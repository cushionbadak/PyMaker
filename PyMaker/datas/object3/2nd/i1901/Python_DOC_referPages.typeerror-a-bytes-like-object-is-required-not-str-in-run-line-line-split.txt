I've very recently migrated to Py 3.5.This code was working properly in Python 2.7:After upgrading to 3.5, I'm getting the:error on the last line (the pattern search code).I've tried using the  function on either side of the statement, also tried:- to no avail.I was able to resolve almost all 2:3 issues quickly, but this little statement is bugging me.
You opened the file in binary mode:This means that all data read from the file is returned as  objects, not . You cannot then use a string in a containment test:You'd have to use a  object to test against  instead:or open the file as a textfile instead by replacing the  mode with .
You can encode your string by using Example:
Like it has been already mentioned, you are reading the file in binary mode and then creating a list of bytes. In your following for loop you are comparing string to bytes and that is where the code is failing.Decoding the bytes while adding to the list should work. The changed code should look as follows:The bytes type was introduced in Python 3 and that is why your code worked in Python 2. In Python 2 there was no data type for bytes:
for this small example:    import socketadding the "b" before 'GET http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n'solved my problem
You have to change from wb to w: to After changing this, the error disappears, but you can't write to the file (in my case). So after all, I don't have an answer?Source: How to remove ^MChanging to 'rb' brings me the other error: io.UnsupportedOperation: write
why not try opening your file as text?Additionally here is a link for python 3.x on the official page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.htmlAnd this is the open function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#openIf you are really trying to handle it as a binary then consider encoding your string.
You opened the file in binary mode:The following code will throw  a TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'.The following code will work - you have to use the decode() function:
