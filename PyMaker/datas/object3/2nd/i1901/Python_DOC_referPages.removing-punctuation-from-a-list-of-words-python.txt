This question already has an answer here:Best way to strip punctuation from a string in Python                    24 answers                So I have a list of words where I want to remove all punctuation. Here is my codeI am getting the following errorTypeError: translate() takes exactly one argument (2 given)I've veen trying a few different ways to do this but with no luck, there's surely an easier way to do this?I'm new to python so excuse me if this is a bad question, any help would be greatly appreciated. 

You could also just do this:Disclaimer: The code below is using Python 2 syntax in an IPython shell - the  function seems to have changed in Python 3 - your above solution was for Python 2.Addressing timing as mentioned by @Chris_Rands in the comment to this answer:This was done with  set to a 5 paragraphs generated here: https://www.lipsum.com/feed/htmlSo, yes, the translate method is by far the fastest. At the same time... depending on how many times you need to do this, you don't really need to worry about this.Use the simplest approach you can think of and then use a profiling tool (CProfiler) to figure out where exactly your bottleneck is if your script isn't fast enough.
