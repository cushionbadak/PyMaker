I am still in the "any technology sufficiently advanced..." phase of learning to program. This code seems clunky, and hard to update if needed. Is there a better way to go about this? It just looks completely bonkers to me, but it works... so yay? It takes a variable from TKinter radial 1-16, and uses it select the grade1 ect variable. The grade1 variable then link to sheet names on gspread. 
Do not keep 16 different variables for ! Use one list:Then all you need to do is:
Instead of defining 16 separate grade1...grade16 variables, you could store them in a list like  and then set subject as 
Or use dictionary:You will get desired grade.You have to have a dictionary with keys of all possible  values, and values of the grades you want for each key, so then you get the  key in the dictionary, then get it's value, by using , now you've got the desired grade.
There are few ways to get around it.The first method is considered better code. However, there is another way of using keyword. It treats the code inside as an expression. Since only the number part of the variable changes. However,  is not the best way I recommend. For more, refer to this page Why is using 'eval' a bad practice?
