So I have been playing around with schedule and finally got it to work. I was too excited to relized that there came ANOTHER problem haha. However the issue is now that it doesn't end whenever the main is finished and I can't really find the solution. I know the issue sits on the row Time.sleep(1) because whenever I keyboardInterrput then there comes a error saying Time.sleep(1) was the "Issue" and I can't really find a soulution to end it. Im using a schedule from a github : Github schedule
You code is encapsulated in  loops with  as the argument. Either you did this by mistake or this is poor structure. This is the problem.If you don't want to remove the  loops then atleast add a  somewhere.If you need help structuring your code, go to Code Review.
You could use the  keyword. The for statement can define your iterations and the halting conditions. Or using the  function to iterate over your numerical sequence. Being used to traditional if-then-else statements, the  statement will break you out of your while loop. It needs to be with your innermost  or  loop.  Your  clause needs to belong to your  loop and not part of the  statement.  And the  statement will move your loop forward.
