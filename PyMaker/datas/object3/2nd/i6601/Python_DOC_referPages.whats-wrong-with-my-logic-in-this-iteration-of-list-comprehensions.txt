I was expecting  would give me a list of jellyx*x, but it returned the following value.What's wrong with the code?
The problem is in the expression:This is equivalent to:Because the  and  operators have the same precedence.Precedence just means which operators get evaluated first in an expression. Operators with higher precedence "bind" before operators with lower precedence, operators with equal precedence get evaluated left-to-right. This is similar to mathematics, so:Note, the arithmetic operators have the precedence that is typical for arithmetic operators from mathematics.And finally, you might not know, but with sequence-types (which includes , , , the  operator causes a "repitition operation", so:So, to get what you want, try:Alternatively, you could use the  method on strings:Or better even, use f-strings in Python 3.6:
You can also do :Will give :Here, the  will give  which you then use in your string.For more explanation on the behaviour of the OP's code (due to  of operators  and ) , have a look at Juanpa's answer.
