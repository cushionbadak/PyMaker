Lets say that my program asks a user to input a number indefinitely and I appended it in a list.what I wanted to do is to randomly pick any of the numbers so my sample output would be:Having said, since the user input would be indefinite there will be chances that it would be an odd number.I am currently using random.sample to choose a number from that list and append it in a list, after that I'll append the sub-groups of list to create a list within a list.Would be a great help if anyone answers, thanks!
You could shuffle your list with :And extract 3 sub-lists with slicing. The first list will have indices 0, 3 and 6 from the shuffled , the second list will have indices 1, 4 and 7 and the third will have indices 2, 6 and 8:As a bonus, it will work with lists of any length:You can be sure that every element will appear exactly once in the nested lists.You could also define more sublists:
If List is going to remain short such that you can read it into the memory, then you can use Now use List Comprehension to subtract the original  with Now use  for  and  and you'd be good to go! :)
