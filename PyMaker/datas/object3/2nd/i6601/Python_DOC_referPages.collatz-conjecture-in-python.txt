I'm relatively new to Python and I decided to try and code a relatively simple collatz conjecture where the user enters a number (integer). The code is just a simple function that calls itself. i is a list that should have every number that the function calculates appended to it. I'm new to executing Python scripts and I have tried using the IDLE shell to run the code. It asks me what number I want but when I enter a number nothing is printed? I'm sure I just need to edit a small bit of this code (or maybe it's all wrong yikes) but does anybody have any idea why my script returns nothing? Sorry about this and thanks.Here's the code:
There are three s before your  and one of them is inside an  statement, which means that at least one of them will be executed, so your  won't even be reached to be executed, you should move right after the function definition to see something:See more about the . A snippet: leaves the current function call with the expression list (or ) as return value.
As others have mentioned, all of the execution paths in your function end in a  statement, so that  call is unreachable. So if you want each value of  or  to be printed you need to move the call to somewhere that it will be reachable. ;)Also, there's a little bit of redundancy in that code. You don't need    in both the  and  branches, you can move them outside the  block.Here's a modified version of your code. I've also changed the  operators to  so that the results of the divisions will be integers.output
