I am trying to patch a function to return a nested dictionary like so:This fails, as when accessing the dictionary, the code just finds MogicMock functions e.g.  or I guess I could mock these  calls, but is there a more elegant solution than pretending to be a dictionary?
Assuming that  and  are methods of the class , this might work for you:Assuming that  and  are attributes of the method , this might work for you:Check out the documentation for  here.Few other pointers:If you have something like this in your class:And now if you want the dictionary returned from  to be patched with some other return value, then this can help you:If you want to mock the value , then try to mock the client method itself
