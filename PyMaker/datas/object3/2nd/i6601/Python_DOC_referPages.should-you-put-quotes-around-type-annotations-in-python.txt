What's the difference between these two functions? I've seen people put quotes around type annotations and other times leave them out but I couldn't find why people choose to use one or the other.Are there advantages or disadvantages to any of these?
Putting quotes around type hints is something that makes sense when making a Forward Reference according to PEP 484. In this case putting quotes around a name is used to subdue a NameError that would occur.In other cases, don't use quotes, it doesn't result in the hint you want: though for now type checkers (mypy, atleast) don't seem to treat these differently, I wouldn't be sure if that would be the case in the future. Best to be clear and not use quotes when you actually don't need them.
