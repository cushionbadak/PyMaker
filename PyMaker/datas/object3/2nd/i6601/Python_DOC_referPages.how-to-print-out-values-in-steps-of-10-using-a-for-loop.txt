this code prints out the values from -30 up to 40, but I need it to print out the values from -30 to 40 in steps of 10. Can someone help me? I wasn't able to find anything when googeling this problem.
The third argument for  is the , so just use:However note that the  is exclusive, so if you wanted to include  it should be:
Following the :The documentation defines  as taking three arguments:range(start, stop[, step])The last argument, , is the interval for each . So, to   in intervals of , we can set the  argument to :which  out the following values for :N.B. that as  stops when it reaches the  argument (exclusive),  is not included.
Since print in python 3+ is a function, you can achieve the same result using:Code:outputBasically print will unpack the range and use separator .
