I have written a small piece of code in python 3 for sending value of a variable which is in hex over UDP but it is resulting in "MemoryError"Here is the codecould someone please help me fixing it.
The socket related code is irrelevant, only this is required to replicate the problem:The reason for the  is that Python being asked to create a  object of size 0xf1a525da11f6. From the documentation:bytes(int) -> bytes object of size given by the parameter initialized  with null bytesYou can use the  module to help here:The format string  specifies a signed 8 byte value () in network byte order () . See the format string documentation for details.
