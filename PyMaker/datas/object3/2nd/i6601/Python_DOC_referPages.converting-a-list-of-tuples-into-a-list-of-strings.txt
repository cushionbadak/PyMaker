So I have a list of tuples, for example  and I want to convert it into a list of strings: . I have tried using a for loop with the join method but cannot get it to work. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks. 
Use a simple list comprehension:
Use  from e.g.output ['GGG', 'AAA', 'BBB']The use of  is only to allow printing the output. It forces the lazy object returned from  to be evaluated immediately. You don't need it if you will later iterate over object.
There are multiple ways you can achieve this. If array is , then:1) Using : well the other ways have been just written by the other two most recent answers :).Also, even though it was not asked, but I got interested in performance, and I wanted to share the results of a rather simple benchmark:Input@Paul Rooney@COLDSPEED@this@mentalita
Above one gives list of strings
you can just use   method tested in  & The itertools.chain method returns  object, you can get  elements using  or  using .
You can use ' or  method can done the job in just one line using list comprehension ::)
