Is there a way to generate the offset rule string accepted by DataFrame.resample (e.g. 'T', '3W', '2D', etc) starting from a TimeDelta or another object representing a time frequency? I know that DataFrame.resample can accept a TimeDelta, but I like to know how to generate the string programmatically without having to invent my own function. OutputActually I would like to obtain an offset rule string: e.g. '3T'
The docs explain that str(t)Returns a string in the form [D day[s], ][H]H:MM:SS[.UUUUUU], where D is negative for negative t.You wanted to know if  offers support for output like '3W' without having a user function (trivially) format its numeric output into such a format. No, it does not offer such support.You may find to_perioddelta() helpful when you write such a function.
In case someone else needs to write their own function like myself, here is the code:
