Natural Text
The following is the code:My question is: how to understand the TextIOWrapper object fin? I mean, is it safe to say it is something with a sequence structure, where each item of the sequence is a line of your file with "\n" added? What else could I say about it? How do you understand it?Any comments are greatly appreciated. 
That expression  splits (streams more accurately) the file by the new line delimiter until it reaches EOF. Think of it a stream that reads until it's a new line, and then returns the characters it just read. 
File-like objects are iterators that produce a line of text on each iteration. Iterators in general just means "things you can loop over exactly once"; files differ from this pattern on insofar as they can (depending on what the represent) be ed, which would reset the iterator to a new position in the file.To be clear, they are not sequences; the term "sequence" has specific meaning, and includes the ability to index it, iterate it multiple times in a row or in parallel, all without manually fixing up state.
