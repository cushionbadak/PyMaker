I have created a random list by below command:Now, what could be the command for counting the number of values that are between 0 and 9, 10 and 19, 20 and 29, and so on.I can print them as below:But, I don't know how to write a command to count the number of the values after printing b.Thanks for your comments.
Just make a dictionary, enumerate and count.
if I understood you correctly, then so:etc
You may use  to achieve this as:Sample Run:When the value of  is:the above program returns  as:
In data analysis and statistics this is called 'binning'. If you poke around on the 'net for terms like 'bin' and 'bins' you'll find a plethora of pages about software and how to do this. But a really good one uses the preeminent product for Python, numpy.In your case you need to set up the end points of the bins which are -0.5, 9.5, 19.5, 29.5, 39.5, 49.5, 59.5, 69.5, 79.5, 89.5, and 99.5. (I've chosen -0.5 for the low end only because it made my calculation easier.) histogram counts how many items fall within each of the ranges given by these numbers, taken in pairs (-0.5 to 9.5, 9.5 to 19.5, etc).And here's the result.
