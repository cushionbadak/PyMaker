I'm looking at this minimal valid(?) program:This program executes and behaves as expected , preserving the stack trace of the inner exception, as documented by . However, when I run  on it, this is what I get:The syntax-error disappears when I remove the second and third expressions to .Is this a bug in pylint, or am I overlooking something?
Your pylint binary testing for Python 3 syntax, your code is valid for Python 2 only. Pylint tests code following the syntax of the Python binary you installed it with (it uses Python's own parser).In Python 3, you'd use:See the  statement documentation for Python 3.While your syntax may be correct for Python 2, you are technically using  wrong. When passing in 3 elements, the first must be a class, not an instance. The second is an instance of that class, the third the traceback:or you can pass in  for an empty argument list passed to the first (the class) to create an instance:Your code still happens to work, but only because Python isn't being too strict and takes that first argument as the instance when it is not a class. If you want to test Python 2 code with pylint, install a copy into your Python 2 binary, and run that version. See Specify which python version pylint should evaluate for
