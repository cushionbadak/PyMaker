I have a couple of questions. The code below doesn't run because I've specified three arguments to the  method and the  function returns a dictionary. Here is the output:What would be the best/standard way to create a dog based on user input as I'm trying to achieve? Is using dictionaries like in the  function a recommended way of storing and returning values from a function? I think it is but want to check.Many thanks.EDIT: I don't think this is a duplicate of Passing a dictionary to a function in python as keyword parameters because I think my question is more beginner centric and specific. Hopefully some other beginner will find this question when wondering how to make an instance from using . 
Yes, you can do this, but you have to use the  operator to convert the  to an argument list. Please see What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for Python parameters? for further info.Also see Unpacking Argument Lists in the official Python tutorial.
As written, the class can't unpack your dictionary. You could replace this lineWithThat said, it's kind of messy. You probably shouldn't even bother with the dictionary in the first place. And you should probably create the dog object within the function.
Your function returns a dicitionary and class should takie argunents. Use **dict or **func()in a new object call
