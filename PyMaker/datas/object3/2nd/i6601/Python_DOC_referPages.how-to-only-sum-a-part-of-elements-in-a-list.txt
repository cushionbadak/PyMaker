I need this function to return the sum of the elements located at the odd indices. And that's what I have right now:
Using the code you've already started, enumerate is probably the function you want which returns the count and the values in the list. Then we filter the odd indices and add them to a variable for the sum, as you had already done:
Since you are doing ,  will check if each element is odd, not if its index is odd.What you can do is this:This goes through all of the indices, and if it's odd, adds the element at that index to the accumulator.That method is fairly easy to understand; however, it goes through an unnecessary number of elements: generates all elements counting up from  up to but not including , counting by . This starts at 1 and takes every 2 elements.This is rather long though, and can be shortened to the following:Using list slicing, where  gives every -th element starting from  up to  (implicity the very end), you can do the following:This sums every second element starting from the first.If your input is not necessarily indexable (that is, it's iterable but cannot use  syntax, such as a set, range, map, etc), you can do:This sums every value where the index is odd by getting the index and value for each enumerated value. The  function is an iterable which returns .
Just you can use a list slice or function
