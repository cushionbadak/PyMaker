I have captured some packages with wireshark and i want to resend them with my own software, written in python. I am using socket programming but I'm new to python so maybe this is a stupid question.My software is doing its 3-way handshake as it should, and sends a packet with my information. But the thing is, it is not the right information it sends. This is what I do:I want the packet to contain the hex value 13EC, but it is sending it as a string right now, like "0x13EC". If I put it like this......it's  just sending zeros. Can somebody please tell me what I am doing wrong?Thanks in advance,BartelBTW, I am using python 3.6.2.
When writing  you're essentially creating a integer with the value of 5100. But the socket can't send integers (to my knowledge).Instead what you want to do is send byte data in the shape of  and .To do this, you can simply do:And that should do it.Or you can use struct to pack the data.
