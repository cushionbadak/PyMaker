Here is my code:I want that  prints  but when I want to instantiate a Perro class show me this error. I want to know what is wrong with my script
By definition (read the docs), an abstract call is a class which CANNOT be instantiated until it has any abstract methods not overridden. So as in the Object-Oriented Programming by design.You have an abstract method  not overridden, as inherited from the parent class. Or, override it with a method , and do something there (maybe even call the parent's method; but not in case it is private with double-underscore, of course).If you want to instantiate , just do not make that method abstract. Make it normal. Because it also has some implementation, which suggests it is a normal base-class'es method, not an abstract method.
