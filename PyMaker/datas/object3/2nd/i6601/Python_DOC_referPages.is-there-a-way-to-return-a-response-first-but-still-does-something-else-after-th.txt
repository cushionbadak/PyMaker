I want to return a response in django view first then does something after the response.Let's say I have something like this as example.....So I am wondering if there is a chance to return the response first?  What's above is an example of what I mean.I am not sure if this can be done in django, if possible, can someone let me know who this can be doneThanks in advance.
Well, that's more of a Python than Django question. As the comments have pointed out, you could implement some sort of asynchronous queue like Celery however this may be a bit of an overkill for your use case.Consider using plain Python threads instead:The idea here is to extract the code which you want to run asynchronously into functions and run them in a thread.
