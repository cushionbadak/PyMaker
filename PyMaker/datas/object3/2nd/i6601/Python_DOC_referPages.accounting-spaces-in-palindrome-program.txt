This is a program that accepts a string of words and checks if the words are palindromes and if it is one, it prints it. However if a string has a space in it, my program won't count it as a palindrome (Example: nurses run). What should I be adding to make the program exclude the space, when it's accounting for palindromes?Palindrome: a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. 'madam' or 'nurses run'
Try stripping out the whitespaces before doing the palindrome check
You can use reversed:
Your code is still incorrect in the elif statement. You've added  when you should actually be returning the response from your recursive call as previously mentioned.
Here's a simpler solution of your problem:or you can just create the word out of sys.argv like this:
