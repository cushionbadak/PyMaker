My machine runs on Windows 10, I have installed recently python 3.6 along with my previous python 2.7, unable to import libraries in python 3.6.
You can reinstall all libraries installed by saving list of them:(please notice  is Python 2.7 here)Next you should install all of them with Python 3:But not all old libraries are compatible with new version of Python!
