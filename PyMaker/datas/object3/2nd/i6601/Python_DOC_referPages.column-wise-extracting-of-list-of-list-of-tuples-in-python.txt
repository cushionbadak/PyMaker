all I have a list of list of tuple hereI wanted get the tuples containing the max values in second element of the tuple, column-wise. I tried accessing columns like this But I get the errorTypeError: list indices must be integers, not tupleThanks in advance, Please let me know if you need any other informationEdit 1:Desired output:
output:Let me know if this works for you I will explain the answer.You can access columns like this..Explanationzip https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zipNow imagine x,y,z being the rows you had in . By zip(rows) it returns 1st elements, 2nd elements, 3rd elements etc... There by returning us columns of the rows we passed.Note: zip acts on multiple arguments passed in so we need to send multiple rows like x,y,z separately, not like [x,y,z] as a list. That is done by *A which separates the rows and passes to zip.Now we got different columnsmaxhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#maxList Comprehensionhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionsFinallyWill give you max for each column!
You can try this:Output:
 is a list is lists of tuples. Basic Python does not recognised multiple-element subscripting, although Numpy and similar modules extend it. Your subscript expression  is therefore interpreted as a tuple whose first element is a lice and whose second element is an integer, which (as the message explains) is not acceptable as a list index.Unfortunately, "the tuples containing the max values in second element of the tuple, column-wise" isn't a terribly good description of the actual desired result.I presume the answer you would like is .One relatively simple way to achieve this is to sort each of the sub-lists separately, taking the last element of each. this could be spelled asThe  argument to the  function ensures that each list is sorted on its second element, the  subscript takes the last (and therefore highest) element of the sorted list, and the  ensure that each element of the output corresponds to an element (i.e., a list of three tuples) of the input.
