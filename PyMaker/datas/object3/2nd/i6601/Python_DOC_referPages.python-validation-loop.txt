Natural Text
I need to validate the user's name so it only contains letters. For this i am using a while true statement. I also want the username to be written to a text file once it is valid how would i change my code to do this. How would i change my code so if the user enters an invalid name they have to try again, and if it is valid it is written to a text file.

Hope this helps
My solution upon many others:
all() statement validates every char in the string; the map runs the lambda function for every char in the input. To create an iterator out of a string, you can use iter(name)
From the documention:str.isalpha()Return true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, false otherwise. Alphabetic  characters are those characters defined in the Unicode character  database as “Letter”, i.e., those with general category property being  one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”. Note that this is different  from the “Alphabetic” property defined in the Unicode Standard.Something along the following lines should do the trick:
