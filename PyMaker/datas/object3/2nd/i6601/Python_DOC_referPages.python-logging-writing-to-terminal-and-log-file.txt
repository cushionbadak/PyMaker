I have two files:  and . In , I have logger setup, and a set of functions (made up one below):I'm trying to call  from , but when I do, the  message shows up in both the terminal window AND . Any ideas why this might be happening? If it helps, I also import other modules into , if those modules import logging as well, could that cause issues?
It looks like you're initializing the logger with  file inside the  method of  class. This means that any code that creates an object of  will initialize the logger. Somewhere in your code, in one the files, you are creating that object and hence the logger is initialized and writes to the file. Note that you do not need to call  yourself as it is called on object creation. ie. after this calllog files will be written.You're asking why both stderr and file is used after your new file handler is attached. This is because of the propagate attribute. By default propagate is True and this means your log will bubble up the hierarchy of loggers and each one will continue handling it. Since default root logger is at the top of the hierarchy, it will be handling your log too. Set  to False fix this:You might want to read up a bit on logging. Also, if you want to keep your sanity regarding logging, check how you can use dict to configure logging.
