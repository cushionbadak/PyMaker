I have a program that returns a set of ages inside of an array and I want to count them and put them inside of a dictionary, I have tried the following but no results. Please help!let's say I have an array as follows:this makes perfect sense as if we look at the set(ages) it equals = {10,11,12,15,20}so the returning count actually equals to the count of each value in agesWhen I try to put in a variable though, it only appends the first number or it says it is not iterable!How can I store it into a list, even better how can I make dictionary containing the set(ages) and the count for each of the set(ages)Thank you
There are a lot of different ways to achieve this.  The first, and likely easiest, is to import the  class from .The other way is to do it in a loop:And finally, dict comprehension.  It has really no advantage over the loop other than the fact that it's a single line.  You still end up iterating over each variable in the list:Since you asked more about the ternary operator, that loop is equivalent to saying:The ternary operator allows us to complete this pattern in a single line.  Lots of languages have it:C/C++/C#JavaScript
try this!
If you need to store counts, better you use Python dicts.
