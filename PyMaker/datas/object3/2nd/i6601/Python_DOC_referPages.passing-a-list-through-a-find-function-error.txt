I defined a function that allows me to find a specific character in a parameter and returns all subsequent characters. Example:This seems to execute without issue.  However, I am having a problem with my second function, which allows me to pass a list through the first function, compare, and return True or FalseThen, I define my list and variable1 to for function2 and print:I cannot seem to figure out what I've been doing wrong.  Something seems to be off wither how I am passing through the list, resulting in errors regarding split or find (I've tried both), and/or my comparison of Variable1 and parameter1.  I'm sure there's a small issue here that I keep getting tripped up on, but for the life of me I cannot figure it out.
