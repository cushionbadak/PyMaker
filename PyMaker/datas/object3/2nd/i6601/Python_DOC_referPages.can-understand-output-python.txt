this is my first post so I apologize for the formatting. I got that piece of code I wrote for college and it's for calculating hoy many days, hours and minutes have I lived.So when I try to print this:I get that I've lived 12699 days, 304776 hours and 18286560 minutes. The problem is that if I just look at the years between 2017 and 1982, I've lives at least 35 years, and that * 365 is 12775, that without counting extra months and days I've lived. The strange thing is that if I try to make prints inside my code likeI get 35 and 12775Help please, I'm stuck
Assuming your inputs are  values trying to represent the date in DDMMYYYY form, take a look at your  calculation:For your inputs,  (ISO form 2017-07-25) for , and  (ISO form 1982-10-11) for birth date , you're computing:The problem is, by performing the computation on years first, you're rounding up on years lived, and correcting it by living the appropriate number of negative months (similar problems occur for days). So your end result is actually correct(ish); you haven't actually finished 35 years, you've lived a little under three months less than 35 years, and therefore the day count should be lower (by somewhere around 60-90 days, and lo and behold, you were off by 76, ignoring leap year issues).That said, please use the  module. It will do this more correctly (no negative deltas, handles leap days, etc.) and much more simply.For example, even without changing your inputs and outputs, you could instead do:
