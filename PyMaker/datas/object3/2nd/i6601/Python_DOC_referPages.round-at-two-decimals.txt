I would like to standard deviation to be round at 2 decimals, but it didn't work so far. How could I fix it? How to make that works with ?
Python has a builtin function called ; but to get it how you want, you'll want to cast the  to a float. Something like  should get you what you want.
Numpy is properly rounding the numbers in the cases you show, but you are seeing the results of floating point precision when the numbers are displayed on screen.  If this loss of precision will truly cause a problem for you then you should consider using the  package.
