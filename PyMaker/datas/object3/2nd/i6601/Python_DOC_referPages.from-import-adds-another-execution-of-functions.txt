You need to add the following at the button of your module to eliminate running your module as a scriptThis will tell Python what code to run when you are executing your module as a script. Otherwise, it will just load the module namespacePython's main docs'main' is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A moduleâ€™s name is set equal to 'main' when read from standard input, a script, or from an interactive prompt.A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by checking its own name, which allows a common idiom for conditionally executing code in a module when it is run as a script or with python -m but not when it is imported.
It was an issue related to python's logging function. logger.getLogger(name)
