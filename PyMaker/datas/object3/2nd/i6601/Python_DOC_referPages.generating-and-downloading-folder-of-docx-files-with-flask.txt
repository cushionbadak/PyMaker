I'm currently learning how to use Flask, and my goal is to let the user provide certain inputs, click Generate, and then Download a .zip file of .docx files generated by a different python script.Currently, my .docx generation python script saves the folder locally, which I don't think is ideal. It is saved as a folder of .docx files, so what is the best way to have those files able to be downloaded by a user who inputted variables that generated those files?
zipfile module and flask.send_from_directory are what you need
