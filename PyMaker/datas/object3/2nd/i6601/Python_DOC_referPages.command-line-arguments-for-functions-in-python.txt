I have a python file which holds multiple functions. Each function will have its own parameters.The first argument is the function to run. But I am unable to find how can i define arguments for my functions so that it will appear in  help and also can validate.Here the first postional argument will be the name of the command, in this case . What i want is the user can pass additional arguments which will be different on different functions.example:  so this  will come as a argument to  function and can be viewed in the  alsoThanks 
Try OptionParser:Add as many options as you want. You can then call it like thisor use help to see your options
