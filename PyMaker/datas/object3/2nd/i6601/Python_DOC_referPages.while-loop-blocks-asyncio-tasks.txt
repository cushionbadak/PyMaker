I've been using asyncio for a bit but I'm still fairly unfamiliar with it. My current issue is that while trying to wait for a response from a function with asyncio, the waiting (while loop) blocks the function from happening. Here is the code that sums up the problem:wait_for_next is supposed to wait for the next response, but the while loop blocks the run() function. How could I stop this happening? Should I be using loop.run_in_executor, and if so, how?(There were a couple of other examples of this I could find, but they were very specific and I didn't understand if our problems/solutions would be the same.)
As already noted, loop stuck because  blocks execution flow until this coroutine wouldn't be finished.If you want some of your coroutines to be started without blocking execution flow you can start it as asyncio.Task (more about tasks) using  function:Output:
