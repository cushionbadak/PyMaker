I want to add a month datetime to my current datetime, if I do this, I only can convert the datetime to timestamp, then add the timestamp space:If is the February, I will add .If is a solar month of 31 days I will add .If is a solar month of 30 days I will add .  Then convert to datetime again.So, there is a lot of things to do, python is comfortable for developer, if there is a simpler and more convenient way to do that?
