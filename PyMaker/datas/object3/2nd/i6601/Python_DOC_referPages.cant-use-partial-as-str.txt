This question already has an answer here:functools.partial on class method                    1 answer                I ran into this problem while trying to write a pretty print procedure for a program in which I use several named tuples containing floating point pairs.I want to format the floating point numbers when printed because the result of:Is too long:So I created a function to print the named tuples:The name and labels should be fixed for every type and only the obj argument varies so I thought I could use functools partial.But this throws a Surprisingly if I use lambda to create the functions it works.Prints what I wanted:I'm trying to understand why the partial version doesn't work.
 returns a non-descriptor callable, roughly equivalent to an unbound method. This means that it is not being passed a  parameter, which is consistent with the error you are seeing.Since a lambda behaves just like a regular function  defined with , it is in fact a descriptor. The  method of the lambda returns a bound version that passes in the instance as .To get a partial function that behaves more like a method, use  instead. You will have to move  to the beginning of your argument list so it can receive  when the method is bound.Here is your example:
Functions get their implicit  argument by being descriptors: the lookup  constructs and returns a method object that remembers  so as to supply it to .   does not return a descriptor, so it doesn't get that special treatment.  (It's actually a class, so it "returns" an instance of itself.)
