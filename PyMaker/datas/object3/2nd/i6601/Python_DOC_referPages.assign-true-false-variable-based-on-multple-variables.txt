Here is my assignment:Clunker Motors Inc. is recalling all vehicles from model years 1995-1998 and 2004-2006.Given a variable modelYear write a statement that assigns True to recalled if the value of modelYear falls within the two recall ranges and assigns False otherwise.Do not use an if statement in this exercise!so if I'm reading this correctly:I need to have a variable "recalled" that will be assigned true or false based on the condition of the variable modelYear being between 1995 and 1998 OR being between 2004 and 2006. In doing some searching I found this segment of code someone else used for this challenge:Now MyProgrammingLab is not accepting this as a valid answer to the situation. It say SyntaxError line 1. Am I just overlooking an open parenthesis or missing a capitalization or something? Or am I completely wrong in using this approach?
You are quite close, but you are using the wrong tools.  I use PyCharm, and run the code locally.  There are other IDEs which are excellent, but this is the one I use.  When I typed in this:PyCharm showed me:Note the red underline for the syntax error, and when the cursor is hovered, it says 'Unresolved reference' because it does not know what  is.  It should be .Better Tools == Better Code.Cheers and good luck.
Remember PEP8 rules which says,special reserved keywords are in lowercase,so its not And,Or but and,or click on pythonrulesPep8 Rules
Run your code locally - figure out your SyntaxError. Read the examples more carefully. And / Or are not capitalized. Also, Python has a range function. You could use that instead You use end year +1 because ranges are non-inclusive
