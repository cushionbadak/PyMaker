A file handle in my syntax references a folder which includes a version number in YYYYDDMM format. For example, the "v20170215" referenced below:The version part of the file handle is routinely updated based on new data that needs to be processed. The file handle always ends with a "v" followed by a YYYYMMDD date.How can I automatically extract the last "YYYYMMDD" string from the file handle (e.g., "20170215") and create a date variable out of it? If the date were a string variable in the data, I could use something like below:But given it's a line of syntax I need to parse, I suspect I should look to Python, but I'm stumped how to tackle this.
I'll assume you can't get the updated reference as data from the same source that creates the updated syntax (might have been an easier solution).Once the handle is defined, you can extract that definition into data this way:This will open a dataset called  in which variable  will contain the full path for your file as defined in the handle. From that you have to extract only the string you need - see if this can work for you:Now you have the string you needed, you can continue and turn it into a date and match it into your data.
Assuming that the syntax comes from a file that you can open and process with Python, you can split the line on whitespace, grab the date part of the last field using slicing, then feed that into  to parse the string into a  object.
