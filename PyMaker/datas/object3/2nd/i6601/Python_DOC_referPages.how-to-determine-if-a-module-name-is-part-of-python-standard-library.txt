Natural Text
I have a module name as a string (e.g. 'logging') that was given by querying the module attribute of an object.How can I differentiate between modules that are part of my project and modules that are part of python standard library?I know that I can check if this module was installed by pip using pip.get_installed_distributions(), but these are not related to the standard libraryNote: I'm working on python 2.7 so solutions that are valid only in python 3.x are less relevant.Unlike the answer here, I was looking for a solution that can be run in O(1) and will not require holding an array of results nor having to scan the directory for every query.Thanks.
Quick 'n dirty solution, using the standard module imp:
EDIT:I used the solution which is here.Output:This works in both Python 2 and Python 3.BEFORE EDIT:I guess, you can use Python Docs. Here are standard library parts of Python 2 Docs and Python 3 Docs. Also, you can select the exact version of Python.
