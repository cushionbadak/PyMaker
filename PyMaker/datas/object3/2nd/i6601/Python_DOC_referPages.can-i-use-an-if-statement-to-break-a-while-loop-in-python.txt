Basically what I want is to have the program run and start back at the beginning until a command is typed. I have the repeat part working, but I can't get the loop to break when I want it to. I was trying to use an if statement to take the input and use it to break the loop. I've seen it done in tutorials, but I can't get it to work for me. I understand the break statement is to exit a loop, I'm wondering if it is possible to use the break statement in an if statement like so:With this for me it just prints,:if I type it, not breaking the loop. If it's not possible, does anybody have another way that I could get the same result, having the loop end when I type something like "quit"? Any help is appreciated.
You need to set  with a single equals sign (this may have been a typo in your post).You also need to put  in quotes to make it a string. As you have it, you're comparing the user's input with the builtin  function, so they'll never be equal.
