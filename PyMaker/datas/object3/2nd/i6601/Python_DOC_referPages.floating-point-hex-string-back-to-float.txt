I want to change the float to hex and hex to float.So I want to get equal of the first float and end of the float.This is what I tried, on Python 2.7;  = first float,  = hex string,  = new float value from the hex string.How can I change the  hex string to a float again?I've tried  but none of those work.I can also use Python 3.5 if that helps.
Use the  classmethod:This is the direct inverse of the  instance method.
