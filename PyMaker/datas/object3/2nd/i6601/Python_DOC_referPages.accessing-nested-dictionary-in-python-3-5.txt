I'm importing a nested dictionary from an external file and trying to access values in the deepest level; however, when I try to use  loops I get the following error:The dictionary I'm importing (from a file ) looks like this:etc. etc.Here are the snippets of code I'm working with:I'm fairly certain I've done something like this on a number of other dictionaries before (and had no problems), and I'm wondering if there's something obvious I'm missing at this point.Oddly, if I , my return is  (the key), not its value (a dictionary); however, if I  the return is the entire nested dictionary value as it should be. If I instead tryI get all of the country names, but, just like with the  statement, I only get the keys and not their nested dictionary values. My end goal is to simply return the value of the  keys within each country's dictionary. So, I'd expect to seefor the first country, for example. Strangest of all, if I doas a simple test, I get exactly what I'm looking for. Any suggestions on where I'm going wrong in my  loop?
You are iterating over the dictionary itself, which yields the keys for that dictionary. In your  dictionary, those keys are strings (such as  and ).You wanted the values instead, it is the values that are dictionaries too. Loop over :Note that the fact that you imported the datastructure from another module has no bearing on all of this.
