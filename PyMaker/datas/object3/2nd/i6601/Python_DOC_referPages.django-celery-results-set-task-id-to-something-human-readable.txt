After many days I have a working celery and celery beat task list, and the results are stored using django_celery_results. However when I look at the table record, it hasn't got any useful information in there.is it possible to set the task id to something human readable?one example would be using the demo task, it returns the no, but an unreadable task idtasks.pyscheduler in app.settings
The easy answer is No. The  attribute is generated automatically. If you follow the code backwards the core function that generates ID's is in , which interestingly is just a thin wrapper around the builtin .However, if you look at the function signature:..it appears like it would be possible to supply your own function that generates the ID, and as long as they're unique they should work. Fundamentally you'd have to patch: , , and .I don't think that you'd be able to apply worthwhile names since this function is called with no parameters to simply return something unique.BUTIf you look at  and  there's an undocumented parameter !This would allow you to manually specify the  before the Task is called/created, and as long as they're globally unique you'll still get all of the reporting and metrics. Unfortunately I don't see any easy way to change the  from a Result, to make it more useful after the fact...kinda making your UI's textbox a little silly.If your project is set up for it, you can use Task Inheritance and modify task behavior that way. In theory you should be able to overwrite  and  to inject a task's ID.Should make your Task ID look like: 
Implement a custom result backend that overwrites  to decide what is saved as result to the database.Depending on which backend you're using find the related class in .This example extends the result for an amqp backend.When initializing  pass your result backend class.
Try:This may help to find the task status in the UI, but Celery always needs a unique id for each task execution.
