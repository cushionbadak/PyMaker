I need to take all the values in a list, and replace them with zeroes if they're a string or their actual number if they're an int. the w.replace is how I'll replace the string, but I don't know what to replace 0 with.I want to replace "a" with zero and the entirety of "zebra" with zero inside the list_of_strings.The end output should be [0, 2, 7, 0]
