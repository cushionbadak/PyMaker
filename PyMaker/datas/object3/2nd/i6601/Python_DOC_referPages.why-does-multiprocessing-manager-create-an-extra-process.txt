I use  to create a worker process but I see there are two worker processes created. The worker processA runs at the same time with the main process. The worker processB only runs for 10 seconds, and then it will terminate and start over again.Based on my observation, the worker processA is created after the call of , and this is NOT expected at all. The worker processB is created when  is called, and this is expected.Since the call to  function is expensive in real code, I would like to eliminate the worker processA completely. Is that possible? Ideally, I only expect to see two processes (i.e. main and worker processB).
 works by creating a "server" process, which is responsible for housing all your shared data. Then, your main process and worker processes communicate to the managed objects in the server process via proxies. As stated in the docs (emphasis mine):Managers provide a way to create data which can be shared between  different processes, including sharing over a network between  processes running on different machines. A manager object controls a  server process which manages shared objects. Other processes can  access the shared objects by using proxies.There's no way to use a  without spawning the server process; the server process is a core part of the 's functionality.
