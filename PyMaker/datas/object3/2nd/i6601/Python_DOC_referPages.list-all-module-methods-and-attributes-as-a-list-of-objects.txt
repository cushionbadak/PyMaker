I was trying to dive in python and evaluating some of the builtin functions.The dir function returns a string list containing the names of all attributes of the given module.Because of that if I run the following code segment, I get an empty list:Is There other functions or other ways, that I can combine with  for getting a list of Objects instead of row strings?my goal is to do something like:and not something like the example in dive in python book
That's because  returns a list of strings:String values are not callable; these are not the actual attribute values, they are the names.If you wanted to to test those names as attributes on the  module, you'd have to use , or use the  function to get the  namespace as a dictionary:The order differs here because dictionaries are unordered and  always sorts the return value. For modules,  simply returns .If you wanted the callable objects themselves and not the names, just filter the values of the  dictionary:
 checks is  is an object that has a  method. In your case, it doesn't, that's why the comprehension is returning an empty list
