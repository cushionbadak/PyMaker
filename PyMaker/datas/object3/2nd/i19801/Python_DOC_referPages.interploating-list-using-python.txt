I have set list of x and y, for exampleand I need to find the y values for a set of u defined asI am using this interpolation module. It is similar to the numpy interpolateCurrently, I follow:Is there a way to circumvent the for loop, because It increases my computational time.I could rather spare my memory instead of time. My list size are very huge!I hope that inbuilt map function could be used, but not aware of how to use it.
 loops internally too - it just does it C-side where it is faster. However, you are already using a list comprehension, which also offloads to C and will probably be faster than .That said, there is an opportunity to gain speed and readability here by changing your loop:In Python, we loop over iterators, not indices. By indirectly looping as you were, you will slow your looping down significantly. It also makes it far less readable.As to using , it could be done using  to make a function that calls  with  and  prefilled:However, as I said before, this will likely be slower, and is far less readable.(I use the term C-side in this answer presuming you are using CPython, but in any other implementation, it will also be implemented more efficiently, using whatever lower-level options are available).
