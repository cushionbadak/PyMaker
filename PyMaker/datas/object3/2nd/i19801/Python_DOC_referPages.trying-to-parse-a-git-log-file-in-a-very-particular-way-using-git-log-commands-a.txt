Natural Text
I want to display only the diff between commits that have a tag added to them. Or the closest to this. In other words something like this:And so on. I have tried but cannot get this specific format maybe someone can help me out there. Then once I have a text file with this format or as close as possible I do the following:After doing this I do not know how TO READ EACH OF THE LINES IN EACH OF THE STRINGS in the array tag_separation?Once I can do this I can check if line in the string starts with a certain character (@, +, - or tag) and store different lines in data structures to manipulate later.Thanks in advance for the help!
You might want to use the library, which will give you an higher-level access to your  repository.And even if you decide not to use it, you can probably have a look at how it's done there!
Git wonâ€™t be able to give you that format in a single command, so you need to create it yourself a bit. For that, here are some hints:You can get a list of tags using You can get the commit SHA1 for a reference (i.e. tag) using You can get the diff between two commits using , for example That way you also end up with already separated diffs for each tag, so you do not need to store it in a file first and split it again, you can just start with it.After doing this I do not know how to read each of the lines in each of the stringsYou can iterate through the lines of a string by splitting it first, using .
