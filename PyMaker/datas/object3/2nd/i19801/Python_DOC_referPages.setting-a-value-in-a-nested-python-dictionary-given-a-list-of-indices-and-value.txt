Sorry if this question has been answered before - I've been searching for solutions but I maybe am not using the correct search terms.Anyway, what I'm trying to do is to programmatically set a value in a dictionary, potentially nested, given a list of indices and a value.So for example, let's say my list of indices is:and the value isI want as a result a dictionary object like:Basically, the list represents a 'path' into a nested dictionary. I think I can construct the dictionary itself, but where I'm stumbling is how to set the value. Obviously if I was just writing code for this manually it would be:But how do I index into the dictionary and set the value like that programmatically if I just have a list of the indices and the value?Hope this makes sense and isn't too dumb a question... :) Thanks for any help.
Something like this could help:And you can use it like this:
First off, you probably want to look at setdefaultAs a function I'd write it as This would be used as:This could be cleaned up with error handling and such, also using  rather than a single key-list argument might be nice; but the idea is thatyou can iterate over the keys, pulling up the appropriate dictionary at each level.
Here's another option:I originally got this from here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10218517/1530754.Quite clever and elegant if you ask me.
Here is my simple solution: just writeYou can even do:Now the backstage:
I took the freedom to extend the code from the answer of Bakuriu. Therefore upvotes on this are optional, as his code is in and of itself a witty solution, which I wouldn't have thought of. When setting  to True, you're making sure to only set already existing values:
Use these pair of methods
