spython script to list all of the files and directories that have been created
Without giving you the entire answer, here are the parts you need:walk:  iterates over all of the files and directories in  and any of its subdirectories. You can wrap a  loop around that. Look at the examples to get the  and other details right.stat:  returns a  object with information about the file at . Depending on your platform, either  or  may be the creation time. (On some platforms, there is no way to get it.) The format is seconds since the epoch.The time module: You've already been told about this. Get the current time at startup, using your favorite seconds-since-the-epoch function. Any file where  is new. (But make sure you get the timezone stuff rightâ€”use either GMT or local time for both file times and current times.)
