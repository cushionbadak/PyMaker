I am new to python. I am trying to make a small elavator program.The code: I get this error: AttributeError: type object 'int' has no attribute 'getLevel'Aside from changing the str to int, am I using any bad technique? I really want to improve my programming thinking and code writing. Thank you :)
 is a type, so to instantiate it, you need to do , not .Check the docs for examples and more.Also note that  is an odd name for the variable, as it implies it is a function that gives the level. A better name would be just .It's also worth noting that  evaluates the input as Python code (In Python 2.x, in 3.x it acts as  does in older versions), so  will already be a number, although I would recommend using  instead, and keeping your conversion from a string to an integer, as it won't allow arbitrary execution of code, which is much better.
Here is the sample code modified:
