Given that  objects were made subscriptable, why aren't  objects subscriptable?Note that range objects and itertools.repeat objects are part of Python 3.I would prefer:
 just yields the same object over and over again.  I'm not really sure what subscripting it would actually do for you ... You would be just as well to call .  Perhaps you are thinking about  (as I did when I originally read your question)?Part the the wonder of  is that it attempts to operate as lazily as it possibly can.  In light of this, what do you expect to happen if you pass a generator expression to ?   has NO WAY to know the length of the object you passed in short of casting the whole thing to a tuple and inquiring.  Doing that would probably break the API in a bunch of other places (now you consume your iterable when you subscript your repeat object) or it would take a whole lot more intermediate storage via an unnecessary  -- which is what  tries to avoid.  As it is currently implemented,  on a huge generator expression that you can't hope to hold in memory works (as long as you don't actually iterate over all the elements), but that wouldn't be the case if you tried to subscript it at a large index.Finally, as the name implies,  is a library for creating  objects.  As such, there is no reason to expect that the objects are subscriptable.  (It's not called  after all :).As a side note, you might be able to do what you want with .
itertool.repeat() method returns an iterator, not a list, as is the case with  function. So, you can't subscript on it.Here's what documentation says: -Make an iterator that returns object over and over again. Runs  indefinitely unless the times argument is specified.From documentation of range: -If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in  function range() comes in handy. It generates lists containing  arithmetic progressionsIn Python 3, difference is that,  creates a  object. Which  function in Python 2 did.
