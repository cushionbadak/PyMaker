I am trying to make a program which grabs a list of numbers from a file (which could change in lines and size), and then print out the total of all the numbers and the average. I had no problems doing this when I had a set number of linereads, but am confused on the 'proper' way when the lineread changes every run.This is my work-in-progress code. I read around a bit and found the correct (?) way of looping through the file to find the length, but not sure how to implement it since it throws some type of IO error currently. Thanks for the help!
I'm not sure what you want to do... but you should be able to get the answer in one pass.You can use  to number an iterable object, in this case a file, if you need to know the item/line number count.Assuming a single int() per line:if this is CSV data you should look into using the  module, it will split the line into rows/columns for you.
A simple solution, doing what you want...
This assumes your file only has numbers on each line and not characters, otherwise you'll get a .
There are some good answers regarding how to do what you want. As for the IO error, the input() built-in attempts to evaluate the user's input which is both dangerous and not what you want.Try using the raw_input() built-in. That returns the user's input as a string. For fun, try running your script and giving it  as the filename and see what happens.
