I am quite new to python and regex (regex newbie here), and I have the following simple string:I would like to extract only the last digits in the above string i.e 767980716 and I was wondering how I could achieve this using python regex.I wanted to do something similar along the lines of:indicating that I want to find the stuff in between (.*?) which starts with a "-" and ends at the end of string - but this returns nothing..I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction..Thanks.
You can use  to find only the characters:Alternatively,  works just as well:Explanation of all regexp components: is a non-greedy match and consumes only as much as possible (a greedy match would consume everything except for the last digit). and  are two different ways of capturing digits. Note that the latter also matches digits in other writing schemes, like рнк or р╡и.Parentheses () make the content of the expression a group, which can be retrieved with  (or 2 for the second group, 0 for the whole match). means multiple entries (at least one number at the end). matches only the end of the input.
Nice and simple with :Regex Explanation:Or more simply just match the digits followed at the end of the string  
Your  should be .  is used to match digit (one or more) is used to match at the end of string.So, your code should be: -And you don't need to use  function here, as  is already a string.
Use the below regex depicts the end of string.. is a digit matches the preceding character 1 to many times
Save the regular expressions for something that requires more heavy lifting.
Try using  instead. That matches one or more numeric characters followed by the end of the string.
