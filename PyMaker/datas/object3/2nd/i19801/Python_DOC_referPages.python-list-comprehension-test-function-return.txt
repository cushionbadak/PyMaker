Is there a way to test the return of a function in a list (or dict) comprehension? I'd like to avoid writing that:and use a list comprehension instead. Obviously, I don't want to write:so?
How aboutIf you don't want to keep the intermediate list, replace  with . And with , the whole thing could be turned into a generator.
Just make a generator to compute the values and build the filtered list from the generator afterwards.Example: For reference:https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generatorhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/Generatorshttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/
