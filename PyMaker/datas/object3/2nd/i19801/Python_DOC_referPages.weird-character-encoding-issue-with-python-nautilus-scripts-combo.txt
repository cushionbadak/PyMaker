Does anyone recognise this strange encoding and how I can handle it properly?  The problem is, for example, I have a folder such as on my disk, but when I get it using , i.e. the currently selected folder in nautilus, it appears in python as and then other actions such as renaming or copying the file don't work because it doesn't find the file on disk.
