When an exception is raised inside a thread without catching it anywhere else, will it then kill the whole application/interpreter/process? Or will it only kill the thread?
Let's try it:The code above yields the following results:So, the answer to your question is that a raised Exception crashes only the thread it is in, not the whole program.
From the threading documentation:Once the thread’s activity is started, the thread is considered  ‘alive’. It stops being alive when its run() method terminates –  either normally, or by raising an unhandled exception. The is_alive()  method tests whether the thread is alive.And also:join(timeout=None)Wait until the thread terminates. This blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is called terminates – either  normally or through an unhandled exception –, or until the optional  timeout occurs.In other words, the uncaught exception is a way to end a thread, and will be detected in the parent's  call on said thread.
