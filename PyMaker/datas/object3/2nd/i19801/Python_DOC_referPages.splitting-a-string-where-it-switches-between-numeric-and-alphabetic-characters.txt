I am parsing some data where the standard format is something like . Sometimes, data is input correctly and we might end up with  instead of .  In this scenario, I want to parse out the number of pizzas.The na√Øve way of doing this would be to check character by character, building up a string until we reach a non-digit and then casting that string as an integer.This is pretty clunky, though.  Is there an easier way to split a string where it switches from numeric digits to alphabetic characters?
You ask for a way to split a string on digits, but then in your example, what you actually want is just the first numbers, this done easily with :This makes a lot of sense - what we are doing is taking the character from the string while they are digits. This has the advantage of stopping processing as soon as we get to the first non-digit character.If you need the later data too, then what you are looking for is  mixed in with a simple list comprehension:If you then want to make one giant number:
To split the string at digits you can use  with the regular expression :To find the first number use :If you know the number must be at the start of the string then you can use  instead of . If you want to find all the numbers and discard the rest you can use .
How about a regex ?
Answer added as possible way to solve How to split a string into a list by digits? which was  to this question.You can do the splitting yourself:use a temporary list to accumulate characters that are not digitsif you find a digit, add the temporary list (-ed) to the result list (only if not empty) and do not forget to clear the temporary listrepeat until all characters are processed and if the temp-lists still has content, add it Output:References:What exactly does the .join() method do?
