Okay so basically, I need a bit of help with this very easy program I've threw together:Don't worry about the 'graphics' module. It's part of John Zelle's Python book.The point of this is I need to loop my range for 5 instead of 4, however, because 'options' is in [i], this particular program above will pull:However, if I change the 4 to a 5, it will look for a 4th item in the list however it doesn't exist, so it will spit out an "IndexError: list index out of range"What I want to achieve is, when the program reaches the end of the list, to loop back to the first (0) item in the list.For example,Would pull out:I have looked through this site and found some tools which haven't lead to any success, this includes the 'enumerate' function which I don't think will help.If someone can shed some light on how to do this, it will be very welcome!Hope I can do this without a nested loop aswell if this is at all possible.Thanks you in advance for your help.
You can achieve this in one of two ways:1. 2. modulusEDIT:From the conversation in the comments:If you want to print the contents of the list 4 times here are a couple of ways to accomplish this:OROR
Something like this?
You could use the modulo (%) operator:yields
Firstly loop over the values, not indices. Python is designed to avoid looping with indices, and doing so is awkward, inefficient and ugly:is far better than:To get your looping behaviour, look at itertools.cycle():Where  is the number of items you want. Here we use  and  to stop repeating after the number of items is reached (throwing the values from range away).
