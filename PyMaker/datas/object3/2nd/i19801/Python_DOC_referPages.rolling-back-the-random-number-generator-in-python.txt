Is it possible to 'rollback' the random number generator by a specified number of steps to a earlier state to get repeated random numbers?I want to be able to do something like this:My only current idea to accomplish this is to store all generated random numbers into a list to go back to. However, I would personally prefer a method that does not involve doing so because I plan on generating a pretty large amount of random numbers while this function won't be used that often.
You want to take a look at  and . Combine this with keeping track of the number of items generated and it's pretty simple to do what you want.Note that you would have to be careful about other code using  if you relied on this, so I would suggest making a  instance to use to avoid this.The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a  hidden instance of the random.Random class. You can instantiate your  own instances of Random to get generators that donâ€™t share state.(from the docs)Example implementation:Which can be used like so:
