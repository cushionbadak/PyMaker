I'm getting an error when trying to append values to a list inside of a list. What am I doing wrong?I'm getting this error:
You shouldn't index into an empty list. You should call  on the list itself.Change this:To this:Result:See it working online: ideone
Right, . As such, accessing  will fail as the first sublist has no elements.Btw. you can get the wanted list a lot easier using some itertools and recipes.This is basically an x-take of an y-grouper of an indefinite count starting at 0.
