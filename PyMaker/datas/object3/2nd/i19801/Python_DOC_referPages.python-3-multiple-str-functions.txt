As far as I know, Python doesn't support function overloading, but in Python documentationlink to py3k docseems that there are 2 different str methods,  and How are defined these functions? When is the first invoked and when the second? Can I create my own  and  functions (makes sense)? UPDATEOutput for  is  butoutput for  is 
No, python doesn't support overloading because it doesn't need to. Python documentation often shows different ways of calling a method to illustrate different uses, but there is only one  callable (a type in this case).In this case,  accepts multiple keyword arguments, which have default values if not specified. The  type then uses the those extra keyword arguments, if specified, to interpret a  byte string argument. If no keyword arguments were passed in,  behaves differently.In other words,  adjusts it's behaviour based on wether or not the keyword arguments have been supplied. If that is the case and the first argument is a bytestring or bytearray,  it'll decode that argument to unicode text, using the extra keyword arguments to control the decoding process.You can define your own function that'll behave the same way as regards to the keyword arguments, checking the type of the first argument:
No, there's only one .It is shown twice for the sake of clarity (that is, to demonstrate different use cases).You can achieve similar effects in your code by using default arguments, positional argument and keyword arguments. See Python normal arguments vs. keyword arguments
