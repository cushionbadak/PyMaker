I'm using Python's logging module to log some debug strings to a file which works pretty well. Now in addition, I'd like to use this module to also print the strings out to stdout. How do I do this? In order to log my strings to a file I use following code:and then call a logger function likeThank you for some help here!
Just get a handle to the root logger and add the StreamHandler. The StreamHandler writes to stderr. Not sure if you really need stdout over stderr, but this is what I use when I setup the Python logger and I also add the FileHandler as well. Then all my logs go to both places (which is what it sounds like you want).You could also add a Formatter to it so all your log lines have a common header.ie:Prints to the format of:
 can take a keyword argument  since Python 3.3, which simplifies logging setup a lot, especially when setting up multiple handlers with the same formatter: – If specified, this should be an iterable of already created handlers to add to the root logger. Any handlers which don’t already have a formatter set will be assigned the default formatter created in this function.The fairly long and verbose example code from the accepted answer therefore becomes just this:(Or with  +  per original question's requirements.)To get the logger, useLater in your script, use  to output useful logging messages.
Adding a StreamHandler without arguments goes to stderr instead of stdout. If some other process has a dependency on the stdout dump (i.e. when writing an NRPE plugin), then make sure to specify stdout explicitly or you might run into some unexpected troubles.Here's a quick example reusing the assumed values and LOGFILE from the question:
Either run  with  as the argument prior to setting up any other handlers or logging any messages, or manually add a  that pushes messages to stdout to the root logger (or any other logger you want, for that matter).
After having used Waterboy's code over and over in multiple Python packages, I finally cast it into a tiny standalone Python package, which you can find here:https://github.com/acschaefer/duallogThe code is well documented and easy to use. Simply download the  file and include it in your project, or install the whole package via . 
For 2.7, try the following:
