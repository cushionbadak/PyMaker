I am pretty new to python, but I am unable to find an answer to what I am thinking should be a relatively simple issue.I am trying to utilize , and I am wondering what I can do with the output of it (like set it to a variable, an array, things like that).I am using , and I have had some trouble finding documentation on .The code is relatively simple:This prints the tasklist, but I have had trouble getting data from that print into variables. I am assuming it's something minor to do with Python, and not to do with tasklist.Ultimately I am looking to make a matrix of the tasklist entries, that way I can search for a process, and grab the corresponding data.
 is the easiest:(Note I've used  here, as I'm not experienced with the  command you're talking about - there's reference to it for window systems though...)Then you have to do something on  so it's usable...
 isn't a usual Python command. Instead, it "calls out" to the wider operating system:  is roughly the same as going to a command line and typing . It's a quick-and-dirty way of executing any program from a Python script.There are, of course, non-quick and dirty ways of doing this. They are found in the  module, and allow you to start up an arbitrary subprocess (other program) and communicate with it, sending it data and receiving its output.There's a quick shortcut function in there which will call an external program, check whether it succeeded, and return the output. That function is :
Based on a few of the other answers...
