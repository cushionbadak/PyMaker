Natural Text
I'm currently having a problem I cannot think through properlyI have a situation where I have a text file being read in a specific format(predator) eats (prey)What I am attempting to do is put it into a dictionary however there are situations where there are multiple lines of the. (predator) eats (prey)Where the same predator shows up to eat a different prey.So far this is what it looks like...As you can see I simply dump the format into a list which I attempt to convert into a dictionary.But this method will only accept one value for the key. And I want something that has two things likeLion eats ZebraLion eats dogto have a dictionary that isLion: ['Zebra', 'Dog']I cant think of a way of doing this. Any help would be appreciated.
There are two reasonable ways to go about making a dictionary that contains lists that you add to, rather than single items. The first is to check for an existing value before adding a new one. The second is to use a more sophisticated data structure, that takes care of creating the lists whenever it is necessary.Here's a quick example of the first approach:A variation on this first approach replaces the / block with a slightly more subtle method call on the dictionary: The  method sets  to an empty list if it doesn't already exist, then returns the value (either the new empty list, or the previous existing list). It works very similarly to the other approach to the problem, which is up next.The second approach I mentioned involves the  class from the  module (part of the Python standard library). This is a dictionary that creates a new default value any time you request a key that doesn't already exist. To create the values on demand, it uses a factory function that you provide when you first create the .Here's what your program would look like using it:
