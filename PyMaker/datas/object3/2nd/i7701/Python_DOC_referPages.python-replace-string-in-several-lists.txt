If you use a dictionary instead of a list for your , the problem becomes much easier :You don't need to iterate on  for each  element, then. means :2 first elements of the corresponding value from  for the key . If not present, use  insteadelements of  after the 3 first ones, if present
Use  to aggregate the elements from the lists, then build a new list for each pair:Note that this usage of the  unpacking operator is supported in Python 3.5+.
