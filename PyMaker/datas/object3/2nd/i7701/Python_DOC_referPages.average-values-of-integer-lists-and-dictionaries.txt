Is there a way of calculating the average of the values of two or more lists or even dictionaries?This is what I came up with:But what if I have 100 lists? And what if those lists are inside dictionaries like these:P.S. the length of the list is always the same.EDIT: Important note is that I want the average of each index, not the average of the list.
Use zip and a list comprehension:
You can use  to get a tuple of each element grouped together index-wise from the input lists, and use  to add them together:
I think this works fine.
