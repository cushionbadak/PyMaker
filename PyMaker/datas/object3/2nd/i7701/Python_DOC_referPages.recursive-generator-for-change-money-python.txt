Natural Text
First, thanks for any help. I have this recursive code for counting ways of change from a list of coins and a given amount. I need to write a recursive generator code that presents the ways in every iteration. Example at the end:This is the code:Now, I need to present the ways with a recursive generator. I have a part of the code that I need to write:This should be the output for example:
Btw this reminds me of Problem 31.If you are using Python 3.3+ we can write  with :or without Testsworked fine, so it seems to give similar outputNoteYou should remember that for large values of  and small coins we may reach recursion limit (max depth is near  on my machines).EDITif you want to get which coins were used we can add extra parameter for thempossible problem here is that in situations when amount is negative or no coins left  object will be yielded, but it's ok, we can filter them from results using :gives us
this is the pattern.i asked to complete it
