In my code I am constantly grabbing frames from a camera to check if there is any human body present or not. whenever there is a human, crop the body and upload it on server. and keep doing this.PROBLEM: Whenever I start a thread to upload photo to server my program execution stops and wait for the upload thread to finish. I don't want my program execution to stop and wait. I want it to run without stopping. I want to start a separate thread to upload photo that runs parallel, does its job without disturbing normal flow and finishes after it. it should do this every time there is a body detected.
Correction:Use  to define anew thread instanceUse  to launch it, of course you don't have join since your process is continuous.simplified code so I could test-run it at my end:PS: Remember the thread is not destroyed and you must ensure the  doesn't stuck in memory for any reason, or you can control number of instance you have and set cap and manage zombie threads to avoid process crash and bad memory management
