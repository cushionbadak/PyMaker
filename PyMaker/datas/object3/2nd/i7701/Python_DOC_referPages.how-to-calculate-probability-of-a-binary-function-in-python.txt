Let us consider the following function:  Trial:I have tried with the following code but I,m not sure whether it is correct or not. The codes are here:  Does my code give the correct calculation? Please help?
If you mean to say "0 with the probability of , and 1 with the probability of ",  returns a random number from , so you just check if  is greater than that number:Currently, your function returns  and  with a 50/50 chance.
Yes, your code does the correct solution (based on the binomial distribution you've created calling N times f(x) ).However, the probability of selecting 0 or 1 randomly from (0, 1) is 50/50, but,  as you surely have noticed already, you're computing the probability for a given sample (Ex. [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]), not for the whole universe of calling infinite times f(x).See: Binomial distribution.You could write a more readable code if you store the results of the function in a list like this:Then:I also recommend you to explore numpy and binomial distributions, numpy.random.binamial
