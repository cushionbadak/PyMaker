Let me preface this by saying I am really new to Kotlin but am a little familiar with Python.My goal is to remove all the occurrences of the characters in one string from another string via some sort of function.I can show you how I would do this in Python :     And I can use it like this :  It would give this output :   How can I something similar in Kotlin?
I suggest using  in Kotlin:This should output .
You can use Regex (the equivlant module in Python would be re):Output:
I'm not familiar with Kotlin but I would declare both strings and a character variable. Then do a For...Next statement with the character being assigned in turn to each letter you want removed and search for the letter(s) in the altered string.It probably isn't the most efficient way of doing it but if you're okay with that slight delay in run time, it should work.
