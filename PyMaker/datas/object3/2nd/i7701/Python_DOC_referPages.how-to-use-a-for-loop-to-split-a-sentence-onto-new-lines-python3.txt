Natural Text
I know how to use a split() however, I'm having a bit of memory loss here. I want to use a FOR loop which will split up a user inputted sentence whenever a space occurs. Each word should thus be displayed on a seperate line when I run the program. Every time I run this, I'm just putting every letter onto a new line, but I want every word on a new line. My code so far: 
There are several ways to do this ...you could also try to implement the split method yourself (which is closer to what you gave as example):but you could also adapt the  method to do what you want:for the last case, please refer also to https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=print#print ( I have not tested the code in python, so there might be +-1 index offset, you'll easily find)
You can use list comprehension and  to do this in one line:and if you wanna keep the spacing and print them too, you can use:You can also use a  as the following:remove 2nd print if you don't want spaces.
