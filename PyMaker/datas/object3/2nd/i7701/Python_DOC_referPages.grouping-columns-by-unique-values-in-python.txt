Natural Text
I have a data set with two columns and I need to change it from this format:to thisI need every unique value in the first column to be on its own row.  I am a beginner with Python and beyond reading in my text file, I'm at a loss for how to proceed. 
You can use Pandas dataframes.Output:Let's use  and :Output: 
Using collections.defaultdict subclass:The output:
an example using  only; this is all in the python standard library (although the  version is way more concise!).assuming the keys you want to group are adjacent this could all be done lazily (no need to have all your data in-memory at any time):you can then replace the  with something like  for the program to read your actual file (and similar for the output file with ).again: of course you could directly write to the output file every time a key is found; this way you would not need to have all the data in-memory at any time:
I found this solution using dictonaries:OUTPUT10 1 5 3 11 5 4 12 6 2Something more functionalOUTPUT11 : ['5', '4']12 : ['6', '2'] 10 : ['1', '5', '3']
Using  may be easier. You can use  function to read  file where data is separated by space or spaces.This is will give output of  as:After reading  file to , similar to  in previous other answer, you can also use  and :Output:
