I have a numpy array.I want to perform rowise OR operation on it so that the resulting array looks like this:Is there a straight forward way for doing this without implementing loops ?I will be very grateful if someone could suggest something. Thanks
If you'd prefer to stick with bitwise or (the  operator in Python is a bitwise or, whereas the  operator is the boolean or), you can use . However, this only takes two arrays as input, so you can use Numpy's  capabilities to combine all the subarrays in the array. I like how explicit this is, but the  solution is common enough to not raise any eyebrows. The first argument for  is of course the  and the second is the  you're reducing along. So you could also do it column-wise, if you preferred, or any other axis for that matter.
You could do this by calling  to generate a boolean mask and then cast to  to convert the  and  to  and  respectively:The first param to  is the axis arg, here we can see the differences between axis 0 and 1:
