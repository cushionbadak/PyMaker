I am having a problem likeI have a compound string with many keys that gets kept in a config file. For 8 different queries, they all use the same string, except 1 key is a different setting. I need to be able to substitute a key in that file to save the strings for later like:How do I substitute one key at a time using ? Thank you
If placeholders in your string don't have any format specifications, in Python 3 you can use  and provide a mapping, returning the field name for missing fields:If you do have format specifications, you'll have to subclass  and override some methods, or switch to a different formatting method, like .
I think  does what you want:
you can escape the interpolation of  by doubling the curly brackets:a different way to go are template strings:(this answer was before mine for the template strings....)
You can replace  by  to enable further replacement later:This easily extends in multiple replacement passages, but it requires that you give all keys, in each iteration.
All great answers, I will start using this  package soon. Very disappointed in the default behavior here, not understanding why a string template requires passing all the keys each time, if there are 3 keys I can't see a logical reason you can't pass 1 or 2 (but I also don't know how compilers work)Solved by using  for the items I'm immediately substituting in the config file, and  for the keys I replace later upon execution of the flask server
