I want to create a histogram with broken axes and found that there must be a module doing this called brokenaxes that works together with matplotlib (source) . Anyway, when I trie  to import the module like this:I get this error message:No module named brokenaxesI'm using ipython5.1 in anaconda 4.3.Can anyone help me? 
In order to use a module it has to be installed. This can be done viaSee https://docs.python.org/3/installing/However, it seems that the brokenaxes you get from the python package index is currently (as of June 2017) broken (as the name says it ;-)).  It should now (as of August 2017) be working again (see answer by package maintainer below).Alternativelygo to https://github.com/bendichter/brokenaxes, download the files and copy into your python's site-packages folder. 
Package creator here. There was a bug in the install script. It worked despite the bug in previous versions of pip, but if you have the most recent version the install broke. I fixed it today, so you should be able to run:to get the latest version. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for bringing this to my attention.Ben
