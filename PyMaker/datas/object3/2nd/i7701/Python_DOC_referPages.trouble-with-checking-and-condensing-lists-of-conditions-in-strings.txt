Natural Text
I've been making a sort of artificial intelligence (it's more like a long list of question - answer situations) and I've been looking to step up the complexity, but I know there's a way to shorten the amount of typing I have to do and I can't quite find it. Anyways, here's the long version of me asking for input, then checking the type of input (for example it's a question):and so on, then I would check for subject, mood, expression, etc...If anybody knows how to condense all 5 of those statements that'd be great, thanks...
Use the  function with a generator expression to test words from a sequence against : iterates over the generator expression and returns  as soon as one of the  tests is true, or  when the generator expression is exhausted.
