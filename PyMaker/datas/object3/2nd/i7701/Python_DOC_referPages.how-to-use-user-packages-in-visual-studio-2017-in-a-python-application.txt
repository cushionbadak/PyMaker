I have this python application structure in Visual Studio 2017.I created a  folder using the Solution explorer and there's a  file in it.I want to use the  module which is stored in  directory. But when I try to use  it says  not defined.I have just started learning python. I looked up to this but I dont understand why isnt it working. Am I doing something wrong? I looked it up here 
You are trying to import from from package. Each package must have an  file. You just have to add a blank file  to your  folder and then it should be fine.
