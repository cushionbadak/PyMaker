What is a Pythonic way to search or manipulate sorted sequence?
 is part of the standard library - is that the sort of thing you're looking for?
It's worth noting that there are a couple high-quality Python libraries for maintaining a sorted list which also implement fast searching: sortedcontainers and blist. Using these depends of course on how often you're inserting/removing elements from the list and needing to search. Each of those modules provide a SortedList class which efficiently maintains the items in sort order.From the documentation for SortedList:Both implementations use binary search to find the correct index of the given value. There's a performance comparison page for choosing between the two modules.Disclaimer: I am the author of the sortedcontainers module.
