i have an xml (skin) file with the X and Y cordinates.I have to divide (for 1.5) all the numbers inside the tags:example:becomes:The file is very large I can not make 1 to 1. I need a script (.sh or .py), I created something but unsuccessful.
if file is very big, better is to use SAX xml parser, or http://lxml.de which uses libxml2 (very fast parser). I recommend SAX because you don't need DOM, only to find specific tag and change its attributes (?). Script will be like filter. Another option is to use  but  expression may be complex (I don't know how looks your XML file).
