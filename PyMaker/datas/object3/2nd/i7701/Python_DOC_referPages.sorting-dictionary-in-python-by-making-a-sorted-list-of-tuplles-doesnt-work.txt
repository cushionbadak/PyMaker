I've been using the solution provided in Sorting_Dictionary to sort a dictionary according to values.I know dictionaries cannot be as such sorted but a list of sorted tupples can be obtained.Complete code:This function produces problem:here helper is a method which returns a dictionary which is to be sorted. The dictionary is like this {Dad:1, Mom:2, baby:3}But this doesn't produce a sorted list of tupples. Instead the output is somewhat random like thisHow can we explain this behaviour?
According to the documentation for sorted (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted), the second argument is a function that creates a comparison key from each list element, so not the dict as a whole. returns an iterable (in python3, list in python2) of tuples, which is what's passed to your key function. If you want your comparison key to be based of the work frequency (the second element), you want to return the second element in this function ( where  is the individual tuple getting compared).To also explain the random output you got, your key was . Since your dict does not have tuples as keys, the default value will be None.
