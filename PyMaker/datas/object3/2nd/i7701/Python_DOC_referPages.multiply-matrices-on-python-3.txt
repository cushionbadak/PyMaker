anyone know why I got the wrong result? I know the there is a mistake in the last line in the code which is f=p0*pn*p
One potential source of problems:produce a , not a .  That means that after those 2 loops (which probably can be written without looping), ,  and  have the same values.Did you actually test this code line by line, making sure each step was correct?  When I write functions in Python, and especially  have test out all steps interactively.  Another thing - unless you really need it, don't use .  Stick with  when creating arrays, even 2d ones.  And use  (or ) if you need matrix multiplication.A quick rewrite of your function:
The solution is to use np.copy() to copy your  matrix.If you still don't get the expected answer, then you might want to have a look at np.dot() and np.matmul().Also note that PEP465 introduced  as a matrix multiplication operator.
