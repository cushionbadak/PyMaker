From https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.htmlThe purpose of the  package is two-fold. One is to provide  the implementation of the  statement (and thus, by extension,  the  function) in Python source code. This provides an  implementation of  which is portable to any Python interpreter.  This also provides an implementation which is easier to comprehend  than one implemented in a programming language other than Python.Two, the components to implement  are exposed in this package,  making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known  generically as an importer) to participate in the import process.Does it mean that both the  statement and  function are by default implemented based on  function?But https://stackoverflow.com/a/44655619/156458 implies that is not implemented based on  by default.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import says that  function is invoked by the  statement. so if  is not implemented based on  by default, the  statement is not implemented based on  by default either.
No, the actual import code is a port of the Python code. See the implementation of the  function (which  is basically a light Python->C wrapper for), which contains the comment:So for performance reasons,  uses C-optimised code, not the Python implementation of . The two implementations are kept in sync, however, if you were to create a pull request touching one, the Python core developers will ask you to update the other too before accepting your changes.Your use of emphasis leads me to believe you are misreading the documentation;  is not the implementation of the import statement. This is the implementation of the import statement in Python source code, in contrast to the implementation of the import statement in C code.
