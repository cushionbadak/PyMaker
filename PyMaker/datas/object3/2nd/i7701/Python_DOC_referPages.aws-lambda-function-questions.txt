I'm looking at an example for python AWS  function and I had a few questions.For this method:What does this colon do in the  statement?Also, for this (part) method:Where is  defined? It looks like  is equal to what a person would respond to alexa saying their favorite color. Or is it checking of  is a slot category? If the second, then for , where is  defined?Also if anyone has any tutorials for python amazon  functions for alexa skills, please let me know.
None of code from your question looks like lambda. Amazon lambda is just a functions which accepts two parameters "event" and "context". After that you can create an event which will trigger that lambda and give it some context.Event can be what ever you want: HTTP request, S3 event or Alexa event. 
For Your question,1) colon mean  it defines a dictionary data structure.2) 'Color' is a String value, it was defined when it was used.. But u can not retrieve it once u used it.FYI, python is fun, read the tutorial. :)
