I am trying to make a program in Python that beeps every hour. and no of beeps should be equal to no of hours. such as for 12 o'clock it should beep 12 times.but I have no idea how to detect change in hour. the above code beeps for h no of times and it gives the hour.but how to detect that hour has changed.whether should I check every regular time interval and use previous hour and current hour to detect changes? I think this idea is not effective. because of time delay of interval time i.e.check current time every 5 second and compare two successive check to detect change in hours.is there any method to accomplish it directly.
At its simplest:Note you can test the code by using .minute rather than .hour Which will allow you to see if it fits your purposes.You will have to replace the  with a call to your function  Also you might want to consider adding a little extra code to your  function.To ensure that for example: at 16:00 you only hear 4 beeps rather than 16 and at midnight, you hear 12 beeps, rather than none.
