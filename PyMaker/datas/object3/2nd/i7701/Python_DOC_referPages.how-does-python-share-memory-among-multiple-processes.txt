I read that processes operate on seperate memory spaces (link). However the multiprocessing package of python offers shared memory (multiprocessing.Value, multiprocessing.Array). Where (in which process) is this data stored? Is the data accessed by reference by the child processes?
The data is allocated in a shared, anonymous memory map created through the  module. You can see the code here and here.
