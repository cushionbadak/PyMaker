Can please anybody tell in few sentences: what are the advantages of coding from a command line then an IDE (like PyCharm for Python)? I didn't find an answer, which could satisfy my interest and show the real practical meaning of coding from command line vs. IDE to an unexperienced programmer.Note 1: I rephrased my initial question which was about argparse package.Note 2: Even if I found some arguments - if anyone can bring another advantages of using IDE vs. cmd, please post them.
I made a small research outside of Python section and found a very similar question from somebody who is learning C++.Here I can sum up some the main advantages mentioned by other SO users:Easier to automate tasks, also in cross-platform processesToo few bugs, in comparison to most IDEs.More efficent for larger systemsFunctionality of the Vim editor (Linux)After further research I understood that it is more typical for Linux users to code from a command line, then for (for example) Windows users. And of course it depends very much on developer's preferences.
