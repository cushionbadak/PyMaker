I'm using a python package, cdo, which heavily relies on tempfile for storing intermediate results. The created temporary files are quite large and when running bigger calculations, I've run into the problem that the  directory got filled up and the script failed with a  error (we are talking about 10s to 100s of GB). I've found a workaround to the problem by creating a local folder, say  and then doingbefore importing the  module. While this works for me, it is somewhat cumbersome if I want also others to use my scripts. Therefore I was wondering, whether there would be a more elegant way to solve the problem by, e.g., telling  periodically to clear out all temporary files (usually this is only done once the script finishes). From my side this would be possible, because I am running a long loop, which produces one named file each iteration and all the temporary files created during that iteration would be discardable afterwards.
as the examples show: you could use  in a context manager:that way they are removed when the context exits....do you have that much control over how  uses tempfiles?
