I created a program that added integers from a file into an array and then did something to them, but when I tried to add two files into the same array the code I was using didn't work. Here's the code I used for one file which worked fine:But when I tried adding a second file, what I did din't work.I know that that is not how you do it, I just couldn't figure out the correct way. I also realize that there already exists similar questions, but their answers did not work in my case. Any help would be appreciated.
