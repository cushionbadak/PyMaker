From Python in a NutshellCustom ImportersAn advanced, rarely needed functionality that Python offers is the  ability to change the semantics of some or all  import  and  from   statements.Rebinding __import__You can rebind the    attribute of the module    to your own custom importer function—for example, one using the  generic built-in-wrapping technique shown in “Python built-ins” on  page 174.In "You can rebind the    attribute of the module  ", should "the module  " be "the module  " instead?Is "the    attribute of the module  " bound to function by default? Or does "the module  " provide the default implementation bound to its     attribute?
Yes, that's a typo in the book. In Python 2 the same module is named  (no ), in Python 3 it is named . is a distinct function from . If you are going to rebind , save a reference. is implemented in C, and essentially calls the C-API  function. is a pure-Python function. The goal of  is to provide a pure-python implementation of the import machinery so it can be hacked on more easily, and this function is no exception.
