I am trying to generate html Test report but the test cases are executing properly but html report is not generating pls help me out this..Thank you.
This line is incorrect:According to the documentation of the built-in  function, its first three arguments are expected to bethe file path (a string)the mode in which the file is opened (a string)the buffering policy (an integer)The way you are invoking the function, you are passing the following arguments:file path → mode → buffering →  – This is wrong, an integer is expected.It seems that you actually want to use  as the file path and  as the opening mode.In order to do that, use the  function:(Note that you have to omit the , which would have meant something different anyway.)
