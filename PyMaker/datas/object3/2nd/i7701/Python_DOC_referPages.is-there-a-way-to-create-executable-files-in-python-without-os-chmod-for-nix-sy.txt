By default  writes files with 666 octal permission: -rw-rw-rw-. I wonder if there's a way to make  creates files with the execution bit set. For instance,  if presumably my system's umask value is 0000 then any file written with  will be written with the permission -rw-rw-rw-: I'm looking for a way to set the default permission value of  to 777 octal so I can write executable files directly without . Or generally is there a way to achieve this in Python? Probably using lower-level file processing tools from  module?  and most editors use 666 octal permission mode by default. I wasn't able to obtain files with the execution bit set for files created by  command,  uses 666 by default.  Note: this just an artificial question. 
 accepts an  argument that returns a file descriptor;  accepts a mode, which defaults to .
