I'm trying to set up uWSGI to run a simple Flask application. I followed along with this tutorial, which worked fine, but when implementing the same concepts on my project it didn't work.Here's my directory structure:When I'm in the  directory, the python command  works fine. However, the uwsgi command  doesn't. Here's :Here's :And here's the error I get:Thanks!
Why  had worked?Because Python sets  to include your  directory, based on the directory  (the command-line argument) was in:As initialized upon program startup, the first item of this list, , is the directory containing the script that was used to invoke the Python interpreter.You can check this out by adding  and  to your . The very first element would be your  directory (full absolute path).Why  hadn't worked?Because interpreter didn't knew where to find . uWSGI hadn't took the path of  and haven't added it tothe embedded interpreter's  (via  internal API call,  or otherwise) - it had just initialized the interpreter and loaded the file.Basically, uWSGI is not a Python interpreter, it just hosts it, embedded.If the script directory is not available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the script is read from standard input), path[0] is the empty string, which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first.Why  fixed things?Because you told Python interpreter where to look for imported modules. :-)
