By default when we create a datetime instance, the format includes microseconds.If I don't want the microseconds part in the instance then I do this,So my question here is that is there any way where we can specify the format in which we want the datetime instance to be created rather than converting it to formatted string we want and then converting back to datetime instance.
A  object has no format. It is not created in any specific format, it is just an instance of a class. That instance has attributes, and those attributes have values.If you need to have an instance that represents a time with the  attribute set to , just use the  method to create a new instance from one with all the other attributes correct:However, if you wanted to format a  object for printing, then just format it without the microseconds component:You don't have to use the microsecond attribute anywhere.
