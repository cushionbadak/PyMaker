I've got more than 200 files in .csv and I'd like to read and compute two of them in the same time (current and the next one). I'm trying to use glob and pandas data framesI've got no other ideas.
You can use the  recipe from the  documentation:From: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipesand usage:
If you wish to work with the current and next file at every iteration, the following should do:This uses  to keep track of the index of the current file from the  sequence. This way, you can grab the "next file" while working with the "current" file by just adding  the current index.I hope this helps.
