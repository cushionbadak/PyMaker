This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I've written some code:But when I answer I get:
 returns a string.From the docs:If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.You should change your code as follows:That way the program will try to convert the user intput into an integer - and if that fails it will print "Give me a whole number please"
