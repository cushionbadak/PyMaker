Note: This is a hypothetical question:So I Googled several variations of this question ("String literl", "Escape Char", "Raw String", etc), mainly only solution they said was to place a "r" before the first quote of a string. I also tried using .format() into a raw string, re/repr, and I tried .replace() the slashes, but it already converts the escape char.However, what if it was a pre-defined variable returned from a separate function/class (for example)?So my question is: How do you make a pre defined variable a string literal, and get something like this path to work?Update: This is all hypothetical! Just curious if there is a way to reverse escaped chars!!!Example: 
I dont quite understand your question. Is the output of  returning a string, or the raw data? Test to make sure it's a string. If it isnt simply cast the return value as .If there was a newline character the only way to display it is to cancel out the functionality by adding another backslash represented as  instead of '\n'.
From the question:The variable  stores the string "w". There are several ways to write the string literal:Unicode strings add:The variable just contains the string with one character "w". The information, how the input was written in the input file is lost. Therefore,  could only return a list all possible forms without knowing the original form.
