Natural Text
I have a script that uses a large chunk of text to train a model. The way it's written now I can either read from a file or stdinthen I can call my script as: or The second version is especially useful if I want to search the filesystem, and use multiple files to train the model. However this becomes tricky, due to the pipe, if I simultaneously try to profile using  i.e. I know that I can send it multiple files using the  option, and iterate over the files, but then I will have to change the behaviour of the  method to avoid overwriting data. Is there a good way to open an IO channel, for the lack of a better expression, that concatenates the input without explicitly reading and writing line by line?
you can  open files and use a generator to  open files from the filenames:this has the added benefit that only one of your files is open at the time.you could also use that as a 'data pipeline' (may be more readable):
