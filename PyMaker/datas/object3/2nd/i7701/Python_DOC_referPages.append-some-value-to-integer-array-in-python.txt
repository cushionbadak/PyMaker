how can I add some value to this integer array "a" using append or any other method?
The reason you are getting an error is that you cannot append to . If  was a , you would have no problem.It looks like this is what you are looking for:If  and  are , you can:
Lists are much more efficient at item-wise construction than numpy arrays.  If you want to  one-by-one, I would suggest appending to a list and then converting it to a numpy array using .  A faster way to do the same thing your code does is this:If you just want to convert your  list into an  array:Which you can then  as per @Akavall or use the somewhat more compact  form (note the square brackets).
Here's some timeit code that compares the speeds of 3 different ways of converting a 2D Python list of small integers to a 1D Numpy array.The straight-forward way is to simply pass the whole list to Numpy's  function, and then flatten the resulting 2D array to 1D via its  method. That's the approach taken by .The other ways that I tested both use the  function.  builds the array row by row,  builds it item by item. As you might guess, this last approach is very slow. Even for a 10x10 list it's around 50 times slower than . For larger lists, it's speed is truly glacial.outputThese timings were obtained using Python 3.6.0 on a rather ancient 2GHz single core 32 bit machine with 2GB of RAM, running a Debian derivative of Linux. YMMV.
Ok, well according to the docs the numpy arrays do not have the function append.Here is the correction of your code:I guess this was what you wanted to do, according to the docs numpy.append() is a free function that you can use. I hope this helps you.
