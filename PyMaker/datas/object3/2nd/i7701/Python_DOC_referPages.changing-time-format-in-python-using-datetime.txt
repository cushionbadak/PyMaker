I am having trouble trying to change my date format. is for example: 2017-06-20T12:54:57.000ZHere what I am trying to do: I also tried For both I have this error:
 stands for months; the second time you should've used  for minutes. Also,  for seconds.
Use the following format string:In yours, you have  instead of  for the minute,  instead of  for the second, and you were missing the  for the microsecond.Check the docs for a full explanation of datetime string formatting.
I finally split my string because I don't need the microseconds, and I use timedelta to correct the timezone
