I have a list of floats which comes from some other function.What I know is that in ideal world there exist a common factorwhich can be used to multiply each term to obtain list of integers.There could be some small numerical noise (~1e-14).So for examplehere each term can by multiplied by 3 to obtainHow can I find this term? We can assume integer solution exists.Any helpful comments will be appreciated
Python's Fraction type can convert floating points to rationals with denominators under 1000000, and then you can find the lowest common denominator.A straightforward way to find the least common multiple using the math.gcd function:
The brute force solution. Still looking for something more universal...
