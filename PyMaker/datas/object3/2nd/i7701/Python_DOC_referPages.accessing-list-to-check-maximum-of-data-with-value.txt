You can use a  to group the elements and determine their total. The  also provides some functions for getting the most common elements. You have to convert the  to , though, so you can use them as keys in the dict.
Here is your data:The first task is to sum the corresponding values, as in  {'H', 'B'} = 6 (5+1).Now  looks like this:And you want :
