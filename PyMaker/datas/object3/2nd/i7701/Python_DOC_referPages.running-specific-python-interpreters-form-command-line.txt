You can use Python launcher for Windows:Python 2.7 interptreter:C:\> py -2.7Python 3.6 interpreter:C:\> py -3.6You also can run a script with a specific interpreter:C:\> py -2.7 myScript.py
If its windows machine, to open a specific version of python you can use py from the command line.example:py2.7 #for version 2.7and py3.6 #for version 3.6if its a Linux machine you can use the following commands in the command line python python2.7 #opens version 2.7 andpython3.6 #opens version 3.6
