I would like to get the unix file type of a file specified by path (find out whether it is a regular file, a named pipe, a block device, ...)I found in the docs  but in Python 3.6, this seems not to work.Another approach is to use  objects (e. g. by ), but there are only methods ,  and .Any ideas how to do it?
Python 3.6 has  and its  objects have methods: takes a bit to get used to (at least for me having come to Python from C/C++ on Unix), but it is a nice library
You use the  module to interpret the result of .You can make a general function to return the determined type. This works for both Python 2 and 3.
