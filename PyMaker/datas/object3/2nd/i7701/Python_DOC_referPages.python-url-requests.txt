Let me start by saying I am extremely new to Python, but I am familiar with other programming languages. Before I dive into this project, I need to ask a few questions. I need to be able to make URL GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests straight out of Python.I'll be writing a library for specific use cases of those functions and I don't want users to have to go installing external libraries (like "Requests").What is the best way to do this, urllib.request?Thank you for educating me.
I need to be able to make URL GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests straight out of Python. ... What is the best way to do this, urllib2?Since urllib.request.urlopen() is hard-wired to GET or POST, you will need  http.client.HTTPConnection instead:The technique gets you "closer to the metal" and gives more control, but it loses all the comforts of urllib.request and its various highlevel services (like following redirects).
