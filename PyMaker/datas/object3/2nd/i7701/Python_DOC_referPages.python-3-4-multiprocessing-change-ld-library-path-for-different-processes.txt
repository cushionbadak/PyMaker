I'm using python multiprocessing module to call a python function in separate process, and I want a different value for the environment variable  for this processes.Specifically, I need to append a string to the existing value before the process refers to it. An example code is shown below:In the print statement, I can see that  has been correctly updated, however, my process is still referring to the value that it had when python was started, meaning that module_A is still referring to the old Is there a way to update this value dynamically within the script.RSVP. Thanks
The documentation for os.putenv() includes the text:"... Such changes to the environment affect subprocesses started with  os.system(), popen() or fork() and execv()"So, you can do it like this:... or (maybe better) after the fork() call, like this:(edit) Also the following does appear to work:module_A.py:main.py:
