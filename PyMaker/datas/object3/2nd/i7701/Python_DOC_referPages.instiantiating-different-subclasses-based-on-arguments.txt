I have a  and a  class, both inheriting from , which checks whether a given round-robin or playoff match passes the rules or not.The constructor has one argument, the match: . Now, if the match is a playoff match (), a  should be instantiated, otherwise it should be a . I could just do this:But this is kind of an unclean way of doing it. Would it be possible to just call the parent class constructor, , and this would create the instance of the corresponding subclass?What design could I use here to choose the appropriate class in a transparent way?
In order to make  work, you can override the  method in your parent class like this:However, it's not obvious to someone who reads your code that  returns an instance of a subclass. I recommend adding a staticmethod with a clear name to , something like this:Now you can do , which conveys the intention of creating a  specifically for this  instance more clearly.
