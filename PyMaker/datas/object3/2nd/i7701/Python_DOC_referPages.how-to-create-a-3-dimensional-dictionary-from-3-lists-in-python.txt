I have 3 listsI want to create a dictionary looking something like this:I want to be able to loop over  and  and do  to get the value associated with it.I tried this, but this does not work. Extra:I am writing a Linear program in  and I want to create a dictionary of demand values for a particular sku , in period  on line  so that I can do  summed over ,  , for constraints or something like that. These demand values are constants. This could be cartesian product or comprehension. Is there a function similar to ?
Since you are using PuLP, you may want to look into pulp's makeDict().Suppose you have the following:and that for your demand values you have:You can then create an array that contains your demand data like this:and now define your dictionary:EDIT: Since the data set up was a bit messy before, setting up the array like this makes it much cleaner (and easier to edit):Now the parameters for makeDict() should be:
If you want "Cartesian product" of lists, you can use:
this is a variant using  and :where i used  as placeholder for your value.
Another way of doing this would just be to have a dictionary that is keyed by tuple values i.e Note in  it would be more common to donate your sets with a capital letter and iterate with the smaller letter.
I think this reads really nicely as a comprehension:
