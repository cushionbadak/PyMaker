I am trying to create a neural network using the python module nnet-ts.It has a built-in method named TimeSeriesNnet(), which takes two arguments;hidden_layers and activation_functions.See documentation for this module, as well as example in the README.md:I am running python version 2.7.13The nnet-ts module has dependencies to 5 particular packages, which I am listing below together with the current versions I am using:numpy-1.13.0, pandas-0.20.2, scipy-0.19.0, theano-0.9.0 and keras-2.0.5Following the example in the README (link above), my code reads as follows:Execution of this code results in a NameError being thrown. Output:My guess is that the reason for this error could have something to do with different module versions, as the code is nearly identical to the example given in the README. Any help is much appreciated.
Definitely, there is something wrong with your deployment of the code. For your Python developments, I suggest always use a local virtual environment. For this Neural Network Timeseries, you can build it locally with the  command, it will build necessary files in the  directory. Assuming you have all dependencies, there shouldn't be any problem. In the deployment, you just have to set your  to this directory, or you just include this path in the runtime with  method.For example, assuming I am in  directory, I have built and run nnet-ts as follow:
