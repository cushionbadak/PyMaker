I have the following function defined in its own file called MTG.py.  It is supposed to take an adjacency matrix as an input, and create a graph.When I run from the command lineI get exactly what I want, which is the correct graph printed to M.png.However, if I add to the code above (with no indent, i.e. outside the definition of the function)I get the errorI imagine this is happening because the input function is taking in what I think is a matrix, but is actually something else.  I've tried to rectify this by using np.matrix(M), but that turns my matrix in a 1x16 vector. I am new to Python, and I'm sure there are 1000 ways to do this better, but I really want to figure out why this particular way is not working.I am using PyCharm 2017.1.3 (community edition, if that matters), and Python 3.6.
Python 3's  returns a , it doesn't parse it to make a Python data structure just because the contents look like a Python literal. In this case, if you want to be able to enter a  of  of s literal, I'd recommend using  to (safely) convert from the string representing the matrix literal to the  itself:You're probably used to Python 2, where  was equivalent to doing  in Python 3, but that version of  was dangerous and removed for good reason;  gets you what you need without allowing arbitrary code execution.
