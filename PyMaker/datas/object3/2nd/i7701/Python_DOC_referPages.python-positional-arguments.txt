I am trying to understand how the parameters to this  are interpreted:It appears this  forces the caller to call  with exactly 2 params and the second param should always be a named  param. How do I decipher this from the  signature? Why does it not allow me to specify a middle argument for the ?
How do I decipher this from the function signature?Arguments with no default value must be passed.Arguments after a  must be passed by keyword if they are passed at all.Extra arguments cannot be passed to "fill up" the  unless an argument name accompanies the .Since  has no default value it must be passed.  Since it is after the  it must be passed by keyword.  Since the  is "bare" (i.e., it is just the  placeholder and not a vararg like ), no other positional arguments can be passed as "middle" arguments.See PEP 3102 for a description of the keyword-only-argument syntax.
The  alone is a Python3-only way to express that the following parameters are named arguments and can only be passed to the function as such. From the documentation:Parameters after “” or “” are keyword-only parameters and may only be passed used keyword arguments.
