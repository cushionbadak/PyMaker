I have this Django query where I get some information from different databases, which I want to expose to the front end:that gives me in turn a list of dictionaries - the prompt is for :I would like to be able to arrange the order of the keys in each dictionary, that means in a required and specific order I am provided. The order would always be the same for each element in the list.Is there any way to do it in Django or in Python?
You probabily need this:import collectionsOrderedDict   dict subclass that remembers the order entries were addedDocumentation here:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDictHere you can find a full example:https://pymotw.com/2/collections/ordereddict.htmlHope this help,Ciao!
This is actually related to python. Here is the cross-reference to the same question which already answered.Sorting dictionary keys in pythonYou can only get a sorted representation of the key list.
One way is to use  instead of . However this returns list of  instead of list of  but the order is always the same in all elements.Values will always be in the order specified in  but a tuple instead of dictionaries.
