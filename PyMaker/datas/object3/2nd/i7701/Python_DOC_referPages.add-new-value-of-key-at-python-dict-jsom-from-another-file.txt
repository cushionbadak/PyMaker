Good day! I have question about python dictionary and json! At one file i am creating json dictionary with this structure:For it  use this code (i - number of faces, (x,y,w,h) - rect. of coord.):Before this part all is great. My question - how i can open this dictionary (face.json) at the another py file and CHANGE value of 'Age', 'Gender' and save it? Thank you for your time! 
You can use  in order to load the dictionary:Then you can save the data again using :Note that there is no need to invoke  manually as  handles this already for you. Also when opening the file you want to use mode  instead of  because otherwise you don't overwrite the old data but instead just append the new dictionary to the end. This will also invalidate the json format.
