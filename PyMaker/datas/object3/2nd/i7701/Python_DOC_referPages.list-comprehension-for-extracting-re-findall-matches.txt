I have a regular expression with a single group, and I want to use it to map a list of strings to a filtered list of matches for strings that match. Currently, I'm using the following:How can I do this more elegantly, using only filters, maps, and comprehensions? Obviously, I could use a for loop, but I wonder if it can be done purely by manipulating iterators.
There's no real advantage obfuscating your code with map, filter, or other functional tricks since a list comprehension is fast, simple and clear:
You can use maps and filters. Here's one way.If you're using python3, don't forget to tack on a  at the end.However, I don't see much of a need for more "elegance" here. What you're doing is perfectly fine.An alternative courtesy @juanpa.arrivillaga:
