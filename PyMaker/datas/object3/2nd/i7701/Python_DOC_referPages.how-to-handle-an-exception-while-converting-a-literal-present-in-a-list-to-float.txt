Natural Text
I have a list which has values shown above. When I am trying to add to an excel sheet using pandas, it is being added as text rather than float or int. I want to remove quotation marks so that it won't be seen as text in excel sheet, I know it can be done using split, and if I try to convert all of these to float, it throws an exception for this '0(1:1)' element saying that invalid literal for for float.How do I handle this? 
The simpler solution is to wrap the  body in a  and append  or the original value () if it fails for a particular iteration:A  will be thrown when  can't be parsed as , while  will be thrown when  is .Like that you don't need to check if  is  using and  and both exceptions can be handled consistently (assuming that's what you want).Note the  is not needed as it is actually not doing anything. According to the docs, strip() will...:Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.That is, it will try to remove  from the start and the end of your values, but none of your values start or end with two single quotes. Actually, any of them contain quotes at all, those around them are just the way to represent a string, but are not part of their value.Also,  will automatically take care of converting a string representation of a number () to .
You can use  from  module and use a  block like this example:
