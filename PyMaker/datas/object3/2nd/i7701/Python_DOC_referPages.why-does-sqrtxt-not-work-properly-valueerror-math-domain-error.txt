So I want to make a program that says what are the solutions to  n   in the function  2^n  -15 = xt  where n is a positive integer and xt is a square number. But this doesn't work:The error says this:
Short answer: you aim to calculate the square root of a negative number.If we add a  statement to the program:We see that the first element that is queried, is:Although there are complex numbers that represent square roots of negative numbers,  works on floating points, so a subset of "reals". Now for reals, the square root of a negative number is not defined.Finally not that  does not calculate the power, one can calculate the power by using  (or  in this case). The caret  is a bitwise or.
This error could happen when your argument to  is a negative number.The  function is not able to calculate the square of a negative numbers.You can use the  lib for negative number:
 apparently does not like negative numbers which would lead to a complex result. From the documentation:These functions cannot be used with complex numbers; use the functions of the same name from the cmath module if you require support for complex numbers. The distinction between functions which support complex numbers and those which donâ€™t is made since most users do not want to learn quite as much mathematics as required to understand complex numbers. Receiving an exception instead of a complex result allows earlier detection of the unexpected complex number used as a parameter, so that the programmer can determine how and why it was generated in the first place.Use  from cmath if you need complex results as well.
