I have a question about python regex. I am trying to get count of the number start with 1, end with 1, and between 1s there are only 0s from the string.The problem is if the number is 10101, it should return 2, but based on my regex, it returns 1. How can I change this regex to count duplicated 1 between two 101s?https://regex101.com/r/R78CRD/1/ 
Regex only counts non-overlapping matches. Your regex however matches two s, so regex skips forward to the 3rd  and continues to count from there.You can use a lookahead assertion to fix this:
