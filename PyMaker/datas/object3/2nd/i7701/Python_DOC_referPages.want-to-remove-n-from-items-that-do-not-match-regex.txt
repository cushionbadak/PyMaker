Natural Text
If have block of text that has a non-uniform list that, for example, looks like the following:And I have a regex that looks something like the following, I can act upon the items that do match it (i.e., everything but the lines that starts without numbers):How can I target the lines that don't match the regex to remove the \n? In the end, I want something that would look like the following:Or is there a better way to go about this than regular expressions?
You don't even need regex for this, but if you want to do it with regex - use negative lookaheads to select the new lines to remove and replace them with a comma:
Regex seems fine here, however your regex is invalid, you had an extra ( at the beginning.I believe this does what you're looking for:It splits the lines into a list, and then creates a new list out of elements that are added to the list depending on the results of the regex, with '\n' or ','. It then joins the elements of the list into a string, then we chop off the first '\n' with [1:]
