Hi, I am working on a  for a Reddit-like use. This bot controls 6 accounts. The problem I'm running into is when I run the section of code that checks if one of my accounts have already voted for the post.Let's say account 5 has already voted for the post: The current code stops the enumeration altogether, so account 6 never gets a chance to run through the checks. If I change the  to , account 5 attempts to vote and because it has already voted, the exception also stops the script altogether.I have tried , , etc. I'm thinking now that I may have an indentation problem. Surely it is an easy fix and I'm just missing something.
You might be looking for continue rather than break.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#continueAs continue only breaks out of the inner for, you might be able to re-structure the inner for as a generator.I'm assuming that account[k] will only give one name here?
