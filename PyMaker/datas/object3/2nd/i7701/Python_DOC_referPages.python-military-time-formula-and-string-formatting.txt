I have created a function to take a string input "minutes-since-midnight" and convert it into military time.For example- 365 = 0605,441 = 0721,864 = 1424. For some reason my outputs are: 066, 077, 1414. Can someone please explain to me what I am doing wrong
you can use  to pad your integers with zeros if necessary:also note that your format string referenced the first argument twice (you had  instead of ).
