I have an array  and  and I'd like to map  such that for every element in  that's between an element in  it will get mapped to the index of  that is the upper range that  is contained in. Not the best explanation in words but here's an exampleSo the final product I want is I know I can just loop and solve for it but I was wondering if there is a clever, fast (vectorized) way to do this in pandas/numpy
Use python's  module:bisect â€” Array bisection algorithmThis module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion. For long lists of items with expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more common approach. The module is called bisect because it uses a basic bisection algorithm to do its work. The source code may be most useful as a working example of the algorithm (the boundary conditions are already right!).The following functions are provided: Locate the insertion point for x in a to maintain sorted order. The parameters lo and hi may be used to specify a subset of the list which should be considered; by default the entire list is used. If x is already present in a, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as the first parameter to  assuming that a is already sorted.The returned insertion point i partitions the array a into two halves so that  for the left side and  for the right side.Reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html
bisect is faster: the solution assumes lists are sortedreturns
