I would like to make two POST requests from an API on a Django view at the same time.This is how I would do it outside of django.I'm confused about the event loop. How can I do this inside my Django view? Do I need to use nested functions for this?Edit: How is this even considered a duplicate? Parallel calls and schedulling with crontab are completely different things...
Solution was to nest the function inside another one.
In this particular case you can simply use the , asyncio is using it under the hood in  anyway (but also adds redundant lines of code / loop creation etc in your example).see https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html
Django is a synchronous framework so you can't use any  in the views because of there no loop or something like that. You really can use Django channels library for it, but it will make your views asynchronous under the hood by itself, you don't need to use  also, just connect the channels a go on coding as you do it before, without any async features.
