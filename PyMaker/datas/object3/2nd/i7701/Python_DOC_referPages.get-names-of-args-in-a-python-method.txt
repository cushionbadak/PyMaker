This question already has an answer here:How to get the original variable name of variable passed to a function                    8 answers                I am not sure if it is possible. But suppose I have some python class with constructor as follows:Suppose I use this class somewhere and create an instance of it:What I mean by get name of arg, is to get names ('user', 'person', 'client' and 'doctor')I really mean just get string name of a argument. Where user, person etc. are some python objects with their attributes etc, but I only need the name of how these variables (objects) are named.
 should be used when you are unsure how many arguments will be passed to your function lets you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance (kwargs = keyword arguments)So  is a dictionary added to the parameters.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists
Use  and  like this:and you'll get access to the keywords and the values as well, no matter which type they are.
