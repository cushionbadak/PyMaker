I have a list of floats like following:I want to format it so that I could print up to 4 decimal places. So, I wrote the following code:It prints following, i.e., each number in a separate line. However, I want to print all of them on the same line. Using following code, I could achieve this.And I got this:My question is: Is there any better way to achieve this without explicitly writing each element of the list using a loop? I have a list of 110 entries and writing each explicitly each element so many times is painful.
How about:See String join()Within the join(), we apply the format to each element in the list of numbers.
The print built-in methon has an "end" keyword argument which defaults to a linebreak. You just need to replace it with a space or tab, like so:Check https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=print#print for more information on it.
