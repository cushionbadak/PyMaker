I am writing a Python script to find duplicate entries in a CSV list of call numbers and titles. Here is the format of the CSV file:920.105,George Mueller  920.105,George Mueller  920.105,George Mueller 327.373,The Letters to the Galatians and Ephesians  327.371,Galatians and Ephesians 289,The Modern Tongues  Movement 288.01,The Seduction of Christianity  288.003,Understanding Cults and New Religions  288.002,Understanding Cults and New Religions 286.061,"History  of the Baptists, A" 286.044,"History of the Baptists, A"  286.003,This Day in Baptist History 3 286.003,This Day in  Baptist History 3 286.003,This Day in Baptist History 3What I need to do is find all of the duplicated call numbers that have different titles. So I don't care about most of the entries, because they are duplicates of the same book. I'm looking for different books that were given the same call number. The script I have will complete with no errors, but when I open the file the script created it is empty. Here's my code:Thanks in advance!
This is based off of @hiro protaginist's answer but it allows unsorted duplicates.As with the aforementioned answer, replace  with  and  with .
if your input is sorted by the book numbers, you could use  :which will outputnote that i had to change your input as that would not have generated any output...in order to use that you'd need replace the  with something like  for the program to read your actual file (and similar for the output file with ).again: this will only work if your input is sorted by the numbers.
