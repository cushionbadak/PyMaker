 will set names that cannot be used with regular attribute access i.e. .How can I check for such names, to avoid using them?
On Python 3,We check that the attribute name is a string, that it fits the format of a Python identifier, and that it's not a keyword.  doesn't exclude keywords, so the extra check is necessary.(Yes,  is a thing, but I don't really want to allow  subclasses.)
