My code looks like the following. It seems to be "hanging" during the  loop. If I create the dataframe  with 10 records, the whole process completes fast, but starting with 10000 (as shown), then the program seems to just hang. I am using  to look at the CPU core usages, and I do see all of them spike up to 100%, but then long after they go back down to 0%, the program doesn't seem to continue. Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
It appears  doesn't behave as you want and it wasn't made for sharing between multiple process, instead you must use I have added some print to understand your code flow,You can still polish your code to use  instead of
