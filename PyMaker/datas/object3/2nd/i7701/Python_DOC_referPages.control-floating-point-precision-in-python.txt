I have a number in python like 2.75960192084e-05.I want to display it with less number of numbers after decimal point like 2.759e-05. Note the exponent should remain displayed. Is that possible ?
the Format Specification Mini-Language allows you do do that with:...it will round though.the  means that 9 is the minimal witdh of the resulting string; with  places behind the decimal point in xponent notation.
