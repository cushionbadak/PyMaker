I am trying to set up an automated email sending script. I am using the email module and the  object from the  module and am sending the email using the  module. I would like to be able to attach a .pdf file to an email but the documentation for the  method for  is not very helpful and I'm not even sure I should be using it. Here is what I have so far with irrelevant information removed:How do I go about attaching the pdf file? I searched and saw one answer was using the MIMEText object to add attachments but it did not appear to work pdf.
Late for the answer... but this is what I do:By the way, this isnt a duplicate question, in this question, he use EmailMessage and don't use MIMEText / MIMEPart, etc.
