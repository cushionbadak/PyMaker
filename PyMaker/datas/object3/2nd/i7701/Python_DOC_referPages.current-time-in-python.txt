Hi I want to add the current time and possibly date to an email message sent using python,Its for a raspberry pi project i'm working on using an ultrasonic distance sensor,I have the sensor placed on a meds box and if the box is moved a certain distance I want to send an email to myself with the text"Your medicine box was moved at 04:15:32, Did you take your tablets?"It works in so far as the email sends but the time looks like 041532I tried adding colons to the time like so ("%I"":""%M"":""%S") but then the email was blank
essentially, the directives (the %X -es) get replaced with the respective values
you'll find more in documentation
Don't add colons inside of the inverted commas. Doing it directly will work smoothly. And if you want it in 24-Hours Format, just replace %I with %H. So it would look like this:
