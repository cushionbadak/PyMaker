I wanted to create a simple program which calculates the area of a circle where method and radius are input by the user. I am constantly getting the error: . What's wrong?
Python indicates blocks via indentation alone.  Your "true" and "else" branches have to be indented.  You cannot indent the leading  statement.  Does this match your intended logic?You do have other problems, but this will get you closer to execution.  For one thing, you never print the computed value in your else branch -- just a literal string.Among other things, I strongly recommend that you practice incremental programming: write just a line or two at a time, and don't continue until those are syntactically legal and do what you want.  Use  statements to trace values as you go -- and delete them later.  There is no need to get to 20 lines of code when you haven't yet managed to read in a value in the first 4 lines.
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.This is important, as without it, there is no way for the interpreter to know what is expected to be part of that block of code.(Ignoring that the lack of indentation causes an error)If  what should happen?If it isn't? then what? does it print anything? does it print ?So, how does indentation fix this confusion?Doing this:will print     foo    barwhen  and nothing otherwisewill print when  and otherwise
