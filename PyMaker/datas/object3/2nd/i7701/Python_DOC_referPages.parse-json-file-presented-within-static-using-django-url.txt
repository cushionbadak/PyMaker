I am having json file in my django app. I have parsed it to fetch json using  and returned as django URL.I tried this,it is working code. but i want to know is there any better/optimized method than this? 
Instead of json.loads, you can use json.load which uses the file object directly:This saves a little bit of code, and may save some memory if you have big JSON files.Furthermore, you could use with to close the file when done with it:This closes the file as soon as you exit the "with" block.
