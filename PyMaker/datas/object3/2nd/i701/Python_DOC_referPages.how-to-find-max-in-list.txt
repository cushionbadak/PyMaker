I write the following code but it shows error.TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)       in         1 a = [9,89,65,87]      ----> 2 print(max(a))TypeError: 'int' object is not callableHow do I fix this or are there any documentation I need to read to get better understanding?
It seems like that your  is not a function but an  object.Can you just run the  and check what exactly it is?
Apparently you used  or  as an integer variable name before, and the  or  function has been overwritten. Use another name for the variable that you called  or  previously and it should work.
This code is working properly, so please check your code and run it again
run: And it should return like: built-in function maxIn this way you can identify whether you've overwritten  method or not. If so, change the name print wherever you've used.Here are some links for your reference:https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/functions/max.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/
