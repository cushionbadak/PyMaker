Write code to count the number of characters in original_str using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_chars. Do NOT use the len function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on this problem, comment it out afterward!)The computer tells me this is correct, but it's doesn't answer the question. I must replace len with another function.
If you cannot use the  function you could write a function like  below that uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the passed in  and increments and subsequently returns a variable  based on the total amount of characters. I think that is what you mean by an accumulator right?Output:
With the accumulator pattern, you have a variable, and you add to it when something happens. You can make that "something" mean "counting a particular character".So, write a loop that steps through each character in the string, and each time you go through that loop, add one to a variable, starting from zero.
