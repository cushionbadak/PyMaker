Of course, I can do a  on the escaped string, but I am assuming there should be a way to do it with the existing API (from the standard library or with third-party modules such as ).Update: I've found that Python3's  produces the expected result but I am reluctant to use it in an XML context since I'm assuming that HTML escaping might follow a different spec than what is required by the XML standard (https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#AVNormalize).
