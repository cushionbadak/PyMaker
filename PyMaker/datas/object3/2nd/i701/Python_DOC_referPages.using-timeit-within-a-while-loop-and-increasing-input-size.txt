Natural Text
I'm stumped. Basically, I have two functions that take an input (which is a list of randomly generated numbers).Then I wanted to figure out the size of the input list in which the time it takes both functions to execute is equal.Here's what I have:I can't figure this out. I've tried everything I could find. I know you can't reference outside variables when using , so I tried working around that too. I basically need any sort of method where I can increase the input side of the function and calculate each time.Thanks so much in advance. I've been struggling on this for over a day now.
I think the easiest way here, would be to format the string accordingly:Instead of writeThis will put the current value of  where  stands. See the docs for further information.
