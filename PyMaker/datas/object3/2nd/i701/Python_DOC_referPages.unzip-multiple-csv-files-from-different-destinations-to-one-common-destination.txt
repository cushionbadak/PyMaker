I am currently using some code that downloads csv data in zip files for each month in each year, the files are downloaded and then stored like this:Currently these folders are just on my desktopOnce I click on say the folder  you can see a folder for each month, jan, feb etc...So far I have tried this:but it doesn't seem to work?Any help would be appreciated.
This seems to be more related to file system traversing than zipfile. For that, you can use [Python 3]: glob - Unix style pathname pattern expansion, and for handling .zip files handling use [Python 3]: zipfile - Work with ZIP archives.For more details on traversing directories, check [SO]: How do I list all files of a directory? (@CristiFati's answer).code.py:Notes:I created (in my cwd) a tree structure that is simpler than yours, but thew principle is the sameThe files used are dummyThe algorithm is simple:Search the input dir for .zip files that match desired pattern (name starts with PUBLIC_)For each such file, extract all .csv files that it contains in the output dirOutput:@EDIT0:For Python 2
I do not have experience with the zip module unfortunately, but if you are asking how you could navigate to each of these folders I would approach the problem like such:I can't verify it works though because I obviously don't have the files on my PC, and there are still some fill in the blanks like "# do stuff here" but hopefully this can help get you on track! Let me know if you need more clarification.
