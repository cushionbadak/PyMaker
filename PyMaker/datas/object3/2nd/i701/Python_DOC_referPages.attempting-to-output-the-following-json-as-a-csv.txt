From your data it looks like non-bracketed items should be considered as values of the first column (i.e. a key) and bracketed ones should be considered as values for the second column, using the key that precedes them. You can do this purely in a procedural fashion:Which should produce an  containing:
 is a little challenging for Python beginners, but is very handy for walking through a collection of items and working with them in groups. In this case, we group by items that are or are not Python lists.From each group of nested ints, we'll create one or more entries in our accumulator list.Once the accumulator list is loaded, the code below just prints out the results, easily converted to writing to a file.Prints:
I think using  would be a good approach since grouping items is main thing that needs to be done to accomplish what you want. Here's a fairly simple way of using it:Contents of csv file produced:
