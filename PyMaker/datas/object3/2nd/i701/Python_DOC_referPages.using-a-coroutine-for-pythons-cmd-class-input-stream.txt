The problem I am facing is that:I have an asynchronous methodCalling plain-old python code I cannot changeWhich calls back a plain-old python methodWhich needs to call async code using I have a custom command interpreter built on top of Python's Cmd class. I provide it with custom stdin and stdout. For the purpose of this question, it looks like this:When  needs to read from the user, it will do this:I want to provide an SSH interface to my custom interperter using the AsyncSSH library based on . My SSH code is much like the Simple Server sample, which reads a stdin like interface like this (notice the  keyword):I tried a number of things but I can't duck type the SSH code to Cmd's expectation of stdin. What must I do to have my  object use asyncio/coroutines on the inside while providing an old-school, single thread interface to ?
The solution was to patch the  method to make it asyncio aware.This code is a copy of Python's 3.7.2 Cmd class cmdloop function you get if you set set to put  in front of readlineResults in this code (aoicmd.py available as a gist): Where you need to use your Cmd derived class, like , create a new class called  at runtime:Implement  and  as you see fit, but your readline should look like this:
