I am trying to save all entries of  separately in a list but I don't know how to manipulate the output before it is processed.What I am trying to do is generate a list containing the absolute pathnames of all *.csv files in a folder, which can later be used to easily manipulate those files' contents. I don't want to put lots of hardcoded pathnames in the script, as it is annoying and hard to read.Normally I would use a loop with  but in this case I cannot do so, since  just seems to create a "blob" of content. Probably there is an easy solution out there, but my brain won't think of it.
