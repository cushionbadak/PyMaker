If I pass the string  to the built in keyword , the console outputs the literal string . If there is a variable named  with a value of , how do I get the keyword  to output the variable value of  when I pass in ?I'm making a data-driven script from an Excel spreadsheet. In the string values I'm passing in, there are variables names within it that I want replaced with the variable's value.I've tried to run the string through the  keyword, but it just changes all of the variable names like  to , so it's recognizing something here?Would output to the console:I would like this string:To evaluate into this:I would like all variables in the string to translate to their respective value.
Robot has a built-in keyword named Replace variables which will replace variables with their values in a string.
