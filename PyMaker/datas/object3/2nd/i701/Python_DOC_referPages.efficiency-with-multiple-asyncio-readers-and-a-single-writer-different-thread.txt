I would like to combine threading and asyncio with some synchronisation. For example: A thread write-combines frames from a camera into some variable or buffer. Multiple readers (asyncio or threads) are woken on each write to take the latest available frame.I have tried deriving from the  to no avail.Is there a mechanism that does this already (https://github.com/aio-libs/janus?) or how is best to implement it?
you can use asyncio.Queue, however it is not thread safe, just task safe.  If you want thread safe use queue.Queue, however this is not task safe as it will block your thread.  Personally for multiprocess I use a 0MQ Push-Pull Pattern, which feeds to/from a  adapter.
