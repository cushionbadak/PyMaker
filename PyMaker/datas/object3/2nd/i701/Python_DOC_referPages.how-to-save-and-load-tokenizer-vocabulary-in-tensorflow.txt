Natural Text
I've trained a sentiment classifier model using Keras library by following the below steps(broadly).Convert Text corpus into sequences using Tokenizer object/classBuild a model using the model.fit() method Evaluate this modelNow for scoring using this model, I was able to save the model to a file and load from a file. However I've not found a way to save the Tokenizer object to file. Without this I'll have to process the corpus every time I need to score even a single sentence. Is there a way around this?
The most common way is to use either  or . Here you have an example on how to use  in order to save :
The accepted answer clearly demonstrates how to save the tokenizer. The following is a comment on the problem of (generally) scoring after fitting or saving. Suppose that a list  is comprised of two lists  and , where the set of tokens in  is a subset of the set of tokens in  (an optimistic assumption). Then  gives different results for  as compared with first calling  and then .Concrete Example:Results:Of course, if the above optimistic assumption is not satisfied and the set of tokens in Test_text is disjoint from that of Train_test, then test 1 results in a list of empty brackets 
I've created the issue https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/9289 in  the keras Repo. Until the API is changed, the issue has a link to a gist that has code to demonstrate how to save and restore a tokenizer without having the original documents the tokenizer was fit on. I prefer to store all my model information in a JSON file (because reasons, but mainly mixed JS/Python environment), and this will allow for that, even with sort_keys=True 
Another option is to save Tokenizer into JSON format:The data can be loaded using  function from :
