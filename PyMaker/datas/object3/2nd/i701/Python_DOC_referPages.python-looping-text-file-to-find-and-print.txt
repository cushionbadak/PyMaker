Natural Text
This Python code runs but prints the last page of the text file. Not sure why, but I aim to print the whole line of text that is underneath a specified line of text (a line that contains the specific string ** Direct **). How can I loop through a text file, search each line for the specified string, and whenever it is found print the row directly below it? I have searched many online forums and have not found an easily understandable example. I use Python Sypder 2.7. Any help appreciated

You need to make some changes:1.-Read the lines2.- Compare with your text
Check out the  module. It includes the  function, which searches for a pattern inside a string.To print the next line you can take advantage of the fact that file objects are iterable, by using .For example, you could do:By the way, you don't need that final . It is already taken care of by the  statement.
Check if  is in any line in the file and the print the next line as found will be the next lineno file will be set as Contents of file tempPython fileOutput
