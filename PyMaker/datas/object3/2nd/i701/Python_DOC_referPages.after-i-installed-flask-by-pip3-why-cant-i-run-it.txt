After I installed flask by pip3, why can't I run it? How can I run it then? Thanks.
Try as a modulepython -m flask run
Your command does not run, because  expects a file as its argument, and there's not one there (or a directory, check out the documentation linked below).The option  will search the  for the module you pass on, and execute its contents as the  module. Check out the official docs. You might have seen that as an example, where people run  to serve files from their current directory.
