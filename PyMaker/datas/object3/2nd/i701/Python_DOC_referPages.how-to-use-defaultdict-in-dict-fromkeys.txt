I want to count the histogram for a property value(depth here) of 3 different samples with 1 dictionary.This code will make DepthCnt contains 3  of the same one, thus I cannot count different samples.How can I do it right ?It is OK to use either  or .I tested these 3 ways:The memory size are:It seems good to change to .
It sounds like you're trying to count occurences of  in . If so you're looking for a collections.CounterGiven:Counter:Edit:You can always use a counter instead of a defaultdict as wellP.SIf you're working over a large dataset as well take a look into the Counter class both Counter and defaultdict are similar below is the TLDR from this great answer to a question on  vs Counter supports most of the operations you can do on a multiset. So,  if you want to use those operation then go for Counter.Counter won't add new keys to the dict when you query for missing  keys. So, if your queries include keys that may not be present in the  dict then better use Counter.Counter also has a method called most_common that allows you to sort items by their count. To get the same thing in defaultdict you'll have to use sorted.
Use a dictionary expression/comprehension/display
