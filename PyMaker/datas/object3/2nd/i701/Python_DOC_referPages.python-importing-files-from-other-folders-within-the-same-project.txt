New to python and not understanding how imports work. I saw something about how you can do a sys.path.append but I don't want to do this because this needs to go into source control and run off multiple different computers with different pathing. How do I simply import a file that is in another folder but within the same project?My file structure is How do I import FileA.py while inside FileB.py?This doesn't work because I get back 'No Module named FolderA':
Make your subfolders python packagesMake sure that only the root is on the python path. Even better use a standard layout and use pip -e installsSee this for a great layout.Then use absolute imports like import package.subpackage.module or explicit relative ones like import .module
Add  to each directory to turn them into packages.  Then you can use relative imports, such as in fileb.pySee Relative imports for the billionth time for detailed explanation of relative imports and how they work in python.
