Natural Text
I am trying to do what the Title says, Configure the Tkinter message so that each tuple in WL_ratios has its own line without being surrounded in brackets. Creating more messages is not an option as the length of WL_ratios can vary, so i have to only use the one. So far the width=100 is the only thing that is allowing me to get text onto a new line. However this still isnt working because each tuple varies in length so some tuples spread across two lines which isnt what i want. I know you could limit each line by how number of characters but again the tuples vary in character length so i dont think that is an option. Does anyone have any suggestions that could work?
Just convert each tuple into a string, and add  there, and that should do it. Alternatively, you could call each value in the tuple separately, and add  there.
