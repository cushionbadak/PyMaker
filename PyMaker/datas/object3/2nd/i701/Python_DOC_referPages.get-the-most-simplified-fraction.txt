This question already has an answer here:How to convert a decimal number into fraction?                    4 answers                I'm writing a program that uses the  module. I want to get the most simplified fraction of a float. When I try it with numbers like , it works correctly:But when I try it with  or  it displays fractions with very high numerator and denominator, instead of  and .What can I do to be sure that the script will always display the most simplified fraction? Is there any way to do it with  module or another module, or I have to write the function myself?
When you pass  you are passing in a float, so it is already an inexact representation before the  receives the value.Alternatively, if you pass a string instead, you can get the exact value you want:
Try this:See the results:
Try with  module example from the docs:
Pass it as string to get the simplified fraction:
