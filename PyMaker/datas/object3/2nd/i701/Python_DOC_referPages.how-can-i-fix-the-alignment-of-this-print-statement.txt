I'm trying to create a table that loops through various wind speed values in order to compute a table that looks like this:Ideal Run. However once I run the follwing code:I end up with the tables being created, but the alignment on the names of the columns and the actual numerical values is completely off. Here's what it looks like once I run the following code:Actual run. If you could help me fix the alignment, I'd be greatly appreciative. 
You can use String formatting using theFormat Specification Mini-Language.For instance:You get something like that:Or, using a more pythonic loop:
You could just pad with spaces using str.format().In this case, s is the string and width is the entire width of your column.You would define this somewhere in your code, probably under your imports just to get it out of your way, but so long as it is defined before you start calling your print statements.  This would change your print block a little, too:What I did:set width at 13 (your widest column right now is 11)created lists of each row to be printedapplied our function to each item on the listprint the list as a single row using changed from using your own integer tracking using  and  and instead let python iterate over your rows and columns for youWhat you might want to do differently:Use list comprehension to generate your lists (instead of Adjust your column width based on the actual maximum list as below
