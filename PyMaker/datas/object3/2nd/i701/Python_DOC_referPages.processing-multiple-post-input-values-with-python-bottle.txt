In Bottle, let's say I have a form with 10 inputs:I want to then process all the potential inputs and don't want to do this statically by calling each one individually on the POST route (e.g. request.forms.get("one")). Is there a way to process all the inputs in the form. I've been seeing request.params and request.query ...... but don't fully understand how I can use these to get all the input data as either a dictionary or list. When I use the above code, I get an empty dictionaryAny help is appreciated.
 returns a Python Dictionary of all the inputs in the request.So you can process the request dynamically like this
 is an instance of  class. 1When you examine  class with FormsDict subclasses, there is a  method that can be used to retrieve a list containing tuples of field name and value. 2
Just for some additional help. This can now take any form, or query post and combine them into a payload.  The reason for the  is because Bottle technically doesn't return a true dict, instead it is a FormsDict which does not have all the features of a dict in place.  This makes that process simple, and turns everything into a dict.
