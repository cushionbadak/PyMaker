How do I fix these errors? 
Found this comment to this issue on github.async and await are only reserved in 3.7 onwards. Renaming library  files or folders is not a good idea as it both creates inconsistency  in your install and may confuse pip or setuptools if you decide to  upgrade those libraries.It also doesn't help for this issue, where asyncio.async is used.  Modifying asyncio in this way will damage your install and prevent  discord.py, or really any async library, from operating correctly.Use an older version or use the rewrite branch to fix these issues.I don't know what python version you're using for sure but I can assume you're using  and . Either use  or below, or download the re-write.If I remember correctly the  is:You can also get quicker more relevant help on the discord.py server
