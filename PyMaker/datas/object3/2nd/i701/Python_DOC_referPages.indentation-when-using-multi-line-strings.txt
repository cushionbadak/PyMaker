I sometimes need to use multi-line strings, but in a nested block. This works, but the readability is really poor:Using:(as suggested in Pythonic way to create a long multi-line string) is not an option because the string  would be:with unwanted left spaces.Question: how to use multi-line strings in nested blocks with a good readability?
Wrap the string in a call to  and it will clean it up the same way docstrings get cleaned up (removing leading and trailing whitespace, and any level of common indentation). is also an option, but it's uglier, as it requires you to put no text on the first line, and explicitly use a line continuation character to ensure every line (not just the second and onwards) has identical leading indentation:Note that while code blocks on SO don't show it properly,  left the empty final line (from putting the closing  on a line by itself), where  would have removed it.
Have you tried using '\'. For example:
