Natural Text
I have a string and I want to get rid of multiple phrases in one pass.If the phrase starts with "aPPle" or "pEAr" and ends with " f " or " g " (with the space characters), respectively, then I want to replace it with a space. It can have anything between the start and end.I'm stuck on getting re.sub to use the variables and I get . This is probably really simple, I've been unable to find an answer poking around SE.Here are phrases I would removeHere are phrases I would keep (no spaces enclosing ) ( goes with  and pEAr goes with )
Use  to inject values into your pattern, i.e.:You can do a simple  instead but it becomes very unwieldy to deal with such manual concatenation if you want to employ complex patterns.Keep in mind that your end pattern must match exactly for it to work - for example, if your string ends with  (no space at the end), your pattern for  won't work. You can define it's  as  instead to capture such case.
