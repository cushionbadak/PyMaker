Natural Text
I have folder with many .txt files. I want to remove files from this folder which have words 'Best Regards' inside file.I wrote simple loop but I still have problem .Here is my code. 
You can use a check flag.EX:
You need to break the for loop when you find the line containing 'Best Regards'. As you are using a context manager, there is no need to explicitly close the file. The file will be closed when the context manager exits. Then you can delete the file
Get used to using pathlib.  Also you want to make sure you want to delete the files,  you do that by building up a list of files you want to delete first (reviewing them to make sure the logic of the statement is correct) then axing them.  Documentation
