I have tried a to modify this to: loop through the subfolderson the walk, test when the new parent folder is in the original list of subfolders, then branch into an if statementbut without success.  I feel this should be easy, but I am new to python and cannot figure it out.  Any help would be much appreciated.

You can first get all of the sub directories in the root directory using  and putting a check with :And then iterate over all the sub-directories again using  to get files in them. You can use  to check for only files:
