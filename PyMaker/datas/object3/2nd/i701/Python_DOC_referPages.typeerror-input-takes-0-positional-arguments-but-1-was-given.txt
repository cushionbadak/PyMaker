I am writing a Python program to measure the time complexity of insertion sort. However, I got the above mentioned error on line number 6. This error also occurs during other{  int(inputs)  }. Any help would be great,thanks. My code is:
Note these 2 lines of your code:andIn the first of them you redefined the built-in function  (which accepts  or  parameter) with your own with the same name (which accepts only  parameters, i. e. none).So in the second of them you called NOT the built-in function  - as you wanted - but your own one, and as you callded it with  parameter (), you got a relevant error.Choose an other name for defining your  function - and then use that name for calling it, too.
