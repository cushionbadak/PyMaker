I need to use both python2.7 and python3.6 for a task. I used conda to create two python envs. I know how to use a shell script to control the code running and switch between different envs. Say I need to run python2.7 code first, then I run python 3.6. My question is could I first run python 2.7 code, and then in the python 2.7 code, I directly activate the python3.6 conda env, and run the python 3.6 code? 
For your task maybe it is enough to change the environment just calling the shell from python using:Maybe you need to add some extra code to take the outputs or new inputs if there areand continue running the code.If that doesn't work maybe is easier to call the python 3.6 function direct from the command:Or also using the function subprocess.call from your 2.7 code:Using Python 3.6 you can also use the subprocess.run()
