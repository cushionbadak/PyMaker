I am trying to make my code executable via terminal with certain arguments passed to it. I could not find any questions or answers dealing with a similar situation. The problem is that the order in which the arguments are processed is also a little ambiguous. I tried giving all the options but then it says the -p option requires integer vales and discards the one provided right after -p. Instead, it is pointing at the hostname provided as the reason for failure.The python script should execute when I run the following:In this, if -p and hostname are not provided, the program should take default values. But the message must be provided.I have tried using argparse and tried topers all arguments and reuse them in the code but the order in which they are then is completely messed up. The expected result is that the code should execute if the user inputs any of the following:It should show help text if: The message is missing-p is given but no valid int value is given.In all other cases, it should substitute default values. (Say, google.com for hostname, port number 22)  
welcome to Stack Overflow :)The following should be sufficient for your needs.The help text now looks like:If you haven't already, checkout the official argsparse docs for more detailed information where all the options are covered.
