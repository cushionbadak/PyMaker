I am trying to create a program to find the largest power of two less than or equal to a given number.Given below is the code I have made for it:It seems to work only with odd numbers (the else statement part) and does not output anything when an even number is entered.I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong here.
Why should you treat odd and even numbers differently?To me it seems the algoritm for odd numbers works fine for both:
Start with , and multiply that by two as long as the result is less than your input:
Using a loop is a very inefficient way to solve this problem.Notice that the required exponent is one less than the length of the  in binary.An efficient way to find the answer is thus to use int.bit_length().
One way to solve this is to evaluate each power of two and check if it is less or equal to a given boundary.Note that you have to return  since the loop stops only if  and this only the case if  is actually greater than .
