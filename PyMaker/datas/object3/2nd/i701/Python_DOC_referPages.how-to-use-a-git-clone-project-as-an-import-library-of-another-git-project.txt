I have two cloned git projects in my directory, myProject and OpenSourceProject. I did a pip install of OpenSourceProject so that I could use it as a dependency within myProject, for example:However, I recently cloned OpenSourceProject from GitHub with the sole purpose of modifying some code (fixing bugs and etc). It is now in the same directory as my other git cloned project, myProject. Is it possible for me to import the modified git instead of still using the pip install version? And how can I do that?
1st, you still can  the modified version; just  to the cloned directory and run Or you can modify  to point to the cloned code. See the tutorial on how Python finds modules to import. Change  in your scripts or environment variable  before running the scripts.
