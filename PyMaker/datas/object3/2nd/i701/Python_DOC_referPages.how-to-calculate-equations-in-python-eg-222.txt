This question already has an answer here:Multiplication in Python                    7 answers                can anyone give me the code needed to calculate sums and equations in python?E.g 2*2*2I have tried things such as Print "2*2*2"and suchnothing gave me an answer
Either don't pass it as string like:Python 3Python 2Or use eval function, like:
First of all, check your Python version, by running .In Python 2.x,  can be called without parentheses, but one of the main changes in Python 3.x is that  requires them.Python is a dynamic language, where types are inferred from their use. "2*2*2" is a string type, that depending on your version you can be printed by using either , or .The returned data types can sometimes be confusing
Check out pythonâ€™s built-in math library: 
In the python shell (type  in terminal or cmd), type to print the result.You can also type and it will print  again.This should work. Write the same line in a script and it will work too. However, in a script, you can't just type 2*2*2 to print the results, you need to use .If instead of writnig 2*2*2, you need to do something like 1+2+3+4+5, which is a sum on a list like , simply writeIf you want to do the sum of some elements in a dictionary like  on the element from 3 to 5 inclusively, do
