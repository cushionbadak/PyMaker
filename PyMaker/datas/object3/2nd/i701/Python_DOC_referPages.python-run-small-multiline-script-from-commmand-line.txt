I have a bunch of very small python scripts that I want to run from the command line. Here is one such example:I am abundantly aware that I could save this as a python script (e.g. ) and run the script like this:However, in compiling a library, I have a lot of these small scripts, and would just like to concatenate these into a single shell script. I just can't figure out the syntax. I thought that the shell script should look like this: But when I run this I get the error:What am I missing here? 
It would be better to put them in a Python module say  as functions and use  as the command to call them.Then you would have a place to put common code and you'd be able to open the file and get Python syntax highlighting.
I was waaaay overthinking it. This works
I would recommend collecting the functions into a proper Python module (as per Dan D's answer) somewhere on your .Instead of calling  in the shell script however, I would suggest calling the functions in a single Python script, avoiding shell script altogether:
