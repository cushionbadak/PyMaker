I am trying to write a game that generates a random integer and the user has to guess it.The problem is that if the user input is not a digit it crashes. So I tried to use , and it works at the beginning, but if the user decides to input not a number after the first input was a digit, it still crashes. I don't know how to make it check  for every input.
I would suggest doing the following:
If your code crashed because the user entered not a number, then either make sure the user enters a number, or handle an error while trying to compare it with a number.You could go over all chars in the input and ensure that they are all digits.Or you could use a  mechanism. That is, try to convert to the numerical type you wish the user to enter and handle any error throwen. Check this post:How can I check if a string represents an int, without using try/except?And also:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
The typical pythonic way to tackle that would be to "ask for forgiveness instead of looking before you leap". In concrete terms, try to parse the input as , and catch any errors:Beyond that, the problem is obviously that you're doing the careful checking once at the start of the program, but not later on when asking for input again. Try to reduce the places where you ask for input and check it to one place, and write a loop to repeat it as often as necessary:

In your code you want to check whether the user has input no or string since your not using int() in your input it will take input as string and furthur in your code it wont be able to check for <= condition for checking input no is string or nocode:-
also you can check the eval of the inputed string with eval function
You probably will have to learn how to do functions and write your own input function.
