This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I'm creating a function that receives a number between 1 and 5 (likert scale), from a question. When the user inputs a wrong INT my loop is ok, the question repeats. But i want the question to repeat if the user inputs a string too. But in that case the program crashes "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10" 
 always returns an integer, so  will always be true. If the user types something that isn't a valid integer,  will signal an error.Use  to handle the error if the user enters something that isn't an integer.You don't need , since the condition is just the opposite of the  condition; use . You also don't need , since it's at the end of the loop and it's just going to continue anyway.
Instead of trying to abstract the input as  right off the bat, do this instead:
You cast L to int before checking its type. So when L is a string, your program tries to cast it to int and it crashes. You should do numerical operations only when you are sure that L is not a string. The solution is either to use try and catch or to handle it with an if statement.
