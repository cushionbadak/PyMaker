I've got class A and its inner class BThey're in different files(suppose a.py and b.py)I need to change A.x in method of class B without sending "self". I.e. self.inner = B() and not self.inner = B(self). I can't send "self" because class A is in generated file that I mustn't touch.How do I do it?That's how I'd do it if I could send self
You could try that with the  module (although as @Slam advises, it's far from being recommended):
I believe you can so dome black magic with  module.But I advise you re-thinking if you really need this, and why. Because this is good example of breaking the ideas of OOP and sane architecture overall â€” outer scopes should not be altered until they're explicitly providing you a handle to do so. In case you're not following this idea, you'll get super-tightly coupled code.
