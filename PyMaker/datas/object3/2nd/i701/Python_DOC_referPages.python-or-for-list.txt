In Python you can do which will printCan you do the same with a list? I.e. is there a Python function  so that the following will also print ?Note that  is not printed.
You can use  or  to find the first truthy value from a list:The  function takes both a filter function, and an iterable, and returns an iterator that of the values from the iterable that pass the filter.But when you set the filter function to , then it is essentially the same thing as using  as the filter function, so only values that are true are allowed through. The  function then gives you the first such value.Demo:You may want to add the last value in  as a default for the  call, in case there are only falsey values;  would at least produce  if none of the values are truthy, so the following does too:Using  is a fraction faster than  because the  implementation tests for  before it tests for ; this speed difference is very small and barely measurable (within a margin of error):
You can use the function  with the operator  in the  function:
