I've made an address book app using MySQL in PHP but now I want to make it in Python using a text file. Is it possible to perform CRUD operations with a text file instead of a database?
You can use the shelve module that's in the Python standard library. It basically gives you a dictionary that is easy to save to a file. However, you don't get a lot of relational database features like joining tables; it's just a key-value dictionary.The documentation for it is at https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.htmlThis doesn't really scale as well as using a database though.
