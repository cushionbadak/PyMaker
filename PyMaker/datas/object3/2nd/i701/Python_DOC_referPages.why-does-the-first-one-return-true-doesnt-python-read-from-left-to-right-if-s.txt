Natural Text
I don't understand why the first one is true, does it short circuit when it sees True or?
In Python,  has a higher precedence than , meaning that  will bind first (search for  in the following section of the Python documentation, for example(1)).Hence your two statements are equivalent to (despite your incorrect assertion that Python reads left to right):And, regardless of what the result of the parenthesised sub-expression in those two expressions above, ing that with  will give .(1) The relevant parts of that link (the explanatory text and the initial part of the table) are included below for completeness, with my emphasis:The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python, from lowest precedence (least binding) to highest precedence (most binding). Operators in the same box have the same precedence. Unless the syntax is explicitly given, operators are binary. Operators in the same box group left to right (except for exponentiation, which groups from right to left).
Thanks to PM 2Ring's comment:  has higher precedence than . So Python will execute  first, soThe first one is like this:result of  is  and  is .The second one is like this:result of  is again  and  is .
