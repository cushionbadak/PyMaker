I'm a bit confused what you exactly want to achieve. But if you want to replace  in every match of pattern , then you can use backreferences to groups.For example, modify pattern so that you can reference the groups . Now group#1 refers to the part before  and group#2 refers to part after . So the replacement string looks like this -  - where  is group#1 and  is group#2.The output: You also can use function to define replacement. For more check in documentation.
