I've been trying to break a loop which is meant to look for a file in a certain location. My intention is to make my script look for that file for a certain time and then break whether the file is found or not but I can't get any idea.How can I make the script wait for a certain time and then break when the time is up?This is my script at this moment:

Calculate the elapsed time by doing  minus  by using  function and assign a variable ( in this code) which will be modified and check whether the file exist or not and use it for the loop.As below:

As roganjosh commented, it would be simpler if you used time stamps. I have added relevant code below:
Here's how to do it with the  class. These can be configured to delay a specified amount of time and the call as function of your choosing.
To check for the availability of a file in a certain location you can try the following. The script will break as soon as the file is found otherwise it will wait upto 5 seconds for the file to be available before breaking.
