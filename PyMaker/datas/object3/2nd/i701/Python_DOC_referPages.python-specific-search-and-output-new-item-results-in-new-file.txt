I'm trying to learn python :) and sorry if it is a really noob question. I tried to search but couldn't find exactly what i was looking for.I'm trying to compare 2 files. but not just straight foward like this. I want something more precisethere will be more then 200 name entry and i need to extract new entries from file 2let say file one has those entry:some random text -Name: Item_01_01- some random textsome random text -Name: Thing_01_01- some random text  and file 2 hassome random text -Name: Item_01- some random textsome random text -Name: Thing_01- some random textsome random text -Name: Object_02- some random text  I want to do something that will compare the 2 files and extract the new item in file 2so i want the info Object_02 appear in my output filesearching the info into -Name: XXXXX- I know how to read file and write files in python, it the info i'm not sure how to get it.And yes file 1 has more number at then ends of each itemsI hope it's clear (sorry English not my main language)Thanks a lot in advance for help.
Well assuming the order in which it is written does not matter, I think the most effective way to do this is to use a set to store values from bothfiles and then write it over to file 2.Here is my code.
here is the final working result of my code. I had to adjust it to make sure that my file2 don't get that extra weird space that I was not awarded of. I did some custom adjustment so it work nicely with my needs.instead if using name i used ID that are 16 digit numbers.Thanks to @davedwards for precious helpthe code:
