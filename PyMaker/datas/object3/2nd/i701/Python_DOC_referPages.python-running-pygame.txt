I created a simple game using Pygame. Is it possible to run this game on other computer, where Pygame is not installed? I tried to write a BATCHT file, which installs Pygame using pip. But it isn't working too. 
To make your game run in other computer where there is no pygame installed you need to make it executable. Following package can make your script executable:pyinstallerpy2exeTutorialConverting to executable using pyinstallerConverting to executable using py2exePyinstaller is way more easier than py2exe. But both of them works like a charm!
Maybe you could try to build a dist, in case your target system is linux based (.rpm or .deb). You find a detailed description here:https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/builtdist.html
Try auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/)With this you can pack the whole thing into an exe.It supports everything above python 2.7
