I have two dataframes which both have a 'Date Time' column, the first dataframe has the data as , the second dataframe has the data as .When I run df['Date Time'].apply(pd.Timestamp) I get the following:The first dataframe becomes , which is correct. But the second dataframe becomes  which is incorrect (the month and the date are in the wrong order).I've had a look at the documentation and can't see a way to specify the order of the month/date. Has anyone come across this before? 
Perhaps a better way is using pd.to_datetime. For your second dataframe the code is going to be:Proof:Prepare you case:Convert:PSShould you be insisting on using  the code will be:but I never seen this in practice.
