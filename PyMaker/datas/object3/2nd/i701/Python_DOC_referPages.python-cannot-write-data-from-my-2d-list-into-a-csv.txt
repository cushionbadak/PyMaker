I am trying to write the contents of two lists to two respective CSVs in Python. The contents of the CSVs are meant to be wiped before being written to, which works, however I am unable to write to the CSVs successfully without an error or nothing writing to them at all.I have tried code such as "invWrite = csv.writer(open("INVENTORY.csv",'at'), delimiter=',')" and using "writerows" as well as trying "invWrite = open("INVENTORY.csv","at")" and using "write" however it all appears to not work, my csv either wiping (when I use the "w" method instead of "at") or staying the same.Trying to utilise "map()" and doing playerWrite.writerows(map(str,x)) causes the following error:simply typing playerWrite.writerow(x) provides a similar issue as my original problem - the csv is wiped (which is intended and due to the fact I originally called the write function with the "w" method) but nothing is written to it.I will show the relevant code here, the first half is the lists being written from the CSVs and the latter half being the code for rewriting the CSVs. playerInv is a 2D list.the writing part:Here is the contents of playerInv (list), passed from INVENTORY.csv before it was wiped:[['prisoner rags', '1'], ['training greatsword', '1'], ['battle  spinner', '1'], ['granny smiths', '1'], ['skeleton key', '1'],  ['bread', '1']] #this is a 2D list.and here is playerInfo:['playerName', '500'] #normal listtl;dr - I have tried a combination of different methods to call/define my csv writing function and tried a number of ways to write to my csv (write,writerow,etc.) however I am unable to find a way to write my list to my csv. If anyone could solve this issue or provide context as to how I could solve it, it would be much appreciated.
Keep in mind that there exist two different methods of csvwriter:  and .as I heard only string values could be written to a CSVYes, but as documentation says, you should feed  with sequence of s, that might be  of s - look at example provided for .I can't be 100% sure without looking at  content, but I think your code for writing should be:please check if that would help.
No longer require a solution to this problem, able to write to CSV however every character is separated by a comma. I will do my own research into this. Thank you Daweo for referring me to the documentation.
