I am trying to perform operations on a particular combinations of a dataframe but my code is running not according to my thinking and I don't think I have done some visible error.Here , I am changing the value of  and  to  so that the loop enters only once inside the if else condition and if both the criteria are met then it breaks the loop. is a dataframe , information about which I guess should be irrelevant.Its output is printing  multiple times which should not happen.Am I doing some very fundamental mistake or it something more deep error, I am unable to figure out?Edit:I pasted indentation wrong , Now I pasted it correctly.
your parenthesis are wrong.Check the following code:Output:validif you want to have the conditions properly verified, use:Output:invalidor in your case:check the operator precedence in python to know which one will be evaluated first
since you got the answer alreadyI say you could refactor last conditional block of code using logical AND operator to check instead of 0+0.for more assurance, you could print check1 and check 10 values at end of the loop to evaluate for each iteration
