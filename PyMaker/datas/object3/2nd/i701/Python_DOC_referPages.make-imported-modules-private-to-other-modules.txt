Suppose I have a code like this in module And I have a module  written like this:I will see that the code runs fine and that when using autocomplete in most IDEs, I found that  is accessible. I want to make  private so that only  code can see that variable.I don't want  to be able to access .What is a good approach to make this possible?Why do I want  to be inaccessible? Because I want it to not show in the autocomplete when I type  and press Tab in Jupyter Lab. It hides what the modules can do because there are so many imports that I use in my module.
The solution is the same as for "protected" attributes / methods in a class (names defined in a module are actually - at runtime - attributes of the module object): prefix those names with a single leading underscore, ieNote that this will NOT prevent someone to use , but at least it makes it quite clear that he is using a protected attribute.
I see 2 approaches here:more user-friendly solution: change alias names to "underscored" onesthis will not prevent from importing it, but it will say to user that this are implementation details and one should not depend on them.preferred-by-me solution: do nothing, leave it as it is, use semver and bump versions accordingly.
