I coded an algorithm and it worked properly till 2 weeks ago. I get this warning and I cannot understand why I get it. The warning is:"C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/Python/sezg_1_diffne.py:147:  DeprecationWarning: Calling np.sum(generator) is deprecated, and in  the future will give a different result. Use  np.sum(np.from_iter(generator)) or the python sum builtin instead.  obje_1=detmas.objVal+sum(hopen[i]*fixedCost for i in Fset)"A part of my code is:I tried something which I found in internet such as removing numpy and reinstall it. However these solutions did not work for my code. How I can solve it? Thanks in advance...
Don't import  from . Look for  or  in your code and delete those lines. Otherwise, you will override the built-in .  and built-in  are independent functions with different requirements.The warning suggests while your code may work now, it may not work in the future. Notice you do in fact use a generator implicitly. These lines are equivalent:In Python, extra parentheses are not required to explicitly denote a generator. Your error will disappear when you avoid importing  from the NumPy library.
