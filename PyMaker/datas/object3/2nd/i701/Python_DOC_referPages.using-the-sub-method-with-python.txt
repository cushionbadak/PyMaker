I would like to replace text in a file using a regexp and Python. Using  I can can do something like this on the command lineWhich basically takes looks for a string of ip=[4 octets] and replaces the last two with xx.The input file would look likeThe desired output file looks likeI need to put this into a Python script I am usingHow can I use the  method to achieve what I want to do? I need to pass 3 arguments to this method and can only think of how to pass 2, I don't know what that third argument should be
Minimal required change to you code would be: only defines what to match.  has an argument of what to substitute with.You can either call  which takes three required arguments: what to match, what to replace it with, which string to work on. Or as in the example above when you already have a precompiled regex, you can use its  method in which case need to say what to replace with and what string to work on.
