I'm trying to find keywords within a sentence, where the keywords are usually single words, but can be multi-word combos (like "cost in euros"). So if I have a sentence like  it would find  in that sentence and return true.For this, I was using this code:where  is the input and  is an array of phrases that match a keyword (like for cost in euros, it's ). However, I noticed that it was also triggering on word parts. For example, I had a match phrase of  and a sentence of . I'd not expect this to return true, but it does, since it apparently finds the  in . How do I get this to only check whole words? Originally I was doing this keyword search with a list of words (essentially doing  and checking those), but that doesn't work for multi-word keyword aliases.
This should accomplish what you're looking for:Output:Basically, we're grabbing all matches, using pythons  module as our test, including cases where multiple s occur in a given , using a compound , then using  to trim duplicates from the , then using  to coerce the  back into a .Refs:Lists:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-listsList comprehensions:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionsSets:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#setsre (or regex):https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re
