Natural Text
I am new to Python and still don't understand all of it and its functionality but I am getting close to what I am trying to achieve. Essentially I have got the programme to scrape the data I want from the website but when it is printing selected words/items from the "specs" string it is also printing characters such as [ ] and '' from the string. The example is that I am trying to just get the 'gearbox' type, 'fuel' type and 'mileage' from a list of li's which i have converted to a string with the plant to then select the specific item from that string. What I am getting with the current programme is this:['Manual']['Petrol']['86,863 miles']What I would like to achieve is a printed result like this:Manual, Petrol, 86,863 miles Which when exported to separate columns in my .csv should show up in their correct columns under the appropriate headings. I have tried .text to remove just the text but it shows up with the 'list' object has no attribute 'text' error. 
Welcome to StackOverflow!So there's a lot to improve from your script. You are getting there! is a generator  resolved into a list. Effectively, you get to access by index the things you want. For example,  can simply be .The issue that you get extra  and  is caused by your use of slicing . From the documentation, indexing returns an item, slicing returns a new list. See lists introduction.(Optional) And finally, to get all those information in a single line, you can do multiple assignments from the specs list. See multiple assignments.Bonus tip When in doubt, use pdb.Good luck! And enjoy Python!
if you want to get the string from the list maybe you can do thisbut this way or aldnav answer will give false result even throw an errorValueError: not enough values to unpackUsually I will extract parent container first, not select the child () then go to the parent.
