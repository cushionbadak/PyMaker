Flask + Sqlalchemy + WTFormsCode was working perfectly before, now with zero change I am receiving an error saying:job = {"name": form.command.data.filename[:-3],AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'filename'Which of course is very confusing as it has been working perfectly and very much had the attribute filename until this morning. Below i've attached the form code and relevant view creation code, some info redacted for security. Form Code:View creation code:From personal research I see there was a solution some time ago that required form = Form(request.form) to become form = Form(), however as you can see that is not the issue here.I am quite confused and any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much in advance.
I'd advise you to take a look at Filefield documentation or even source code to see that in Filefield there would be no  attribute, but actual sent file name would be in , so  in your case.P.S. Also, removing last 3 symbols is a bad way to get rid of file extension, use stdlib os.path.splitext instead.
