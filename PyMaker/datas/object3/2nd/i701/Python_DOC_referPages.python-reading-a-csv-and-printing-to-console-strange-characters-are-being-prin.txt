Natural Text
I am reading from a csv file and printing to console in Python. The first printed line is including some odd characters at the beginning of the string. The file in its entirety is:My code is:the output is:I do not know where the "ï»¿" in the first line is coming from.
The "ï»" is a byte order mark (BOM), which is used at the beginning of some Unicode files or streams to indicate the "endianness" of multi-byte encoding variants (UTF-16 or UTF-32), or, like in this case, to indicate that the file is using UTF-8. Using a BOM at the beginning of a UTF-8 file is optional, but some applications -- like Microsoft Excel -- will use a BOM to indicate that the file is using UTF-8.If you're using Python 3 and you know that your file will be using UTF-8, you should be able to just add the encoding when you open the file:Here's the Python documentation on this:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#reading-and-writing-unicode-data
