I'm trying to rename the file names and extensions of all the files in a directory and move them to a new directory. I've read multiple post on how to do it but for some reason I haven't been successful and I've been stuck on this for 3 days now and feel like I'm doing something careless. Somebody get me on track please. This is the latest way I've been trying.When I run the code above I get the message:If it matters, I'm  using macOS Mojave, version 10.14.2.
I tried replicating the same using Python 3 on Mojave 10.14.2. Use the paths starting from , and don't include . The code runs perfectly when both  and  exist. I got a similar error when  was removed, and the error message also specified the paths I passed as parameters.If that's what you're experiencing, ensure that the directory you're trying to move the file to exists before calling . This can be done in Python itself by using the  method. Since it throws an error if the directory already exists, you can check that by using the  method.
this is the code that worked. I think the problem was that i was trying to change a non-audio file to a .wav and the system was rejecting it.
