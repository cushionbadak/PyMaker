Trying to understand a regex example in python and here is my codeIn the output it shows the strings and the seperators, the last seperetor is a comma with five spaces not just a commaIf the seperator was just a comma, shouldn't the output be like this?
 splits the provided string by the pattern, returning what you capture in parentheses as part of the results.In this case your regular expression matches "a semi-colon, a comma, or a whitespace character (which is captured and returned) followed by 0 or more whitespace characters (which are discarded)". As a result the whitespace after the comma in your example is consumed when the comma is matched and is not present in your output.
If capturing groups are used in the regex, then  includes the contents of the captured groups. However, it still uses the whole match as the separator, which leads to the behavior you observed. If you want  to be equal to the original string, you'll need to capture the entire separator (and use non-capturing parens where you've got parens now: ).
I would recommend splitting on the following pattern:This says to split on optional whitespace and either comma or semicolon separator, followed by one or more spaces.The problem with your current pattern is that it leaves space optional, if a comma/semicolon separator be present.  This is resulting in spaces appearing as matched terms.
