I see I can color things using  and .I'd like to color my numbers using Python formatters:where the number is green if  otherwise red.What's the most pythonic way to achieve this?
I don't believe there's anything you can easier/better that colorama or custom wrapper (take a look for this question for reference).The reason is that python doesn't have great extensibility with string templates/formatting. Terminal output should be escape sequences, and there's no other way around, so you need to modify your output somehow.One-timer with f-strings may me like:If your case allows this, perfect thing would be encapsulating logic to value class (roughly, if you can use subclass of int/float), so you can provide  spec with support for coloring.If you cant, you'll probably end up with wrapper around print.
