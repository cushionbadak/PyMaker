I want to replace a list of strings with a single string in a pythonic way. To clarify what I mean, this code does what I want:I would have imagined though, that would have done the trick. But the  method only accepts a string as input. Is there a more pythonic way (I imagine, a way without a  cycle) to perform this operation?Thanks in advance!
On solution could be to use regular expression (see ):note: I modified the replacement string to  to show a case leading to a different output
