IÂ´m trying to write a python interface with C-API for my application.I can create a module and add procedures and import them in the python context. Then I can run python scripts to access the module and procedures.I would like to use a key to access data like:module.someVar['key'] = valueor print(module.someVar['key'])Then I would like to use the key and the data in a proceure in the C-Code.What procedure is called in the pyTypeObject?Edit: SomeVar is a variable of a type which it seems like I have to create. And yes, after the comments, it is a dict-like object. It seems that the first answer points me right point, I am currently testing it.
