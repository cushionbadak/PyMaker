 is a Python builtin that gives a unique ID for an object. I would guess that you did not intend to pass it  on this line:The calling convention for this functions seems to be that it is meant to be an integer for the primary key in a database table. Figure out where you should be getting your primary key from and set it correctly.Pro-tip: avoid using names that are predefined by Python (see here for a full list). It can lead to headaches like the one you just had.
