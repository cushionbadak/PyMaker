I'm trying to save a date in my sessions. I always receive the error . I found this here in the Django documentation: How can I save my  as seconds instead of datetime?
Either write your own session serialiser to allow you to serialise  objects directly, or store the  value in some other form.If you want to save it as seconds, then use the  method:Your own  class only needs to provide  and  methods, directly analogous to  and  (which is how the standard JSON serializer is implemented).If you want to encode  objects and be able to transparently turn those back into  objects again, I'd use a nested object format to flag such values as special:and set  to the full qualified name of the above module ().The above uses the  method, new in Python 3.7.
