Im gonna include the description of the task this code is supposed to do in case someone needs it to answer me.When the code is tested with a file which contains "123", then everything works fine. When the website loads in another file to test this code, following error occurs:So Im guessing the error occurs inside the first  statement, but i don't understand why. If an error occurs when the value inside a file is being converted to float, shouldnt the code just go to the second  statement ? And in the second  it would be converted to string, which will work anyway ? I'm guessing i misunderstand something about how  works. Sorry for long post.
No, only one of those  blocks -- the first one matching the exception -- will be executed. The behavior you are describing would correspond to
shouldnt the code just go to the second except statement ?Nope: this "flat" try/except statement works only for the first  block. If an exception occurs there, the  branches catch this exception and straight away evaluate the appropriate block. If an exception occurs in this block, it's not caught by anything, because there's no  block there.So, you'd have to do a whole lot of nested try/except statements:You may need to add an extra level of nesting.This is terribly inefficient in terms of the amount of code you'll need to write. A better option might be:Note that if you do , a new line will be read on each iteration (or, in your case, in any new try/except block), which may not be what you need.
