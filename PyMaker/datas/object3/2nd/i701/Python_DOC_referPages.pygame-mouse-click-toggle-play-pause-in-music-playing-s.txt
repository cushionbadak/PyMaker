I am trying to make a music playing system. I have made a class called Circle which defines the button and their attributes which has a method called click() that detects whether the particular area in the screen is clicked or not.I want to toggle the play and pause buttons when I click. My logic:Since both the play and pause buttons lies on the same co-ordinates the method clik() returns true for both and both the if statements executes as a result of which the music pauses after some time it is being played. How do I solve this issue?
