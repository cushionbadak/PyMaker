In the following code in python:Why print(a[b]) can be executed but an error message is shown for print(c[b])?
This type of indexing only works for  and  is just a python  so you can't index it like . You can convert it to numpy array first then use your indexing.
In python, list accepts integer based index.To executeOutput of the above codeThe C list is being iterated from index 2 to index 3. As python iterated upto end-1 index.E.g c[2:4] only index 2 and index 3 will be considered.
When you use bracket on an object like this:You are calling the function  of the class of the object a with b as the argument. See this for more detailed of the function.Now if  does not show an error while  raises one this means that the implementation of the method  for the class of  is handling the type of  and the implementation of this method for the class of  does not. This behaviour is exactly the same for every functions, the call is just a bit hidden.
