This is a common issue as referenced here : https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5221You are trying to use the pip, which is shipped with the Debian system. You better try to avoid using that pip at any cost.Please use  instead of the system pip which you have in the debian system.I also recommend using venv - virtual environments for keeping your system environment safe.
