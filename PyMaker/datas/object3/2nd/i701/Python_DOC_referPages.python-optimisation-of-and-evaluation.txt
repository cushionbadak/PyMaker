This question already has an answer here:Does Python support short-circuiting?                    3 answers                In Python 3, I have to check that 3 conditions are not happening in a function parameter, so, I created 3 functions:So, there are 3 functions, one of them iterating a string, an operation that is very heavy potentially. But, if one function returns already False, it is not necessary to check the remaining ones, we know the logical AND will return False, being able to make this less computationally expensive.So, I am wondering if Python (CPython or other implementations) is optimizing this, therefore, the usage of  is right, or if it would be better to check these functions one by one and returning False as soon as the first of them is False, having a more optimal but, maybe, less readable solution.How this expression is being evaluated in Python?I tried to find the answer to this question googling for it and also in this site
It's called  and, Yes, Python does support it:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not
 will not evaluate  or  if  already returns . will not evaluate  if  already returns .You will find that this is how bool operators work in almost all C-like languages.
