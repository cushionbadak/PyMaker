You are given a dictionary of the US states and their capitals. The keys in the dictionary are states and the values are capital names.Write a code to return a list of all capitals that contain the name of a state in their name as a substring.HINT: For example, Indiana as a capital name and Indianapolis as a state name is one of the key/value pairs that your code would find. Your code should add Indianapolis to the list. After you found all capitals and added them to the list, print out the listRun this cell to create a dictionary of states' capitalsCode:
Oh, I got it. I missunderstood your question.This will be work.This will return 
If would go for the following:The inner list contains the list of states that appear in the capital we are currently iterating over in the outer list. If this list is not empty current captial is added to the list of outputs.You can yield the same results by sequencing the same logic with normal  statements.
Use map to find the list of matching capitals.filter 'None' entries.Output:Output:
You can use list comprehension to do the same thing that you code currently does. This:can be converted into a list comprehension just by observation.The above is equivalent to your code. If you don't know list comprehensions, I suggest getting familiar with the concept.This code calls  twice, so there is yet another improvement possible: iterate over the  of the dictionary, which is covered in Yuda's answer.
For Python 2.x:For Python 3.x:Result:
Iterate through your dictionary and check if the value contains the key in it i.e. if key is sub-string of value.
