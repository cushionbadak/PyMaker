When installing gcloud for mac I get this error when I run the  command according to docs here:I poked through and echoed out some stuff in the install shell script. It is setting the environment variables correctly (pointing to my default python installation, pointing to the correct location of the gcloud SDK).If I just enter the python interpreter (using the same default python that the install script points to when running ) I can import the module just fine:Only other information worth noting is my default python setup is a virtual environment that I create from python 2.7.15 installed through brew. The virtual environment python bin is first in my PATH so  and  and  all invoke the correct binary. I've had no other issues installing packages on this setup so far.If I echo the final line of the install.sh script that calls the install.py script it shows  which is the correct python. Or am I missing something?
The script uses the  command-line switch, which disables loading the  module on start-up.However, it is a custom dedicated  module installed in a virtualenv that makes a virtualenv work. As such, the  switch and virtualenvs are incompatible, with  set fundamental imports such as  break down entirely.You can either remove the  switch from the  command or use a wrapper script to strip it from the command line as you call your real virtualenv Python.
I had the error below when trying to run gcloud commands.If you have your  sourced automatically you can specify the environment variable  i.e.  to not use the  .
