if there is a dictionary: in python 3, i would like to convert this dictionary key to a string and its value to another string:Some attempts:Any easy solution? Thank you!
Use :You can use  ( for python 2), it returns pairs of keys and values, and you can simply pick its first.I converted  to a list, and picked its  index, you can also convert it into an iterator, and pick its first using :Use  and :You can also use  to retrieve all of the dictionary keys, and pick its first key. And use  to retrieve all of the dictionary values:Here, you can use  too:Ensure getting a :The above methods don't ensure retrieving a string, they'll return whatever is the actual type of the key, and value. You can explicitly convert them to :Now, both , and  are . Although actual value in dict was an .Disclaimer: These methods will pick first key, value pair of dictionary if it has multiple key value pairs, and simply ignore others. And it will NOT work if the dictionary is empty. If you need a solution which simply fails if there are multiple values in the dictionary, @SylvainLeroux's answer is the one you should look for.

Make lists of keys and values:then make variables:
At this point, you can use a destructuring assignement to get your values:One advantage in this solution is it will fail in case of  containing several entries, instead of silently ignoring the issue.Finally, if you need to ensure  and  to be strings, you may add a list comprehension:
