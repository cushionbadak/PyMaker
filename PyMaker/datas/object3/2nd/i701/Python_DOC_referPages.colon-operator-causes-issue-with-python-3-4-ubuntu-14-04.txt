My Python code is successfully working with Python 3.6 on Ubuntu 18.04. However, it gives  the following syntax error when I moved to the Ubuntu 14.04& Python 3.4:Did something changed between Python3.4 and  3.6? I also want to know the meaning of the colon(:) operator for such a case. I added 'if' at the front of the problematic line, and seems that syntax issue was solved, but I don't think that author of the code meant an 'if' statement there. By the way, the line was taken from the constructor part of a Python class.
Type hinting come up with Python 3.5 (please see Python 3.5 changelog).So, yes you have to remove the  stuff.
