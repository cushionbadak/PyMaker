I'm having an issue with matching exactly one colon towards the tail end of a timestamp value. I want to match this colon exactly and then convert to a period. I have tried several ways to try to match this colon exactly, but to no avail.Here's an example: 02:44:05:406 -> 02:44:05.406I created the following regex: :\d+$ -> this will match :406 towards the end of the timestamp.I tried a different approach: \d+:\d+$ -> this matches 02:44, 44:05, 05:406I even tried this one: [^\d+] -> this matches all three colons :However, I want the last colon - 02:44:05:406 and replace that with a "."Any ideas on how to do this? I'm using Python 3 and regex.EDIT: Removing ** from the third colon (e.g. :) to avoid confusion.
If regex is not mandatory, you could just use  with  option:
You need this as your regexMatch as many characters as possible up to the last  and capture themThen your substitution should be all the stuff captured followed by a dotso your code looks like
You can use str.rpartition to split the string on the final colon, then str.join to create the new string.Or you could use string formatting to create the new string:
