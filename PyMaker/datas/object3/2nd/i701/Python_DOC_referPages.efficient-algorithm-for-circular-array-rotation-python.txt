For a given array I want to perform a number of right circular rotations. For instance given array  and number of rotation as 2, I want to obtain .For that I have written the a code in Python given below. I have also looked into the solution given in here. However I am looking for an elegant algorithm that can perform it more efficiently using native data structure in Python.Here is my code:
You can use this trick : Look at the trick at line 3. If we rotate a list by its length number of times then we will get the original list back. That's why we don't need to do that. We will rotate that times which will actually effect.
Use  and  from  module:Usage:Alternatively, use  from  module:
You could use a recursive appraoch:Output:The basic idea behind this is as follows. If you let the function  be  then our function follows the following steps:
