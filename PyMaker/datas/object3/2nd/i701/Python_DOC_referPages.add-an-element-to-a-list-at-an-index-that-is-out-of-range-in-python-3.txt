In other languages, such as javascript, when you add a value to an array that is outside of the range of indexes you "extend" the array with undefined values until the specified index.Example: When I try to do this in Python, I get a list assignment index out of range error.Is there a way to do the same thing in Python?
You can subclass  and override the  method so that it will extend the list as required by the given index, which could also be a  object, in which case the larger of the  and  attributes of the slice should be used:so that:outputs:Note that the expected output in your question in incorrect because an index of  actually refers to the 6th, rather than the 5th, item of the list.
Do you mean something like Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, None, 5]???I may be misunderstanding the problem, but
