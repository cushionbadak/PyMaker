I am writing a program to walk the filesystem to collect file information to put into a database.  I am trying to learn python after a lifetime of shell scripting, and am seeing an issue between what find returns and what  returnsThe issue I have is that the "OS"  returns symlinks to directories, but the python find does not, and I have no idea how to make it do that.  Now I don't want it to follow them (i.e. ) and that would create a different result from find as well.  But I want to be able to print the entries that are symlinks to directories.thanksc
If you want to get same output (sorting may vary), you need to print both directories and files for given path.  returns directories as well as links (to anything). Minimal change to you code would be:This may be a bit easier to do with :For instance I've created the following tree:Running  will yield (note directories and links to directories appear the same way):And running the first snippet with  yields the same items (in slightly different order,  would default to depth first,  does breadth first). For that  example just be ware if  is , as is it would chomp the leading  off.
