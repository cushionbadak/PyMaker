There is none, but if you don't mind a little hack, you can generate it like this:
With the addition of the   in Python 3.5 this is now as easy as:
The Python Standard Library By Example shows this function in the chapter on signals:You can then use it like this:
I found this article when I was in the same situation and figured the handler is only handling one signal at a time, so I don't even need a whole dictionary, just the name of one signal:there's probably a notation that doesn't need the tuple(...)[0] bit, but I can't seem to figure it out.
Well,  says at the bottom:So this should work:
Building on another answer:
for  of positive number (signal number), or negative value (return status from subprocess):
