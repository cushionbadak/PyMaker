This question already has an answer here:Concatenate elements of a list [duplicate]                    1 answer                I have extracted some data from a file and want to write it to a second file. But my program is returning the error:This appears to be happening because  wants a string but it is receiving a list.So, with respect to this code, how can I convert the list  to a string so that I can save the contents of  to ?
Try :Documentation says:Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the iterable iterable. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.

Explanation: will convert any python object into its string representation. Similar to the output you get if you do , but as a string.NOTE: This probably isn't what OP wants, as it has no control on how the elements of  are concatenated -- it will put  between each one -- but it may be useful to someone else.
will give "'a','b','c'" as output

Method 1:Method 2:Method 3:

From the official Python Programming FAQ for Python 3.6.4:What is the most efficient way to concatenate many strings together?   and  objects are immutable, therefore concatenating many strings together is inefficient as each concatenation creates a new object. In the general case, the total runtime cost is quadratic in the total string length.To accumulate many str objects, the recommended idiom is to place them into a list and call  at the end:(another reasonably efficient idiom is to use )To accumulate many bytes objects, the recommended idiom is to extend a  object using in-place concatenation (the  operator):
