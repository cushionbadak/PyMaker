Given a function object, how can I get its signature? For example, for:I would like to get .
However, note that  is deprecated since Python 3.0.Python 3.0--3.4 recommends .Python 3.5+ recommends .
Arguably the easiest way to find the signature for a function would be :Also, in Python 3 a method was added to the  module called , which is designed to represent the signature of a callable object and its return annotation:

Try calling  on an object to find out about it.
Maybe a bit late to the party, but if you also want to keep the order of the arguments and their defaults, then you can use the Abstract Syntax Tree module (ast).Here's a proof of concept (beware the code to sort the arguments and match them to their defaults can definitely be improved/made more clear):
If all you're trying to do is print the function then use pydoc.If you're trying to actually analyze the function signature then use argspec of the inspection module. I had to do that when validating a user's hook script function into a general framework.
Example code:
Use %pdef in the command line (IPython), it will print only the signature.e.g.
