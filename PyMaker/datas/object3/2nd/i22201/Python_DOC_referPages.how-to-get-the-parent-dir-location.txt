You can apply dirname repeatedly to climb higher: . This can only go as far as the root package, however. If this is a problem, use : .
 doesn't validate anything, so if we're already appending strings to  there's no need to bother with  or joining or any of that. Just treat  as a directory and start climbing:That's far less convoluted than  and about as manageable as . Climbing more than two levels starts to get ridiculous.But, since we know how many levels to climb, we could clean this up with a simple little function:
Use relative path with the  module in Python 3.4+:You can use multiple calls to  to go further in the path:As an alternative to specifying  twice, you can use
Should give you the path to .But if  is the file that is currently executed, then you can achieve the same by just doing
 is a better way for  and more readable. This will return the parent path of the given_path
A simple way can be:
May be join two  folder, to get parent of the parent folder?
Use the following to jump to previous folder:If you need multiple jumps a good and easy solution will be to use a simple decorator in this case.
Here is another relatively simple solution that:does not use  (which does not work as expected on one level arguments like "file.txt" or relative parents like "..")does not use  (avoiding any assumptions about the current working directory) but instead preserves the relative character of pathsit just uses  and :Result:
I think use this is better:
