I'm creating a config file to hold configuration/properties settings for my project that frequently change, such as file paths. What's the standard name/extension for such a file? (e.g. in Java I've used config.xml, in VB.NET I've used App.config...)
First, consider using ConfigParser (configparser in 3.0, so the documentation says).  That doesn't solve the naming problem, but it is a readable alternative to xml for most configuration needs.Whatever name you use, make all the parts meaningful. I would probably use something like appName.cfg, where appName identifies your application, or the part of the application the configuration is for.
Ok, I've asked around where I work and researched a little, and this is what I've come up with as suggestions:settings.iniapplicationName.configapplicationName.cfgIf anyone has any other suggestions, feel free to add...
The docs seem to use On Windows, many people (such as mercurial) use
