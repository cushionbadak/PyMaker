If there are several methods in the test class, I found that the order to execute is alphabetical. But I want to customize the order of execution. How to define the execution order?For example: testTestA will be loaded first than testTestB.
A tenet of unit-testing is that each test should be independent of all others.If in your case the code in testTestA must come before testTestB, then you couldcombine both into one test:or, perhaps better would be The  class only tests those methods who name begins with a lower-case . So you can put in extra helper methods  and  which won't get run unless you explicitly call them.
As far as I know, there is no way to order tests other than rename them. Could you explain why you need to run test cases in the specific order? In unit testing it usually considered as bad practice since it means that your cases are not independent.
To update on the topic (from documentation):Order in which tests are executedIn order to guarantee that all  code starts with a clean  database, the Django test runner reorders tests in the following way:All  subclasses are run first.Then, all other Django-based  tests (test cases based on , including  ) are run with no particular ordering guaranteed  nor enforced among them.Then any other  tests  (including ) that may alter the database without restoring it  to its original state are run.Note: The new ordering of tests may reveal unexpected dependencies on test  case ordering. This is the case with doctests that relied on state  left in the database by a given  test, they must be  updated to be able to run independently.
