I'm trying to use  to construct a sequence to grab the duration of a video file. I've been searching for 3 days, and can't find any reason online as to why this code isn't working, but it keeps giving me a blank result:
stderr needs to be redirected to stdout. Also, there's no need to call other tools like  etc. do your string manipulation in PythonIf Python is not a must, you can use the shell directly.
As others have pointed out, you need to pass the PIPE from one process to the next.The stdout (PIPE) from one process becomes the stdin for the following task.Something like this (starting from your example):
Using  will not magically wire the correct pipes for you.You must pass the output pipe of the first process as the value for the parameter  of the second process. See the docs for an example.
Python can't "build a whole pipeline" in this way -- it could delegate the task to the shell, or glue it up more directly using the  attributes of previous subprocess objects in the line, but there's really no reason for that in this specific case, since you can code it directly in Python pretty easily.  E.g.:
