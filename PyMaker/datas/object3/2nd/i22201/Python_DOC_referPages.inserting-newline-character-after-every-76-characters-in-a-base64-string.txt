I am trying to convert bitmap images into a base64 string before inserting it into database as binary blobs. The base64 string needs to be encoded in such a way that their is a new line character after every 76 characters. What is the best pythonic way of doing this?

For Python version 3:https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#base64.encodebytesEncode the bytes-like object s, which can contain arbitrary binary data, and return bytes containing the base64-encoded data, with newlines (b'\n') inserted after every 76 bytes of output, and ensuring that there is a trailing newline, as per RFC 2045 (MIME).Example:For Python version 2:http://docs.python.org/library/base64.htmlEncode the string s, which can contain arbitrary binary data, and return a string containing one or more lines of base64-encoded data. encodestring() returns a string containing one or more lines of base64-encoded data always including an extra trailing newline ('\n').The docs for version 2 could certainly be written more clearly, but it does what you want.Example:
If you want line break, don't use the straight base64 package, use the one provided in email:It do split the encoded string each 76 characters
Since Base64 mandates a fixed line length (64 or 76 characters, depending on which version you look at), the library that produces the Base64 String should already do that (or at least have an option to do that).
You should use strict encoding. That will add a new line
