This question already has an answer here:Store output of subprocess.Popen call in a string                    9 answers                I've created and deployed a Flask App with Apache2 server WSGI in which now would like to run a .sh script from the App.  However, from calling from python code, it doesn't execute. Here is the test.sh:Here is my python flask app code index.py (runs when App is opened) but nothing is printed or executed:To check that there is not errors in my code, I've check flask error logs, and no errors.  Also, I created a script called test_shell_script.py with same python code as above (but not flask app code) and it runs great like this:And then run it with python:    python3 /var/www/FlaskApp/FlaskApp/test_shell_script.pyI did change the permissions as well:What am I missing here which is not allowing my Flask app to run shell commands from the python code?
To show command output inside Python, there are two popular methods:: It runs command with arguments and return its output. (official documentation): Interact with process: Send data to stdin. Read data from stdout and stderr, until end-of-file is reached. (official documentation)I could view the shell file output using these both methods using Python 3.5 in an Ubuntu machine.::Output screenshot:
