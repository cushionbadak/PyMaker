I got stuck when I try to figure out the following :here is the code output:Just like what I commented out,  is base on , however, there is not a  class in the main module. A class its base class is not accessible, is an error? But interesting,  can still call the method, which comes from the parent of its parent. 
For the sake of the answer, we don't need the FormMeta class at first.Imagine the definition of Form as follows:the  call just returns , which in this case is just , which creates a new class called , which is derived from  ( in this case), with no additional methods.You can read about it at the type documentation.The  metaclass in this case does  nothing. It inherits  (that's why it is a meta class), and then just passes the data it receives on to , plus some print statements. So it is essentially the same as above.You can read more about metaclasses here.
