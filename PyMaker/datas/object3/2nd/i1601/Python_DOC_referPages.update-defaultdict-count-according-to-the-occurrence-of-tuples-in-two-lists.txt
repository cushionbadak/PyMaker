I have two lists and would like to create a dictionary to record the occurrence of tuples.My current code:My result is:My desired result is:I do not know why the count of  is 1. Isn't the default integer of  zero? Why I got 1 for the  tuple?
This line isn't doing what you think it is:Here you are iterating a list elementwise, in this case the elements of . There's no filtering taking place. As your  loop iterates,  successively represents , , etc. The fact the name is the same as a variable you've defined earlier only serves to confuse.Instead, you can use a ternary statement to differentiate operations: is more idiomatic with Python. It's good practice to use  for O(1) lookup within a dictionary comprehension.
Isn't the default integer of  zero?Yes.Why I got 1 for the ('leaf', 'liquid') tuple?You wrote:That is, find the current value—which creates a new one set to zero—then add one to it and store the result back.  The resulting value is 1.
Without reinventing the wheel. You can use  from the wonderful  standard module library for this. Here we create a counter based on  and updates the counts to zero if it is not found in . Hope this is a more intuitive method in solving your problem.
