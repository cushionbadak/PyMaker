Calculating the sum of integers contained in the multidimensional list in python with recursion.Im sure a problem is in multidimensional list. How fix code?
Well, that can easily be done with a simpler recursive function:Highlights:1. isinstance is used for type checking.2. sum sums the elements of a given iterableEdit:If you are not allowed to use , a  loop can be used too:EDIT 2:If for some ludicrous reason you are not even allowed to use , you may use exception handling, but I'd recommend against it since it makes the whole thing less readable and more messy than it is has to be:
Other option using exceptions:
