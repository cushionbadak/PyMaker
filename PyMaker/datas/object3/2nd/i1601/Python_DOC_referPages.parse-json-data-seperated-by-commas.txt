Lets say i have the following json:How would I extract the 1st, 3rd, 6th item in "data"? So extract dog, bird, and dragon. These words will always be changing too. I know how to extract the entire thing by doing:But i'm not sure how to extract individually.
It is a string. You can use the split method. Assuming you have loaded it into python using json.load(), you can do this:['DOG', 'CAT', 'BIRD', 'SEED', 'HEART', 'DRAGON', 'LINK', 'SUNSHINE']Check out the string methods to find out all the ways to manipulate them.https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html
Parse the JSON into an object then split a string into an array delimited by (,) comma
