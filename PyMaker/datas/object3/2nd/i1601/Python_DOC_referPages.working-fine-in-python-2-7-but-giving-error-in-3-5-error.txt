I'm writing a script to automate data generation for a demo and I need to serialize in a JSON some data. Part of this data is an image, so I encoded it in base64, but when I try to run my script I get:As far as I know, a base64-encoded-whatever (a PNG image, in this case) is just a string, so it should pose to problem to serializating. What am I missing?
You must be careful about the datatypes.If you read a binary image, you get bytes.If you encode these bytes in base64, you get ... bytes again! (see documentation on b64encode)json can't handle raw bytes, that's why you get the error.I have just written some example, with comments, I hope it helps:
