My DLL has the following function:The function will write data out through outSize and outData (meaning these need to be passed to the function with the expectation that my function inside the DLL will modify them)In addition, Function_Modes is:For reference in Perl I referenced the function like so:I created a small Python code that should run the function and show the data it returns, but the call while "appears to access the DLL", does not return (the python code just after the call is never called)There appears to be very little documentation on how to handle DLL functions that return data - just that byref should be used, but its not 100% clear how to allocate the data for these function to use them - so that could be my issueThank you for assisting.
As I see it there are two changes you need to make:The C function you are attempting to call uses the  calling convention, so you must access the DLL using , not .    is used for the  calling convention.  See also the Python  documentation.The fourth argument to your function is a pointer, but you appear to be passing it a pointer to a pointer.  Try replacing  with .
