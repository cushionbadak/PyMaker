In python 2.x SORT worked well when I passed a function.Switched to python 3.x .. sort has changed, but I did not understand how I have to modify the code to make it work also in python 3.If I do not pass a function, everything works, but when I pass a function, I get the error: TypeError: must use keyword argument for key functionHow should I change ....
cmp is not a valid built-in function in Python 3 anymore, but you can emulate it.  sort works differently in Python 3, but you can use cmp_to_key to translate old Python 2 style sorts. You have to import functools to use .The functools.cmp_to_key() utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp function to a key function.You have to use  keyword argument in Python 3 sort methodHere's an example implementation:Output is exactly the same as Python 2 output:
