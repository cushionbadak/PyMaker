Here i have listfor suppose  is in then we need to combine both tuple and make as one tuple and replace  with  in Result:should come but make sure instead of 'A', 'B','C',.. what ever it'll not be same for everytimeCan you help me with that?
basically you need to create a tuple key for your 2 values, and create a default dictionary with that.Extend the rest of the list for each key, and transform back the key/value couple to list of lists by adding the key (as list) to the valuelike this:result:The  part allows to put the 2 first values in separate  and  variables, and the "rest" in a  list. This feature isn't available in python 2. Python 2 users can replace the loop by a more basic:(this problem is similar to that one: Merge tuples with the same key for the core part, but the pre/post processing makes it different)
You can also use  to group the tuples by the first two items, then combine the rest of the tuple at the end with flattening:Which gives the following:The above uses  to flatten the grouped tuple of tuples. You also need to sort the list of tuples by the first two items, in order to group them with . This is because it groups by consecutive keys in an iterable, which you can only achieve by sorting. Additionally, If your list of tuples are always of length 4 and the key is always the first two items, you can also use  for  and :Which looks up the first two values (0, 1) and last two values (2, 3). 
You can also try below code.And if you want to try 3rd party package then install  using . Â» pip install ordered-setYou can check https://pypi.org/project/ordered-set/.Note: This is just to keep the elements in order after passing the combined tuple to .
