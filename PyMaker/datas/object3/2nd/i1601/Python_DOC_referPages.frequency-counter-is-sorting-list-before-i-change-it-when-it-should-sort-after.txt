I have a frequency counter, to iterate through a list of times and tell me how often each number comes up. First, I run it through a function to remove the decimals using . I check this with a print statement at the bottom, it works fine. But for some reason, even though the frequency thing comes after I change the  the values with . Here is my code and I'll give some output.the output looks like:It took my a while to figure out what was up with the freqlist output, it's doing everything right, but it is doing times, not newtimes (where we drop the decimals), even though it should be after we drop the decimals. Any ideas? Thanks!
The problem is  works for consecutive similar items only. It requires a sorted input to work in the way you expect. You also don't need to create intermediary lists; instead, you can use  with a generator expression:Sorting takes O(n log n) time. For an O(n) solution, you can use :Then, if you wish, extract values in a list after sorting by key:
