I have one dictionary (dictDemCLass) with a key but the values are all 0 and I plan to fill them with the values from another dictionary (dictAvgGrade).  I need to do so where the keys of the two dictionaries are the same.When printed (dictAvgGrade is shortened):Ultimately I want to fill dictDemClass to show the average for each class. So that the output could look something like:
You can use  to groups items in  by "class" (i.e. junior, senior, etc.). Then you can compute the average for each group and add it to .So for the example your posted, it can be something like the following:Output
if you know that  is always a subset of  you can do thisotherwiseif you are using python3 you can do something like thisif you are using python2 you can do something like this
