The code I have sends a command to a serial device and returns a string  or in Python  is the format I send the command in, I can see the incoming data in putty but not in Python? The incoming data also starts with a  and ends with a . How do I get this data through to Python?My code:
It looks like the issue is with your call to . The pyserial API states that it uses  which reads characters up to the newline () character. Since your data begines with  there are no characters before it, and hence the  call will read zero bytes from the buffer, and return an empty string.You should either move the  to the end of each message, or use the  call directly to read  bytes from the connection.
