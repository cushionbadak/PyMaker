I want the summation of 3 different objects like:And tried to do this
You are returning a tuple, which doesn't have the  method overloaded. You should return a  object instead:Edit: clarification of the solution added after commentEach  sign translates to an  call. In your example, the operation  is actually performing two calls to : . Adding parentheses to the expression may help:  actually translates to .The problem happens in the second call to , since your method is returning  which is the tuple  (you can omit the parentheses in your code, and it's more pythonic, but it's equivalent and it's actually a tuple).A tuple is a fixed-length list of elements and it's a basic class of python language. You can read more about it here.The result of  is the summation you would expect from , but of type . In the example, You can check this running your code but printing just And also:The second addition, though, fails, because the result of the first one is a tuple and not a  object. So  actually is calling the  method of the tuple, which exists but has other meaning than the one you want. Therefore, you are obtaining the error Note that adding two tuples is just appending them and not adding the coordinates element-wise: The solution to this problem is to return a  object as the result of the  operation, allowing to concatenate more than one addition operation. I added the  method to your class because otherwise the print is just showing a default representation of the class like .
