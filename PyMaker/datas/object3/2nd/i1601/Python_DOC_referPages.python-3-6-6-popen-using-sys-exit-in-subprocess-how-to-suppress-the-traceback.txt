I have a class with some functions that basically do output checks on data, the functions of this class are called using a subprocess. Now if the output check fails the subprocess has a sys.exit call with a different code depending on which check it failed.In the main code I have this:Now the output from this shows all traceback and python exceptions for the sys.exit calls in the subprocess.Im actually logging all errors so I dont want anything being displayed in the command prompt unless ive printed it manually.I'm not quite sure how to go about this.
