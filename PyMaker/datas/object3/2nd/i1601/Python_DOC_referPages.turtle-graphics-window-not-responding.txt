I am attempting to translate a Julia set generator that I made previously to Python code. However, when the code is run, the turtle graphics window stops responding immediately and draws nothing. Have I done something horribly wrong or is there something I'm missing? Perhaps I'm asking too much of python to do in 1 frame. Please explain what is causing this to happen and how I can fix it. Thanks! generate a list of y-valuescreate a color valueiterate on the x'sIterate on the y'suser input
There are too many problems with this code to focus on an algorithm error.  When I try to run it, I get, .  Specific issues:The  argument here is being passed a number:but Python's  function (and Julia's) expects a function as its first argument:and it returns a list of the results of applying  to  but you treat the result as a scalar value: The  function never uses its second argument, and never returns anything!The variables  &  here are being treated as globals, set but not used, as if prepared for use by :but the  &  used by  are locals initialized to zero:You have a function and global variable with the same name !And your globals are out of control.
