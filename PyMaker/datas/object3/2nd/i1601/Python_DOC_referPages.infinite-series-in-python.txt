This question already has an answer here:Is there an expression for an infinite generator?                    7 answers                Is there any function in Python that provides an infinite series similar to generateSequence in Kotlin?In Kotlin I can do something like:Obviously this stops with an integer overflow error but I would like to do something similar in Python. 
you can write a simple of coarse this particular generator is builtin with 
Use  to get a  object that generates an infinite sequence of values.You can take the first n items by explicitly retrieving the next item from the  object for the required number of times. Alternatively, and preferably, use  to take the first n items.Mirroring your example, to take the first 5 values of the sequence using explicit iteration:Or using :
