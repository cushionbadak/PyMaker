 +  + list comprehensionYour  mapping is a list of lists, you can flatten this into an iterable of tuples via . Then feed to  to create an efficient mapping.Finally, use a list comprehension with  for the desired result. Just remember to convert the values of  from  to .
This iterates through list  comparing it's value with first value of tuples in  list. This appends the second value of tuple to output list if the first value of tuple matches with the value in :
You can convert your double-list of mappings into a lookup dictionary and use a list-comp:Output:Related:dict.get(key[, default])Why dict.get(key) instead of dict[key]?
