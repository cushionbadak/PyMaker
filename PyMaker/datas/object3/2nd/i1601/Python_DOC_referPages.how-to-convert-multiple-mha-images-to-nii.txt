I would like to convert about 300 .mha images into .nii format. Which are under subfolders . I have successfully converted one image but in order to go each folder and convert, its a tidious task. Please suggest me code that is functioning with sitk library 
Use python's os.walk method to get all the files in a directory tree.  Then select out only the ones with the '.mha' suffix.Here's an example of how it works:https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/os_walk.htmOr you can try and decipher the os library documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
