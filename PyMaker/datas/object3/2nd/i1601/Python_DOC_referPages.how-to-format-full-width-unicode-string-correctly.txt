Natural Text
It seems that python add only one half width space to format the string, but for full width characters, there should be a full width space or two half width space. Is there any solution?the code is :then the output:when I change  to  , the output is:but the output I want is
See python docs format-examples , the 6th example shows that we can use  to make text center and filled with  (  means center and the char in front of it is the fill char). Just use full width space  to replace  in this example.So finally, my template string is: means right align. See python docs format-specification for all align charsthe output is:I also tried to use two half-width space as the fill char, but it raised  .Hope the answer will help someone in the future
