Natural Text
I have a .txt file like thisI want to read this file line by line and check that whether the line starts with alphabet or digit. If the line starts with digit then add all these digits in that line and print sum. and if the line starts with alphabet then simply print any message.I have tried this codeNameError: name 'total' is not defined
 is undefined - and you do not need it:Create file:Process file:Output:Explanation of :this takes the whole , 's it at whitespaces into a list  of strings.  applies a function to all elements of the iterable and returns a generator of it which is summed up by :Readup:you can find most of the function I used at python built in functionsmap()int()sum()the rest are string functions:split()rstrip()
It was some error in your code.First,  is not initialised, you should addAfter, iterate on  will give you :I think you want split the line and get number one by one:
Python interpreter doesn't know how to do this  because  isn't initialized. Just initialize it like this, for example (or in any place you think it would be right):PS And if you want to sum numbers instead of string concatenation, you should initialize  as  and add  like this 
Parse the string of number to a list of integers with  and make the addition with :
As always, many ways lead to the desired result.My approach would beusing with is convenient as it closes the file for you, even if an error occurs and  return bools - no need to additionally test them against a so called list comprehension (a one-line-for-loop in square brackets) creates a list on the fly and allows processing each value while adding it to the list; the resulting list can esily summed up and printed
