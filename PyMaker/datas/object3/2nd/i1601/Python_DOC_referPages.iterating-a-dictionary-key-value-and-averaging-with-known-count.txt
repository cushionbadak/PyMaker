As a beginner in python,Im still trying to grasp the concept of dictionary count/loops better. So i've created a sample data to get my question across clearly. Below i have an unordered list of dictionaries containing the revenue information of a few shops. My question is, how do i get the average revenue of each shop - based on the count of reported revenue, reported by these shops?Running the code above will give me:Based on each shop reporting count:How do i find the average of each revenue reported so that my output will return the following:
If the total revenue is called  and the count  and they both have the same keys (which they have to), you can use a dict comprehension to calculate the average revenue :
If you want to manipulate your current approach to work, then user8408080's approach will work just fine.Otherwise, as mentioned in the comments by @Chris_Rands, you can collect the revenues with a , storing them as lists, then calculate the mean at the end:You could also have a  of , and store the revenues and counts simultaneously:Note: In the first example I used  to calculate the mean. You can also use  if you want to. 
You can do it without python packages, as follows:
