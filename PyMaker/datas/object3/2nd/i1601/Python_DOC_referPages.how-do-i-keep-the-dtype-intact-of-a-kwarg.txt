For a script that I am working on I want to make it optional to pass on an array to a function. The way in which I have attempted to do this is by making the variable in question () a . The problem is that when I do it in this way, python changes de dtype of the kwarg from a  to . The simplest solution is to convert the variable back to a  using:But I do not find this a very elegant solution. So I was wondering if someone could show me a "prettier" way to accomplish this and possibly explain to my why python does this?  The function in question is: The function is called with the following command:The version of Python that I am working in is 2.7.15
See the accepted answer here why you always get a mapping-object (aka a ) if you pass arguments via ; the language spec says:If the form “**identifier” is present, it is initialized to a new  ordered mapping receiving any excess keyword arguments, defaulting to  a new empty mapping of the same type.In other words, the behavior you described is exactly what the language guarantees.One of the reasons for this behavior is that all functions, wrappers, and implementations in the underlying language (e.g. C / J) will understand that  is part of the arguments and should be expanded to its key-value combinations.If you want to preserve your extra-arguments as an object of a certain type, you can't use  to do so; pass it via an explicit argument, e.g.  which has no special meaning.
