I am trying to create a program that will find and store the index of each element in the nested list.So far, I have tried using nested for iterators to accomplish this.Below is my code.I think the row indexes are outputting in a correct manner but the column indexes are doing something strange.I have looked over the code several times but I cannot find out what's wrong with it.
A nested comprehension using  will do:Your  based approach fails because  always returns the first index of the element in the list, so it won't work if there are repetitions. Also, it has worse performance since every  call must iterate the list it is called on.A pure loop-index-based implementation along your original lines would be:And if you know that your table is not jagged, you can use :
Here's a  solution.
If you observe carefully, then you may observe that there are duplicate values in the list that is the reason you get the indexes wrong. So, in case of duplications you can use enumerate. Enumerate will return the tuple object so iiteration over it and this will give you expected output.You can try this-
