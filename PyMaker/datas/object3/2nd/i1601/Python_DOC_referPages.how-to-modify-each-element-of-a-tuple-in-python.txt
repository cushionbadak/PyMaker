I have a list of tuples:I want to multiply each value to 100 and then reassign them in the same order. But doing below, it throws error:How can I modify these values and save them in their places? Thanks
If you read the docs, you will learn that tuples are immutable (unlike lists), so you cannot change values of tuples.Use a list-comprehension:
You cannot reassign values to tuples because they are immutable. Try creating a new list of tuples:
Tuples are immutable. A list of tuples is not the best structure for what you're looking to do. If you can use a 3rd party library, I recommend NumPy:The alternative is a list comprehension, which doesn't work in place.
