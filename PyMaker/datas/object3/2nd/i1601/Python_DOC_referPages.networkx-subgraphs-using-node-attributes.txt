I have a set of data where the nodes have an attribute showing the name of the team to which they belong. I would like to work out the stats for a) the whole network and then b) the stats for each team comparing their connectivity etc. (Lets say I am comparing who sends emails to who and therefore the degree of connectedness of the team. Here is my sample code:I know I can form a subgraph as follows: Is there an easier way of setting the nodes by reference to the node attribute? 
You can use :Now the  dict contains the subgraph of every different role present in the graph. This works for an arbitrary number of roles.
