I'm trying to record some stats on a script I'm running in python (a few percentages, less than 12 characters worth). I want it to be efficient. I want the stats to keep being updated as the script runs so that if the script were to exit I still have the stats available to be updated when I run the script again. I've thought of ways such as recording in a csv (seems inefficient since there looks to be no functionality to keep updating the same row ), updating the title of a file within the system. But can think of nothing which is as clean and efficient as I was hoping. Any ideas?
You could store it in a .txt file if you'd like really, or anything. Using the built in module for .csv files in Python, overwriting rows directly - rather than having to recreate the file - isn't possible AFAIK. Check out the sqlite3 module for storing the information in a database. https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
