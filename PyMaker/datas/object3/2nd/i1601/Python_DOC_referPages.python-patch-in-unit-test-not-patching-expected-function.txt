Basically, the  directory follows the 'structure' of .The  module containsThe  is, in turn, invoked in the  function in :I am trying to test this with the following unit test in :However, if I run this test from the command line, I get an error because the patch was not called:Although I'm using Python 2.7 in which  is a separate package, as far as I can tell from the current documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch), this should be the correct way to use the  decorator.Any ideas what is wrong with this example?
Any ideas what is wrong with this example?Hum...a) Why do you duplicate the folder structure. You've made a package, just put a  sub-package in it, then in your tests import the relevant parts of the outer package to exercise in tests, patch what you want, and that's it.b) Having  and  names is asking for trouble.c) Other modules (and yet using other modules) don't see the patch you've made in your module. You are patching a string that your module doesn't use.
