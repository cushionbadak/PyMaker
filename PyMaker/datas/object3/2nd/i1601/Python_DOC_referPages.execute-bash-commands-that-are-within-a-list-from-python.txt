i got this listI'm trying to execute one by one all the elements inside as a bash script, with no success. Do i need a for loop here?how to achieve that?, thanks all!!!! 
is one way you could do it ... although just cd'ing into a bunch of directories isnt going to have much impactNOTE this will run each command in its own subshell ... so they would not remember their state (ie any directory changes or environmental variables)if you need to run them all in one subshell than you need to chain them together with "&&"as noted in the comments, in general it is preferred to use subprocess module with  or one of the other variants. however in this specific instance i personally think that you are in a 6 to 1 half a dozen to the other, and  was less typing (and its gonna exist whether you are using python3.7 or python2.5 ... but in general use  exactly which call probably depends on the version of python you are using ... there is a great description in the post linked in the comments by @triplee why you should use subprocess instead)really you should reformat your commands to simply note that you will probably need to add your python file to your sudoers file also Im not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish here ... but i suspect this might not be the ideal way to go about it (although it should work...)
This is just a suggestion, but if your just wanting to change directories and delete folders, you could use  and :Which will  three directories deep into , and delelte . The current working directory changes when you call , as seen when you call .
