I am creating a game and I have found out so far the most common save program, pickle, can only save/load while the program is on. The game I am making would take a long time to complete, and I don't think people would like to restart the game every time they quit. Is there a program I can import/download to save the variables elsewhere so they can be loaded again?
pickle, can only save/load while the program is onI don't know what you mean by this.In the strictest sense, it's true -- a program can't do anything if it's not running!But it seems like you meant that a file saved with pickle would vanish when the program quits, and that is certainly not true.Pickle is a perfectly reasonable way to save the game progress between play sessions.  Save the file before quitting, load the file on the next startup, boom you're back where you left off.
