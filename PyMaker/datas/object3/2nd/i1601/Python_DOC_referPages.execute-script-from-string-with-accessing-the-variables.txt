You are not passing the global dictionary to modify. Try: 
You really should avoid using global variables. Regardless, here's how to do it:Output:A  declaration only does something inside a function or class method and even then is only needed when the global variable's value is going to be set to something. However, as a special case, one isn't really needed here in the  method because it explicitly passes  (but not a separate locals dict) when it calls . It might be a good idea to put one in anyway to make it more clear what's going on.Using  this way is explained in its documentation which says:If only globals is provided, it must be a dictionary, which will be used for both the global and the local variables.(emphasis mine)Here's a way to avoid referencing a global variable at all in the method:Output:
