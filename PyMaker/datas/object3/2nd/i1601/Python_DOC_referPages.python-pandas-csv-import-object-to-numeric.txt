I'm trying to import a csv-file with the following content in each line.In the end df.dtypes shows that it is an object, but I want to get the values that I can make for example a line plot.I tried to convert the object to a string, to remove the '[', ']' and than castit to numeric, but I was not successful.Any hints?Thanks
