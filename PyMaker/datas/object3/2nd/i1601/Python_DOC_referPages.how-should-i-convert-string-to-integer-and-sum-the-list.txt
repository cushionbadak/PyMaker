I want to sum up the list of string. I tried to convert strings to integers by using for loop and int(). But it didn't work. What should I do? Thank you for your answer!
The  and  data types are immutable, so functions called on them can never modify their values.Hence the  function can't modify your  variable in the for-loop nor is it supposed to.As a result, the  function is designed to return a new integer, thus you must assign it somewhere or it will be "lost in the void".I.e.Note that it is great practice to learn these, albeit simple, algorithms for operations on lists, strings etc, but the  built-in function is there to be used if your in a rush!N.B. I have also used a list-comprehension here that you may not be familiar with; they are really useful, I suggest learning them.
Use  with  to map each item to int: as such does not alter  unless you assign it back. So your code should be:Or, shortly:

I don't know why everyone suggests loops. Imo the pythonic way would be the following:May be a bit heavier on RAM as compared to the  with for loop approach but I'd wager it's faster.EDIT:As @tevemadar pointed out you can actually do:which changes the list comprehension to be a generator that you then sum, which is a better solution as it does away with having to have the list in memory as one.EDIT2:A thing to watch out for with the second solution is that changing  after defining  actually influences .
(Implementing the comment) returns the integer value,  remains being the string it was before.You need :
