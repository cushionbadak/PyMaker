Here's the problem:I want to play two mp3 or mpeg format audio files in parallel using pydub. What I notice is that I can start one thread no problem, but it hangs until the first audio file finishes. Only then does the second file start.I believe this to be due to the python GIL. So I think the threads will not be able to fire in parallel. Am I correct in thinking this?Here's a simple version of my code:The only work around I discovered on the matter entails taking the mp3, converting it to wave, then feeding it to pyaudio on a thread. That's fine, but it might be computationally expensive for my purposes. Link for workaroundThank you!
I recommend using pydub with simpleaudio which supports concurrently playing multiple sounds. For a simple example see  which you can also just use, if you like.The main  function tries to present the same functionality regardless of which playback method is being used, so it waits for playback to complete, but simpleaudio works fine with concurrent playback (and the  function does not wait until the sound finishes playing)
