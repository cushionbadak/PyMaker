Natural Text
I have several text files located in different folders.Goal: I need to grab all the newest files for each folder based on the cities they reside. So the return value would be something like:I will then use the return values as path to open the files and feed through another function that I have built. But at the moment the other function only works when the files reside in the same folder where I run the script or I specifically point it to sub folder - not the entire tree. So at this point I need to be able to go through each folder, grab the newest file for each city, return the value as path to the file.  I'm new to python or scripting in general. A helping hand would be greatly appreciated!
here is my solution for you:You have to choose your startpath and then you get all newest files in all directories
Use os.walk to navigate the directory structure and os.path.getmtime to determine the modification time for each file.For comparing the times, I recommend using the datetime module.
