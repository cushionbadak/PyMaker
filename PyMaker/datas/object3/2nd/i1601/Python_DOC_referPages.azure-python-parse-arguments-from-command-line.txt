community, I am trying to parse arguments as default values for principal credentials on Azure using Python CLI. In my code, I am trying to hardcode the default values for the "--azure-client-id", "--azure-secret",  "--azure-tenant" and "--azure-subscription-id" as default but I am not 100% how to add it. I have been searching all over the net but can't find the answer as yetI am still learning and I was hoping that someone could help me. Thank you in advances for your helpMy code below
parser.add_argument('--azure-client-id', nargs='?', const='ID',  default='ID')nargs='?' = 0 or 1 argumentsconst='ID' = sets default value when no arguments are passeddefault='ID' = if '--azure-client-id' is not specified this will be the default valuehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs
