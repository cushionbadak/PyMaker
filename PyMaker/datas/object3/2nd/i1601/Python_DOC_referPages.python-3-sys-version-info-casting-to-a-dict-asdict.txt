I am new to Python and just messing around with it. Is there something unique about sys.version_info that means it doesn't return a proper namedtuple and therefore doesn't have the _asdict function? 
Interesting so I actually dug deeper. As mentioned in the comments,  is a bespoke tuple subclass and not to be confused by the  that interestingly actually says its a named tuple, though they probably were referring to the  string format.You will also realize that if you run  which returns its methods,  or  is not part of it and therefore returned your error where it does no have  as an attribute.According to the documentation itself;A tuple containing the five components of the version number: major,  minor, micro, releaselevel, and serial. All values except releaselevel  are integers; the release level is 'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate', or  'final'. The version_info value corresponding to the Python version  2.0 is (2, 0, 0, 'final', 0). The components can also be accessed by name, so sys.version_info[0] is equivalent to sys.version_info.major  and so on.Seeing that the components are static and as mentioned in the documentation, the components can always be accessed by name or their fixed indexes.If you would really want a dictionary out of it:It seems redundant as you can also easily do  and so on. Hope this helps gives you an understanding though.
 isn't ~quite a  (despite the docstring).(below assumes cpython implementation detail, it may or may not apply to alternate implementations such as  / )It is implemented in C, a .  From the 3.7.1 sources:A  from the docs is:the C equivalent of namedtuple() objects, i.e. a sequence whose items can also be accessed through attributes. To create a struct sequence, you first have to create a specific struct sequence type.That is, it's like a , but not the same.  Notably it appears to be missing the , , , and  apis.
