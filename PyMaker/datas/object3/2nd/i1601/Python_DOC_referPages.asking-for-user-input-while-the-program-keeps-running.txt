Creating an automated battle system, but I want the user to have some input. The problem is whenever I ask for input the entire function stops until it gets input from the user.If you look at the while loop, I ask for the player input there. The problem is, of course, the entire program stops to get the userInput instead of continuing with the program. I've tried putting that line in a while loop like thisI thought that this would somehow create another line in the program that the user can type in any command they want while the battle is going on live. The effect was that my function was just stuck on this while loop which was stuck on true... If anyone here on this forum knows how to achieve an effect like this let me know. All the code that is necessary to reproduce this problem is down below (removed some parts of the code which was not needed for the issue) Let me know if you need any clarification. Thanks!
I believe you'd have to use threads in order to have separate processes running while also having user interaction.You can read about threading in python here (specifically the threading module in Python 3): https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html
Here's example solution using threads. Here I'm creating new thread that's waiting for user input and then pass that input as argument to function.
