So, I'm trying to have an item for list1 printed once, then the first element of item2 dictates how many items from list 3 are printed, then the next loop around, it starts where it left off. Then repeat until I run out of items from list1.. I think I have all the lists formatted right because list1 is a list of strings, list2 is a list of integers and list3 is another list of stringsit prints out the first x amount of items from list 3, a total of 8 times (which is how many elements are in list 2)Sample: it will print:expected would be:etc
For each word in  you want to print a slice of  determined by the corresponding value in . You can do that by zipping  and  and computing the appropriate slices:OutputIf you want to format the lists as a string, you can use :
This will destroy :
The shortest one here:The output is: them and iterate over, add  as usual, and remove the inner loop, that's all the changes, note that it makes it shorter (by far).
Output:
