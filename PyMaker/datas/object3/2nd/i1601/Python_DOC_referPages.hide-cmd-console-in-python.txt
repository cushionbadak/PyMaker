I wrote some statements like below:both will pop up a console.How can I stop it from popping up the console?
The process  can hide the console window:Or set the creation flags to disable creating the window:The above is still a console process with valid handles for console I/O (verified by calling  on the handles returned by ). It just has no window and doesn't inherit the parent's console, if any. You can go a step farther by forcing the child to have no console at all:In this case the child's standard handles (i.e. ) are 0, but you can set them to an open disk file or pipe such as  (3.3) or . 
Add the  argument to the subprocess calls.Or, if you don't need to wait for it, use  rather than .
Try .
try to change the extension from .py to .pyw
