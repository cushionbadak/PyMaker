I am trying to work with pylabels to create nametags for an upcoming event.  In one section of the code, there is this tid-bit:where .  So essentially, this will load each line of "names.txt" and call the function 'write_name', using specifications in 'specs', and add each name to unique labels.  I'm attempting to change this code to the following:But I get this error:Can anyone help me understand what exit means in this context?  I do not understand from other submissions.I am hoping to add this subsetting aspect so that I can add further details to the nametags.I am using Python3.5
Can anyone help me understand what  means in this context? I do not understand from other submissions.  ... As  isn't a function, it should be exitable.When you use  statement context managers, that object must define these two methods:Whatever  is (a Pandas DataFrame, it seems), it doesn't implement either of these methods.  As indicated by the traceback, it doesn't define  at all, so execution stops right there and raises an exception.I don't see a need to use a DataFrame as a context manager.  A typical use-case is when you want to ensure that something happens at the end of the  block, namely, closing a file stream.  (Like a / block--you want to make sure  gets called unconditionally.)  With a Pandas DataFrame, I'm not sure if there is any analogy that would necessitate have those two dunder methods.
