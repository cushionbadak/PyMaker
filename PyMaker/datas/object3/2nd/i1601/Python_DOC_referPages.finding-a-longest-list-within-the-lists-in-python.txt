How can I do it simply in python way?I try to iterate over it but all I could receive is the only  of each item in a list Output must be: Thanks in advance
 and  function in python accepts a  argument that will find the max of an iterable based on what defined as a key. so, try this:then you can use  to find those indexes
OUTPUT:
The usage of  (min/max) is easiest. If you like to go through your list yourself, you can do this like so:Output:Doku:enumerate(iterable[,start_value])
