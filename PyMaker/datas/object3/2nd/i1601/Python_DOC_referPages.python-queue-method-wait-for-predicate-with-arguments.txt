I'm trying to utilize the  method of the queue module. I have a callable for the predicate, and it works if I don't pass any arguments, however the callable requires an  argument. WORKS:FAILS:This generates the error "bool is not callable".I've tried the following:Result: bool is not callableResult: tuple object is not callableResult: tuple object is not callableResult:  fn missing 1 required positional argument: 'int'fn is a simple function just for testing.:Any guidance is greatly appreciated.
 accepts a predicate that is a callable that accepts no arguments. The return value of the predicate can be anything since all objects have a boolean interpretation. is a callable that accepts one argument, so it is not a suitable predicate.  is the object that is the result of calling the method, which is a , not a callable.Your approach with the  is the simplest and easiest in this case:If your function is complex enough, you can have it return the predicate callable with appropriate refactoring, instead of wrapping it in a lambda. For example:
I was able to solve it by using a lambda:But I'm curious as to if there are other ways?
