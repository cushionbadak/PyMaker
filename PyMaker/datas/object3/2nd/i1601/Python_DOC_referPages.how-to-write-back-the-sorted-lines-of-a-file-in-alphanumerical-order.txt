how do i make it my code print the sorted file lines, but when it does, it does it in ascending order.
read whole file, sort and write into new file:if "sorted" should use some special sorting, provide comparing function in "key" argument:sorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)     Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order, and the     reverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.
This is a more concise way to do it:As you can see here: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html, you can provide a callable in order to customize the ordering.sorted(iterable, /, *, key=None, reverse=False)     Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order, and the     reverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.
