I need to sort my list in alphabetical order but ignore the case of my letters.I would like to receive :I tried to do :But I received this error : Someone can help me please ?Thank you,Jason
You need to provide a key function:
This should work:The  parameter of the function  is the value that will be used for comparison in the sorting process. In this case the  we want is the string part of the tuples in lowercase, so that's what we return using a one-line lambda function.In python  is a basic built in function that converts the value passed to a string, that's why the error.See  to understand why is prefered over 
If you don't need to keep an original version of the list it's quicker to sort in place by calling a list method:this method doesn't return anything because the original list object now becomes sorted.
