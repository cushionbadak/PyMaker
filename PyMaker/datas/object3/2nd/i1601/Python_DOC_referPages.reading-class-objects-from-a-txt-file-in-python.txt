Natural Text
I'm relatively new to Python and trying to learn the language. I have been trying to figure out the code for this problem over the last day, I know it's probably going to be relatively simple.What I want to do is reading a text file, containing data in the following format, iterate over the data and create a class object for it. Thank you!
the best practice for python is using a json,builtin data type of dict:eg: text_file.json:reader.py:then it is your reader class:if u wanna read do thisyou r all set now
This is probably the easiest way to do what you want:you could write a program like this:and in file.txt:
I assume by "text file" you mean some kind of CSV/TSV Format, which would be a pretty common use case. It also implies that the CSV file has some kind of header, which defines field names which correspond to the field names of your class, so the DictReader class gives you an appropriate level of abstraction. The csv module is part of the core modules in Python so you just have to import it, no need to install anythingThe following snippet might be used as a skeleton to further build your code up around itNevertheless, if DictReader does not fit your needs, you also can parse every row of the textfile as you like on your own, there are some examples on the csv module docs.
