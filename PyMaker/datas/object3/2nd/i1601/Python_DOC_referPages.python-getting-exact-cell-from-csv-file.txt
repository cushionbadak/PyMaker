I pretty much type the csv file path to analyze and do different things with it.First question is: How can I print the exact cell from the CSV file? I have tried different methods, but I can't seem to get it working.For example I want to print the info of those two cellsThe other question is: Can I automate it to print the very first cell(1 A) and the very last row first cell (1099 A), without me needing to type the cell locations?Thank youSmall portion of dataExample of the data:
You import  at the very top but then decided not to use it. I wonder why – it seems just what you need here. So after a brief peek at the official documentation, I got this:That is all you need to read in the entire file. You don't need to – for some operations, it is sufficient to process one line at a time – but with the full data loaded and ready in memory, you can play around with it.The number of cells per row. Note that this first row contains the header, and you probably don't have any use for it. Let's ditch it.Done. A plain  removes the last item but you can also use an index. Alternatively, you could use the more pythonic (because "slicing")  but I assume this could involve copying and moving around large amounts of data.Look, there is data in memory! I pasted on the  because of the following:which showsbecause each line ends with a . This empty 'cell' can trivially be removed during reading (ideally), or afterwards (as we still have it in memory):and then you getand now you can use  to address any cell that you want (in valid ranges only, of course).Disclaimer: this is my very first look at the  module. Some operations could possibly be done more efficiently. Practically all examples verbatim from the official documentation, which proves it's always worth taking a look there first.
