I have a JSON file, and what I am trying to do is getting this specific field '_id'. Problem is that when I use , it says that my variable   is a list, not a dictionary, so I can't do something like:because I keep getting this error: TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strWhat I also tried to do is:It kinda works. Now, my type is a dictionary, and I can access like this: But I only get the first '_id' from the archive... So, what I would like to do is add all '_id' 's values into a list, to use later.Thanks for the help!
You want to print the  of each element of your json list, so let's do it by simply iterating over the elements:If you want to transform the list of elements into a list of ids for later use, you can use list comprehension:
As you can see the  is a  of for looping over  you need to use the following code
it says that my variable data is a list, not a dictionary, so I can't do something like:Yes, but you can loop over all the dictionaries in your list and get the values for their '_id' keys. This can be done in a single line using list comprehension:['5436e3abbae478396759f0cf', '5436e3acbae478396759f0d1', '5436e3acbae478396759f0d3', '5436e3acbae478396759f0d5']Another way to achieve this is using the map built-in function of python:This creates a function that returns the value of the key  from a dictionary using a lambda expression and then returns a list with the return value from this function applied on every item in
