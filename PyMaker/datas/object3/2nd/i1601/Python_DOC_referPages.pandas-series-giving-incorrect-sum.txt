This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                Why is this Pandas series giving sum = .99999999 where as answer is 1. In my program, I need to assert on 'sum is equal to 1'. And, assertion is failing even if condition is correct.The output is:
Use np.isclose to determine if two values are arbitrarily close. It's a remnant of how floats are stored in the machine
