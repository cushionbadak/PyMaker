I am new to python and programming, any help would be much appreciated! I am having trouble with a piece of coding I am writing in Python. My task is to write a function to calculate the number of times a particular letter appears divided by the total number of letters in that sequence.My function is supposed to return a list with the fraction of letters for each sequence.This is my code so far. The output gives me a fraction for only one sequence even tough the list  has four sequences.output: I have been trying my hardest to try and solve this problem, but quite honestly don't know where to start.

You could do it in a very readable and concise way using a list comprehension:
