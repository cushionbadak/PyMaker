I am trying to write a python script that takes one argument from the user.I want to throw a message if the input is not part of the list of possible inputs.However, I get the "Unknown direction..." message despite the right input being provided. What is the issue? Why the values are not being compared to the  list?
From the python docs - https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargsNote that nargs=1 produces a list of one item. This is different from  the default, in which the item is produced by itself.You'll need to make Also, you might want to look at the choices keyword argument to do that.
You can just use the  kwarg in  to do this for you.https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html#choices
