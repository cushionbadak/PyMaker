I have been struggling with this code for a couple hours and am not seeing much in previous questions that relates to it. I've gone down the rabbit hole trying to make it work so I think it's pretty inefficient at this point as well as isn't outputting in the manner I'd like.I am trying to get user input in the form of multiple grade entries, evaluate them based on grading criteria and then output the students grade in letter formAny advice on getting it to output correctly or on any better coding techniques would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ahead of time from a novice coder.Here is my code:and here is the output:The desired output is:
Its because your first loop to get i is completing before you make use of i, then i is already 3 when you loop through to print the results. Instead you should get the index in your second loop like this:and then eliminate the first loop.After looking again at the question i also noticed you were grabbing the "best score" from the same list every time, which would make each student have the same score. Im guessing you just want to grab the score for each student. I updated my answer to work for that - not sure if it was your desired behaviour.Edit: looked at it again and realized what you were doing with best score, fixed my answer here's the results when i run it:
this the correct way,in your code i=3 which is why you are getting the same answer for each student
As Quinn said, your top loop iterates over , which finishes at . Future references to  will yield 3.Some things I noticed:1) What you can do is check their grade at the same time as you loop through.2) Additionally, you don't need to find the maximum each loop, you can get it once outside the loop and then reference it inside.3) Finally, it looks quite ugly when you have all of these print statements, it makes it much nicer to read if you assign the grade in the if statements and then print once with the found grade, like so:There are some further small optimisations you can make as well. For example, the list comprehension you have:Is the classic case for a map:
