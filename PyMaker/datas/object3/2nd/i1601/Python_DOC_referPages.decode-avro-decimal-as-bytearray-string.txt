I'm using Kafka with Avro messages. One of my fields is defined like this:Using the Avro console consumer, I see a message like this:Which I expect to equal .Supposedly, the bytearray should be the twos-compliment of the number. I've tried using Python's  module to decode it, but the values I get don't make any sense:How can I validate the message? Can I decode the string somehow, or has the Avro console consumer corrupted it?
You seem to be going about this the Hard Way. The approach suggested by How to extract schema for avro file in python is to use:Single stepping in a debugger to see how the reader decodes your messages should get you closer to assembling a "raw" hand engineered decode.
