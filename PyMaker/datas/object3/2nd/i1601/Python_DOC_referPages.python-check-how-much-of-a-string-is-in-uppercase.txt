You can use  and  to clean out non-alphabetic chars and  to count uppercase chars and calculate the ratio:Also see the docs on  and  which you might find yourself using regularly. Moreover, this uses the fact that  is a subclass of  and is cast appropriately for the summation which might be too implicit for the taste of some.
Regex seems overkill here. You can use  with a generator expression:Or functionally via :Alternatively, via :
Generic solution that works with any boolean function and iterable (see below for version that only looks at ):Output:even better is schwobaseggl's  because it does not need to persist a list but instead uses a generator.Edit: 2nd version that only uses str.isalpha characters and allows multiple boolfuncs:Output:
Using regular expressions, this is one way you can do it  (given that  is the string in question):It finds the lista of both uppercase and lowercase characters and gets the percentage using their lengths.
Here is one way to do it:
Something like the following should work.
Try this, it's short and does the job:
