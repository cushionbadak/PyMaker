I'm supposed to write a function that does this specifically. And here is the file.customers.txt The Code
A simple solution would be iterate through the file using :
It's not clear from your syntax whether to return just the row as a string, or the fields split around the .  I have assumed the single-line.The python  function does not take an index, it just reads the next line from the file.  Below I used  (note the ) which reads all lines from the file.  If your file was huge, this would not be so efficient.Also a bit of error-handling for out-of-bounds  helps:Of course you may not want to read the whole file, just the next Nth recordObviously this code assumes that  is indexed 0 -> (N-1).
