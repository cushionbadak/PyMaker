I have a Test class with as many as 50 different method. I want to patch every method with a mock function.Is there any easy way to do this instead of repeating  50 times?
You can use  as a class decorator instead:Excerpt from the documentation:Patch can be used as a TestCase class decorator. It works by  decorating each test method in the class. This reduces the boilerplate  code when your test methods share a common patchings set.
