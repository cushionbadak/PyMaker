I have a Ubuntu LAMP webserver and data is being sent to the webserver continuously through HTTP POST method. I need to extract the data from HTTP POST and insert them in a Database. I don't know how to do that. There is a lot of example available on how to handle outgoing HTTP POST request but the incoming HTTP POST request. I want to write a python3 script which will extract the data from incoming HTTP POST request and save them as varible which I will use to insert the data into the database and also return a response to the client.Can anybody help me in this regard?
UPDATEAccording to the code you posted below, here is a working answer.Calling it with Postmanand the command line output isI combined answers from these here:Reference one, two and thirdAnd this is also very important to read:https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.htmlhttp.server is not recommended for production. It only implements basic security checks.I believe is ok for a small implementation and some testing around or proof of concept but eventually you'll need to manage this better, maybe I can suggest you to spend some time and use Flask, is actually an excellent & very light framework for Python API building and prototyping.-Previous answer (deprecated & updated above)-As per a very light and simple reference to this one:Update (without and API):Assuming you are running on or machine at a custom port with a custom trailing part at the URL, then "pure" python would look like this:I assume this way you can reuse the variables freely. Check also this reference here, Brenda's answer.
@oetoni, I am getting time out error while using:But I am getting the correct response while using this code:and it prints the received data on the web browser.I am using this script as a cgi script on the apache web server which can be accessed through a web browser. I am not running this script as a service or application. 
This code solved my problem. Now I can store HTTP POST data into variables with this python cgi script.my HTTP POST Request:http://your_server_url_or_IP/cgi-bin/python_script.py?m_site_name=MySite&m_first_name=anyname&m_last_name=anylastanme&m_device_name=anydeviceidorname
