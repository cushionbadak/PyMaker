If you read the error carefully you see that Python is complaining that you are trying to check if a  is inside a . You wrote , but since  is a list, you cannot do that.Instead, you should iterate over the words in your blacklist and check each word, like this:
if you only want to replace the exact matches, the  module can help:not that the example makes any sense but you may not want  in  replaced in this example:the words in your blacklist are matched only if it is surrounded by  (non-letter, non-number, not ). then i back-reference with  and  to add these characters again.
As per the error  it clearly states that you must pass the argument in a string format and not in list format. When you pass the list as an argument you must keep in mind that you need to iterate over each element of list and check that whether that element exists in your text string or not.Also note that as per your code you only just returned the new text but did not print so don't forget to do print if you are not doing in the python shell.print(censor("this is annoying me", ["annoying"]))If you do not want to pass list as an argument and want to check many words in text and replace it then you can also try for example-Here * takes multiple arguments!This will output as:
