I am new to python.  Currently, I have a timedata like  "2018-11-15 13:34:40.000 EST".  I want to convert it into EpochSecond. I know how to use dateparser to get this, however, I want to know is there a simple way to do this without dateparser?
 is what you're looking for (relevant part):For aware datetime instances, the return value is computed as:Example: Implemented into your example, we'll have to use another approach as  doesn't quite take timezone kindly due to a bug (relevant question where I found the info).  So we'll have to use another builtin to parse it (example here):The parsed string is still a  object so you can handle it the same after parsing.Note: however  might complain it read the timezone but not understood it: You might end up needing to pass the  into the  method anyhow:So I guess in the end it's not as simple as you might want.
