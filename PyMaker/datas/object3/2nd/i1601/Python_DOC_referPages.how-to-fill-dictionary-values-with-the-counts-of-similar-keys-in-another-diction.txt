I have a dictionary (studentPerf) which has all of the students in a school, with tuples as keys.  I want to count the number of male students and the number of female students in the school, and use this to update the values in a second dictionary. The second dictionary (dictDemGender) has 2 keys, male and female, and 0s as the values.  How can I change the 0s in dictDemGender to reflect the number of males and females in the school?Could I do this with dictionary comprehension?I've given the first few entries to studentPerf:I did ask a similar question but had diagnosed the problem incorrectly.  I previously asked for help with finding an average score. What I actually need is a count of the different key possibilities. I need to be able to do so without any outside packages unfortunately.
Use :Or, if you need empty counts also:Or, using  with :
Assuming the expected output is , consider using a .Initializing the two keys with zeros is not really necessary, you could also writebecause  lookup defaults to zero for missing keys:
As I said, I was looking for a solution that did not require outside packages.  I know the way I've gone about this is rather cumbersome but this was for a class and the exercise had these requirements.  I found a way to count all of the males and females and input those values into the dictDemGender dictionary.
