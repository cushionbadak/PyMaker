Your codewill not work, because you are missing the return statement in the line . So it should beBy the way - if possible, don't code things yourself, use the predefined library:
Your recursion will not work... you are missing a  statement and also the algorithm does not work...This is what a recursive gcd could look like:and here a non-recursive gcd:also note that you could just use .
