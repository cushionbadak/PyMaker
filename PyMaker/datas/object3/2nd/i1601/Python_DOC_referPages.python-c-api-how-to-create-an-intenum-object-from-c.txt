I want to create an IntEnum subclass called MqHandShakeE in C using  Tcl-C-Code from the example as templatemy Goal is to call a python function with…the C-constant  is an INTEGER Python only solution:this is type-safe because  has type  and value … this i can check… the sub-module approach from down is not type-safe… the  as sub-module has type 
After I had published a sample for C++, I realized that OP had tagged the question with C (not C++). Sorry, my fault. Here a sample in C:Compiled and tested in VS2013 with Python 3.6:This sample establishs a module  which- has to be appended to the Python tables (using )  before  has been called- has to be imported in the Python code (using ).The original answer with code in C++:I took a look at our Python wrappers and made a little sample for OPs case:Compiled and tested in VS2013 with Python 3.6:I must admit that I resembled this sample by cheating in our production code which we once did patiently while digging through the online resources. For a basic introduction, I recommend 1. Embedding Python in Another Application.The root module has to be imported in the Python code before it can be used ( in the Python sample code). In our productive code, we did it in a separate preceding call of , so that our Python application programmers even don't need to care about this.I splitted the implementation into multiple modules ( and ). This surely could be done even shorter by establishing a module  with the module variables , , and .
this is my answer… to create a type-safe IntEnum class in python-C-api.→  Python C-API… how to write python code in C
