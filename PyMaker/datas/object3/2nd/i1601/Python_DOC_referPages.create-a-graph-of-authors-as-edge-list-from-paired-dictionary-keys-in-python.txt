You can use list slicing on the  in combination with  to get your tuples to put into your graph:Output:with those tuples you can do:You should keep in mind that the order in which keys are presented might vary - if you need to ensure insertion order you need to use: up guarantees insertion order on dicts  up has insertion order by implementation detail/sideeffector use an OrderedDict to begin with ( or use  )For dict insertion order, read information @  Are dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?
