How could I convert a list into a nested list with increasing size of the sublists?For example,from to 
I'd do this with islices over an iterator of the original list. This way I can just specifiy the number of elements to take without having to worry at which position I am currently at. (In addition, the following code works with any iterable.)The last chunk might be truncated to whatever amount of elements the iterator had left.Demo:If you want to discard truncated chunks, adjust the code as follows:Now, truncated chunks are not included in the result.
As a follow up to timgeb's solution, without , you need to keep track of the index:
Several  and  to the rescue:
Assuming that you list length has the correct length for the last chunk to have the correct size, you can use list ,  and list comprehension to solve your problem in few lines:
