Natural Text
my wife texts me unorganized and long grocery lists. I will paste her list into a text file. I want to write a program that will will erase her unordered list and write to that file an ordered list. e.x. all fruit together, meat together ect. clearly this program is in its infancy. in my text file, I have written:in this case, when I iterate through each line of my text file, I expect  to be appended to fruit? but it is not. what have I missed?
You need to strip the line endings from the file, as they are carrying  or (Windows carriage return) at the ends. This means you are comparing  with , which are not equal, leading to nothing being appended. You can fix this by using  beforehand like so:Or you can just strip from the right with :You could also strip everything while iterating with :But the first two solutions are fine. 
Use  to cut '\n' simbols from end of lines    also you can use  to check items that starts with Upper letter
