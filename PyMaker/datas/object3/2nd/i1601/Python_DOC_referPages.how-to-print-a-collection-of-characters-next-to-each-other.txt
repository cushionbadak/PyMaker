This question already has an answer here:How to print without newline or space?                    26 answers                I have this code where given an integer n, I want to print out all integers in the interval [1â†’n] that divide n, separated with spaces. I wrote this code:I get this as the answer:But I want my answer next to each other, separated using spaces (so: ). How do I do this?
Instead of:You should put:This will change the end of line string from "\n" to " ". This will give you the desired output.Another method would be to build a list of results and print it out at the end:
I would suggest accumulating all intermediate results, and only when the computation is done, print it.If you want to print them with nice comma separation, you can do something like this:BenefitsFirst, this reduces the number of calls to wherever you are printing to (by default, this is stdout)Second, the code becomes more readable and easier to adjust and expand later-on (for example, if you later decide that you want to pass those dividers onto another function) Edit: adjusted the join operation per ritlew's comment
(with the comma) Should do the job.
