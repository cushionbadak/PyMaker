I even used print statements to check if y.name and favourite were the same when checking this and they were yet it still wasn't entering the if statement when using or I'm super confused as to why that is since I thought this was just a standard equality check (The beginning of the code is mostly set up, just included it for context in the case that there was a problem there and not the if statement). Thank you in advance!
I think you should add strip.("\n") before you compare two string.
