What kind of structure that a main Python process gets results from ProcessPoolExecutor after, on exemple, map command has been invoked.
You can call on executor.mapfunction for getting the results. Here's a really good example in python docs.EDITED (to answer the question)It uses a queue(from multiprocessing module) for scheduling calls and another for the results if any. Its like a consumer-producer model. I think that reading this code will be very enlightenment. Its very well documented.
