Natural Text
I'm creating a text based adventure game, and this is meant to be a small fight. The s  or  should be set to  at some point, but the code is stuck in a loop that goes passed .
Currently your  loop will go on forever since you set it to  initially, then never alter the  value you are using in the  to . Inside your loop you will have to have some condition check like this:If you set it to  like so, the next iteration of your  will check if , and since it's now , the  will not execute again. A  can also be used, but keep in mind that once a  is executed, any remaining code that has not been executed in that iteration of the  will not be executed.
