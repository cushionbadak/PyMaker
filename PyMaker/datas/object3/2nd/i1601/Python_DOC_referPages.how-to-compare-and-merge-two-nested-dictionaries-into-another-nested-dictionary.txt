I have two nested dictionaries -Task: for each test in Runid1, if the test is present in Runid2, we compare the two nested dictionaries for that test. Based on some condition(s), we compare each parameter (r-values) of both the dictionaries and create lists of such parameters, that qualify the condition. We add the result to another dictionary named 'Result'.Eg. For each test in Runid1, add to list all r values that are < 10 and diff between them is > 4.

You could try looping over the intersecting keys, then adding the results to a dictionary based on your conditions:Which gives the following:However, the above approach assumes ordering of keys with , which is only guaranteed in Python3.6+.If were using lower versions of Python, then we need to first check if the key from the first dictionary exists in the second dictionary:
