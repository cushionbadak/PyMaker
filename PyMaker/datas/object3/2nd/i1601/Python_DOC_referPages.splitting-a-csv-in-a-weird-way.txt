I'm currently trying to work with data about artists, their songs, and the lyrics. I have csv with the artist, the song name, and the lyrics in that order. I'm trying to split it so that I have each thing separate however the lyrics keep getting split whenever there is a new line. I've tried using this.However that just returned the error previously described. Does anyone know how to split this csv so that the lyrics do not get split?Edit: Example of what I'm trying to split.
Parsing a csv with lyrics has some non-trivial problems that are difficult to handle by yourself (I can see from your edition that you already figured this out). In particular, columns delimited by quotes and new lines or commas inside the data itself are difficult to parse and there are modules already designed for such tasks. I suggest trying with python's csv.reader or, better, with pandas.Using From the documentation: Using This will return a pandas  object and handling it correctly will involve some learning, but if you use python and csvs with python I strongly suggest giving it a try.
