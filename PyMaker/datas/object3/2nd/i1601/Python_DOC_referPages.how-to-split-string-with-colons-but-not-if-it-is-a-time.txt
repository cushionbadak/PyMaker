Given some long string:I want to be able to get a returning string with: UPDATE THIS IS MY CODE (not working because it either splits the string or not at all):
Why it isn't working:You're asking it to search the entire string  for one pattern, .  If a match is found, you want it to search the entire string  again, but this time for the pattern .  If the first pattern is found, but the second pattern is not found, the substitution  is made, replacing all  in  with .  What you probably want to do is either:1) Combine a negative lookbehind  with a negative lookahead  in your pattern to define a pattern which describes "colons but not if it's a time".or2) Search the string for a colon, then search the region around that match to see if the match is part of a time; if not, replace that item.  Certainly (1) is more efficient, but implementing (2) will help you understand why your solution isn't working.  This may be helpful:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search Solution to #1:The complete match pattern you're looking to replace should be:So your one-liner would be:(Aren't regular expressions just so aesthetically pleasing?)Try plugging it in here to test: https://www.debuggex.com/(Remember to switch to  in the dropdown menu.)EDIT:I forgot Python's lookbehinds have to be fixed width. A sloppy fix is to use the pattern:The caveat here is that it recognizes "garbage like11:45 and whatnot" as containing a time, but correctly identifies that "garbage like1:45 and whatnot" does not contain a time.EDIT #2:A little further checking shows that Javascript doesn't support lookbehinds at all, so many online regex testers might fail to execute this, even if you toggle them into Python mode.
You can use this:Which will match colons only if they are preceded and followed by a non-numeric () character, using the  and  lookaround assertions
