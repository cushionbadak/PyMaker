I have a 2D list containing lists of different words. I have a set of 12 nested for loops. I need to loop through every possible combination of elements in the 2D list and perform a simple calculation on the result. I originally did this using the itertools.product() function, followed performing the calculation on each resulting list, however the result of the itertools.product() call became too large and I would run out of memory. This means I need the calculation to be performed after every iteration. My code looks something like this:This code works fine and does what I need. However, I want to know if there is a way I can condense this down in a more pythonic way?
Use , just iterate through the iterator, don't build a list with it:
