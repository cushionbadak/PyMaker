Suppose I have a base class with unimplemented methods as follows:Now, let's say one of my colleagues uses the Polygon class to create a subclass as follows:(H/Sh)e has forgotten to implement the area() method.How can I force the subclass to implement the parent's area() method?
this could be your parent class:although the problem will be spotted at runtime only, when one of the instances of the child classes tries to call one of these methods.a different version is to use .you will not be able to instantiate a  without it having all the methods implemented.this is the  syntax; in  you'd need toalso note that for the binary special functions   it is better to  instead of raising .
That's exactly what  are used for :)In your base class
You can raise  exception in base class method.Also you can use , but then you need to declare metaclass to be , which would make your class abstract. More about  module
