I have a list of tuples which I want to convert to a Series.  I attempt to do this by converting the list to a dictionary and then to a Series:The resulting Series however, doesn't behave as I need it to.  It seems to drop  pairs (possibly arbitrarily?)E.g.How would I obtain a series without dropping any key value pairs?
Use  constructor with  by first column, then select second column for :Or create 2 lists and pass to  contructor:
Using  and sequence unpacking:With duplicate indices, as in your data,  will not help as duplicate dictionary keys are not permitted:  will only take the last value for every key supplied.

The problem is that when you convert a list of tuples to a dictionary, Python drops all duplicate keys and only uses the last value for each key. This is necessary since each key can only appear once in a dictionary. So you need to use a method that preserves all the records. This will do that:Example:
