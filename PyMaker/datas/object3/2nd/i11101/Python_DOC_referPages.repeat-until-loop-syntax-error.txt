I'm still getting a handle on python and have been trying to implement a REPEAT UNTIL loop using online tutorials. Everything seems to be in order but I keep getting a syntax error but I absolutely cannot find an error with my syntax! Can someone help me? My code is;detvar is my string variable the error is for the 'detvar' on the last line. 
This is all you need: and  are not valid expressions in Python. Instead, you want to use , which is what you originally had.The  statement allows you to continue iterating as long as a condition holds true. Alternatively, you can repeat until something is true by negating the condition.So,  iterates the body of the loop (which is everything indented under the colon) until  is equal to .Edit: In accordance with Bryan Oakley's comment,  is initialized as a value that is not  so that the loop body executes at least once.
This is a horribly worded question, and I have no idea what this code is meant to accomplish, but I'll see if I can decipher this. There's no need to use "REPEAT," just doIt should exit the loop when devtar = "SABRE" automatically.
