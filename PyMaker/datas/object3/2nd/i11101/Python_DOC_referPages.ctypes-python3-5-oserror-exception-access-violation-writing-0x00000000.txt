Researching other similar errors, I think that I have an issue with a an illegal operation such as writing to an address that I shouldn't be. I'm not sure how to resolve this. Any help please?Exact error I'm getting:Functions I'm callingGetSoftwareVersion() contentsedit: adding the relevant C++ code
You're getting the error  because of the statement .  As suggested by the ctypes documentation for  you're passing an integer address.What you're telling  to do is make a new  pointing to , then trying to  to it via .  If you were to use , you'd get , if , then at , and so on.  It's very unlikely that your memory should or will want to allow you to write to that location, hence the error.What you likely want to do is use , where  is the size of the array needed to contain the output of .  , as the name suggests, will give you a mutable char buffer that's initialized to null bytes (e.g.  means  is size 3, with contents ).  You could guess and check or look at the source of  to hunt down the safe value of , or just give yourself something huge (for a version number) like  and pick something sane from there.
