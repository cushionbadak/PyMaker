I am trying to create a python script that well periodically connect to haproxy socket, send a "show info" command and exit. This script will be used along with keepalived in order to determine, through this script, when to switch master/slave servers. Therefore, my goal is that my python script been non-blocking.  Within my script, i have initiated a SysLogHandler to send to my local syslogd various messages (exceptions e.t.c). However, i don't know if SysLogHandler is Blocking or not.
The python documentation on logging is the main point where you should start. is a subclass of (There are many more. See the docs).This is the relevant part that you are looking for I think.I went a bit further and checked the actual implementation of Handler.You can see that it uses threading.RLock().
