 will do this, but you need to divide the value by  first (the numeric value you give and JavaScript's  expects is in milliseconds since the epoch, where Python's API takes a floating point seconds since the epoch):That makes the raw  object; if you want it formatted the same, you should take a look at  object's  method.
It's almost the same. You just have to convert the units.Date from javascript specifies the number in milliseconds, in other words, expects a number in millisenconds as a parameter. When the python  date takes seconds.
