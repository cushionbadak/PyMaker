I am stucked at this code for creating unittest for infinite loop.Please let me know how can we create unittests for infinite loop?
What behaviour are you testing? There doesn't appear to be any side effects or return value here. There isn't really anything to test. If it's just that  is called after the loop then that sounds like over-specification. If it's just that some invariant is maintained after the loop ends then you can patch  to throw an exception, and then examine the state after the function has run.module_under_test.py
You could code the infinite loop using the  fun—Åtion instead of . This might make the code slightly less efficient, but it makes it possible to mock the infinite loop:Then in your test do:
