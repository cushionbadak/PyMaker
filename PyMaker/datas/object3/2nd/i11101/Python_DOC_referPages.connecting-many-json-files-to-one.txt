There are two ways you could do this - by working on strings, or by working with Python-JSON data structures. The former would be something likeOr if you want to work with Python loaded-JSON thenThis latter will validate all your incoming json-strings ( will throw an exception for any bad JSON) and will be more efficient for large numbers of devices. It's therefore to be preferred unless you are working in a RAM-constrained embedded system with small numbers of devices, where the greater memory footprint of the latter is a problem.
The  module can be used.Output (prettified):
