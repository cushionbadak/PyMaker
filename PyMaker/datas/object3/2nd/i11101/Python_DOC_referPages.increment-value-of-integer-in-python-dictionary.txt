So I write an app that counts amount of yellow cards in football matches through all the games of the tournament.So let's say I count all Brazil's goals and I need to increment the amount of yellow cards with each game I go through in a loop.So I have this dictionary cards_per_team_dictionary that looks like this:and I wan't to increment the int value with each game. I tried the following but it doesn't seem to work:I get an error:And also this:But it seems to overrun the previous integer instead of adding up to it.Thanks in advance!
You have created a set not a dict:To create a dict, you add key/value pairs separated by a colon i.e  :Both a dict and set literals use , one difference being  creates an empty dict where  is needed to create an empty set. If you want to add a key value pairing:But for repeating keys you can use dict.setdefault:A more efficient option is to use a defauldict:In both cases if the key does not exist it is added with the new value, if it does exist the value for the key is increased.
