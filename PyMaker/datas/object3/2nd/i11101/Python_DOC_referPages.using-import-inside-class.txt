I am completely new to the python class concept. After searching for a solution for some days, I hope I will get help here:I want a python class where I import a function and use it there. The main code should be able to call the function from the class. for that I have two files in the same folder.Thanks to @cdarke, @DeepSpace and @MosesKoledoye, I edited the mistake, but sadly that wasn't it.I still get the Error:@wombatz got the right tip: it must be self.zeit.sleep(2) or Test.zeit.sleep(2). the import could be also done above the class declaration. Test.Pyandrun.pywhen I try to  I get this error:What I understand from the error is that the import in the class is not recognized. But how can I achive that the import in the class is recognized?
Everything defined inside the namespace of a class has to be accessed from that class. That holds for methods, variables, nested classes and everything else including modules.If you really want to import a module inside a class you must access it from that class:But why would you import the module inside the class anyway? I can't think of a use case for that despite from wanting it to put into that namespace.You really should move the import to the top of the module. Then you can call  inside the class without prefixing  or .Also you should not use non-english identifiers like . People who only speak english should be able to read your code.
You want time.sleep. You can also use;Edit: Importing within class scope issues explained here.

You're almost there!  is a function within the  module. This means that the name  doesn't exist unless its understood within the context of , unless you define it on your own. Since you didn't define it on your own, you can access it by running .In your specific example, you used:you'll have to run:Alternatively, you can import sleep directly from time, by running:Good luck!You can read more about the time module here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.htmlYou can learn more about imports here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.htmland I highly recommend learning about namespace in python, here: https://bytebaker.com/2008/07/30/python-namespaces/
