I have a regex that searches for  or .  If it finds , it replaces it with .  If it finds , it replaces it with .Here is what it looks like in Perl:  is the eval option.   is a concatenation.   acts as an if statement.How can I do the same thing in Python 3?  I'm looking for something like:I guess I have two main roadblocks.  Firstly, I don't know how to obtain the  object within a regex substitution.  Secondly, I don't know if eval is supported by python or what the best alternative is.
Python has no strange language syntax related to regular expressions - they are performed in well-behaved function calls.So instead of a part of the call arguments that are executed on match, what you have is a callback function: all you have to do is to put a callable object as the second argument, instead of the substitution string. The callable receives the match object as its sole argument.In this case, all you need is an inline  - so you can even define the callable as a lambda expression:
