Lets say I get 66 and 72, then I first sort them by the "small number", that is 6 and 2 in my numbers, then put them in a lost, and then do the process all over again but for the number 6 and 7 (the bigger number). In its current shape I get the error "Queue" object is not iterable.My Queue class is looking like this, I think this one is okay.
You need to add a bit more code to make it an iterable.  should return an iterator. The iterator should have a  method.Take a look at this:Build a Basic Python IteratorSo it is my understanding that the thing you want to iterate over is the contents of ... Why not just return 's iterator.Here is the easiest way to do that:It's a bit hard to see what exactly it is that you want.. If what you are trying to do is empty as you iterate over it (Queue is a fifo kinda deal) it then rather do this:
