This question already has an answer here:Check if a number is int or float                    14 answers                Pretend there are three float values being passed through this function.  The function takes the first two values and subtracts the second from the first.  If the result of that subtraction is less than or equal to the value of the parameter tolerance, it returns true.  I want to set up another test in there.  How do you tell a function to return None if the arguments passed to it are not floats?
You can ask the type of a variable in python with  or : 
You can use "if type(variable) is not float:". For example
