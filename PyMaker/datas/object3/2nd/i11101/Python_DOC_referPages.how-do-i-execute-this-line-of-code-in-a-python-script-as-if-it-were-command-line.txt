I'm trying to write a script to duplicate running the line:in a python script, like it were via cmd. I've tried a variety of subprocess.Popen commands and none of them work (all get the Errno2 file not found). I currently have and I have tried several other variations. I'm mainly concerned with the space between the .bat and .py portions of the command. Should I just use r'' with a space between the two?
You probably need to use  in the POpen call. But note the warnings about potential security issues found in the documentation.
I had tried something like this. Let me know if this suits your requirement. Here is the reference link
