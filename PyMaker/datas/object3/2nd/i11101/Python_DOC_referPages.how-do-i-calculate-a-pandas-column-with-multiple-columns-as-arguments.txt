I was using a wind speed calculation function from lon and lat components:and calling it to calculate a new pandas column from two existing ones:Since I changed from Python 2.7 to Python 3.5 the function is not working anymore. Could the change be the cause?In a single argument (column) function:I am now using:And it works fine.Could you help me?
I would try to stick to existing numpy/scipy functions as they are extremely fast and optimized (numpy.hypot):Timing: against 300K rows DF:Conclusion: vectorized approach was 230 times fasterIf you have to write your own one, try to use vectorized math (working with vectors / columns instead of scalars): demo:same vectorized approach with  function:
If want to use , add :Without :map(function, iterable, ...)Return an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable, yielding the results. If additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel. With multiple iterables, the iterator stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted. For cases where the function inputs are already arranged into argument tuples, see itertools.starmap().Another solution:
