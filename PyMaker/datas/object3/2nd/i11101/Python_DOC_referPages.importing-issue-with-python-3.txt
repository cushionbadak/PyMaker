I have a code that runs in Python 2.7 but not in 3.5 and I can't find the reason. It has to do with importing.The root folder has a subfolder called . From the root folder, I am running the script  which includes the line .In the folder , there is a file called  which has the import line: which tries to import the class saved in  which is located in the subfolder  as well.When I run the script  from the root folder, I get the  saying "No module named ".In Python 2.7 this runs without problems. Can someone please suggest what may be the issue and how this should be done differently in Python 3.5?
Implicit imports within packages are not available for Python 3, so to get this to work you will need to use an explicit relative import:This should work for both Python 2 and Python 3.  This also makes your intention more clear that you want to import from a relative package, not an installed package.
