Is there a way to change resources available to a running process from ? Namely I would like to change  : limit.I know I can use  and spawn process from that shell, but that would require stopping that process beforehand.I'm also aware of , but it's not available in  with .Python  module apparently allows changing limits just for itself...I have found the following blog article, which explains how to do it with  and I'm just hoping that something similar exists in .Essentially I think I'm asking how to make  system-call for a running process from the Python program.
Take another look at the  library. The function  takes a  as its first argument, and raises  if a process by that ID cannot be found. So I believe it's exactly what you're looking for.resource.prlimit(pid, resource[, limits])Combines setrlimit() and getrlimit() in one function and supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary process. If pid is 0, then the call applies to the current process. [...]When  is not given the function returns the resource limit of the process pid. When  is given the resource limit of the process is set and the former resource limit is returned.The catch is that this function is not present in Python 2.7. Hopefully you can dip your toes in python 3 for this one task.
