Consider the following regex, which checks for password strength.  It has the start and end string anchors, to ensure it's matching the entire string.I noticed Python 3.5 has a re.fullmatch() which appears to do the same thing, but without the string anchors:Is this the intended purpose of fullmatch?  Are there any situations where this could cause unintended issues?
The  function and  method are new in Python 3.4.The changelog is very explicit about it:This provides a way to be explicit about the goal of the match, which  avoids a class of subtle bugs where $ characters get lost during code  changes or the addition of alternatives to an existing regular  expression.So, the way you use it is indeed the intended purpose of this feature. It can not lead to unexpected issue,  and  are just carefully added internally.
