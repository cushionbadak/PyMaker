I am trying to run SUMO through traci interface. I copy pasted this example from this link. The code is as followsWhen I try to run the code, it throws me the following errorAnyone know what is wrong.
Looks like you're running in an  notebook. They have non-standard "standard" I/O streams that can't be used like a "true" file object (because they're really data queues, not pipes, so they don't have a file descriptor to use for low level I/O).You can't use them with libraries (like ) that perform low level I/O; the error is there to tell you this.. You'll need to use a real file-like object, possibly something as simple as sending output to a  and then copying output from the file to  if that's what you need.It's possible it would work by just not passing   and  arguments at all; the default behavior for  is to use the same  and  as the parent, so if there are valid file handles opened (even if the notebook replaced / for Python use), it might "just work" (where "just work" includes the possibility that data sent to the underlying file descriptors  and  is discarded, so you never see it).Or just don't run in the ipython notebook.
The problem was that my command line used Python 2 whereas the spyder IDE used python 3. Since I wont be needing to pass any more arguments to the stdin, I removed the option and simply tried to open the sumo-gui with  as follows. It works now.
