I'm working on Python 3.5.1 and I want to be able to tell if a function has returned as coroutine object but I cannot find where the coroutine type is defined, instead as of late I've been using the below snippet to get the type through instantiating a coroutine with a function.There's got to be a better way to do this, my question is where is this type defined so I can use it directly?
Probably the best way to access the coroutine type is through the  module:That's not actually where the coroutine type is defined -  does pretty much the same thing you're doing to get at it - but it's the standard Python-level way to access the type.If you want to see the actual definition of the type, that's in  and . Look for the parts that say  or .
The best way to tell if a function is a coroutine is with . 
Python's coroutine type is defined in , which is imported in , which itself is imported in asyncio.coroutines.  Not sure how this helps you more than @dirn's answer though (which is how to tell if a function is a coroutine).
