I need to turn the input_string into the comment below using a for loop. First I sliced it using the  function, but now I need to somehow turn the input string into . I tried replacing the  and the dash for nothing (), but the string output is unchanged.  Please don't import anything, I'm trying to do this with functions and loops only.When I type , the output is  therefore nothing is happening.
Use the re module's  function and .Using no imports, you can use a list comprehensionThe algo here is, we loop through the string after splitting it on . Now we split the individual words on  and the first element of these on . We now have the number and the words, which we can easily .Complete explanation of the list comp answer -To understand what a list comprehension is, Read What does "list comprehension" mean? How does it work and how can I use it?Coming to the answer,Splitting the input list on , gives us the list of individual file namesNow using the list comprehension construct, we can iterate through this,As we need only the file name and not the extension, we  by using  and take the first value.Now again, what we need is the number and the name as two parts. So we again split by Now we have the [number, name] in a list, However the format that we need is . Hence we have two optionsConcat them like . This is an unnecessarily long wayReverse them and join. We can use slices to reverse a list (See How can I reverse a list in python?) and  to join like .So we get our final list comprehension
Here's a solution using list comprehension and string manipulation if you don't want to use re.The way this list comprehension works is:Take the list of results and remove the ".xls". Split on the  and switch positions of the number and "result". For every item in the list, join the list into a string.
