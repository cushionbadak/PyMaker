Given a string with codon letters I canÂ´t figure what the following program is explicitly doing. I know that it goes through the whole string but what is it doing exactly ?  The response is [5, 28]. 
This list comprehension goes through string  one index at a time and checks 2 conditions:Is the character at index  in the string ?Is the character before the character at index  not equal to ?If both those conditions are  then  is added to a new list (which in this example isn't being saved).The output is telling you the characters at index 5 and index 28 meet these conditions (the output doesn't seem to be right for this string though). Remember strings are 0 indexed, meaning the first letter of the string is accessed via .Additional info:StringsList Comprehensions
