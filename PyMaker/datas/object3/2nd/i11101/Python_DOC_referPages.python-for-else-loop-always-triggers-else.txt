Natural Text
I am trying to read a tab-separated file and collect all characters except control characters. If a control character is hit, the remainder of line should be ignored too.I've tried the following code in Python 3.5, using a  loop:I'd expect this to check each character for being a control character and if it hits one ( is triggered), skip to the next line, hence trigger the / statement.What happens instead is that  is always triggered, even if the  statement in the  clause is never reached for a line. Consequently, the final  statement is never reached either.What am I doing wrong?
The  block of a  loop is only executed if the  loop never was interrupted. You'll only see the  statement in the  block executed if there were no control characters in the line. From the  statement documentation:When the items are exhausted (which is immediately when the sequence is empty or an iterator raises a  exception), the suite in the  clause, if present, is executed, and the loop terminates.A  statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the  clauseâ€™s suite.A better test to see if there are control characters in a line is to use the  function with a generator expression:or you could use a regular expression; this'll be faster as the looping over text is done in C code without having to box each individual character in a new  object:
