Natural Text
So whilst programming part of my homework, I decided to include validation within my program. However whilst adding in validation using the  command, when having a sentence with letters in it, I get the error message for when typing in numbers. Sorry, cant display all of my program but i have included a test bed of code I programmed to test whether the  command works, for validating whether only alphabetic letters are entered. Test data entered = one of several testing examples
If you enter more than one word, there are non-alpha characters in your input (spaces in the case of the input ). Those cause  to fail.Also, your error message is misleading - a single non-alpha character is enough to trigger the error, not "invalid letters only".If you want to allow spaces in your input as well (but no punctuation or digits or other non-letter characters), you could do
