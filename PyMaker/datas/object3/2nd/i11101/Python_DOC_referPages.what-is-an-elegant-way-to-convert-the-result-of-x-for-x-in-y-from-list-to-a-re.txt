What is an elegant way to convert the result of  from list to a regular variable?The result of the above will be .I am now using  but ...it does not look right :-)thanks
You have a list comprehension on the right hand side. It evaluates to a list.You want to pick up the first element (which is perhaps the only element for the kind of problems you are trying to solve) from it, so index the 0-th element in the list returned by the list comprehension, just like you would do it for a regular list.You can also use a generator expression instead of a list expression and then call the next() function to retrieve the first item from the iterator returned by the generator expression.
You can use  that retrieves the next object from the iterator. The parameter that goes within  is a generator. This allows saves you from fully constructing the list and then filtering for . Instead it only iterates until it hits , and wont evaluate until the next  is called on the generator object.
