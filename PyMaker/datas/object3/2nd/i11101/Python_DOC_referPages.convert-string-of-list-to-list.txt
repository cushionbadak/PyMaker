I have the list of strings: and I want to convert it to 
You can use  inside a list comprehension to do this. As  is not the proper representation of a python list in a string, we can remove the brackets to get  which on splitting becomes . This can be easily converted to a integer nested list by casting it to an int using the  callable. For further reading What does "list comprehension" mean? How does it work and how can I use it? 
Your strings  aren't formatted like python lists (commas are missing).  You've got a couple options depending on how robust your parser needs to be:This will work so long as you don't have any inner strings formatted like:  (the leading space will mess it up)I think that probably the most robust parser that I can think of is to remove the  and  and them parse it yourself:
As long as the strings are fairly regular, this should work:
Use a regular expressionIn case it is not always well-formated. 
The simpler the solution, the better it is for others to understand.Well here is my solution:So I using list-comprehension here. The 'map' function returns a list. The code  will split each string on space character(s) and the each string token would then be converted to 'int' which is the function I've passed to the map function.Need more explanation over my code?
