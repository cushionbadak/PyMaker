I have the following command which adds a user to the administrator group of a  instance,When I run this command on my terminal, it runs perfectly and gives the expected output.But, I want to execute this command in python either using the  or  library.Using  I wrote the following code,It shows no error but no changes are seen in the administrator group.I tried the same using ,This throws an error, it cannot find the account .The variable mentioned  is of the form host_ip:port.I have tried a lot to fix these errors. I dont know where I am going wrong. Any help would be appreciated.  
a) string escapingFor the subprocess/curl usage, you should be escaping your string tokens rather than manually adding extra :Escape using  before the character i.e. usingwill keep the  around the Content-Type section.More on escape characters here: Lexical Analysis - String Literals...The backslash () character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning...b) Looking at the  docs their example uses  to split their command line into args.  splits the string a bit differently:you can see  removes excess quoting.c) http response codeTry using  option in  to get a HTTP response code back (and the rest of the HTTP headers):Even though you're using  to start/make the request, it should still print the return value to the console(stdout).d) putting it all togetherI changed the how the  and  are interpolated into the string.If none of this helps, and you're getting no response from gerrit, I'd check gerrit logs to see what happens when it receives your request.
you should try [] () or () to post json data ;for  : (https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess#subprocess.Popen.communicate) may give you help,or just exec bashCommand in shell to see the difference;for  , I have not use it ,but please you add error info.
