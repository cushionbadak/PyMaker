I'm following a tutorial on neural nets1It's in Python 2.7. I'm using 3.4. This is the line that troubles me:I get: .Is there a way to rewrite it so that it works in 3.4?
If you know that the iterator is finite:Or if you know that  is always small and a profiler says that the code is the bottleneck in your application then here's code that might be more efficient for small :Unfortunately,  (Python 3.4+) returns zero for a  object. See PEP 0424 -- A method for exposing a length hint.
A bit late now to answer, but in case anyone else stumbles on it: for that same neural net example tutorial, it turned out I had to wrap the 3 zip calls in the mnist_loader with a list(zip(...)) construct:And then it worked.
Force the  to evaluate.
Some InfoThis is because in the Python 3.x,  returns a generator object. This object is not a list (it's better) but it behaves like one. You can try iterating through it like this:The Quick AnswerPlease show us the code surrounding where the error happened.But I think I can still give you a quick (and not necessarily good) solution.turn thisinto this:
In mnist_loader wrap your zip results in  constructs like below
