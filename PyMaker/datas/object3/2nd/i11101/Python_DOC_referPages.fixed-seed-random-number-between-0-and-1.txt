I want to generate list of fixed random numbers by giving a seed between 0 and 1 in python. For example, l = [0.1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 0.75]. I can get this by using random.random(). But every time it gives a new random number list. I want to fix it by giving some some seed. How can I do that. Thanks in advance!
you can do it like this:it will always give same random list.
Check out pydocs page for random.seed()Calling the above will return the same list each time.  In other words, the output is deterministic and predictable.Note that Python 3 users have to use .
