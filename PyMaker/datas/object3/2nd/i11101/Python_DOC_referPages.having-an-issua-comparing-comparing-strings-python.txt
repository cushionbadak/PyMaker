Probably there is an easier way to do this, but i read there is no Switch/case in Python. I wanted to ask the user, to introduce a name of a color, and after calling the function that should take care of that, it should return the color code in RGB. My if statements should also accept when the first letter or the whole word is in capital.The wierd thing that is happening to me is, i keep geting results on my console that makes no sence, i am SURE that there is (somewhere) a mystake from me!After puting the same input, exacly the same word, the results on the console are not the same.AT the moment this is my exact code.Console output:it seems every 2 times i write something, if gives me back the color RGB code.what i keep finding hard to understand, is why this:is not showing the exact same thing.Thanks for the help guysEDDIT1: i found out using extras on those prints, that he is not getting to those 2 last prints. Still to know why..EDDIT2: i notice my own error.. saying white is (255,0,0) :D
The way you return the color could be simplified a lot by doing this. It also fixes your bug.You should familiarize yourself with , , and some basic Python functions. They make life a lot easier!https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlP.S. Your  and  rgb values are the same.
first i'd rewrite the get_color function to something more like this
