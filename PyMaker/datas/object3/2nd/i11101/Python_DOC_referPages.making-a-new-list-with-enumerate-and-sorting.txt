I am brand new to python and coding in general. I'm actually a Cinema 4D artist. C4D has a built in python script manager. I will do my best to explain what I'm trying for.I have a sphere. The sphere is broken up into points. I have calculated the distance each point on the sphere is away from a different object. I have made a list of all these calculated distances. I would like to make a new array of the index and the corresponding distance calculation. How do I combine the two lists into a new array? Mock example below -It returns the correct number of indices needed [0,1,2,3,4,5]my desired result would look like a combination - something like this:For bonus I would like to dynamically sort the new "preweight" array based on the distance calculation. So as I move the object around the array sorts from closest point to furtherest point. Kinda like this:Thanks in advance. I am really enjoying the help this site provides.
Use . When called on a list and iterated over, it returns elements of the list as a tuple of .For the second half of your question, use .  when called with a  will use the value returned by the function applied on the item for  sorting. In your specific case,  would be something that would take an element and return the second item of the tuple. Something like: 
To add to SuperSaiyan's answer, the built-in  provides a more robust tool for solving all similar problems. While  simply pairs a list of elements with their indexes automatically,  requires that you provide a series of iterables that it will group together:However  also allows you to do some other cool things like grouping more than two iterables, and "unzipping" a list elements that are equal length pairs. Continuing from the previous example:
