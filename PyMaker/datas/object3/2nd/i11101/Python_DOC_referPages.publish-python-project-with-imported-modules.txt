I would like to publish a python project, but i use modules in it like socket. How do i add to the project code that is not mine? Is that even legal?
There's no need to add modules that are in the standard library. For other dependencies, you can test if the module is available () and notify the user to install it or even automatically install itpackage your program and have pip install the dependencies for youuse cx_freeze or similar to make a stand-alone package from your program that includes the modulesIf you're on Windows, you could package it yourself with the minimal Embedded Distribution (from Python 3.5). See the Python wiki on deployment for further reading.Observe the licenses of your 3rd party modules.
