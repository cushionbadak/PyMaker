Isn't there a uniform way to access parameters by name (and not by position), which doesn't depend on the way the function was invoked? Please note that:I'm not interested in , because I'm talking about the case where I don't know the signature of  in advance and yet I want to know if a particular parameter exists (by name).Clearly that's related to decorators, but I've written the example in a simpler way (or I hope so).EDITMany thanks for the answers about inspect.signature. Using that, my new version of  is:
Isn't there a uniform way to access parameters by name (and not by  position), which doesn't depend on the way the function was invoked?Yes by ing the :Note that trying to bind the signature to an invalid call will raise similar/same TypeError that would be raised when calling the function with invalid arguments.  Also arguments that use the default will not be present in  unless you call Also note that keyword only arguments will be in  dictionary instead of :
