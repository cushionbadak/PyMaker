Natural Text
Here is what I have:I'm trying to tell python to pull the integers from a string and print the largest one.  My code isn't working however, and I would appreciate any help with fixing it without using something like import re. 
If you create a generator that yields only the digits in the string, you will be able to use .
You can use 'filter' combined with a lambda expression. I don't know if it's the better solution, but I will put here to show another way to solve the problem.
