I need some help in writing a python program that will implement a circular queue data structure (array-backed). I've completed a few of the methods already but I'm a bit stumped when it comes to adding and taking things away from the queue, as well as checking the values within it. I believe this is of the first-in-first-out structure. Here's what I have for the body so farWhat I 've written thus far makes the most sense to me but if I were to test this with the following code block I'd get an error saying 10 != 4. This code will fail the 9th line of the test,  I'm unsure why my code is producing the value 10 at this time. What would allow for this class to pass the given test?
I'm pretty sure that all the code using  is wrong. That attribute isn't needed at all. The whole point of the  attribute is to use it to store the values. Use the indexes  and  to figure out where in  to put things (and where to take them from):You should probably also have a  method.
I'd get an error stating that the Queue class doesn't have a data attributeI don't have the error you mention when running your test on your code.
If for some reasons you don't want to use built-in collections.deque module, here is an example of how you can implement your own circular buffer:
