Natural Text
I'm very new to python and have been trying out codewars. Some problems pretty difficult for me. What I'm trying to accomplish is,"to know the index of the vowels in a given word, for example, there are two vowels in the word super (the second and fourth letters)." I don't really understand how to use index and/or find. I need to know I can edit this code to find the positions of the vowels in any given word.
Check the documentationhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methodshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.indexBuild your code around the method:Output:This is really a list object, but Python prints its elements.As pointed out by @PM 2Ring, this only finds the first occurence of the vowel in the string. This is for two reasons:Each vowel is only tested once only finds the leftmost match (see also rfind()):Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end].So I pointlessly complicated the code as follows to make it work:Output
You don't call  or  like that. They both take arguments of the formwhich means they take a single substring to search for, possibly followed by a start index to specify where in the target string to start searching from, possibly followed by an (exclusive) end index to specify where to stop searching.However, this isn't really a job for  or . Both of those methods have to do a linear scan over the string they search, and to find all vowels you have to loop over all the vowels, so you effectively have a double loop.Fortunately, Python provides a more efficient way: put the vowels into a set and then loop over the letters in the word and test if each letter is in the vowel set. Testing set membership is very efficient and it doesn't involve a linear scan over the set. To catch all vowels we need to put both the upper-case & lower-case vowels into our set. To keep track of the position of each vowel in the word we can use the  function. output
str.index:Like S.find() but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.To find the vowels in a given word you need to take one note as you already mentioned in your question, some words can have more than one vowel (i.e.,"enumerate"), so this is one way to deal with them: Also refer to the documentation Common string operationsExamples for string find in PythonPython String index() MethodHow to get the position of a character in Python?
