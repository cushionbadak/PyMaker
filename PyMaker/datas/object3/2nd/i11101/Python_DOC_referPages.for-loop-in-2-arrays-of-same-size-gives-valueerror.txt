I'm trying to go through 2 arrays of same length in a  loop, but I'm getting a ValueError: too many values to unpackHere is the code generating the error :If I'm not mistaken, there should be a way to do this but I don't see where the mistake comes from
 the lists before you iterate through them. A  loop cannot iterate through multiple iterables as such.The  function combines all the passed iterables into a single iterator.Note: The returned iterator is only as long as the shortest list passed to it.
