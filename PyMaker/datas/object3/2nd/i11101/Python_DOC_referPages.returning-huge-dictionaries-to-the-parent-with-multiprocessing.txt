I am doing a CPU expensive computation that can be easily divided into many workers. However, I have to join the results at the end. The problem is that you can not use shared memory when using multiple isolated processes, and the only way of sending the computed output from the child to the parent is using ,  or . All these approaches pickle the object and sends it using some kind of IPC. I timed all the different parts of the operation, and processing the data is way faster with the processes, however getting the object is too slow, and its always faster if I do not use multiprocessing.Is there a way to achieve the same level of shared memory we get when using  ? I would like to be able to do something like:
you can try pickle dictionaries your self, i recommend using dill module for that (but there are other module you can use too), so it would look something like this:than you can use to get dictionary:
