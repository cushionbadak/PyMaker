In Python, I am creating an array that contains a prufer sequence, i.e. an array of length n-2 that consists of integers between 0 and n-1. For example, (3,4,3,1,2) is a prufer sequence for n=7. I do not know n in advance. I would like to create a prufer sequence, do something with that prufer sequence, create another one, do something with the new sequence, and so on.I was wondering what the fastest way to generate all n^(n-2) prufer sequences.
You seem to be looking for the cartesian product of the  , the function  will do this for you:
