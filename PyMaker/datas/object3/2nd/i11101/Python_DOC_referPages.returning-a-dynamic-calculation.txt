I am pretty sure this is the easiest mistake i can ever overlook. had a similar problem once but cant remember how i solved it for the love of god...ok i edited it and its working as intented, but even with that tutorial i struggle with something else. How do i save the new value after the calulation so it doesnt always start at 100? 
As you have edited the original question, and you are now askingHow do i save the new value after the calulation so it doesnt always  start at 100?you need to  the new value and assign to the  variable and move the randomisation of  so it actually takes a new value before you call , like thisI have put a  in there for testing purposesThinking about this, I would do it even a little different again, the following code so you can try this yourself:now you can call  with default, or with changed parameters for "bigger" hits like , you can also call  from other functions, no need to double assign.And you can take is further, as a hit is a hit, no matter who is hitting who, so no double functions, something like this:
 is wrong;  is a function not a variable. You should call it like Purely based on the names of the variable declarations at the start, I guess you meant Then you run into the problem that  is a local variable, and used before assignment, so now you need to change and your print statement is nowThe same goes for other functions you have defined.
