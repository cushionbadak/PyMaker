I have a module with two module variables. I want to path them out for all tests in my file. Initially I did monkey patching but this turned out to be a problem for tests in other files, that require those variables to be intact.This is something I came up with currently. It's horrible but it works. I'd like to do something that's more "by the book" though (i.e. something that will keep a single indent for all the variables I patch):
but I feel like the proper way to do that would be something that keeps a single indent.With statement with multiple contextsYou can put several statements into a single With statement with multiple context, spanning multiple linesObviously your lines can get very long, here's a way to break them down that still complies with PEP8I ran  on a file with above snippet, it passes.
