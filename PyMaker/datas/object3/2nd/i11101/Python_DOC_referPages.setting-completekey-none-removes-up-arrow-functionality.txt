I'm trying to write a small REPL using the  library in Python. One of the features that it provides is automatic tab completion, which I do not want.Luckily, the docs mention "If completekey is not None and readline is available, command completion is done automatically." So I set  when I instantiated my  subclass, which worked.However, the main functionality of the  module, the use of  which gives support for up-arrow history, was also disabled, and now I'm back to 's.Why is this happening, and is there a solution?
The  module is only imported if  has a non-None value. It looks like the only way to use  and disable completion is to specify a do-nothing completer.
