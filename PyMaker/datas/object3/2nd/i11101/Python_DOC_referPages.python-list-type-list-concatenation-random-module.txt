What I want to achieve : a list of posible combinations of n coin flipsWhat I get when I run this code : a list that contains letters from the 2 posible outcomes "heads" and "tails" . Why? I could not figure out .
Try using  instead of slice assignment.
To generate a random list of  coin flips, you can also use a list comprehension to express the same logic in a more concise way:In the code above, random integers 0 or 1 (as opposed to 1 or 2) are generated to handily use them when deciding between  or  - using the fact that 0 evaluates to , and 1 to .Now, if your intent is to generate all possible outcomes of flipping a coin  times, you can use itertools.product. An example for  (the final output shortened for readability):
You can also use the  library. It becomes really simple like that.This comes in handy if you need to quickly generate large number of sequences. Just save the  result in a variable, and retrieve a random index from it.
