I have an XML string where I want to modify the model type for specific interface. Now, I want to change model  where source . How can I do that?
You don't need multiple  calls. You can do it in one call:
Here's some crude ElementTree code that does the job. In a real program you'd probably want some error checking. But if you're sure your XML data will always be perfect, and that every  tag will always contain a  tag and a  tag, then this code will do the job.outputIf you're using an old version of Python you may not have . In which case, replace it with .
Thanks for your answers, but this is also worked for me
