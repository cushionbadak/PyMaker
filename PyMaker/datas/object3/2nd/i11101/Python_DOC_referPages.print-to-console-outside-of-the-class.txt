I am having trouble figuring this out.I have a Class which prints the the console "inside" the class. I want to be able to print "outside" of the class so that I can use the data stream for other things. How can I get the stream from the code below?I tried a number of different things but have yet to understand the right way to achieve this. Conceptually i want:But obviously this does not work.
Why not print the messages in ? Once you call , it will only return when your client dies (or gets disconnect?). You have to handle events INSIDE the execution loop.It seems to me that what you REALLY want to do here is run this code in the context of a different process/thread or executor, so you can continue performing other actions.Have a look: https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html
