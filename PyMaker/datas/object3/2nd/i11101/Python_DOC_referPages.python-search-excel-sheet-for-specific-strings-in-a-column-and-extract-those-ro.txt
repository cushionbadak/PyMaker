Natural Text
Here's the code I've frankensteined together from other posts,It's not complete, but what I'm trying to accomplish is a search in column 3(or entire sheet, doesn't matter) for 5 specific strings and output those rows line by line to a text file, if possible csv formatted i.e. commas between each value.  How can I set a variable to 5 possible strings? Would this need to be an array?I think the way that I have it written here will overwrite the text file each time rather than append it, is that correct? And if so what's the correct function, "file.append(#stuff)"?
This should work. You can't assign 5 strings to a single variable, without using a list or some other data type. You can however check to see if the third cell's value (i[2] - here) is equal to any of the strings you're looking for ("string1" - "string5" - here).Your output written to the text file "Output.txt" will be comma separated as the rows in your excel are read into python as tuples in a list.
