I have a bunch of file paths:I would like it if I could define the number ID (2001) and then have it be used in the file name, like this:Is there a way to do this? I'm not sure if I explained what I want very well.
You should use string formatting, like so:This lets it be type-ambiguous, in case you want to use an integer sometimes or a string other times. It also can handle as many pieces as you want, so you could loop like;EDIT: There's more to string formatting, see the python documentation for more.
Notice the quotes around the ID value "2001", that makes it a string, which allows you to add it to other strings.  Otherwise you'd end up with a TypeError which will arise when you try to add integers to strings.
