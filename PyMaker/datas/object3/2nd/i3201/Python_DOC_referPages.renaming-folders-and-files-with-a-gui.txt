Python community,today  I tried to write a GUI script to be able to rename folders or files depending on what the user wants to do. I created two different Buttons: One for the Renaming of Folders, One for the Renaming of Files.My Problem is that if I have f.e. a folder with several folders and several .txt files in it, my script is not able to just rename the folders or just rename the .txt files.To solve this problem I had the idea to use the os.path.isdir function to generate a list of TRUE and FALSE values, with the folders refering as TRUE and then rename the objects which fullfill this condition.Because I am relatively new to programming my knowledge is limited and therfore I would be very glad if somebody would be so kind to give me an idea how to improve my code and be able to design my GUI as I wish to.Here is a part of my code (just a bit from my bigger GUI code):Thank you very much in advance.Best regards,Kim
Try using python's os.walk function. From python 2 documentation:(also available in python 3)For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top (including top  itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames)I don't know if this is exactly what you want to do, as this recursively walks down the whole directory structure, and not just the next-level of directories.
