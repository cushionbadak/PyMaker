I have multiple versions of python 3 installed on my windows 10: i have python 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. Now I installed anaconda 3 with python 3.6.4, and I want to start it with py launcher.When I start py.exe it starts python 3.6 from c:\program\ files\python 3.6. I'm unable to tell py.exe to run python from d:\anaconda3.I tried to create py.ini file, I put it in c:\windows, c:\users\germano\appdata\local, but nothing, py.exe starts only python from c:\program files\pyton 3.6.Any help?
According to the documentation, you can use the env , to set the default version of Python.And with respect to change the default directory did not find any variable for this.
