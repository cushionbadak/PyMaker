Could someone please point me in the right direction on how to solve this following problem. I am trying to come up with a solution using pandas.read_sql and asyncio. I want to migrate table records from 1 database to another database.I want to do the following:I have the function:I want to run these in parallel and not one by one.
asyncio is about organizing non-blocking code into callbacks and coroutines. Running CPU-intensive code in parallel is a use case for threads:Whether this will actually run faster than sequential code depends on whether  releases the GIL.
