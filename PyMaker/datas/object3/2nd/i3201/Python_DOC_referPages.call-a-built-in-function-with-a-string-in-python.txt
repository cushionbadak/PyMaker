I've referred to the following threads and I don't think that this post is a duplicate of any of them:Calling a function of a module by using its name (a string)Python Call Function from StringUse a string to call function in PythonFor instance, assume that I have a string, , and I want to call the built-in function  directly with the string. BTW I cannot have  because  is actually loaded from a JSON file, i.e.  is always a string or .My best (neatest) attempt is , but as people suggested,  doesn't seem to be a good option and should be avoided whatever.An alternative is creating a dictionary like  and executing . However, creating that dictionary feels like "reinventing the wheel" to me.Since  is a built-in function, not a method in a module, so  seems unworkable. It is not a self-defined function either, so  gives .What is the best way to call a built-in function with the corresponding string then?
The best way is still a dictionary, but:
Using a  is the only sane solution here, period. Not only because it's the most explicit, obvious, readable and maintainable solution but also because you definitly want to have full control when it comes to mapping user inputs (anything that comes from the outside world) to executable code (security 101: never trust user inputs).
You can get attributes by names using  function: So you can use: But with code like this you cloud get things like  or , so you should do:
