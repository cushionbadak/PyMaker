Looking at the code I have below as an example. Why is it I get the error "Float object not callable" when using print statement 1 but not print statement 2? what do I need to do to my class if I was wanting to make print statement 1 work?
You are trying to use  as a method name and an attribute. You declare a method , but then you assign . So  isn't a method anymore; it's the value of .Perhaps you meant this:However,  methods are not the convention in Python. If you need a method wrapping your attribute, you should make it a property.
This:shadows this:Python functions are objects don't live in a distinct namepsace, so to make a long story short you cannot have an attribute and a method by the same name.The solution is simple: don't use  as an attribute name - specially since "get" is a verb so it's a poor name for a value.Also note that Python has a string support for computed attributes so you don't need systematic getters/setters for attributes. You can start with a plain attribute and turn it into a computed one later if the need arises.
