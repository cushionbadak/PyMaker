I´m new to matplotlib and python in general.  I'm on windows running typeperf.exe to basically reads processor information in real time using cli:The data structure at the CSV is as follows:At the same time - same machine - I run a code which basically reads that CSV producing a live plot ( it works! )The plot is being drawn with a new line every 1 second. Objective:  make the graph to show only the last 60 seconds of capture and continue moving forward with the new data in the CSV.I've read pyplot documentation and tried .clf() and .clear() with no luck. Here's just the portion of code where I´m having a hard time:I tried the while loop in an attempt to make the plot read just for that amount of time. It doesn't work.Would you please point me out to the right path?Thanks,
X and Y currently contain all timesteps and values in the .csv file. Instead of plotting X and Y entirely, you could only plot the last 60 values:This approach could become cumbersome as the .csv file grows with days and years. In that case refreshing (and archiving) the file every now and then should fix it.
