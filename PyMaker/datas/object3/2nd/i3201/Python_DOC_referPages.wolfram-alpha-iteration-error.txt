So I'm working on making a simple research bot but I've run into a problem. I was following a guide on using wolfram alpha in python and when I test it I sometimes get the error . Here is my code:It only happens with some queries and it often works, but still its rather annoying. I looked online but didn't find any help, so I don't know if this is new or something is wrong with my code. Anyway, here is a link to a repl I made where its not working here. Try it with "uranium" I know that one brings the error and so do a few others I've tried. Thanks!
This error is telling you that your query had no results.This line:… calls  on an iterator, , without a default value:Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its  method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise  is raised.If  had no results to show you,  is an empty iterator. Meaning it's exhausted right from the start, so when you call  on it, you're going to get .And just passing a default isn't going to do much good here. Consider this:Now, if there are no results,  will return your default value , and you'll immediately try to do , which will just raise an .One way to fix this is to just handle the error:Another is to break that compound expression up into simpler ones, so you can use a default:However,  can include 2 or 3 results just as easily as 0—that's the whole reason it returns an iterator. And usually, you're going to want all of them, or at least a few of them. If that's the case, the best solution is to use a  loop. Iterators are born hoping they'll be used in a  loop, because it makes everyone's like easier:This will do nothing if  is empty, print one result if there's only one, or print all of the results if there are multiple.If you're worried about getting 500 results when you only wanted a few, you can stop at, say, 3:… or:
