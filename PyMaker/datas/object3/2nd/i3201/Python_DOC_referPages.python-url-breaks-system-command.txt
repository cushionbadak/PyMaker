I am trying to open chromium to an authorization URL with a specific launch parameter. I was not able to find the solution to this launch parameter using the webbrowser library, so I moved onto os.systemThis works up until the "&" in the URL. So chromium opens without bothering me with keyring nonsense, but only opens the URL until the first &. Is there a way of handling the URL and maintaining its integrity?
This is because  is special to the shell. The canonical way to run a subprocess from within Python 3 is:
This is exactly why you shouldn't use  for anything non-trivial. As the docs for that function say:The  module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function. See the Replacing Older Functions with the  Module section in the  documentation for some helpful recipes.If you follow that link, you'll see that you can write this as:Because you're passing a list of arguments, rather than trying to put them together into a string that you can smuggle through the shell, you don't have to worry about quoting, or anything else.By the way, you probably want to use  rather than  here, but for some reason the recipes still haven't been updated in the docs as of 3.7, and I didn't want to add confusion by showing something that doesn't matchâ€¦ Anyway, you should read the at least the quick-start "Using" section at the top of the docs.If you really want to use  anyway for some reason, you will need to quote and/or escape the  argument. Assuming you don't care about Windows, the best way to do this is with the  module:If you do care about Windows, you can add  to the  call. The effects of the  flag are documented under the  constructor. The default  value means it follows POSIX rules as closely as possible, which means it should be able to handle anything that could possibly be handled, as long as your shell is strictly compatible with  (as, e.g.,  is, but Windows  is definitely not, and even  or  may not be). With , it uses "compatibility mode". For simple examples like yours, it should work for most shells without fiddling, but if you need to get more complicated, you need to read Improved Compatibility with Shells. (And, for Windows  or , there's a limit to how far you can push things.)
