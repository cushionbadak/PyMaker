I'm a beginner so sorry If I'm a little vague with the question. I have a perl script that runs and generates a tar file. I am trying to write a python script that untars the file. The only issue is the file name changes everytime the script is run. I am trying to find way(probably regex) to untar the file in my python script because the file name will always change anytime i run the script because of the date and time added. I tried  on the command line and that works but that does not seem to work when i do  in the python script. Any help?
You can use glob.glob() to search for files using wildcards:
