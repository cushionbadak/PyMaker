This behavior happens because the class binding that inserts the key in the Entry is executed after the widget's binding. Therefore, when  is executed, the Entry does not contains\ the new key yet. You can check this with the following code:To solve this problem, you can use figbeam solution or you can use the validate command option of the Entry:More details about entry validation: http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/entry-validation.html
I don't understand why your code does not work, but I can offer a solution that does work. Associate the entry with a StringVar and then trace all changes to the StringVar:Reference: The Variable Classes (BooleanVar, DoubleVar, IntVar, StringVar)
