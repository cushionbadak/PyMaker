When I was trying to mock an async function in unittest with MagicMock, I got this exception:TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expressionWith sample code like:How should I fix it with built-in python3 libraries?
I ended up with this hack.It only works for MagicMock, not other pre-defined return_value
You can get mocks to return objects that can be awaited by using a Future. The following is a pytest test case, but something similar should be possible with unittest.In your case, since you're patching  (which gets passed in as ),  should do the trick.
