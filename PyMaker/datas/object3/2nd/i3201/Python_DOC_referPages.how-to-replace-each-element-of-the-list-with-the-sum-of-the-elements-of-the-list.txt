This question already has an answer here:How to find the cumulative sum of numbers in a list?                    18 answers                I have a list that contain days count in each month:I want to transform list above. Each element of the new list is equal to the sum of all elements in a particular position. For example, first element should be the same (31), second = 28+31, third = 31+28+31 and so on.Desired output:How to do it? I tried variations with a for loop and append method, but I did not succeed.
Though this isn't tagged , I think you would greatly benefit from  (cumulative sum) rather than looping:Alternatively, you could use this list comprehension:As pointed out by @PatrickHaugh, you could also use itertools.accumulate:
