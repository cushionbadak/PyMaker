Natural Text
I'm scraping a text .json site for information and sometimes the elements that i'm monitoring go away because they don't need to be there. This makes the program stop and cant be restarted because they are gone. I need to be able to except that they aren't there and continue on and print / send the right information.I tried doing something with but it doesn't seem like i'm doing it right.If anyone could please help me out, that would be awesome! Note: I took the endpoint out!The elements in particular that don't show all the time are, , and If i run the code as is right now, i get the current error. This is the element i want to except. 
Then you want something like this (and please change the name of the  variable, see comment)How you want it precise is up to you.  You can handle things in different ways.
A nice way to work around KeyError responses in Python is to use the  method on dictionaries. If you call the get method, you can provide a default value to provide if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary:If you have nested dictionaries, you can set  as the default value to provide from one dictionary, so you can keep calling  on each child dictionary:
Instead of getting a value from a dictionary with square brackets, you can use the  method from the  type (see docs here) and set a default value. For your example:This will give  if  has key , otherwise it will give . Of course, you can change the  to some other value that might make more sense for you application.
