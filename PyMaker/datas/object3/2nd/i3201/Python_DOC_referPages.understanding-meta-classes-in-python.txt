I am trying to learn  in python, from my research i found a example like follow.i have a  and  classes like follownow, when i want to make sure that whoever extending  class, must need to implement  method, so i created the meta class to hook the constuction of derived class,so now  class looks like follow with  meta class.The problem is when i get looks into body it returns 2 records for  and  class,  like follow.my code in  breaks since  not have  , but i want to check only in the Derived class so i rewrite my  like follow.I am checking  in my  method.
