I have two lists named  and . I want the first member of the  as key and first member of  as the value and so on. Both the list are of the same length. I have written following code but I am not getting the answer please help me on this. res_list = ['LYS', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'ARG', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'ARG', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'ARG', 'LYS', 'ARG', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'ARG', 'LYS', 'ARG', 'ARG', 'ARG', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'LYS', 'LYS'] and fina_val = [['90', 30.390685694798005], ['91', 33.017900690383094], ['99', 25.200985952934463], ['104', 19.14776281971343], ['113', 20.365273138359818], ['114', 21.71637709195528], ['135', 29.452559922696025], ['138', 24.335606731700775]] but when I am doing as you said I am geeing fillowing answer: {'LYS': ['302', 25.757180610462783], 'ARG': ['282', 17.118237438474793]} where i am wrong ? 
You can use  and a . Also, as Peter pointed out, one can do !Some more explicit (and perhaps less  ways)You can iterate over the zip to be more explicit.Of you can even iterate over the lists together with an index.if those are more clear to you. However, part of the beauty of python is it's conciseness while maintaining clarity.
's constructor accepts a sequence of  pairs, so you can achieve it with
