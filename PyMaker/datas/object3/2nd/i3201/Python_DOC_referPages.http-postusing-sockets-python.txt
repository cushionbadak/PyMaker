Ive made a single POST request using sockets in python and it worked fine, but since trying to iterate username and passwords it just is not working, i have been trying for hours if not all day trying to figure out what is the problem....i just don't get this at all, code will be below(have tried many different versions of what i have now). Thanks, would really love to know were i have gone wrong with this, i do not think i am too far off?And here is the error code(obviously there is this code for each post iteration done)have added +5 too length variable but am now getting another error
Your content length is incorrect. Your POST body is longer than you claim it to be:That only counts the user and password string lengths, but your content body consists of more characters still:The  and  characters also are part of the POST body, so your content length is at least 5 bytes longer than you told the server to expect.Next, you are sending headers with a lot of leading whitespace. The indentation on the  and   strings is part of the string value, but HTTP headers should be sent without indentation. Remove that whitespace.Next, HTTP requires that you send headers with both a carriage return and a newline between them. You are sending just  separators, not  separators.You'd be much better off using the  library that comes with Python. At the very least, try to study it's source code so you can learn what that library does, if you must try to do this the hard way with a socket.If you don't need to go this low-level, just install  and let it do all the heavy lifting.
