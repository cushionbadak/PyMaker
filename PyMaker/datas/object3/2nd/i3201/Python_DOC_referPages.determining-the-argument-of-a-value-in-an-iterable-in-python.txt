This question already has an answer here:Finding the index of an item given a list containing it in Python                    29 answers                Is there a python or numpy function that returns the argument or index of some value (or set of values) that exists in an iterable? I want something that is similar to the functionality of:but is able to do:In the pandas library, you can create a boolean mask that returns only the values that match the condition, and from there you can return the indices of these values. But how might this be done without pandas?
