I have two lists  and . I need to strip the lines starting from the line numbers in the  and ending with the corresponding line number in the . And then need to write these into another file. What is the most "pythonic" way to do it?I tried it with using two  loops way in C++. I would like to know about the most efficient way in python to do this. I tried to use  function inside the loop, but it is not giving the correct result. Please check the below code for my implementation.
The problem is that you cannot use islice with file object this way. Once the lines are read, you cannot go backward into the file without explicitly asking for it.Either you add a  before your second Or you read the file once, and you iterate on the file content in memory:
try this once with linecache util-be aware that This function will never raise an exception â€” it will return '' on  errors (the terminating newline character will be included for lines  that are found).more details at https://docs.python.org/2/library/linecache.html
