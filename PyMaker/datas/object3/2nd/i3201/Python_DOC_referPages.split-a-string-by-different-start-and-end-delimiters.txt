I have a log with data from a TCP port with a given buffer length. Each event has a variable length and it is delimited by <+++> and <--->.Example:I need to split it so that each event is the element of a list -- like this:  How would you do this with Python?
You can also use regular expressions for this task,  in particular: The captured group  stands for one or more () of any character () non-greedily () matched, so as to not capture the entire part from the first opening to the last closing tag.
something like this:
If you want to do it pretty simply, I'd just use a couple of steps. It looks, in this case, that we can assume that the string always starts with "<+++>" and ends with "<--->". So, we can simply strip them from the string and use a simple :If the problem is more complicated, you could also look into using regular expressions with .
usage:  where sep can be a single char, a list of strings, a tuple. In your case 
Regular expressions are your friends.and then you have to clear the empty strings from your list.
You can split then join then splitor even:
Here's another option: is the value of  in the question code.
