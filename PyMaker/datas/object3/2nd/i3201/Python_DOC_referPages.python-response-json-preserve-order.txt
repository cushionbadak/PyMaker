I have a json object which is returned against a post callI was doing  to get the json object. But as I understand it creates a dict object which is unordered. I need to preserve the order.I saw the solution described here: Items in JSON object are out of order using "json.dumps"?But my challenge is my starting point is a response object. How do I take it and convert to a json with the order preserved?Adding some more details:My API call returns an object of form:I have a table with three columns as key01,key02 and keyN.I need to post this json object after some minor manipulations to a software maintaining that specific order of key01,key02 and keyN.But as soon as I do response.json() it is changing the order. I have tried to use the orderedlist approach as mentioned in the two other threads but so far my object is looking like this: How do I get a json which looks like this instead: 
The requests doesn't have the best documentation, but from reading its source code on the  method, we can see that it's defined as followed:where  is the std  library or  if you have that installed.Knowing that, you can actually pass in keyword arguments to  which will directly go to . Which means that you can do what the answer you linked proposed: is an optional function that  will be called with the result of any object literal decoded with an  ordered list of pairs. The return value of  will be  used instead of the . This feature can be used to implement custom  decoders. If  is also defined, the  takes  priority. is an optional function that will be called with the  result of any object literal decode with an ordered list of pairs. The  return value of  will be used instead of the .  This feature can be used to implement custom decoders that rely on the  order that the  and  pairs are decoded (for example,   will remember the order of insertion). If   is also defined, the  takes priority.Therefore, either way you will be able to provide the  keyword argument to .From the information I received from the comments, you don't even need to parse the json, just do:and you can "post" text to wherever you desire.
Relying on the order of json keys from a server (especially one that you don't control) is very fragile. The RFC says:An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs, where a name is a string and a value is a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array.It also specifically comments:JSON parsing libraries have been observed to differ as to whether or not they make the ordering of object members visible to calling software.  Implementations whose behavior does not depend on member ordering will be interoperable in the sense that they will not be affected by these differences.Thus, it is RFC compliant for an implementation (on the server) to change how it orders the produced JSON.If you don't know if the server is using a serialization library that guarantees order, then this could break in the future (if the library changes). Even if you do, if that library takes the server language's equivalent of a , upgrading the language or standard library could change the semantics of that  such that the ordering changes (and your code breaks). As an example, from Python 3.6 to 3.7  changed from arbitrary order to ordered by insertion. In other languages such as rust, which seed the hash function used by their hashmaps to prevent DoS attacks, the ordering could be dependent on the randomness used to seed these hash functions (decided at runtime, and may be different if you, say, restart the server).It's much more safe if you know that you need the data in a certain order to construct it that way yourself:From your comment, it seems like you need that dictionary serialized again. If you use  on an , the serialization will be in insertion order:
