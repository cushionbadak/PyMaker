I am trying to convert now.month to decimal so it would look like 01 and not like 1. The code is:it works in this line with %dthe error I get is ValueError: unsupported format character 'm' (0x6d) at index 2I also tried with the new type {:%m}. The error is the same.Do i miss any libraries? Or is there another way except adding 0 to months from Jan to SeptemberPython v.3.6.3
You are using string formatting like datetime formatting here.  String formatting has its own "mini-language", and  is not a valid symbol in this language.For your purposes, it would be better to use 
This is because  do not stands for . It stands for digits and is a placeholder for numbers when using string formatting.You should use it for months also.Since you want the format as , use @user3483203 answer.
