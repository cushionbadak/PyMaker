I am having a data frame like thisI need Output like this {series_id:3,start:2013,end:2013,count:1},{series_id:3,start:2016,end:2016,count:1}{series_id:3,start:2018,end:2018,count:1},I have to iterate over the data frame of each row and find the gap between year in the data column The data column is a list of a list which has the year and some data in each listI have to check with consecutive and missing years and count.count example: take series id:3 start=2014 end=2018 on iterating the 2013,2016 and 2018 are missed but in between, 2017 is there so for that I have to get like this{series_id:3,start:2013,end:2013,count:1},{series_id:3,start:2016,end:2016,count:1},{series_id:3,start:2018,end:2018,count:1}How can I achieve this even I not able to iterate it?Please Need a help
If your question is how to convert a query operation performed on a pandas dataframe into a list. There is a method called as to_json() on pandas.Find the link below to see examples and implementation.enter link description hereUse orient = recordsThen you can use json.loads() to convert to a list.Now you can iterate over it.
