Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Does Python have a built in function for string natural sort?                    15 answers                Sort list of strings by a part of the string                    4 answers                I've read many similar questions, but none of the solutions match the requirements I need which is, using Python 2.6.6 and without installing or using OrderedDict, how can I get my list to sort based on the first numbers in each item?This is my list:apples.sort() gives me:What I'd want is:I tried converting the list to a dictionary and giving the first numbers 15; 43; 2; 7; 178; but that didn't work. I understand why it's sorting that way, as it's a string, but I can't convert it into an int.I was thinking maybe using regex, but didn't get very far.This grabs everything after the first space in the numbers:This grabs only the beginning numbers:A solution I think would work, but I don't know how to do this, is to match using regex just the numbers and cast that as an int, and sort that way.EDIT: Possible duplicate question has different acceptable solution, different format, but similar question.
You have to specify a custom function as sort key, which would extract the initial numbers from each stringOr using regex
