I'm trying to get parameters of a .txt like that:How can i do a function called get() that takes from this file called parameters.txt the parameter b and return 15??It's to build a module that works like a getter of parameters.To simplify and explain information: the .txt conatains parameters with and int value. The get() function will obtain the integer value associated to the parameter.
