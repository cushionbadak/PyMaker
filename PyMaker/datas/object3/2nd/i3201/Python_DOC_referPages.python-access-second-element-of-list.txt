When I print my list I get something like this I want to extract first and second elements from above list into separate lists so that I can ask the plt to plot it for me. So my results should be  and I  want to know if we have a cleaner solution than to 
You can try :output : 
I would recommend using numpy arrays. For example:Output:
Here a try with zip,  will makes iterator that aggregates elements based on the iterables passed, and returns an iterator of tuples, so  function is used to make the tuples to list :O/P will be like :
zip() will provide the required output.Output: aggregates the elements from all the iterable.  would provide the list you currently have.  with  can be used to unzip a list.Also, there is no need to convert the tuples to list since  takes an  parameter.
One-liner using  built-in and unpackingif you are embarassed that results are s we can turn them into s simply using  built-in:
Lots of pure Python approaches here.  But given that your goal is to plot the separated values, I think there's a case to be made here for the simplicity of Pandas - just drop the list as-is into a data frame and :
To plot:
