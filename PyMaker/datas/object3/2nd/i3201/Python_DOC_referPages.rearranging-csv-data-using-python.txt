Ive commented inside my code. Essentially you use zip() to get a column-wise view on your data. Then apply some logic to spice up the output with fimes for each day. Then you write all the data into your output file:Then we read it back in and process it:Output:If you print (for each row) instead of  something like  you would get even closer to your desired output.
