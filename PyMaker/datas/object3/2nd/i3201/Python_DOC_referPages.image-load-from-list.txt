I'm trying to use a list to randomly pick an image but I got this error:mob =  random(list[pygame.image.load("image1.png"),pygame.image.load("image2.png"),pygame.image.load("image3.png"),])  TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptableIf I load the image manually in the pygame.image.load("Image") it works, but then I got this error. angryball_image_rect should be defined thoscreen.blit(angryball, angryball_image_rect.move(angryball_image_rect.width, 0))  NameError: name 'angryball_image_rect' is not defined
Define your images list in the global scope and fill it with your images. Then you can call  to get one of the images in the list and pass it together with your random coordinates to the  method of your sprite class where you can assign them to the specific attributes of the sprite.The  was raised because you tried to call  with square brackets (which are used for indexing):
