I wrote two example codes which share a same pattern.As you can read below, I used if statement to not to pass keyword argument down to a sub function if the argument is None.I want to do it in a better way.Please share your thoughts if you have an idea.
The default value of the parameter  of the function  is . Because of this, your first / is not necessary. Simple useUse the default value of  of  as the default value for  in your function . Then you can get rid of the / in this function, too.Edit: The documentation says:body â€“ The documentTry to find out if this is a JSON string or a Python dictionary that represents the document. In the JSON string case, use the string as the default value:Edit 2: Using an empty dict would not work (see link in comment). So in the second case, you would have to use /.
For the first example the default value for  is , so you can just pass it directly:You can also setup a different default value. For instance the new default value of  would be passed to .
As already stated, for sorted, you are basically just packing the original function. I don't think you can avoid the  for the second example, but you can shorten it a little.
