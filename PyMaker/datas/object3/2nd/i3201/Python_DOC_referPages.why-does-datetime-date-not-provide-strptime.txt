The python module  provides  and . provides only .Why is that?
 is a class method that generates  objects. Since a  is more general than a  object and the latter can be retrieved from the former via  and there is no need to reimplement this method (besides having a method called  would be quite confusing since it mixes terms "date" and "time" while it's actually just a date).On the other hand  and  are instance methods that transform a given object. In order to provide the same functionality for  objects this methods needs to reimplemented (also because mapping  is ambiguous).Note that in Python 3.7 there was the  classmethod added, as a convenience method for parsing specific date strings (inverse to ).
