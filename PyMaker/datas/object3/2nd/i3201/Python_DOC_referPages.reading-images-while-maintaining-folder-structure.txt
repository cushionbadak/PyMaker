I have to write a matlab script in python as apparently what I want to achieve is done much more efficiently in Python.So the first task is to read all images into python using opencv while maintaining folder structure. For example if the parent folder has 50 sub folders and each sub folder has 10 images then this is how the  variable should look like in python, very much like a cell in matlab. I read that python lists can perform this cell like behaviour without importing anything, so thats good I guess.For example, below is how I coded it in Matlab:The above  will have 50 cells and each cell will have stored 10 images.  will be all images belonging to subject 1 and so on.Im trying to replicate this in python but am failing, this is what I have I got so far:Its not exactly what I am looking for, some help would be appreciated. Please ignore silly mistakes as it is my first day writing in python.Thanksedit: directory structure:
The first problem is that  isn't a number or index, it is a string containing the path name.  To get the index, you can use , which gives ,  pairs. Second, unlike in MATLAB you can't assign to indexes that don't exist.  You need to pre-allocate your image array or, better yet, append to it.Third, it is better not to use the variable  since in python 2 it is a built-in data type so it can confuse people.So with preallocating, this should work:Using append, this should work:That being said, there is an easier way to do this.  You can use the pathlib module to simplify this.So something like this should work:This loops over the subdirectories, then globs each one.This can even be done in a nested list comprehension:
It should be the following:
