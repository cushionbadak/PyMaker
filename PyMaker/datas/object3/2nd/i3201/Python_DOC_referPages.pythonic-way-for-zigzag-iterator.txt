I'm programming onto Zigzag Iterator, it is to iterate a 2D list in following way:to I implemented an algorithem:I know the problem is because I call 1 more time next() of each list, then I get 3 None. I could resolve this issue by checking the hasnext method with java. I can also implement a hasnext Iterator in python. My questions is how I can solve this problem in a more pythonic way rather than thinking it in Java. 
This is the round robin recipe in the  docs.
This can be easily built with tools in :The  stuff is needed so  values can be safely zigzagged over. (It's a value that's supposed to be guaranteed to not show up in the original lists.)
This outputs:
For pythonic solution you need to implement the iterator protocol, I hope this is exactly what you were looking for.If you really want to use  and  then
