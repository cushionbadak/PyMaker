Natural Text
I'm trying to find out if a list of strings are also part of strings in another list.I've found this so far but I'm not able to get what I actually want.this will print ['car'].I would like to have a way to print 'book' and 'chair' as well because 'book' is a part of 'oldbook' and 'chair' of 'bluechair'.Thank you!
You can use  here:This works since it keeps strings in  that exist in any string in .
