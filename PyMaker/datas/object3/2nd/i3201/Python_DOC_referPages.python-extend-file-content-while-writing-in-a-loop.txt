As a network engineer i have started to learn python some days ago and in the first instance i wanted to write a code which checks a given file for valid and invalid IP addresses then save these into separate files.The file opening and checking is working as intended but i cannot save the valid and invalid IPs into different txt.Snippet of IP.txt:
TL;DR: the problem is that you are overwriting your files over and over on each step, you can change mode to  like:ImprovementsWe don't need ,  & , because  is an instance of  which is a subclass of  and from docs:IOBase (and its subclasses) supports the iterator protocol, meaning that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a stream.it means that we can directly iterate through  and instead ofwritewe can collect data at first (e.g. store them in s) and write data into files after.we can extract a logic with - into a predicate for checking if given ip is valid like:Finally we can have something likewhich looks more readable to me.Note that mode is changed to  again because we're writing results all at once using  method instead of opening files again and again and writing just a one line each time.Further reading function docs.
