So let's say my code is as follows:How could I get the output to return 2?
The  method of the  object only takes 1 argument. The easiest to achieve what you are looking for is to use a simple addition:
The simplest approach, using  and :Once the number of elements that you want to count increases, you will be better off using a  and add the counts from there:The main advantage of the latter method is that the  obtains all counts in a single iteration while repeated  calls repeatedly iterate the list. 
Using  repeatedly will have complexity O(m*n). This isn't recommended. You can achieve your task with complexity O(m+n) by using :To cater for potential missing values, you can use :
