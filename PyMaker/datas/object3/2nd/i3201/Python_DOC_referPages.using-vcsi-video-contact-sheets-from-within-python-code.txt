I'm trying to call the video contact sheet module from within a python script, but for my life of it, I can't figure it out.When I call it through command line, it works fine:How would I call the same process from with my python script (Python 3.5)?I tried calling through subprocess, exec, etc, but I can't get it to run.Thanks for all your help!
