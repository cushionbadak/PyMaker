Pip will not let me install django 2.0.7. When I execute  it says:As you can see above, the most recent version it can find is version . Normally, I would be okay with downloading that but it is not compatible with Python 3.7 (the version I have). I have also checked to make sure  was updated to the latest version ().
Mac and Linux (and similar systems) both contain default installations (generally Python 2.7).  This is accessed via  in terminal. if installed will also be for Python 2.7 (or whatever it is on your system).  When you run  it points to the 2.7 installation (or your equivalent).You can test this via the  command, which will show in the path where it is installing to.As mentioned in the other answer, Django lost support for 2.7 with version  so you cannot install the version 2 Django since it has no support (this is your error) for Python 2.Now to deal with the problem:To install Django you just need to tell the terminal which interpreter to use.  As mentioned you could use  or I prefer to use:Simply because I use  command all the time so I know it will work, and will therefore install to the correct location.Note that since you are installing Django you should probably be using a separate environment for security (venv or virtualenv).The  should not be used only as an absolute last resort (as already mentioned by abccd) as it can ruin your system (I have done this multiple times in a Virtual Installation, so it is definitly something you want to avoid if possible), once again using a virtual environment would ensure that you do not need the  command since you are not installing in a root dictionary.
As Simon has mentioned in the comments: your  is installing for Python 2.7, which explains why the latest version for Django is 1.11.14 since Django 2.x dropped support for Python 2.7. You'll need to use Python 3.7's , run either one of the following:You REALLY shouldn't use  with  (it's not safe).
Adding to above answers, if you are using a virtual environment, make sure you are using Python3 to create it. You can explicitly do that like this :Activate the env . Now if you do a "pip install Django" , it will install the latest in 2.x series.
