I am using this script in python in order to connect to a Bluetooth device and then get data, but I want to know the result of this shell command in order to do next worksthis code is a sample when I run the command:in shell, it returns: but how can I put above result in a variable, because I need to know the result of this command?I use stdout, stderr in subprocess but does not work.I am using python 2.7Python subprocess and user interactionabove link talk about getting output in a variable in general, but the problem in my question related to rfcomm, which does not put its result in variable, I run those script and they works well, but it does not works when it used with rfcomm command
If you're using Python 3.5 or higher,you can use  instead. That way you'll have access directly like so, Then access what you want like this, If ever you use Python 2.7, as suggested by documentation I linked, they redirect you to the Older high-level API section. From there you'll notice that you could use Note, if ever you want to catch error also use the  flag.Lasty, there is an important not you should be aware,By default, this function will return the data as encoded bytes. The actual encoding of the output data may depend on the command being invoked, so the decoding to text will often need to be handled at the application level.EDITSince your goal seems to get output while running. Take a look at this answer. I prefer linking instead of re-inventing the wheel. 
You may need to issue the CTRL+C command before the data is returned.Send a signal and catch the exception to deal with what is returned.
