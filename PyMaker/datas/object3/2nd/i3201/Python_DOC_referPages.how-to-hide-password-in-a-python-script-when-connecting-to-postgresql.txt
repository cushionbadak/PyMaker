When connecting to PostgreSQL using Psycopg2 user name and password must be supplied to reach the database. When I'm working in my computer keeping password of my local database as plain text is not a problem.But when I want to use this script in another computer I need to hide credentials. How this can be done ?Any help appreciated h.
The easiest way to hide credentials is to not store them on the public machine. Use the  module to prompt future you for your password.
