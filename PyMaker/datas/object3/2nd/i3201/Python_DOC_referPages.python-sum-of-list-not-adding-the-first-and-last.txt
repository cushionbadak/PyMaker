Why when i type 43682 it return 11 instead of 6 ? Since im adding the first and last number in the list
I believe  should work.
The problem is the unnecessary  loop, combined with modifying the list:If  is , on the first iteration the total is correctly set to 6. However, you're still in the loop - total will be set once again, this time adding 3 and 8 together.So your method should instead just add the first and last elements together, without any loop:Most of the time you should be getting items from a list using indexes, rather than with .  is primarily for removing items from the list; it only returns the item removed as a convenience.
