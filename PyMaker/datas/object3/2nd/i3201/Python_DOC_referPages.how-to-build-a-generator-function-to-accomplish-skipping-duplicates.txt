I want to ake a generator function that loops over an input iterable sequence, yielding one element at a time, but skipping duplicates. An example code is below:Does anyone ave any ideas why this code is not printing?
A simple unique generator would just keep a  of items already seen, e.g.:
Simplest way is to use , an easy way to dedupe while preserving order:Technically, it operates eagerly (all deduping is done up front, then you iterate the completely deduped ), but all other solutions would need to build an equivalent  anyway by the end, so this delays the production of the first value, but does the same amount of work overall (and on Python versions with a C implemented , runs faster than handrolling a generator using a  as a "seen" store). The cases for which it is unsuitable are infinite input iterables and finite but large iterables where it is likely you'll stop processing them longer before you finish (in which case a lazier,  solution based on a  is needed).On Python 3.6 and higher, plain  preserves order (though it's not an official guarantee until 3.7), so you don't even need an import:
Is there a reason you need a generator? Why not just use a ?If you really need a generator:
