Now there are 3 solutions to resize a image:1st: 2nd :and the 3rd:For cases, The problems with 1st comes as error "cannot write mode RGBA as JPEG",for 2nd it comes as "bad transparency mask" and the problem with third is that it works in all cases but the images with transparency after resizing get their background as black which is not acceptable,also distorted colors pixels can be seen near the edges.So what can be the universal solution to these problems?Note:(The output format required is .jpg and the images to be resized varies in the format as they are getting scraped, mostly .png with transparent background)Update:As per comments I have placed an if else based on alpha condition as:It is working fine, But In some rare cases, has_alpha being false, I'm getting following error.
As the PIL error message points out, JPEG does not support transparency. To handle images that use transparency you need to paste them onto a RGB background image. That's what your 2nd option does:  creates a new image of the same size as , with all the pixels set to , which is white. (You can also use strings to specify colors to PIL).So to do this resizing and conversion task correctly you need to determine whether or not the image has transparency. You do that by checking the  string. If it's "RGBA", then the image has transparency. Here's a short demo, which uses a medium light grey for the background. I use the  module to create the JPEG file name from the input file name. This module is available in Python 3.4+.UpdateThe original version of this code did not handle palette-mapped images, but this new version does, including palette-mapped images with transparency.outputHere are the input images, RhombicPlain.png and RhombicAlpha.png, which I created using POV-Ray.Here are the output images, RhombicPlain.jpg and RhombicAlpha.jpg
