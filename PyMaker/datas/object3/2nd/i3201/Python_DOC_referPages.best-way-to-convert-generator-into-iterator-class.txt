Consider the following dummy example:The init code, which takes a long time to compute, is executed once the generator has been iterated for the first time (as opposed to when the generator it is initialized). I would prefer that the init code it is executed as the generator is initialized. For this purpose I convert the generator into an iterator class as follows:All ways I can think of implementing the  method above are very cumbersome as compared to the simplicity of the iterative code in the generator with the  keyword.What would be the most Pythonic way of implementing the  method in the iterator class?Alternatively, how can I modify the the generator so that the init code is executed at init time?
In both cases (whether you use a function or a class), the solution is to split the implementation into two functions: a setup function and a generator function.Using  in a function turns it into a generator function, which means that it returns a generator when it's called. But even without using , nothing's preventing you from creating a generator and returning it, like so:And if you're using a class, there's no need to implement a  method. You can just use  in the  method:
