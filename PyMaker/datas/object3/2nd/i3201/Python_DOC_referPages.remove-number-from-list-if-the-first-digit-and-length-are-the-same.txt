Let's say I have a list of I want to remove any numbers that start with the same digit and have the same length.The result should be:  What I have so far is:I have a list of  and my code outputs .I couldn't find anything when searching, but I feel like I'm missing something obvious.Thank you for your time.
You can create the new list with a list comprehension, using itertools.groupby:We group using the tuple (first digit, length of number), and keep the first number of each group, which we get with .
Create a new set that will keep unique entries. Then, you may filter according to that set:
At the moment, you are using the variable  as a string in .  However, you can't subtract from a string. What you really want is to use  as an index and access in this way: .  However, using the index can be tricky if you are removing items from the list, so I've replaced the for loop with a while loop.  Also, I would recommend that you access the first digit directly, instead of getting a slice.  Therefore, your code will look more like this:Keep in mind that this will break if you have more numbers of length not equal to 3 or 4.  A more extensible solution would be:A final optimization would be to avoid using  in favor of building a new list.   can be a fairly slow operation compared to  so the following will be faster than the previous two solutions:
First sort the list from low value to high values. Check on the highest base of the number (so for 350, this is 100) and if a multiple of this base (i.e. 3) has not occurred before then add this value to a new list
