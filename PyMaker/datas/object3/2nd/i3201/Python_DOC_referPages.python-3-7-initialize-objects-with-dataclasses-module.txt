Here is the my code in python 3.6I want to rewrite this code in , how can i initialize  with  module?I know that i can do something like that but i can't get how to initialize  or similar to that.Thanks in advance for your ideas and suggestions.
Do away with getters and setters entirely and just use attribute access.  We can define an init only field that accepts a string and then convert that string to an integer field in our  call.
