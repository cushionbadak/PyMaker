My script was unable to write into a csv file, so i tried this: instead of that: All was fine, despite the fact that each table cell was nested in .  So, how can i get a clear formated csv file withous encoding issues(like in the first screenshot) and replaced or ignored allnon-unicode symbols(like in the second screenshot) using my scipt?
