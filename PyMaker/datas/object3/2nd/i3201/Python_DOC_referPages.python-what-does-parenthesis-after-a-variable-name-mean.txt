Towards the bottom at the main loop, I'm seeing this lineBut I have no idea what it does and I can't even Google it.What is this?The code below imports from task.py and project.py. But both files do not have anything related to result() hence I'm not including them here.
 returns an element of , which are all functions (, , ....). Thus,  is a function.  will execute that function and replace the value in  with the return value of that function.
You have to see the global loop:it just calls  function until it returns a non-function (probably a result), reassigning back the  name.  is just a name, it can reference anything including a function.you can see that like traversing a tree node by node until you reach a leaf.
