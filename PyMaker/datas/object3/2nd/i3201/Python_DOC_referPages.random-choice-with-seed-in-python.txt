I have two lists a and b with same length as belowHow can i choose elements in a using random.choices such that exact corresponding items in b are also picked. Both a and b will always be of same length. and both the elements of a and b are related based on index. so, in short, what i am trying to do is randomly select an element in a and then be able to pick the corresponding  element in b. One thing is that the elements might be repeated. 
The better option would be to put your lists into one list:then pick from that with .Failing that, use  to pick an index at random:The implementation for  uses the exact same codepath to pick a random index as what  with a single argument uses to determine a random integer within the range.
