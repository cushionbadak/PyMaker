I have a list of dictionaries, for instance :I want to filter them by IMDB > 5.5 :I try this code:and the output:When the IMDB is lower than 5.5, It returns an empty dictionary. any ideas? thank you!
A dictionary comprehension is not necessary to filter a list of dictionaries.You can just use a list comprehension with a condition based on a dictionary value:The way your code is written, the dictionary comprehension produces an empty dictionary in cases where .
An alternative to using list comprehension is using the  function from the Python . This takes in a function and an iterable, and returns a "filter object" that only keeps the items which, when passed through the function return True.In this case, it would be:I included the  around everything to convert the filter object to a list you can use. If you want to learn more about the  builtin, you can read about it here.
Other answers have already provided better alternative ways of doing this but let's look at the way you were going about it and look at what was going on.If I delete some things from your code, I get:Looking at just that, should make it clear why a dictionary is created for each movie. You do have an  statement inside that dictionary, but because it is inside, it doesn't change whether it is being created.To do this the way you were going about it, you'd essentially need to check twice making the first check irrelevant:which can be simplified to justand now, since we aren't changing the item, just:
If you are happy to use a 3rd party library, Pandas accepts a list of dictionaries via the  constructor:Result:
