why the list(123) results to an Exception while the [] works ??
list() is a type constructor The thing you put inside the brackets has to be iterable i.e. something that you can iterate though using a loop. Like a string or a list of integers or floats. As an integer itself is not iterable; list(123) gives an error. But if you type list('123'); then it returns a list as [ '1', '2', '3'].  In case of [123] it denotes a list of a single integer 123. So it works. Its just like writing 23 in the interpretor and getting 23 as the result.  
For an empty list, using  is much better because it's faster and avoid name look-upThe  built-in is useful to convert some other iterable to a list.
Because  is a callable that takes one object as parameter which must be an iterable, while  is list literal and understands that the single int supplied should be the only element for the list.If you want to use , you have to wrap the number in an iterable, for example .
The syntax of list() constructor is:And int is not iterable. so..
