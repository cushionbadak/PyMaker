Natural Text
I have the following two inputs  and  ,both the inputs are matching the  variable,the regex should only match  as it has the exact train name "Glory" ,regex should an exact match of the train, how to fix this?EXPECTED OUTPUT:
I'm going to take a wild guess at what you want, but I could be wrong.You're asking for —that is, any string that includes the substring . Greediness isn't going to change the fact that  contains that substring. It could change whether you match , ,  or , , , but that doesn't do any good; either way, it matches.I think what you may want to ask for is —that is, any string that contains the substring  between word boundaries. Like this Regex101 demonstration:See Regular Expression Syntax for an explanation of what  means:Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of word characters. Note that formally,  is defined as the boundary between a  and a  character (or vice versa), or between  and the beginning/end of the string. This means that  matches , , ,  but not  or .If you wanted to match only  at the end of the line, or  with whitespace (rather than any non-word character) or EoL, or something else, then of course this is wrong.
