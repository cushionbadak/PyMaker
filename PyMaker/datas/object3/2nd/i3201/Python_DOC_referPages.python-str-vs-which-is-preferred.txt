I have used some example code that uses str() instead of my normal habit of '' to denote an empty string.  Is there some advantage for using str()?  Eg:It does seem to be slower.
Referring to the Python manual  is used when:You want the string representation of an objectYou want to convert  (or other byte sequence, like ) into a stringIn all other cases, you should use .The fact that an empty  call returns a blank string is a side effect and not the intended primary use of the method.
The only advantage is that if  is redefined locally then  will use that definition whereas  will not. Otherwise, they are equivalent (although not equal since the compiler will emit a function call in one case and a literal in the other).
