I would like to get the value sum of the total deposit made in all the 3 months. However I was returned with this error: 
The more intuitive way would be to do a nested sum:You can also use 's  parameter to join the lists first:The default value for  is 0, which is why you get the error:  does not compute. Not to mention that your original sum would yield a very long list instead of a number, since that's what you get from adding lists together.A better way to chain the lists would be using , which wouldn't allocate multiple lists as byproducts:@Primusa's answer suggests an equivalent and more intuitive method for flattening the values that I highly recommend.
At the moment  isn't looping through each deposit in the dictionary, it's looping through each list inside of . Since the initializer for sum is 0, which is an int, you're getting the error when sum tries to add each list to 0. A solution would be to flatten the lists first before taking the sum:
Just iterate through the dictionary, get their values by assigning the key, and sum it. Like this:
