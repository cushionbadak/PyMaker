Natural Text
I have a DataFrame similar to the following:where some columns contain tuples. How could I create a new row for each item in the tuples such that the result looks something like this?I know that columns B & C will always have the same number of elements, as will columns E and F.
using zip_longest from itertools. All single-values are wrapped in lists so that they can be zipped with the other lists (or tuples)This creates an array of data frames, which then should be concatenated to get the desired result. Finally, the index should be reset to match the expected output.
