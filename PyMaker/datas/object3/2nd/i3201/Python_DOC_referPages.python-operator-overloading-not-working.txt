I have a Vector2 class: When I try to do , I get the error:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'instance'However, sometimes it works as intended:ball.vel is a vector and I am able to multiply by a float.Vectors are multiplied by floats in many sections of my code without errors.Does anyone know where this inconsistency comes from?Thanks
Define an  method to get  working. It can be as simple asThe other operators also have a dunder- version. These reflected operators are called when the normal version is not defined for the given types. See the docs for the  builtin constant.The expression  is equivalent to , unless  is an instance of a subclass of 's class or  returns , in which case it's  instead.
