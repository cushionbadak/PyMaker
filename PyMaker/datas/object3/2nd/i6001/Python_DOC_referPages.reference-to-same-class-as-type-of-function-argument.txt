This question already has an answer here:How do I specify that the return type of a method is the same as the class itself in python?                    3 answers                In Python 3.5, type annotations were added (see here).Is there a way of defining recursive type annotations, such as for a tree-like structure?In the above, it doesn't seem as though the annotation  works.

For example, the following code (the start of  a simple binary tree implementation) does not work:To address this, we write:It is allowable to use string literals as part of a type hint, for  example:
