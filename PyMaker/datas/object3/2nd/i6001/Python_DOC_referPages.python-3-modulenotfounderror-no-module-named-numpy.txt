You need to add python to your environment variables Computer -> System Properties (or Win+Break) -> Advanced System SettingsClick the  button (in the Advanced tab)Edit  and append  to the end (if you need substitute your Python version)Click OK. Note that changes to the PATH are only reflected in command prompts opened after the change took place.If you are running python 3.6 you will need to add python to your environment path through command promptWindows allows environment variables to be configured permanently at both the User level and the System level, or temporarily in a command prompt.To temporarily set environment variables, open Command Prompt and use the set command:These changes will apply to any further commands executed in that console and will be inherited by any applications started from the console.To change System variables, you need non-restricted access to your machine (i.e. Administrator rights).If you were to run  it should now workThis came directly from the python documents section 3.3.1Now after you restart you should be able to access python through the command line. If you are running 2.7.9+ or 3.4+ pip will come prepackaged with python. However, if you are running an earlier version of python Per https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip:Download get-pip.py, being careful to save it as a .py file rather than .txt. Then, run it from the command prompt:python get-pip.pyYou possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator (Microsoft TechNet).Thanks to How do I install pip on Windows?
Add "way to folder with your python interpreter" and "way to folder with your python interpreter"\Scripts\ to PATH variable. Computer -> Properties -> Extra options -> Environment variables.
