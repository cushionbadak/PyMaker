This question already has an answer here:Is it possible to override the assignment ('=') operator in Python?                    1 answer                I found out yesterday that it is possible to override operators in python, so after a bit of googling i found out how, but i could not find any way of overloading the "=" sign. There is __set__() but as i understand it, it overloads the sign for attributes in the object, and not for the object itself.  What i want to accomplish is this:So is there a way of overloading "=" for an object in python? (and what is that function called)
You cannot overload =(assign) operator.
