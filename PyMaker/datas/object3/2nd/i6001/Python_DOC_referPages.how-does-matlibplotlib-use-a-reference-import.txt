When I draw lines and rectangles using Matplotlib I usually use:But I also find somebody simply use:I found  is in fact , which means  is a reference to ?I am curious in:How does it work? some python tricks?I would use  to view but not in The Pyplot API, should I know they are designed on purpose, or deprecated?
Inside  there is a line saying Hence, if you import ,  is available from the pyplot namespace,Because the availability in the namespace itself is not a documented feature, one should probably not rely on it. Also it is better style to use the functions/objects imported from their original submodule.On the other hand it is very convenient to just write  instead of having to import the patches module first.I guess at the end you need to decide for yourself which case applies.
