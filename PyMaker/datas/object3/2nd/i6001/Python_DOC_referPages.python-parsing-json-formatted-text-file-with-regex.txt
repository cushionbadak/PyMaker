Natural Text
I have a text file formatted like a JSON file however everything is on a single line (could be a MongoDB File). Could someone please point me in the direction of how I could extract values using a Python regex method please? The text shows up like this: I am wanting to get the "fileAssetId" and filename". Ive tried to load the like with Pythons JSON module but I get an errorFor the FileAssetid I tried this regex:  But i get the following 034b9317‌​, 60d9, 45c2, b6d6, 0f24‌​b59e1991Im not to sure how to get the data as its displayed.
How about using positive lookahead and lookbehind:captures the  andmatches the filename. For a detailed explanation of the regex have a look at the Regex101-Example. (Note: I combined both in the example with an OR-Operator | to show both matches at once)To get a list of all matches use  or  instead of . returns a list of matching strings. returns an iterator with the objects.
You can use python's walk method and check each entry with re.match.In case that the string you got is not convertable to a python dict, you can use just regex:Solution for your example:executing this yields: 
Try adding \n to the string that you are entering in to the file (\n means new line)
