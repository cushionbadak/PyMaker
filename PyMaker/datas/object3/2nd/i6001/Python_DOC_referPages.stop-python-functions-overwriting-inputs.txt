I have a simple function that is supposed to run down the diagonal of an array and turn all the values to 0.When I run this function on an array, it outputs the new, correct 'zero' array, but it also goes back and overwrites the original 'dataset.' I had thought that the line  would have prevented this. I do not, however, get the same behavior with this function:Which leaves the first dataset unchanged. I've been reading StackOverflow answers to related questions, but I cannot for the life of me figure this out. I'm working on a scientific analysis pipeline so I really want to be able to refer back to the matrices at every step.Thanks
Arguments in python are passed by assignment (thanks to @juanpa.arrivillaga for the correction) and not by value. This means that generally the function does not recieve a copy of the argument, but a "pointer" to the argument itself. If you alter the object referenced by the argument in the function, you are modifying the same object outside. Here's a page with some more information.A possibility is to use the copy module inside your function, to create a copy of the dataset.As an example, for your code:This article helped me a lot with this concept.
