I have a json format string to be loaded with python2, but it will be error when .  when loads above json string, it will prompt error: , I found that is because there quote mark  before brace in , if I remove quote mark, json loads works.About first string, how can I ask json.loads to support it. otherwise, I need to remove quote mark one by one which is bored.
You can use str.replace() to remove  and  from your first string:
Since we are talking about json.loads() means that you are reading files.you can do so with bash and the amazing sedand if you wanna be very cool you can even use a fabric script!
