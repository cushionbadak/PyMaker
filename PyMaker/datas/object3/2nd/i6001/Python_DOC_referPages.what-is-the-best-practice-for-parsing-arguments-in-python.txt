As I don't have much experience in Python, I'm always trying to follow the Google Python Style Guide. The guide contains the following sentence."Even a file meant to be used as a script should be importable and a mere import should not have the side effect of executing the script's main functionality."Therefore, I searched for a way to override , and have been using this ArrtDict class for arguments parsing as follows.What would be the best practice for arguments parsing in Python?
What the sentence you're referring to is saying is that you should have this line in your script file:And that any code that runs the script should appear in that block.  By doing so, you ensure that the code won't automatically run when you import it from another file, since importing ignores the if statement mentioned above.For processing arguments (which should exist in the if block mentioned above, since you wouldn't want to do that when importing), you should use argparse for everything after Python 2.7.  Here's a link to the documentation:Python argparse libraryYou shouldn't have to override
