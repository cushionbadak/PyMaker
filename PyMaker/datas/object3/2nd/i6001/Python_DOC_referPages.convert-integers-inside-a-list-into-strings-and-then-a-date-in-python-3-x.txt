i've just started studying python in college and i have a problem with this exercise:basically i have to take a list of integers, like for example [10,2,2013,11,2,2014,5,23,2015], turn the necessary elements to form a date into a string, like ['1022013',1122014,5232015] and then put a / between the strings so i have this ['10/2/2013', '11/22/2014','05/23/2015']. It needs to be a function, and the length of the list is assumed to be a multiple of 3. How do i go about doing this? I wrote this code to start:but from a list [1,2,3] only returns me '1'.
To split your list into size 3 chunks you use a  with a  of 3And joining the pieces with  is as simple as Throwing it all together into a function:
Saswata sux
Use  to extract the date and and  to format it:OUTPUT
Something like this would work:So create a placeholder string and a new list. Then loop through each element in your list. If the element is not a year, then add it to the string with a '/'. If it is a year, add the string to the new list and clear the string.
