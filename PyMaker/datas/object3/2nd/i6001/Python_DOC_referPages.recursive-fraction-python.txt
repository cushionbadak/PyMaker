given an integer x, the function should compute and return the following:in my main, I have to display f(x) for values of x from 1 to 10, inclusively.Not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'm new to recursion and don't quite understand it after using iteration for so long.
You are missing brackets for x+1. Probably a typo.your function should be below,
there is one more correction about the data type currently its returning 0 we have to typecast it to floatdef main():    print(recursive(10))   
First you need parentheses in your denominator. Right now you are computing Second, you should write separate code for printing  from  to .  simply prints the value returned by , which is approximately . What you want is a function that prints out a visual representation of the sum.
I think I misunderstood the question and  figured out the proper answer:I was thinking that given a recursive function it should cycle and repeat itself (derp) I suppose I could do a for loop and a counter, but then I would be getting into iteration instead of recursion.
Python also has a very useful "generator" function - yield, that can be used to develop recursive functions that actually return individual values for each call:Result of [0.9, 0.8888888888888888, 0.875, 0.8571428571428571, 0.8333333333333334, 0.8, 0.75, 0.6666666666666666, 0.5, 0.0] is 7.071031746031746
