I want to take input from a file by default.For example:This statement should take input from a file instead of waiting for key hits. I do not want to do it by redirecting standard input to a file, I want it by default. Simply, keyboard is default device for input, so instead of keyboard I want a file to give input.
You can attach your file to the standard input on the OS level like this:To the script, it will seem like whenever  is invoked, the user types the next line from the file.
A simple workaround. You may avoid the global variable by wrapping it with class or make it a module.I don't like this but it is possible. To really replace the stdin (haven't tryied it on windows)For UNIX model,  is just a file. When you use utilities like  you would modify/redirect  of child processes. It feels more comfortable if  of a process is modified in parent's scope (e.g. a terminal). Otherwise it doesn't seem like 'std' anymore.
