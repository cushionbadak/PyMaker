When you import foo, you just imported the package, not any of the modules, so when you called bar, it looked in the init.py file for bar, and that file doesn't have bar in it. If you don't import bar into the modules global namespace, it has no idea what bar is, which is why you got an error. You could add  to the init.py file. This would make foo aware of bar when it runs the init.py file on import.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html has some information about modules and packages, and there's some really good info in this post here Importing packages in Python
