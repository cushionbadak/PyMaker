Thank you all for the help with my previous question. It really helped!. My code is now this...Here is my other question if possible to answer. I know ascii for lowercase and uppercase are different. Is there a way I can shift uppercase letters. like, make " Hello" shift by 2 to make"Jgnnq".Also if a user inputs something invalid it will keep it. An example being "hell@" shift by 2 will become "jgnn@"
 and  are designed around problems like these: mapping one set of character onto another.will print
