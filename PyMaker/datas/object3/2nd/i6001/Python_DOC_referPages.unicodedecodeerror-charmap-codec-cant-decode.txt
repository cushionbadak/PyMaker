Natural Text
I want to take the text of a file, each new value on a new line, for example My_list should look like this  should be equal to ,  should be equal to  and  should be equal to I tried doing so using the following in an approach like the one i found in here How do I read a file line-by-line into a list?Then i got a  do i referred to this link Why do I get a SyntaxError for a Unicode escape in my file path? added  at first and solved it for the first iteration then got this error that i referred to this link to solve UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte X in position Y: character maps to <undefined> and added . Still not working .EDIT: I changed the encoding to  but i didn't get the output i want from  instead i got stuff like that  , again what i want and expect is a list where each line of the .docx file is an element(seperated by /n).
Your input file is a docx file, which is a pkzip compressed archive.You can't open it as though it is a text file.Instead you could look at an external package such as python-docx. Something like this might work for you:
From the last link you give, I think the problem is that the file you are trying to read is not UTF-8 encoded.  Have you tried with another encoding? There is a list here.
