Context: Continuing with my self-learn of Python, I recently completed a textbook exercise that asked for a program that allowed the user to define 'x' number of years and to be able to input, for every month in 'x', a value for rainfall.Issue: Below is my code, which works 'ok', however the latest exercise demands I 'expand' my code to present the numerically largest and smallest user input rainfall value, in a print statement.Disclosure: I have looked on S.O to try finding the solution to my question, but nothing seems to be close enough to my challenge, to help me.What I've tried: I have tried using  and  however I keep getting a  when I type the code  or Is anyone able to offer some 'pointers' as to where I am going wrong?
Python's built-in min() and max() functions expect iterable object like list, set, etc. I think you are putting only one integer which is not so correct (how can you pick min or max number when only 1 number given - obviously it is bot min and max).One way of doing this would be:declare list var:Then when you get monthlyRainfall, you should add this code:After all for loops you can use min(rainfallList) and/or max(rainfallList)So your final code should be:
You can use  and  to intilize variables for tracking the minimum and maximum rainfall values that realistically the user will never enter above above or below respectively. However for the second case just to make sure you can also add a simple check to ensure the user does not enter a negative rainfall amount:Try out the full program with above changes here.Example Usage:N.B. I have only used camelCase in naming the new variables as that is the style you are using. I would recommend changing all the names of the variables in your program to snake_case as that is the convention in python.
