I am running Python 3.6.1 on a Windows 7 machine. I have some scripts in .I have created the user variable PYTHONPATH and set it to the folder above. I do not have admin rights so I can create a user variable only.In that folder, I have a myscripts.py file with some functions.If I try to access it running  from a file stored elsewhere, it doesn't work: I get a If I print sys.path, the folder I have set in PYTHONPATH is not there.Why? What am I doing wrong? Isn't sys.path supposed to show PYTHONPATH?Does the fact that H is a network drive have anything to do with it?I can't seem to find anything on the web for this problem in relation to Windows (but lots for Unix systems). 
A common way to fix this quickly is to useBe careful with  if you are using Windows.Not exactly answering your question but this could fix the problem. 
It is likely that there is a  file overriding the default behavior of . Remove or rename the  (or ) file.There was a  file included in my download of the Windows embedded zip file that caused  to not include .To completely override sys.path, create a ._pth file with the same  name as the DLL (python37._pth) or the executable (python._pth) and  specify one line for each path to add to sys.path. The file based on  the DLL name overrides the one based on the executable, which allows  paths to be restricted for any program loading the runtime if desired.When the file exists, all registry and environment variables are  ignored, isolated mode is enabled, and site is not imported unless one  line in the file specifies import site.Using Python on Windows - Finding Modules
