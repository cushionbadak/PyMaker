I'm not sure exactly how to describe this problem, so apologies if the title was insufficient.I'm trying to make a piece of code that will put all possible tick-tack-toe boards (0 is blank, 1 is X, 2 is O) into a 2d array (list of lists). I've successfully found a way to do this:And it works. But instead of typing out the next seven list items, I thought it would be easier to iterate over them like so:and it just gave me a big array of zeros! I have no idea why changing it to iteration would do this; I tried with both ** and pow(). DOes anyone know what the problem is?
Looking at your code, I think in your second example you could have meant:Also, you can utilise  to achieve the same kind of outcome:
Let's look at that inner expression:The numerator is simply : you take it modulus , which will be larger than .  The next step is then  -- taken as an integer, this is 0.In short, your algebra is off.I recommend that you use  to get the output you want.
