I have the code I would like for the content I need, however i would like to run through all the gameId's that have played so far instead of just the one in the URL. I would like to change 2017020001 and make it go through to 2017021272 or till the end of the season which is around 1272 i believe. How can that be done with the code below?
If the game ids are numbered sequentially then it would be as simple as nesting all your code under a for loop that iterates through all the game ids and using str.format() add the necessary padding to the number in this case some parts would change:One last correction is that using  makes it so that you don't need to close the file explictily.You can find additional information on using str.format() here
You should iterate over your code using a for-loopSomething like this should work:
