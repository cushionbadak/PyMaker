I have a function like:If I want to exit this function at  in the code, what is the recommended way? I want to raise some exception, print error message, return to the calling function and stop the program.   will exit, but is it the recommended way? 
It depends. If you want to raise an Expection, then raise it in the method.If you don't handle it, the program will crash. That is usually not a good way to stop the program and should not be the case, when the Exception is predictable.If you handle it (with try/catch) then you shoulda) do something, so that the program can continue nonethelessb) notify the user that something went wrong and cannot be handled and exitUsually if you use sys.exit(x) when something went wrong, then x is bigger than 0Return is the default if nothing went wrong and the method/function simply finishedsys.exit(0) is used to terminate the programe.g. if you have a particular button (or key combination etc.) that, when pressed, should stop the application 
I believe that sys.exit(0) will exit the program, not return to the calling function. As Jean-Francois says, I believe you want to raise an exception. If you want the calling function to handle that exception (i.e. for your program not to end) then surround the call to Foo with try - except logic.
