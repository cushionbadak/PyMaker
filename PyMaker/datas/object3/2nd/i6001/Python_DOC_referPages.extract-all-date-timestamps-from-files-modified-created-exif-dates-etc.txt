I am trying to extract all available date and timestamps for all files in the CWD.For example  (even if the output not so nice):I am getting syntax error for . Any hints what I am doing wrong?Code:
I got the same errors that you did. First, I had to move line 4 after "file" is defined, or, in this case, "f". Then, the second error was the syntax of the print command. If you place a comma before timestr, it should print fine. The third problem was that I was getting permission denied, apparently from trying to open a whole directory.I have rewritten some of your script to something that I think better suits your needs.However, seeing your first posted example, I thought I could modify this to match it. Here's what I came up with:Running it gave me:Now, it's just a matter of you getting the parameters on the right places and configuring the print commands to suit your exact needs.Edit: With the request to extract EXIF data, the code looks like this. Forgive the blank except.Remember that you can adjust glob to only get jpg, png, or whatever you want. This script gets everything and if it's not an image, it just prints that it failed.
You would need a  comma if you wanted timestr to be the 2nd argument to ctime. But it only takes one argument.There is a difference between a scalar numeric value representing seconds since 1970, and a datetime. It looks like you want to hand the getctime() result to utcfromtimestamp(). Then you'll have an object you can call strftime() on, which will accept timestr as an argument.
