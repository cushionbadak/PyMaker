I am new to hbase and currently I am using hbase-1.2.6. I did the connection to hbase using python script by using happybase package. my question is :can someone please let me know how to decode timestamp value which is automatically inserted whenever we put any records in table?
The timestamp value is the number of milliseconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970 UTC).  You can use the python  module to manipulate it.  Example:The result is a  object in my local time zone. (Central USA)  The  method wants a floating point value that is the time in seconds since the epoch, so divide the time in milliseconds by 1000.Here is the  module reference.
