I am using ElementTree to parse XML files.I was using Python 3.6, but now I have to shift my code to a machine having only Python 2.6. I made some of the necessary changes in syntax, but I am stuck at , which does not exist in Python 2.6, and which I was using with no arguments to recursively parse an  object.I tried to change  to , but that asks for a parameter specifying a match to filter elements by. I also tried simply doing… but that only returns the children at the first level under , not all of its descendants (which is what I need).How can I recursively get all the elements in Python 2.6?
 was introduced in Python 2.7, to replace  … which, although deprecated since then, remains available up to and including the current Python 3.x release.In many cases,  can be used as a drop-in replacement for  if Python 2.6 compatibility is required.However: it's important to note that, although they're often interchangeable in practice, these methods are not the same:  returns an iterator, while  returns a list:… with all of the potential implications for performance and functionality that this difference implies.
