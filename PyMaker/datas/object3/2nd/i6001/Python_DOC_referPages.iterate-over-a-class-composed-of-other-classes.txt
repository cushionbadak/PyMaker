I have a structure representing some data in a following way:I would like to iterate over  elements so that i will be able to access all nested objects like below:I have read that there are a few possible solutions to solve this:using metaclass  implementing iterator protocol   using itertoolsThis is all fine on basic examples, but I couldn't find any solution to the problem I am facing directly - having class which's elements are composed of other classes.
 uses the (internal equivalent of the)  function on the object to get an iterator. Implement the  method to produce one:I used a generator function to produce an iterator; when  is called a generator object is created that then produces  and  in order.The (Python 3)  syntax then delegates to all such values in , which also needs to implement the protocol:Alternatively,  could just reach into  and  and , and not delegate.
