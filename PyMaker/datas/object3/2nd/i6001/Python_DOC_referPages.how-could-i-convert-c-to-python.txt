I'm trying to reproduce the above code in python, but I'm not sure what I'm getting wrong. I'm not sure how to start at a number, then decrement until the condition is met. Here's what I have so far:What am I doing wrong?    
 solves half of the problem itself. Rest of the thing is just formatting and inputting the number. means the range starts from  and ends in  and there is a step of  in between them..Your C++ program generates wrong output:-Correct code:You meant  (newline) in  not .
You need a for loop that decrements.
