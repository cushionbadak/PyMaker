I have a very simple request. I want to write a python function that can download multiple csv files from a website and save them in a specified location. I have found how to simply download a csv file, but want to create a function that can do this multiple times so a different file is downloaded each iteration. I want to change "File" in the code above to say "X", then "Y", "Z" etc.Can someone please show me how this is done.Thanks a lot
You can do this in several ways. First make a list of file names , find its length, then run a loop to get your data. below is the code:-I hope this helps.
If you want to do something like that you should probably invest the time to actually learn even the simplest basics of programming languages. Anyway,Should give you some hint what you need to do. However, beware that you can't simply concatenate paths like that because that's unsafe. You'll have to use  urljoin and os.path.join
