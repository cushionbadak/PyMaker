I want to make a subprocess call to get the directory structure of a folder called ORIG.Here's my code:The call command is working, as I see the contents of the file outputFile.txt when I open it:But why can't I read this/print the output?According to Luke.py's suggestion, I tried the following also:This gives me the outut:
try Popen- You'll need to import PIPE from subprocess.
First: There is no need to call external programs. If you want to get the subdirectories of some path, there's the python function . You could use that and check each entry with , or e.g. use  and just use the directories.If you really want to call an external program and get its stdout, usually the high level function  is the right choice.You can get the stdout with:Without the need for a temporary file or low level functions.
If you don't want to close and reopen the file in between writing and reading, you can use the seek command to read the file from the beginning.
