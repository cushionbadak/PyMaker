I was going through generator in python and I got understood the advantage of generators.Consider the examplecase A:Say in the above example, instead of for loop, I usedcase B:Are case A and case B the same in terms of complexity?I mean if I am using a  loop like  in case A, will I get benefit of generator? Or do I always have to use  for better benefits?
First of all,  is not an equivalent.  produces the next value in the iterator, it is not a drop-in replacement for  using a loop.You'd have to use a  loop:This is slower, because this involves repeated  name resolutions. It is otherwise not more efficient. uses  on the generator (which will return ), and then internally calls the same method  would call, the  method on the iterator.Ultimately, you can test if something is more efficient (performant), with the  module:So for a generator producing 1 million items, the  loop is almost 4 times faster.The advantages of generator functions and generator expressions are memory efficiency, and in many cases, code clarity.  and  are two very different use-cases to get values from your generators, use what you need for the problem at hand.
