I am learning about python's multiprocessing module. I want to make my code use all my CPU resources. This is the code I wrote:The output I get is this:I tried experimenting with different range values in the for loops or using print statement only in work function but everytime without parallel runs faster. Is there something I am missing?Thanks in advance!
Your benchmark method is problematic:I guess you want to run 100 processes in parallel, but  blocks until process exit, you effectively run in serial. Besides, run more busy processes than CPU cores count leads to high CPU contention which is a performance penalty. And as a comment pointed out, your  function is too simple, compare to the overhead of  creation.A better version:result:
