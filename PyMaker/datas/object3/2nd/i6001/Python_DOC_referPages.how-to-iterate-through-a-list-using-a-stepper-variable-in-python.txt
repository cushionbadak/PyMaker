Natural Text
I am trying to write a function that returns a hangman style output given an input of guessed characters and a secret to be guessed. I start by making a new list set to  as many times as the length of the secret. I then iterate through this variable and test if  where  is the walker as we loop through. Currently to keep track of this stepper I am using this codeIs there a built in functionality for  as I am using here?

You could create the displayed word dynamically with  and a comprehension. The guesses are stored in a  and a ternary operator checks if the letter or  should be displayed:
