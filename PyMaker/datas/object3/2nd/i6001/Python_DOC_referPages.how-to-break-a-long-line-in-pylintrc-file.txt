I have a PyLint configuration file, , with some rules defined.However, for one rule, I have quite a few items which results in a very long line.An example of a long line can be seen here on github: https://github.com/behave/behave.example/blob/master/pylintrc#L263Is it possible to break the line to keep listing items on the next line(s)? I've tried to move the items to the next line, however, this seems to make the file invalid.
pylint parses the  file using , which says in its docs:Values can also span multiple lines, as long as they are indented deeper than the first line of the value.This means the solution is to use
