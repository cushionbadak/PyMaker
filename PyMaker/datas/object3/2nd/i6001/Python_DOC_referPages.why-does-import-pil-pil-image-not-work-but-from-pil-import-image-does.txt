In a python interpreter:Why do I have to make the import as "from PIL import Image"? I'm interested in both "what is the underlying working in python imports that makes this behaviour possible?" and "Why was the PIL package designed to work like this?"Also, I really like to keep a clean namespace when programming. If I want to use  in my code, should I import like this:or is there a better way?
You could import :I think that Pillow is structured this way because of the history of the package. The original package  allowed you to do . Pillow, the fork of PIL which supports Python 3, moved  to the  namespace. The suggested import  makes it easy to switch from PIL to Pillow. See the porting docs for more info.
 is a submodule of  and so won't be automatically imported with,since Python doesn't recursively import submodules.5.4.2. Submodules in the Python Language Reference may help to understand the behaviour of importing submodules.When a submodule is loaded using any mechanism, ... a binding is placed in the parent moduleâ€™s namespace to the submodule object.So although after importing and loading a submodule,you are able to access it via , this does not mean  is loaded when importing the  module.Also, I couldn't find this explicitly stated anywhere but from what I've tested, it seems to be that when you import a submodule either like:or:The parent package is also loaded in the process.
