I am trying to write a dictionary into a CSV file using the following code:Below is the error that is being thrown:AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call  last)  in ()        8         9 for city, filenames in city_info.items():  ---> 10     condense_data(filenames['in_file'], filenames['out_file'], city)       11     print_first_point(filenames['out_file']) in condense_data(in_file, out_file,  city)       38             ## see https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects ##       39             print(new_point)  ---> 40             trip_writer.writerows(new_point)       41        42 /opt/conda/lib/python3.6/csv.py in writerows(self, rowdicts)      156       157     def writerows(self, rowdicts):  --> 158         return self.writer.writerows(map(self._dict_to_list, rowdicts))      159       160 # Guard Sniffer's type checking against builds that exclude complex()/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/csv.py in _dict_to_list(self, rowdict)      146     def _dict_to_list(self, rowdict):      147         if self.extrasaction == "raise":  --> 148             wrong_fields = rowdict.keys() - self.fieldnames      149             if wrong_fields:      150                 raise ValueError("dict contains fields not in fieldnames: "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'keys'I did look it this type of questions on Stack Overflow but none of them helped.
You're using  where you should use , because you're trying to write one row, not a list of them.
