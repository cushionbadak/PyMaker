So I know that I can use either the "%" or ".format" syntax to format string, particularly to trim the end of string to a set number of characters:Is there any way to trim the beginning of the string using string formatting (not slicing, etc)? The desired output would be:I have tried the following, to no avail:"%.-3s""%.=3s""%.:3s""%.:-3s"And so on.I have seen nothing in the docs about this, but would be happy to be proven wrong! Any help is appreciated.

For strings, taking a slice is more Pythonic:Bear in mind the "wrap-around" behavior of negative numbers in slicing and indexing.
You can do like this :
