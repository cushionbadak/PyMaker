My code does the following, It reads a N*N matrix file e.g. my matrix.txt file is 2 3 41 2 69 8 9and converts it into a list integer [[2,3,4],[1,2,6],[9,8,9]] whichthen transposes the values inside by moving the value inside to the value of the index when flipped. E.g. [1][0] = 1, so the value of list [0][1] should change from 3 to 1. and the value of [1][0] changes from 1 to 3.This makes it so the final output after transposing the matrix should become[[2,1,9],[3,2,8],[4,6,9]] after flipping all values. Keep in mind if the index is same where [0][0] or [1][1] or [2][2], nothing happens.The following is my code, i am unable to get the final output as i think there there is something wrong with my swapping algorithm, any help is appreciated.
FYI, this could be replaced by a  function pretty easily.  Passing in 3 separate arrays (list[0], list[1], list[2]) and zipping them will basically realign the elements by column.  So [[2 3 4], [1 2 6], [9 8 9]] becomes [[2 1 9], [3 2 8], [4 6 9]].
Use zip()
Other more traditional methods can be found here especially matrix transpose using nested loops.
