I want to get an union-like merged dict of multiple (3 or more) dictionaries.What I have:What I want to get:What is the most pythonic / efficient way to to this?I've found an example for 2 dictionaries here, but is there a better way (e.g.: a comprehension) what can solve the missing key problem for some dictionaries here?Is there a way to do the same merge for any number of input dictionaries?
Produce a union of all the keys, then iterate over that union to gather values:In Python 3,  gives you a dictionary view object, which acts like a set. You can create a union of all keys in all dictionaries with  on those objects.In Python 2, use  instead.Demo:For an arbitrary sequence of dictionaries, use  and a  call on a generator expression:
