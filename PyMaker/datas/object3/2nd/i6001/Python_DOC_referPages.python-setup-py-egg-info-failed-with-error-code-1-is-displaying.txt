In Selenium Webdriver , I am working on Python in Pycharm In which I am using simple class in which two methods are called to open URL in Chrome and Safari respectively.Now After Executing it, I am getting an error like this:I am trying to install self package via command line, its throwing me an error like this:Can some one help me here.
Not sure why you are trying to install the self package, you are not using it in your code, and you do not need it.Your issue is a simple mistake here when calling your method:This code is outside your class, the name  is not defined here, and you get the error you are seeing:The correct way to call your method would be this:Since you are calling a method of an instance,  (the instance that the actual method you called belongs to) will automatically be passed as first argument.Do not take this the wrong way, but I think you need to work your way through the Python tutorial, as this is somewhat of a basic mistake, and with more complicated code you will run into countless issues like this one and will not enjoy working on your project.
