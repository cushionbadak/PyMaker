Natural Text
I tried to use  to make a framework. But somehow I can't do it because one of the column headers is written in Hebrew.I checked, and it is possible for a DataFrame to have a Hebrew word as column header.  but I want to import the data itself from the csv containing the Hebrew word, which I can't.I get this error .How can I import a dataset to datadrame with the column header?
Your file is not in  encoding.Most likely in ASCII with . in Hebrew codepage matches the first (last) character you show in your header example.You'll have to use the  parameter with the correct codepage.
As for how to check your encoding, there's a simple trick here, might be of use:You can just open the file using notepad and then goto File -> Save As. Next to the Save button there will be an encoding drop down and the file's current encoding will be selected there.
