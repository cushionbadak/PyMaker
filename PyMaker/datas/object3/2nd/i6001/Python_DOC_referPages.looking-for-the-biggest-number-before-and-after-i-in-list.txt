I'm sorry if the title is confusing. Here's a better explanation:So basically what I need to do is iterate through every number in list and print the biggest number west (list[0:i]) and the biggest number east. If the biggest number is smaller than i, we print i. So for list [1, 3, 2, 4, 3] the output should be:1 43 4 3 44 44 3I thought my code was correct but it doesn't work for the last number in list, is anyone able to help?'a' is the list in my code
Try:You are not iterating over the indices in your original code; and thus the partition does not make sense. 
The only mistake in your code is the  loop, which loops throgh  and not The following piece of code works  
this may work... not fully tested but it looks correctOutput: 1 4 3 4 4 4 4 3
