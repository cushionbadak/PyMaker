I have a list of objects with ids (object.id) and a list of ids. What is the most efficient way to use the list of ids to order the object list? I have the following solution... just wondering whether there is a faster one?Input: = list of user objects with user ids (user.id)  = list of user ids e.g. Output: list of user objects ordered according to Code:
You could first put the users in a dict:And then you'd have a few options, based on looking up the users by their , for example:Edit: I'd probably, unless you have a very large list or have perform the operation many times, not worry about efficiency that much, but rather focus on having it clear and readable.
You can use  function with custom sorting function. In this case returning index in the ids list.Example:Results in:
Here is an O(n log(n)) solution. It requires the ids in both lists to be exactly the same. It sorts the object list by id and does an indirect sort of the id list yielding an index list containing the positions of ids in order. This is then used to move the sorted objects to the right positions.Prints:
Here's a variation of the scheme using the built-in  function with a custom comparison function. (It may seem like a lot of code, but a significant portion of it is only there for setting up a somewhat realistic test case.)Output:
