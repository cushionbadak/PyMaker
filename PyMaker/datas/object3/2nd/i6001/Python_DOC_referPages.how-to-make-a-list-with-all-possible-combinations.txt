I want to make a list which contains all possible 4-digit combinations of digits 1-6e.g.how am I going to do it? I run out of ideas

This will do the job:Keep in mind that  is a Tuple
Make a list with all possible 1 digit numbers.l1 = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']for each string in the above list, concatenate all possible digits, i.e.l2 = []repeat this two more timesl3 = []l4 = []
