This question already has an answer here:Using global variables in a function                    18 answers                I am trying to make a function called add_item() which works like append() and I am not allowed to use any built in functions. I keep getting an UnboundLocalError. How would I fix this?
Even if you fix the local variable issue, your code doesn't behave like list.append. append operates by stateful side effect, mutating the list it was run on; your code created a new list and assigned a name. The only way I can think of to mutate a list that way without using a named method is a slice assignment:But this obviously uses the  built in function, and the assignment is translated into a setitem call. It's possible to avoid using len, by using implicit bool and getitem calls. But the calls are still there; basically, only a program that performs no operations can run without calling built in functions. 
Because the statement , which is an assignment statement that creates a local variable  hides the global variable with the same name. So you have to specify that the variable is in global scope using the keyword . When you use ,there is no assignment operation, hence no variable is created and the variable in the global scope is used.
Check the code below:
