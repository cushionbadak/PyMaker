What is required to support keyword argument unpacking for a custom class in Python? In both the Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 interpreters the following error message is given when trying to unpack an incompatible type:Does mapping mean the object has to specifically subclass ? Or is mapping in this case one of those pseudo types such as iterable where you don't have to explicitly subclass  to support ? Does this behavior differ between Python 2 and 3?
A Mapping is a generic container for associating key/value pairs.It is not compulsory to inherit from  in order to use dictionary unpacking. Besides,  is an abstract class, so you'll still have to override some methods in order to be able to use dict unpacking with any of its subclasses.For an instance of a class to be dict unpackable, it is enough for the class to implement a  method and a corresponding  method to return a value given a key:
Here is the Python glossary entry for :A container object that supports arbitrary key lookups and implements the methods specified in the Mapping or MutableMapping abstract base classes. Examples include dict, collections.defaultdict, collections.OrderedDict and collections.Counter.
