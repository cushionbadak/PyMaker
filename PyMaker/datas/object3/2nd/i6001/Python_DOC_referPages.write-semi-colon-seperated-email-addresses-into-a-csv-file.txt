Natural Text
I have a file email.txt which has email addresses as follows:James, Brian < brian.james@abc.com>; Attar, Daniel < Daniel.Attar@abc.com>; Alex, James < james.alex@abc.com>; Trendy, Elizabeth < elizabeth.trendy@abc.com>; jones, Gary < Gary.Jones@abc.com>; bones, byron < byron.bones@abc.com>;  I want to write the email addresses into a .csv file in one column like this:  I wrote a Python script as follows which does this:  Is there a better, more efficient or more elegant way to write this?
You could consider reading the contents of the text file as a single string and then using  to extract the emails from that string.In this case, it looks like your email format is fairly specific, so the regex below is also specific also.  Realize, though, that a regex capable of finding any RFC 5322-compliant email address (the "official standard" for email address formats) is several hundred characters long.  For more on that see How to Find or Validate an Email Address from Jan Goyvaerts.Anyway...Regex walkthrough: this regex assumes each email takes a pretty specific form: .   is 1 or more non-whitespace characters is a literal period (backslashing a metacharacter)
