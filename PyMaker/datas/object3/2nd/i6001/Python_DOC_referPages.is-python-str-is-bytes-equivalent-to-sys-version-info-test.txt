Natural Text
Is it correct to useinstead ofto distinguish python2 from python3?  Especially when the version dependent code is required precisely because of the possibility that str is not unicode, the former sometimes seems clearer to me (and avoids an often gratuitous import sys), yet I've never seen python code which uses this test.  Is "str is bytes" true only as a quirk of version 2 CPython, or is it guaranteed in all python2s?
Please use  to tell readers that you're trying to identify the python2 case.
