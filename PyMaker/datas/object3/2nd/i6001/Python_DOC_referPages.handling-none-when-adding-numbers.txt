I would like to perform addition of 2 integers, which can also be None, with the following results:What is the most pythonic, concise expression for this?So far I have:orIs there any shorter way to achieve it?
This is reasonably compact and can handle different numbers of terms:
With boolean logic:Here's a Pythonic method, using lazy :With filterFor an arbitrary number of summands, you could use  and :With an exceptionNote that the previous implementations will return  for . This is the expected mathematical result of an empty sum.Returning  is suprising and might lead to s when you use the output of .One way to achieve the desired behaviour when users don't input any valid summand is to throw an exception:
Try this
