Take this super simple class:The goal is to create instances of the class to use as dict keys.  If  is omitted, the keys are the standard object address.  With  a printable representation might be:When attempting to access the dict by key though, it does not appear to be immediately obvious how to utilize the  (or  for that matter) representation as the key.
First thing's first:  is a red herring. It only affects how the object is displayed. It has nothing to do with what you're trying to do.If you want to have two separate objects refer to the same slot in a dict, you need two things (reference):The objects must have the same hash ().The objects must compare equal ().Your above implementation does the former, but not the latter. You need to add an  method (which is actually required by the documentation when you define , anyway).Â
