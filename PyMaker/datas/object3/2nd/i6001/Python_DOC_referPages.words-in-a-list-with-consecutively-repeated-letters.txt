Right now I have a list of for example  I want to remove the words with the repeated letters, in which I want to remove the wordsMaybe ?
Thanks to this thread: Regex to determine if string is a single repeating characterHere is the re version, but I would stick to PM2 ring and Tameem's solutions if the task was as simple as this:OutputAnd the other:Output
Loop is the way to go. Forget about sets so far as they do not work for words with repetitive letters.Here is a method you can use to determine if word is valid in a single loop:Example
The original version of this question wanted to drop words that consist entirely of repetitions of a single character. An efficient way to do this is to use sets. We convert each word to a set, and if it consists of only a single character the length of that set will be 1. If that's the case, we can drop that word, unless the original word consisted of a single character.outputHere's code for the new version of your question, where you want to drop words that contain any repeated characters. This one's simpler, because we don't need to make a special test for one-character words..outputIf the repetitions have to be consecutive, we can handle that using .output
Here's a way to check if there are consecutive repeated characters:You can then use a list comprehension to filter your list:
One line is all it takes :)Output
