I am familiar with scraping data in this format.But not in this manner.  This is what I have so far with no success.I Would like to pull the "gamePk", "gameDate" from totalGames along with the teamNames within "teams" and other categories. I eventually would like to put that into a csv with the gamePk, gameDate, teams, score, etc. I'm just not sure how to get through the individual categories, any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
It's normal json data, just a bit complicated.  You can get the date from . For the teams, score, etc you have to iterate over .  As for your last question, you can get the 'pk' from .  The player, event, triCode and coordinates values are a little harder to get because some items don't have 'players' and 'team' keys, or the 'coordinates' dict is empty.  In this case the  method can be helpful because it will return  (or you can set a default value) if you try to access a non-existent key.Still you have to design your code according to the structure of the json data, example:
