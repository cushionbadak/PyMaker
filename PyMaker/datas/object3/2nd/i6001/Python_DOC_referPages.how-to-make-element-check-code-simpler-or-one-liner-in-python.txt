I wanna make simple condition to check whether element 'a' in A and element 'b' in B has a some characteristic. the below code operates well, it looks dirty, so, I wanna make it simpler, or one-liner. are there any way to do that?
Ignoring the possible pandas or numpy angles that  suggests might be available, you can use  to get the exact same functionality: short-circuits; as soon as a  fails,  is returned.  is only produced if all tests pass.
Here I follow a different approach from Martijn's one, he postulated that Numpy/Pandas are not relevant for the answer, I proceed with the understanding that everything is a Numpy array...First, for demonstrational purposes, we create a matrix of strings, among them the one we don't want in your samplenext, two vector of indicesand the correct broadcasting rule to apply them to indexing and eventually, similar to what was suggested in comments and proposed in other answersI would like to stress the  line, that could be commented like this "Look ma', no loops" ;-)In terms of a function definition (more general than yours)note that the function is resilient w/r receiving in  and  sequences that are not Numpy arrays.
