I am reading python official documentation word by word.In the 3.3. Special method names 3.3.1. Basic customizationIt does specify 16 special methods under  basic customization, I collect them as following:The problem is that there's three of them are not 's valid attributesObject is a base for all classes. 2. Built-in Functions â€” Python 3.6.3 documentationIt has no recursive base classes.Where are methods of , , defined for class 'object'?
Where are methods of , ,  defined for class 'object'?They aren't defined on . These are special methods you can implement yourself on classes.The misunderstanding probably happened because the documentation says , but the  there just means that it's a method on the object (in the sense of "instance") if implemented. Likewise the later examples on that documentation page list it also shows special methods for metaclasses with . That doesn't mean that it's always implemented, more like if implemented it's available on the class.
 absolutely must not exist for  - its very presence in a class changes how the garbage collector treats its instances, so having this method on  would make it impossible for any class to not have it. is only needed if you want to override the default behavior of treating objects as truthy in a boolean context.   has no need to override that behavior.I'm not sure what's up with , I think it defaults to  if not present (or something similar).
