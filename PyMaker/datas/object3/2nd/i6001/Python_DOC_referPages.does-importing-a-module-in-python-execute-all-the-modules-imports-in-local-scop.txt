That's expected. I haven't imported  module.This one too.  imports :So the names are available via .But not this one. What makes me able to access  via ? I've read the docs, but saw no clues there.
OK, let's see:You will see an item:Then, try , you will see:So there is a  in , but not  or . Because  doesn't import them.Now let's go to :Get an item:It is the same as .Then try  again:There are  in it. Why? Because  imports them.Let me try and explain it in more details. Importing  first imports , then . Importing  gives us  symbol in local scope, representing module having been imported. Importing  imports  among other things. Which adds  symbol to  module. And since we have reference to , that makes us able to access  after importing . Consider the following example::
Unsure whether it is what you expected, but this is by design. Is you look at the sources of urllib/parse.py and urllib/request.py you will see an important difference: the former only import the re, sys and collections modules when the latter (in addition to other unrelated modules) also explicitely imports symbols from urllib.error, urllib.parse and urllib.response.That is the reason why you find them available even if the import was not in your own source file.A more detailed answer would require a detailed description of Python import machinery and is far beyond what is appropriate in a SO answer. Please refer to the official documentation for a more in depth explaination.
