I am trying to figure out what the  method does.-- What does this function do?
If the key  is in , the  method returns the  for the key.If the  is not in the , the method returns the optional "nothing".Calling the above function with a  that is in the dictionary:And, calling the function with a  that is not in the dictionary:You could read about the method at dict.get()Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.
