Is there any magic method that will invoke when I pass object as argument of function?
No, arguments to functions are not treated special in any way. It's just another assignment (to the parameter names of the function).If you need to treat  and  as separate arguments, make  a sequence, then pass it in with the  call syntax to expand the sequence to separate arguments. You can make it a sequence by making it an iterator type:Demo:
