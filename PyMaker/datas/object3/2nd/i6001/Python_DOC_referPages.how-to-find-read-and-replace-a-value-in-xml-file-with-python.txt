This is my example XML file:I want to change the value in the the tag data with key "times" and add 1 to it every time I start the script from the terminal.I tried first of all to read the element with:But i'm already stuck because it doesn't work. If I try to print "times"I get no output from the terminal.My Idea was to read it, with a function add to this value 1 and replace it with the total of the sum (2 in this case). And save the modified XML file.It should be easy to do but I can't figure it out.EDITI had to read better the documentation, I tried with:It read correctly the value, add 1 but gives an error if I try to write the file. What am I doing wrong?EDIT 2 I found the solution, read below my own answer.
Very simply:Wrong level of chacking ...
I found the solution, I only had to first read the value, turn it in an integer, add 1 and replace the value turning it again into a string:That's all.
