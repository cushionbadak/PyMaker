I want to exclude some specific exceptions that are not critical from logging to sentry using raven handler.However, I couldn't find out any way to config the filters for those handlers.The similar logging feature in Java is https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.0/manual/filters.htmlI want to do something like thisDo  package support that? If no, would you mind telling me the best way to achieve that?Thanks
Thanks for @georgexsh advice, I finally end up with this solution.Hope it helps someone those encounter the same problem
