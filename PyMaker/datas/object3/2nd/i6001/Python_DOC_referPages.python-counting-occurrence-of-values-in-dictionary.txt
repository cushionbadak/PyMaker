Use a  object to keep count of each object reading straight from your CSV reader/file, keying each counter on the corresponding date in a :You can then use the  method of the  objects to get the countries with the most occurrence at each date:
You can create a dictionary from the list and use the  function to do so. This will roughly work in the following way:This will work in Python 2.7. For Python 3 you can write:Another way to do this is by using Collections.Counter.
Here is a solution based on pandas apply valuecounts i.e
