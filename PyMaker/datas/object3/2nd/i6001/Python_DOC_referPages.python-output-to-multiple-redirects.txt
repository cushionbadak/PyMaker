In C++, I can output to  and ; in practice this results in code wherein I can redirect output to two files at once like: How would I accomplish this in python?
E.g. in Python 3, just import the equivalents of  and , namely  and .Then you can use your bash redirection as you normally would:And if you want, you can even name them whatever you like. E.g.:It's less "Pythonic," but if it helps you bridge the gap from your C++ experience, it may be a help.

If you want to redirect from the command line, it's pretty much the same way you would do in C++:Programmatically, you can do this with  and , by monkey patching those with files of your choice.
