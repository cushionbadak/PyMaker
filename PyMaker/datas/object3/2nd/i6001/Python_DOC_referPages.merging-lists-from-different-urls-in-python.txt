I want to get a list of events as values on my y axis, but there is something I can't figure out. This is the code I have so far.When I run this code, this is the (part of the) outcome:I want to merge the lists (if these are lists), so that I just have one big list (if that's what that's called) with all the values, so I can use them all as values for the y-axis of my graph.(Like this: )How do I merge these lists easily?
