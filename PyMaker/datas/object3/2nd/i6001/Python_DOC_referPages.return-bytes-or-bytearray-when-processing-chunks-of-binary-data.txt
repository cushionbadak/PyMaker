When returning/yielding chunks of binary data, is it more idiomatic to return  or ?My function accumulates data in a  and currently returns . Are there any reasons for or against returning just the  directly? In particular, if a function expects  and gets , are there any possible pitfalls (as long as it doesn't check the actual type)?According to the documentation of :It has most of the usual methods of mutable sequences, described in Mutable Sequence Types, as well as most methods that the  type has, see Bytes and Byte Array Methods.(My emphasis.) This suggests that  can be used in any place that where  is expected.
They are not interchangeable for every possible case. Some code may use type checking and they have different types. Like their names, types are  and .After question edit:The only difference is that bytes is an immutable version of bytearray.So,  can be used in any place where  is expected.
