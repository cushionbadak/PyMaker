Thank you for reading my question.First of all, I use python 3.5 to write my code.Recently, I have tried to read image file names, and each have a pattern format like:A01_[2016tokyo-tokyo-university-1_chuuoushokudo_1]_ori.jpgand wordpress will add new post thumbnail for me, likeA01_[2016tokyo-tokyo-university-1_chuuoushokudo_1]_ori-75x75.jpgFurthermore, I use this pattern to rename my images.(english alphabet)(numbers) _ [(postname) _ (description) _ (number)] _ (ori or mod) _ (number).jpgMy question is, if I want to use this pattern to check whether I use the right way to rename my image, how can I do?Thank you very much.
Try taking a look at Python's re module. With a little work, it should help you achieve what you're looking for.Before using this library, I would advise that you first read the Regular Expression HOWTO article, as it will help you make sense of the  docs.
