Is there any way to execute the  bash statement as a sequence in Python subprocess?I can execute the  statement as a string, but I want to convert it into a sequence for a safer code.This is my program at the moment. It uses string as the first input of the subprocess with  argument.I want to convert the first argument as a sequence with  argument, but I don't know how to make the statement above as a sequence. This is what I've tried.
 is a shell keyword, not an external command, so you shouldn't use a list argument; the string has to be parsed and executed by the shell. (You can use  with a list, but it's kind of pointless, since  has to concatenate the list items into a single string anyway.)However, you don't need a shell  statement for this particular example, as the  option to  will instruct it to only create the directory if it doesn't already exit.Further, you don't need a subprocess at all, because Python provides its own wrapper around the system call that creates a directory.(Catch and ignore the exception rather than checking if the directory exists first to avoid the race condition where someone could create the directory after you check for it but before you actually try to create it.)
