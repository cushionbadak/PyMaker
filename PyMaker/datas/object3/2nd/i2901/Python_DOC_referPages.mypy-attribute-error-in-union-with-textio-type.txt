Trying to learn to type hint in Python. Given these two functions:First one is ok to mypy, but it complains about the second one with an errorAm I using type hinting incorrenctly in this case?(Using python3.7 with mypy 0.610, also tested with py3.6)
Your signaturesays that  parameter can be  or , after that in function body you are trying to access  attribute of  object, but in case of  being  there is no such attribute hence the error.You have at least 3 possibilities here:do not support case with  being of type  and replace  with add explicit type checking using  built-in in function body likethis may become difficult to maintain in the long termwrite 2 different functions for given task: one for  parameter and one for  parameter likethis may cause a lot of naming problems (but it depends on the use-case)The last approach can be improved using  decorator: in short this will allow us to define a generic function & use a name  with overloads called based on the type of first positional argument ( in our case):Note: we can use any name we want instead of  except , for the latter  will raise a name conflict error.
