I am trying to use the function below.  Mostly when i call this function I just pass in the report_type but a few of the report calls wants a start_date.  Questions Does the None in the definition of function mean that the field is optionalI normally call the function with one of the lines below depending on if I am passing a start_date.  Other then having a series of 'if' statements for each request type is there a good way to call this function and only pass a specific variable if it is populated?  Over time I will be adding more optional parameters and done want a giant 'if' statement
The  part gives a parameter a default value. Here that's , and that does mean the parameter is optional when calling the function. If you don't specify it, the default is used. See Default Argument Values in the Python tutorial, as well as the reference documentation for function definitions:When one or more parameters have the form parameter = expression, the function is said to have “default parameter values.” For a parameter with a default value, the corresponding argument may be omitted from a call, in which case the parameter’s default value is substituted.When calling such a function, you could pass in the same value as the default, to this specific function that makes no difference; so when there is no , you can pass in :Another option is to set any optional keyword arguments in a dictionary, then pass those in with the  call syntax to unpack the dictionary as keyword arguments:It is fine for the  dictionary to be empty.
It is called a .Default parameter values are evaluated when the function definition is  executedHere is the doc on method definition.Here is additional information
