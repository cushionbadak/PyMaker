With a Config Dict I want to configure the logging in a local Python 3 module to log level  while in the main file I want to configure the log level . All the configuration should be done in the main file, not in the module, so that I can change the logging without touching the module.Here an example. Given the module file :and the main file :I am looking for an run output like this:Please note that there is no debug message from   emitted!I have experimented with passing various config dicts, but I never get the output I am looking for. What is going wrong?
The problem with your code is two-fold:You use  in the main module , but  evauates to the string  when the main module is called from Python on the command line, not to .You configure a root logger. If you add another handler to root logger, the logs logged by module will display twice.So here I write an example which I think runs as you expect:::Output:I explicitly name the two loggers instead of using . I think this is more controllable and does not give different results when  is run on the command line.
