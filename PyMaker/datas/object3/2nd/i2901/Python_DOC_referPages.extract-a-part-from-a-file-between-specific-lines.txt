I am totally new to python. Thanks for help!I hope u know what i mean.

Try this:The output is a list containing the following as strings:(I used )
We can iterate over lines until there is no any left or we've reached end of block likewill give usAlternatively we can write helper predicates likeand then use brilliance of  module likethis will give us the same value for .
