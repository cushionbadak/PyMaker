In the code below the  function is carrying out a deep copy of a class attribute of the dataclass. Why is it not producing the same result as the function ? FootnoteAs Anthony Sottile's excellent response makes clear this is the behavior coded into Python 3.7. Anyone expecting astuple to unpack the same way as collections.namedtuple will need to replace it with a method similar to . The following code is less fragile than my_tuple because it will not need modification if the fields of the dataclass are changed. On the other hand it won't work if  are in use.Both versions of the code pose a threat whenever a  method is present in the class or its superclasses. See the Python 3.7 documentation for  in particular the two paragraphs beginning 'Here are the rules governing implicit creation of a  method'.
This seems to be an undocumented behaviour of  (and  it seems as well).Converts the dataclass  to a tuple (by using the factory function ). Each dataclass is converted to a tuple of its field values. dataclasses, dicts, lists, and tuples are recursed into.Here's the source:The deepcopy here seems intentional, though probably should be documented.
