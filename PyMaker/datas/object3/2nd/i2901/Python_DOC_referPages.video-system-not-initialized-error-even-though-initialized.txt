I know this error has been reported a couple of times, but have checked and pygame is both installed correctly and initialized correctly, so I can only guess there is some error in my programming I am not seeing at all (for the past 2 weeks..). Can someone help me see why I get an error when running the below code?:
You've defined a function whose body is this one:Then you've got a loop which is:The problem here is the above loop is living outside the  scope, it's defined in the global scope so it gets executed before  is even called. As a consequence neither pygame nor screen have been initialized, that's why you're getting initialization errors.You were assuming that calling  will initialize pygame and execute the mainloop but it won't... in python indentation matters. I'd recommend you make sure to understand how the lines are interpreted by python first then these type of issues will become cristal clear.This is a nice reading btw https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#lexical-analysis
