Here is a rough code which prints out the docstring of each attribute to an object one after the other. I need to decorate a function which is inside a class, so that it is legible for me to distinguish between different attribute docstrings. If you have suggestions to the actual code as well to make it pythonic, please do comment as well so that it improves my thinking
