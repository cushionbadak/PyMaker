 returns a response object that, when read using , returns a  object. This is because thereâ€™s generally no guarantee about whether a HTTP request returns a binary response or some response that can be properly decoded into a string.Instead, it is up to you to decode the response explicitly, for example if you know exactly that there is a response in UTF-8, or by explicitly checking the Content-Type header in the HTTP response.So you need to do it like this:That attempts to decode the  response into a string using UTF-8 (by default). And then  will be a string which you will be able to call  on.
