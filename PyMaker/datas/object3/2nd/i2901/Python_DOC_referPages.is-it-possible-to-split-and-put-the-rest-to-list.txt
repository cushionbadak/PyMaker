If you use two steps, and  for  this can be python 2 or 3 like:Results:
As suggested by student, you want to use extended unpacking syntax—that is, you can put  directly in the target list (the same way you use  in a function definition), and it will soak up the rest of the values:If you need something that works in Python 2, there isn’t anything as nice. (They wouldn’t have added extended unpacking if there were already a way to do it that’s just as nice…) The simplest solution here is probably to do it in two steps, using the max-splits argument to :
For , may be you can try (As Brad Solomon mentioned link for Extended Iterable Unpacking in comments above):
