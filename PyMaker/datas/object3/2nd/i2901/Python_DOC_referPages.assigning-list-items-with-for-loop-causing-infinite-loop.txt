Natural Text
I have a file with all zip codes in the US with their latitude and longitude. The file is in the format . I plan on saving these to a database, so I have looped through the file word by word and set a  variable. If the  it should assign the value to  if  assign the value to  and if  assign the value to , but when I run the following code to test if it properly added the zip code values it becomes an infinite loop and I have to force quit IDLE (file can be viewed at here)anyone know whats going on here?
You need a little less loop:
Files of comma separated values should be processed with the  module
