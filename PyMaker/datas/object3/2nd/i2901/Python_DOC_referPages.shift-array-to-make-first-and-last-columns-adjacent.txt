I'm struggling how to explain this in the question title so I'll try better here. I have an array which contains 360 columns and 180 rows which represents each degree of latitude and longitude on earth. For clarity, my data looks like the following: It looks like this, where longitude '0' is equal to 0E and '359' is equal to -1E.As you can see, Africa is split at the start and end of the array and I would like to shift the array so that the first columns corresponds to -180E and the last columns corresponds to 180E, like the traditional world view (map) - this will make subsetting the array to 'cookie cut' Africa out. How do I shift/transform my array so that the first and last column are adjacent? (Extra: since you can think of my array as a cylinder, as geographically, the first and last rows are adjacent, but how do I change where the 'cylinder is cut' - the analogy I've been thinking of)
Solution was to use .I firstly found the index of the column corresponding to 180E using:Then, I 'rolled' the data based on this index to move 180E to the furthest left column using:This successfully centred the 0E column to create my desired output.
