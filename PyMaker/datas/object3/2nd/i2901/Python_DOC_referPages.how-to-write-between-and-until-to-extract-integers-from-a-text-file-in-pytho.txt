Natural Text
I have a lot of lines like below. Each item is separated by a space. Because different lines have different numbers (e.g. , , ), the subsequent values are not aligned at the same column positions. In the 3rd line, there are 3 spaces between  and  because this line does not have that information so a space is used to fill it.I need to extract two information1) the , ,  values at 1st, 2nd and 3rd lines, respectively2) the , ,  values (before the ) at 1st, 2nd and 3rd lines, respectivelyI want to use python to write a generalised script to extract that information, instead of a lengthy  to consider one-digit, two-digit and three-digit cases individually.My idea is something like this:1) extract the integer values between the first and the second 2) extract the integer values after the 5th space, until another space is detected after that value. 
If you can get each line as a string, you can do this:Essentially, it makes a list of strings from the original list, delimited by the character you put in. If you don't give  an argument then it just splits the string on any whitespace.Now you can easily extract the information you want:
If you are only extracting numeric fields, you can use the regular expression , which reads digits, then maybe a period and more digits.Then you can use  to grab the numeric fields as a list, and then work with them.
