The output, if it matches, should be like:The output, if it doesn't match, should be like:How to go about this?
Seems like your issue is on one hand related with the for-else construct. Else will always get executed in your code.Moreover, building upon kaihami's answer, to achieve what you are describing you need to store the matching links/lines in a separate structure like a list and then check if that list is empty to print the matched entries or the string "Not matching", here is my proposed solution:
You can save your results to a list and print the results after finding all matches.You can try this code here
