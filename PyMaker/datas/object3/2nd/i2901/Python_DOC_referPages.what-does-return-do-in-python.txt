Natural Text
I was going through the CPython source code I found the following piece of code from the standard library().I tried the following in my python interpreterBut this is same as the following right?Can any one help me to understand what does the expression  or  do in python and when we should use this?
plus and minus in this context are unary operators. That is, they accept a single operand. This is in comparison to the binary operator  (for example) that operates on two operands. Evidently  is just . So the unary operator  in your return statement is redundant. 
 is equivalent to  (if operand is a number). The only purpose I see is to insist on the fact that we do not want the opposite of .
Both  and  can be used as unary or binary operators. In your case they are used as unary operators.  is the same as . We are used to see them in the form of  or .
I haven't studied the code, so I don't know for sure, but Python allows overriding unary operator behavior: Implements behavior for unary positive (e.g. +some_object) Implements behavior for negation (e.g. -some_object)So  in your case could be an object of a class which overrides those magic methods.This means that  is NOT equivalent to .
