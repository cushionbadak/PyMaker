This question already has an answer here:Does python have a sorted list?                    7 answers                What's the good algorithm to keep the numbers sorted while it continually adds new numbers? Any built-in library in Python for it? My idea is self-balanced binary searching treeBinary Heap works too but slowerThank you!
I've looked at built-in ones and it seems that there is no solution there.But the sortedmap module provides the requested functionality and is based on std::map (red-black tree).
