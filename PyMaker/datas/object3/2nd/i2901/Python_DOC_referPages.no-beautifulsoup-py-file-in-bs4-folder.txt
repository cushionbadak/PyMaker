 is not a submodule, it's a class. You can find its definition in .You can see that it's a class like this:â€¦ and you can see what file it came from using functions from the  module, like:The syntax  can do two different things:If  is a class, function, or other name in , it imports that value from module  into your globals as .If  is a submodule under package , it imports that submodule into your globals as module .For full details, see The import system in the docs:The  form uses a slightly more complex process:find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;for each of the identifiers specified in the import clauses:    check if the imported module has an attribute by that nameif not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attributeif the attribute is not found, ImportError is raised.otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the as clause if it is present, otherwise using the attribute name
