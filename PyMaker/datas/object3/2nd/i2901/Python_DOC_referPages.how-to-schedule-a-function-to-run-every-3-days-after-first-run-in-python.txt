I have a function and i need to run it after 3 days using pythonThe script will be running,How to print it every 3 days in python
As @Nuts said in a comment,  is the best option if you want to run an entire program every three days. However, if you're running a microservice or something and just want one particular method to execute every three days, you can use timers.Just call  once to execute  the first time, and then it will call itself every three days (with a few seconds of margin for error, most likely), so long as the program remains running.
If you have to use python, one possible way (adapted slightly from this thread which has other good information) is to use a massive sleep statement.Here is a more complete code snippet. I tested it for shorter intervals (not 3 days) but it should probably work
