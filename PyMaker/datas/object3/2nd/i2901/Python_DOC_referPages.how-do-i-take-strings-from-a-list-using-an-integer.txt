How do I take strings from a list using an integer?I tried this but it just gives an error:On the line where I'm trying to set  to be the part of the  that is 1, since  is 1, if  was 2, I would want 2. The code is how I set it up on my computer and it doesn't work. It just says this:
Python uses indices that start at zero. The indices for your list run from 0 trough to 3, not 1 through to 4. Your code assumes that the latter is true and sets  to 5, so when  then  is true, but  fails because that index doesn't exist.Start  at  and use  instead, to run from 0 through to 3.Note that Python has much better tools to loop over a list.

You'd be better of with different names:or, if you must use :
