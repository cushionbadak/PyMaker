Let's say I have a list of aliases tied to 5 digit codes available at runtime:I want to find a terse way to express: replace the id in the line with the matching alias, e.g. :Should output:How do Python pros write enumerative expressions in a terse manner?Thanks and cheers!
Consider using a dictionary when you have a one-to-one mapping of two categories of data, such as five digit codes and aliases. Then it's easy to access any particular alias, given its code:Result:
If you will be using these aliases directly in your code (not just referenced from data structures) then an  is a good way to go1:Then using  would look like:You could also add that behavior directly to the   with a method:and in use:Of course,  should probably be capitalized, but who wants  all over their code?  Best to have the substitution text be separate from the Enum member name, a job more easily accomplished with 2:1 See this answer for the standard  usage.2 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib , the  backport, and the Advanced Enumeration ()  library.
