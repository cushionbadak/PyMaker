i installed python3.7 on ubuntu using ppa:deadsnakes/ppa repository.When I try to runin python shell it fails with message:I didn't find any info about depracation of this library or anything in python3.7 changelog. It works fine in pythons 3.5 and 2.7. I tried installing it on different ubuntu virtual machines and computers and I always get the same result.Do I need to install some specific library or something (which I doubt because the module is listed in standard library https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) or is problem elsewhere?
This was a bug in the deadsnakes backport of python3.7 specifically for xenial.During the 3.7 beta period (when the package was imported).  The cpython build system used  as a make variable.  It was later changed to .  debian ships a patch with their package that adjusts a generated makefile line using a  expression for that specific variable.  Since this was missing it caused the  module to build incorrectly.This has been fixed in this commitThis fix is available in 3.7.0-1+xenial2 (debian version)
I installed python3.7 by downloading and installing it using make and cmath started working. It looks like ppa:deadsnakes/ppa repository had missing cmath module.
