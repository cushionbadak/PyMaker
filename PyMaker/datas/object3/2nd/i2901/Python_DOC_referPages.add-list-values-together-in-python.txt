I have a list that looks like this:How can i convert the numbers to ints and add the individual string values together?So the desired out put would be
Use  to convert the splitted (using  as the delimiter) string values into  followed by a list comprehension to get the sumOutputI edited after seeing your desired output as strings

Someone mentioned , so I think you should take this a step further with a safe-eval alternative:One thing I like about this answer is that it is purely a non-functional approach (no  inside a list comprehension, which is fine but I don't really believe in mixing paradigms).Obviously this will only work if you have numbers separated by a single comma, without any leading or trailing characters and invalid arithmetic expressions.    I leave the conversion to string as an exercise.
If all strings are in this format you can try to use  function - this will convert numbers into tuples from which you can count sum.If you want output list to contain strings these values can be easily mapped:
