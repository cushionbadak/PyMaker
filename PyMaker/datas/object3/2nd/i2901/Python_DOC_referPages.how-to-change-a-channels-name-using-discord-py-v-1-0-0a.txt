i've already searched a lot about this online. There I came across the API Refrence (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/api.html#discord.TextChannel) which kind of helped me finding what command I need to use. So my conculsion would be to use this code:the problem is that it doesnt work with this error:So this error doesnt help me at all... but im sure I just didnt understand the API refrence correctly and didnt use the command as it is supposed to be used. Im pretty new to python coding so that is the most likely thing to have happended.If anyone has some more python knowledge and is able to understand what I did wrong I would really appreciate your help! :)
