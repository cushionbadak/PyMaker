I'm trying to merge list items with previous items if they don't contain a certain prefix, and adding a  between said list items when doing so. I tried something likebut always get the  error.My apologies if this is badly worded, or seems like an obvious fix, I'm fairly new to python/programming.Edit:I had managed to get it to work with but your answers seem so much neater and efficient. Much thanks everyone
I propose to create a new list, as you showed in your problem specification:The result is:
Here's a one liner solution using  and :This looks like a two liner because I wanted to make it semi-legible, but that's not always necessary: provides the number of elements starting with  found so far. This makes for a nice key to . It works by accumulating the booleans returned by  into an integer.The final result uses  as the key, but joins the grouped elements of  with newlines.Here's an IDEOne Link to play with.
You can do it with list comprehension "also".
A solution that is a bit longer, but that can easily be generalized to other situations, using itertools.groupby:As we have an iterator, we also don't have to create the whole output list at once, we can generate each output on-the-fly:A bit of explanation : starts a new group each time it gets a different item from .  starts a new group everytime the return value of the  function changes. Our  function alternates its output between  and  each time the item starts with the prefix.
