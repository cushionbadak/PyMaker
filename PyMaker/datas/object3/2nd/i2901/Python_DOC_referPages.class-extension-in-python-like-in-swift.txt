I am new to python, coming from swift and I am wondering about the following. In swift if I would like to add a functionality to an an existing class, I can do something like this (as in the book example):I really like this functionality and I was wondering if there is something similar in python, or there is some other way much better that I do not see and hence this does not make any sense in python.
For the sake of completeness, I think this is what you should do (In Swift as well!):Make it clear that your object represents a meter, and that you are converting it to something.If you want some syntactic sugar, that I am not sure is helpful, you can override the item getter so you do not have to use :Adding conversions is as simple as:
No, you can't extend builtin classes like  or .(You can modify non-builtin classes though, but you really shouldn't, as code doing that is hard to reason about.)Your particular example is better served by an unit library like  -- using libraries like that prevents you from making $125 million mistakes doing math between metric and imperial units, too.
You can build child classes of parent classes.  If you're writing your own code, sometimes this is a good idea, but extending something like a pandas dataframe is probably a bad ideaI didn't spend much time googling for you, but this is the best I found: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htmlThis is also some really bad code I wrote trying to explain class inheritance to my girlfriend.  Note that the  class will still have  and  and the :
