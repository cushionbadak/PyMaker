When I press  the call jumps into  as expected, but the  are not getting killed as they continue the process.
The main reason your code is not working is because the variable  is defined inside the  function, and is out of the scope of the  function which tries to access it. Your code should throw an error like this:If you were to move the line  into the global scope, i.e. anywhere outside of the two  blocks, the  should get killed without problem.Of course that's after you fix the other issues in your code, like using  instead of  to start the comments, or calling the function  with the wrong parameter. (you didn't specify your  version but I assume the current version 1.3.7) Actually this function call is redundant after you call .Learn to use a Python debugger liker pdb or rpdb2 to help you debug your code. It'll save your precious time in the long run.
