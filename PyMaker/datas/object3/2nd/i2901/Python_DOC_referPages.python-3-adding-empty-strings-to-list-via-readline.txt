Natural Text
I'm trying to take from a txt file and put them into a variable. Here's my code:So, the for loop skips any empty lines in the wordlist.txt file and, if they're not empty, adds them to the wordList list. However, for some weird reason, it doesn't like the first three lines and puts them into the variable as blank lines. Why does it do that? sure, they're not the most important words in the world, but I'd still like it to use them.
First, you call  to check if the line is empty:Since you're calling it with , you're reading at most  characters. For the first line, that's 0. For every other line, it's more than 0, so this never triggers again (unless you reach EOF), because a line always has at least one character (the newline).Then, if that doesn't trigger, instead of using the line you read, you read another line:Although again you may not be reading the entire line, because you're passing a  argument.And then you read yet another line:So, you're cutting off the start of all of your early lines, and skipping almost two thirds of the lines by reading them without adding them to the list, and your test for emptiness actually just tests for being the first line.What you probably want to do is just call  without a size, and only once instead of three times in a row.Or, better, just iterate the file directly, the same way you're doing with the other file at the top of your code.I'm not sure why you want to stop at 185051 lines, but I'll assume there's some reason. So, rather than  the lines, let's  them with a range:
