I'm new to Python, and wondering why this might of occurred.Here's the code:Here's the problem:After the user inputs which calculator they want to use, the code works until after the answer is given.At , typing  to exit works perfectly, but - doesn't work at all. If I'm not wrong shouldn't the  loop in this scenario, loop until  is null?
The problem is that  returns a string, which ALWAYS fails in the if/elif/elif/elif. Because it is a string and not a number, . The easiest way to do it that I could see is to addto the beginning of the while loop. Having this contained in a try/except loop allows you to detect if the user input something that is not an integer and is not the letter 'q'.
The input() functions returns a string, and since all of your comparisons in the loop are numbers it will loop forever after the first time through. You should not be using  as both an int and a string - my suggestion (trying to change as little of the code as possible) would be to change your comparisons from  to  and so on, then change your  call to ask for a string input instead of a number.
input() returns a string... You're checking for an int
