Here is my c++code:Here is my python code:why is PYTHON FASTER in this case? I'm not sure if it's because I wrote extra code or not, but it seems like a pretty basic for loop. 
It's not the  loop that's slow, but the C++ . And it's not even that  is horribly slow,1 but that you're doing an  for every line.C++  is not just a synonym for , it's an io manipulator object that, when inserted into a stream, inserts  and then asks for the stream to be flushed. Flushing stdout can be very slow.Python , on the other hand, doesn't flush unless you ask it to explicitly; otherwise, it just writes to , which is a  that accumulates stuff in a buffer and flushes whenever it thinks is appropriate, which is pretty much the same thing C++  do.2For a fair test, compare this:â€¦ or this:1. With some platforms/compilers/optimization flags, it is pretty slow. And manipulators can be especially slow. So Python might still beat C++ after you fix this problem. But not by an 11:1 ratio.2. Python also has to convert your string from Unicode to . But, if you're on 3.4 or later, a Unicode string that happens to be all ASCII like  is stored as the ASCII bytes, and encoding it is a no-op.
