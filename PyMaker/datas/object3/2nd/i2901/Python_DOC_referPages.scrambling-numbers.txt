I am trying to program an algorithm that scrambles and "unscrambles" integer numbers.I need two functions  and : return a "random" number between  and , the same input  always returns the same output: return the input to  that returns I managed to solve the problem like this:Is there a way to do this without using the mapping list?Can i calculate the return value of the functions  and ?The "randomness" of the numbers does not need to be perfect.
I think your current solution is better than coming up with a function each time. It is a good solution. Here is a generic solution for a generic key. You'd make your version using the  method I've stuck on.
