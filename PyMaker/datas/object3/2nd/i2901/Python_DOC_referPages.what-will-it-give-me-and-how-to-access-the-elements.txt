Please look at this piece of code :In other words, is a list of arrays (my function, as its name may suggest, return an array) and then the  will be agregated so it would be a list of lists of arrays !My questions are : How to deal with that (indexing, ...) and is there simplest way to proceed, by generating list of arrays in a loop but how to keep it in a data structure ?Thanks
Regarding indexing, you'd just refer to elements like ,  or  etc. Regarding any better data structures, it really just depends on your use case. As @smagnan says in the comments, are you using it for easily accessing data? Matrix processing? If so, have a look at . You say that you need it for big data on time series analysis. In that case, using the  module will be quite helpful (more info).Also, as @Bazingaa says, you can make your code less verbose by using  comprehensions (more info):With  comprehensions, it's best to start from the outside, and from the end. The  will run twice (I've replaced your  with  as I couldn't see you using it anywhere. If you need it, replace  with a relevant variable name). In each iteration, it'll  the inner list comprehension to the . Inside the inner listcomp, the result of the  function will be appended to the temporary  for each iteration of the  loop,This will have exactly the same output as your code, but is clearly way shorter :)
