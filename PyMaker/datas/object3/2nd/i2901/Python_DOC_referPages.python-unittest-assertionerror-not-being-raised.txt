I am trying to write unit tests for my python package and I am finding that when I run the tests AssertionErrors are not being raised, when they should be. Here is a MWE:In exampleModule.py I have:and in testError.py I have:When I run testError.py I expect to see the AssertionError reported from the UnitTest in exampleModule.py, however, I simply see the following:Why is the AssertionError not being raised? If I place the UnitTest() class in testError.py (i.e. have everything in the same file) then the AssertionError is raised. So why when UnitTest is stored in a different file does the error not get raised? Thanks!
creates or updates aobject, on the assumption you intend to do something interesting with those results.But you immediately throw them away:Any failures or errors --- including exceptions raised --- would have been in that results object.For example:This prints:Failures:  [(<exampleModule.UnitTest testMethod=runTest>, 'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/home/kjc/tmp/exampleModule.py", line 11, in runTest\n    self.assertEqual(a, b)\nAssertionError: 4 != 5\n')]It catches all kinds of exceptions, like this example where I added  before the assertion:Errors:  [(<exampleModule.UnitTest testMethod=runTest>, 'Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/home/kjc/tmp/exampleModule.py", line 11, in runTest\n    import sys; sys.exit()\nSystemExit\n')]For the record, the one passing test your example produced is  itself.You can verify this by calling  early in .(As one commentator said, calling unit tests from a unit test is a very strange thing to do.)One SolutionYou seem to want to run tests normally, but from multiple files.If so, you can make a bunch of typical-styletest modules, and then load them manually.Your test-everything script would look something like this:Your test modules would be the usual one-or-more s, with conditional calls to , so each could be run independently:If that's not fiddly enough for you, you can also read up on the methodor the module-level protocol.
The convention to structure unittests is like this:Hold all tests in  directory.test module will be named as  with  to run all tests.
