Natural Text
I am trying to add * as borders for rectangular matrix of characters. For example, should return What I did was I create a new matrix with 2 more rows and columns than the original one, and I filled it with *. So the problem is when I am replacing the * inside with original letters, I have an error of out of index. I couldn't quite figure out why? 
Strings are immutable, so you can not "edit" single characters inside them bey indexing into them - thats what you are trying in your  loop.To keep most of your code, you can change it to:Output:Changing more code:Output:Link:  string format mini languageYour out of index error message is somewhat misleading - you are inside the bounds of your lists, but you are trying to manipulate the string - I would have thought a  would be more appropriate here...Edit: see Azats answer for why your error occurs - I left text in so his post does not loose its reference.
If I understood correctly, you are trying to Create filled with * .Modify  and replace * (excluding borders) with  elements contents.This approach has a problem with  objects immutability, but even if they were mutable this seems to be inefficient to create **...** string and then mutate them character-by-character.About your error: it isn't misleading as stated by @PatrickArtner, it originates from a typo (I guess), because you are creating s of  of :so when  equals to  you are getting this error (because each of  sublists has single  element inside of them).Instead of trying to modify  of  we can create  and append  to it likeTestgives usnon-equivalent by size casegives us
