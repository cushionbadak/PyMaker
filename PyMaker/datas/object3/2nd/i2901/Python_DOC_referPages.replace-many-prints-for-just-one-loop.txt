I'm trying to print the output of a script. But for this I must use many prints. Is there any way to have all the topics without making all the prints?Instead of printing, for example, 40 times, could I just loop to print everything? To print these 40 topics, I need 240 lines of code. Imagine if I need to print 100... I have this output and I would like to keep it:Topic 0:blablablablaTopic 1:blablablablaTopic 3:blablablabla...
