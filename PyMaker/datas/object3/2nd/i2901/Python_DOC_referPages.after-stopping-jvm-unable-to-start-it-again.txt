I am using python-weka-wrapper which then uses javabridge library for running and accessing the Java Virtual Machine to utilize whatever WEKA has to offer.So my application has a frontend in ReactJS, and backend server in flask. For each request to a particular endpoint, a new thread is created by Threading module of python. It is on this thread, JVM (using weka.core.jvm ) is started, the script is executed, and then stopped. After a second request to the same endpoint, a new JVM is unable to start.Error: Help me with the implementation details for such an app. Is it possible to run JVM as a daemon in the backend, something like that, and stopping the JVM only when the server is stopped?
pww relies on the javabridge library with which it is not possible to restart the JVM after stopping it. Also, pww has not been implemented with multi-threading in mind and Weka by itself isn't thread-safe by default.
