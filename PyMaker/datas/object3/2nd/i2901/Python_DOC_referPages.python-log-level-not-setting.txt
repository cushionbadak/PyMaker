In file 1:In file 2:Does not print anything (imports are in place of course). And if I go:The output is 0, instead of the expected 20. So it looks like the logger level isn't set at the level that I thought it was. Moreover, the level is lower than I thought it was, yet it still doesn't log on logger.info. What am I doing wrong here? Oh and bonus question (since I stole the above code and don't know any of python's logging intricacies), how does resolution of a log message happen if the logger's level and the handler's level clash?
File 2 only calls  and not . Thus, setLevel is never called on the logger, so its given the default value of . Take a look at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.setLevelBy default, the root logger is created with level . This is why  does nothing as  is below . , on the other hand, outputs 0 as this is the numeric value of . To have it do what you want, just call  in your second file: To answer your bonus question: the handler gets whatever messages get through the logger.If the level of the logger is , and the level of the handler is , the handler will receive all messages from the  Level and up, but will only output messages on the  level and up. 
You didn't call  (before calling ) so the level of your non-default  was not set.Also note the typo:  ->
