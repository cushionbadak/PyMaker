I have 2 lists:In the nested , I want to append the values of  if the first element in I am trying to get this to be sequential, so that the first 'Download' list in  will append the first element in  etc.  I know there must be an easy way to do it.I tried:This doesn't work, as the index (i) of  will not correlate with that of  if the for loop skips one of its nested lists (as happens in the example), so  will be out of range.So I expect my final result to be:Any suggestions welcome.
You really don't need to care about indexes: you can create an iterator on  with iter and use  to get its elements when needed:
The problem is obvious: you cannot use the same index for  and , as you've already noted.  Stop doing that.  Keep a separate index for each list:Code:Also, why are you doing this from indexing ?  You don't really need that: go straight to the items themselves:
Use a counter to track which position in  you've last appended:
Here is a solution that creates a new list, using  as a index variable
As you have noted, appending  won't be correct, because the index of the item you want to append is different from .There are two possible solutions:Creating another indexing variable, for example , for . Everytime you append item from , you raise  by one, so next time, the item from  will be correct: If you won't use  again, you can use  method, just like this:Method  returns and deletes the first item of , which is exactly what you need, if you won't use  again (because it gets empty).Either way, you don't need variable , you can iterate just over the list:
A python one liner solution:
Must have careful with index of ListB, it can get out of range if we don't control it and ListA has more sublists with Download at first than length of listB.Control it is simple, something like the following code will be enough:
