Natural Text
This has been a source of confusion and frustration for years now. Say you import a particularly poorly documented module and some method that you need to you only has **kwargs for its arguments, how are you supposed to know what keys that method is checking for?If i were to call text, how would i know that 'greeting is something the method was looking for?Some simplistic cases the IDE can help out with, but most use cases seem to be out of the IDE's scope
Think of  as a dictionary. There is no way to tell from the outside what key-value combinations the method will accept (in your case the  method is essentially a black box) but this is the point of having documentation. Without kwargs, some function headers would get extremely cluttered.
Use documentation!The -module's docs is a good example. If you are using a newer version of python (3.7 or 3.6 with backport), consider using  as an alternative to , if it fits your usecase. 
If it's not documented, your only recourse is to read the source.
Adding a  argument to a function is used when you don't want to explicitly define the arguments which must be named.A trivial example:If a function takes as an argument another function which is undetermined and may have different  each timeYou won't know what the function is explicitly looking for.You can have in your examplewhich shows the function is looking for  but it can be
