Suppose count doesn't exist.What's confusing me exactly is this partAnd more specifically I don't get how this adds to the count?Could someone explain this to me, especially the part in the brackets.
Python has a feature called slicing which allow you to extract a substring from a string by specifying the start and end indicies (where the start is included and the end is excluded).The syntax for this is:where all are optional.So some examples from the documentation (linked above):and to give one with the  included:So, to explain your code, a for-loop is used to iterate over the start indexes of the slice. Of course, these indexes range from  (the default to the  function) to the length of the whole string.In your case, since the length of  is , the variable  will take the values: , ,  ... , .Then, you take the slice from the string that starts at the index  and ends at the index  + . Since  is the length of the substring, this will take slices from  that are the same size (length) as the substring.For example, the first ones are:Now, the equivalence comparator () is used to check whether this substring is equal to the desired substring - if it is, the count variable is incremented.
