I have created a temporary directory in python where I am saving a bunch of .png files for later use. My code seemingly works fine up until the point where I need to access those .png files - when I do so, I get the following error:The error is thrown when I pass the temporary directory in os.path.join:However, using gettempdir() seems to work fine.The python docs suggests tempfile.TemporaryDirectory works using the same rules as tempfile.mkdtemp() (https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.TemporaryDirectory), and I would think tempfile.TemporaryDirectory is the preferred method for python 3.x. Any ideas why this throws an error or if one of these methods is preferred over the other for this use case?
I'm not sure why the error occurs, but one way to get around it is to call  on the :You can then run  to remove the  later.FWIW, I think  should be mentioned in the TemporaryDirectory docs, I discovered this by running .
