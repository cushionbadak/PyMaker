Can anyone explain this?returns returns .So, is  2018-07-23 07:00:36 or 2018-07-23 08:00:36 ?
This will depend on the timezone info of the datetime object you create. YOu are in fact creating a naive timezone object in both cases which does not have a specific timezone set objects may assume a local timezone as opposed to UTC which your  assumes returns the same epoch time you put into your original questionFrom the python docs"A naive object does not contain enough information to unambiguously locate itself relative to other date/time objects. Whether a naive object represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), local time, or time in some other timezone is purely up to the program, just like it is up to the program whether a particular number represents metres, miles, or mass. Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with, at the cost of ignoring some aspects of reality."https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlYou can explicitly tell both functions in your answer to use UTC with a kwarg to the constructors (and without using  as below)
