I am new in Python and I have been looking how to solve the following issue. I want to code a function that will receive the inputs: minimum, maximum, scale(mean) and size for an exponential distribution.For example:FunctionExponentialPDF(minimum=0.05, maximum=0.30, scale=0.2, size=1000).Result:an exponential distribution, with a minimum value of 0.05, a maximum of 0.30, it has an average of 0.20 and it contains 1000 data points.How can I extend the code for other probability distribution functions, e.g. normal, poisson, etc.?Thank you all!
Look at the Real-valued distributions in the  module, particularly .You can make it into a generator using  e.g.Then you can take the first 1000 using .If you want to truncate the distribution at a certain interval, you can filter it out first.Put it all together,
