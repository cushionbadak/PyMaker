I am taking the course "Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets" at Data Camp and there is one part in the exercise I don't understand. I was unable to find anything on the Internet on it.I don't understand the line , "set" in particular. What function does it have?
According to python documentation:A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic  uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set  objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection,  difference, and symmetric difference.Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create setsYou are creating a set when you do In sets,  performs Intersection i.e. The resulting set has elements that are common to both source sets. An  element is in the result if it is in one set and the other.Example:
A Set is an unordered collection data type that has no duplicate elements. selects unique values from .  selects unique values from the list The  operator perform the intersection of both the sets (just like in mathematics).
Thank you for the comments. Yes, it is a basic function, it has been less than one month since I got my hands on Python. I hope next time I won't raise such silly questions.
