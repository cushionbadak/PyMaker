Natural Text
I would like to convert hundreds of PDF files (of varying formatting and sizes) to txt and have struggled to find a layman's option for this. What is the best way to do this?I have tried some pre-packaged software (PDF2Text Pilot) but it just... didn't work.I also followed a guide to do so in python, but couldn't seem to get python to open from the right directory as I am not too knowledgeable in this area. What method would you recommend?Thanks!
Why not use the shell  command from the  utils if you are not apposed to not using python. It works shockingly well for digital PDFs. You could then run in your shell to get all the text versions of the pdfs. This will be quite fast. You could run this command from python with  if necessary. I think this will be faster and simpler than going with a native python approach - but I can provide one if necessary.
