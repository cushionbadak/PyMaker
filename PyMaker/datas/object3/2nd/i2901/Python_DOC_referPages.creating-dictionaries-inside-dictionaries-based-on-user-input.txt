New to programming, and teaching myself by making a to-do list app that stores things to do in a dictionary called , based on user input. I'm using the  function, which is working, but I want to add a feature so that in the dictionary , every time a user inputs a new thing to do, it stores the new item as a dictionary inside , with things like Due Date, and Status inside that sub-dictionary. How can I do this?Here is the code so far (just started):
First I suggest you to think about what will be the key(s) of your dictionary(ies). I can suggest you this simple solution using "what you need to do" as a key. It works well:  Output example:
You have "many" things to do, so you can put that dict in a list, or a dict.You cannot put that in a set beacuse it has to be hashable.If you chose a dict, you have to chose a "key" for each element, right?You can read about "data structures" here .Let's try list :Using a dict would allow you to order your tasks, but I'm not sure it is your question. Let's try ordering your tasks by adding a number.So your haircut is task number 5.If you choose the dict way, your code could look like this :
