When I use this code, my aim is to try and make sure that any input will not break the code like letters or numbers not between 0-3. But when i use this code the whole list isn't coming up. How would i fix this?The output should look like this Instead, the output is The code i am using is:I have also tried another way, using 'while True' before 'try' but the program says that is an invalid syntax. SECOND TRY I have used this new code, but again it won't let me run the code as it says I have an invalid syntax when I put While True, with True highlighted in red. 
I think you want something like this:demo outputThe main change I made to your code is to put the  stuff inside a  block, so we keep asking for input until we get something valid. I also used  to print each game with its number. That's neater than your  loop.If you have to print the list of games using a  loop then you can do it like this:I made  a global list so we can access it outside the  function. We don't need to use the  statement in the function because we aren't changing . In general, you should avoid using the  statement.
