I'm having trouble figuring out what's wrong with my code.What i'm trying to do is create a function that will tell me what the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 are below a given 'number'.Here's what I've got:It gives me 90. I need 23 (the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9)
You are using  (the function argument) instead of  (the loop variable).Perhaps this is why you should be using descriptive and distinguishable variable names. In your case, you are using two very similar variable names, while also rebinding the name of a built-in function . This wouldn't happen if the code looked more like:or more concisely:
The idea is fine, but you've messed up the variables unfortunately !"Sum" is actually a built-in function in Python that returns the sum of a list of numbers.Also, your code is not actually iterating over the numbers in the given range, but just using the value that is passed to the function in the for loop. This is because you chose the same variable name!Number is also generally not a good variable name. Many dependencies might have built-in functions with this name.Try your code like so:
