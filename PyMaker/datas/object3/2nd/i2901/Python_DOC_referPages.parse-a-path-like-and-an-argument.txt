I have this script in python 3.7:I want to parse the output in the command line, for example:I don't know how to store the output into a variable.How can I proceed?
In your case you can access the arguments using:As you suggested in comment all you want is to access --output or -o change your add_argument for output to something like i added belowso on and so forth, for any other arguments you want to access should be available in args variable. Go through the documentation for more infoDocumentation
You can get a dictionary of the args passed by using .  returns a Namespace object  and you can then use  on it in order to get a dictionary. Use https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html to learn about manipulating a dict. Other answer is probably better if you don't want to learn about dicts or want to keep it simple :)
