I'm trying to learn a bit of python 3 with something that i thought was trivial, but is actually winding me up a bit..i have two lists.. and i want to generate all unique combinations of state, that those items can have... so for this example it would start as..Note: The ordering matters, and 1, 0, 0, is not the same as 0, 1, 0then, if we added another item, it would end up being..i am getting a bit frustrated with syntax at the moment, and am not 100% sure what is possible, but have been trying to get this working with itertools.permutations, and also the concept of a 'generator' ??So, i started off trying to get the permutations of the states..and then join them up with the item list..but all this does is randomise the state list i currently have in a list.. i.e. i have no 1,1,1, or 0,0,0Can anyone offer me some pointers.. i'm sure this must have been done before!
