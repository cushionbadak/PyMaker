The following code uses the {} operator to combine two defaultdicts.But, as we see if we run this, the  operator returns a  type not a  type. Is there a way to cast a  back to a defaultdict?
You can use unpacking directly in a call to .   is a subclass of , and will pass those arguments to its parent to create a dictionary as though they had been passed to .
You can do it the long way. The benefit of this method is you don't need to re-specify the type of :Unpacking in a single expression works but is inefficient:
The  constructor can take two arguments, where the first is the function to use for the default, and the second a mapping (dict). It copies the keys/values from the dict passed in.
