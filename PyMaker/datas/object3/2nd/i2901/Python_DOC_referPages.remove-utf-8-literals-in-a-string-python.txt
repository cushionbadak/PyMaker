I'm new to python,I have a string like:I want to remove all the unicode literals in a string like:I need output like:Can anyone help me with this?Thank you
If your goal is to limit the string to ASCII-compatible characters, you can encode it into ASCII and ignore unencodable characters, and then decode it again:produces .Check out str.encode() and bytes.decode()
You can filter your string using the  function to check whether your characters can be printed: Output:Reference to this question.
On Python 2 (default string type is bytes):On Python 3 (default string type is Unicode):Note that the original string is a mojibake.  Ideally fix how the string was read, but you can undo the damage with (Python 3):The original string was double-encoded as UTF-8.  This works by converting the string directly 1:1 back to bytes1, decoding as UTF-8, then converting directly back to bytes again and decoding with UTF-8 again.Here's the Python 2 version:1This works because the  codec is a 256-byte encoding and directly maps to the first 256 Unicode codepoints.
May be this help,
