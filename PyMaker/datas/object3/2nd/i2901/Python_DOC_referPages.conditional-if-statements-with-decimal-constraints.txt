Say I have a condition that if a number ends with.00 add 2 to it and if a number ends with.99 add 3 to it. So if I had 5.00 and 5.99, I want to write a nested if statement that would allow me to add the right value to the original number based on its ending.How to do that in R (or python)?
Due to floating point precision, you will need to round your numbers to two decimals as values such as  cannot be represented exactly. This means a value such as  will have to fulfill your criterion as finishing with 0.99.If you are fine with that, using Python's Format Specification Mini-Language  will round implicitly and allow to extract the required decimals.
In .You can round the number to 2 decimal places, subtract it's integer component, then round the result to check if it is close to  or . Simply checking if the result before rounding is 0.00 or 0.99 is unreliable because of . 
In  we can doIf we are looking for last two numeric elementsdata
It seems there are other values in your list/vector you need to deal with. I will give a vectorized format:in R:In Python:  vectorized format with
