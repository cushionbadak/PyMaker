I have a list  which represents nodes in a network graph. I iterate through the nodes in  to obtain a sub-list of neighbouring nodes. At the same time, all neighbouring nodes are compared against another list . I want to create a separate list  that specifies whether the node in  has a neighbour in . See the code below: Running this code returns the following list:The problem is that the code is iterating through the all the neighbours and appending 'Y' or 'N' with each iteration. How can I control the flow to append 'Y' or 'N' only once, indicating that a node in  either has a neighbour on the  ('Y'), or doesn't ('N'). It seems like a simple flow-control question, but I can't seem to get it right. Any advice appreciated!    
You can use  and check if any neighbour is in your :Result:
This code produces a  or  for each :If you just want to know if there is any  for which there is a neighbour, use :Or, I would rather do simply this:
