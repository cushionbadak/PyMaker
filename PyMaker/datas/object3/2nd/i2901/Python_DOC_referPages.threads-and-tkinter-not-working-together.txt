Trying to practice Tkinter, Pyautogui and threading with a simple (or so I thought) auto clicker.It is supposed to open up a menu (check),  then a choice of buttons (check),  it opens up another window (check),  and when you press F7 it starts clicking (not working)  This works fine without Tkinter  Here is code:  When I run the code the F7 starter does not work.Any ideas?
Ok so based on what you are trying to do with your code it is probably best to use  here instead of threading. Tkinter monitors all the key presses anyway so you can just bind the  button to the Toplevel window.The below code will bind  to the clicker toplevel window. When you click in toplevel to give it focus you can use the  to start the auto clicking. I have it set to 1 clicks a second.
