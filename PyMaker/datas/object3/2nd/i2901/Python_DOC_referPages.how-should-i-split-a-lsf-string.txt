Natural Text
Suppose I have following LSF:What I want is to split this in a way so that I can get a JSON or dictionary of all the switches (as keys) along with the values.The first alphanumeric word is also a value to "name" key. Also there should be internal split on each attribute passed to rusage.I am not to able to form such a complex regex and splitting this value at every point seems a very un-pythonic way to code.Expected Output:lsf = Any leads is appreciated. Thanks.
