THE ISSUE: On macOS...Uninstalled Python 3.6 — reinstalled Python 3.7Uninstalled Django 2 — attempted reinstall of Django 2.1 (fails)My biggest issue right now is that I cannot figure out how to install Django. (See the end of this post for all testing I can think to do)NOTES:After learning Python syntax for a few months, I wanted to branch out into creating a very basic 101 web app. So I started learning Django. I realized I really had no idea where or how any of the moving parts: pip, python, django, PyCharm, the OS, et cetera... work together or where they were even installed. I'd never heard of... packages, package managers, pip, path, or Frameworks. So, I decided to try to do a deep dive and really learn how it all works. The best way I've always done that is to... undo it all, and put it all back together.  Issues and Testing:In Terminal:  Results:Okay... Try to install Django: Results:Trying to figure out what "path" really means: Results: Finally... just to see what all was installed I typed in:Results:In PyCharm:When I open a project that I'd created prior to these uninstall/reinstalls, and try to run a new or existing .py file, I get...When I create a new project, however, it picks up the new version of Python 3.7.Results:
If  command starts Python 3.7 in your system you could install Django globally withThere is one cool thing that PyCharm did for you when you created your second project. It created virtual environment - kind of new interpreter which is isolated and meant to use only with your project (it was saved in ). When you open Terminal in PyCharm you should see  before your prompt. That means you have  activated in this project and you can install Django with simply . Just remember that when you are using virtualenv you have to install django each time you start new project.Your old project is trying to use old 3.6 interpreter which, I guess, does not exist anymore. To fix this you have to provide path to valid Python interpreter in File -> Settings -> Project:  -> Project InterpreterThere, you can press the cogwheel in the top-right corner and you can either point to Python 3.7 installation path or create new  for this project.
