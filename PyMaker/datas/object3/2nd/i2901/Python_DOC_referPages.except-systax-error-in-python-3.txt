This is the error:As I have doubled checked the syntax with online documentation I am at a loss as to what I am doing wrong and I guess I am missing some piece of understanding here. here is the full code for reference:Many thanks in advanced!    
You cannot use the  statement outside of a  code block.https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptionsso you would rephrase your code as,which I haven't tried but essentially,Wraps the if statement with a  clause, andany  would be captured by the  statement.
