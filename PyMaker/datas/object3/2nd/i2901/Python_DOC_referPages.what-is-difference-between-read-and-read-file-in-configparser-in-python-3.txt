I am wondering what is difference in usage of read and read_file in configparser. As far as I have tested and both works for me. config_file is name of my config_file I am passing as input parameter.
 accepts a file-like object,  accepts a file name.The main issue with  is that if the file doesn't exist, it fails silently, leaving the  empty.That cannot happen with  since you control the way the file is opened.The other useful case is when you have a list of lines representing a  file contents. kind of "acccepts" a string as input (since strings are iterable) but the result isn't useful:
