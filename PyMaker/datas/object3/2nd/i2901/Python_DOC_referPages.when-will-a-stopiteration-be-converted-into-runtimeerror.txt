I'm reading the documentation for Python 3 here:If a generator code directly or indirectly raises , it is converted into a  (retaining the  as the new exception's cause).I don't understand that, can anyone explain?This is what I've tried in Python 3.6, but nothing seems to have been caught:Specially, both calls to  raised the , but still not converted into .
You missed that this change applies to Python 3.7 and newer. You won't see the conversion in Python 3.6 or older, unless you enable the feature with a  import first (available as of Python 3.5).From the same page you linked:Changed in version 3.5: Introduced the  transformation via , see PEP 479.Changed in version 3.7: Enable PEP 479 for all code by default: a  error raised in a generator is transformed into a .PEP 479 -- Change StopIteration handling inside generators further details why this change was made and how it applies. For your code, running on Python 3.7, the output becomes:Note that I added a  line to  to make it a generator. Without  or  in the body, you get a regular function instead. Calling a generator function produces a generator object and the function body starts out paused, while calling a normal function executes the body immediately:For Python 3.6, you'd use the  compiler switch (use it at the top of your code when writing a script or module):
