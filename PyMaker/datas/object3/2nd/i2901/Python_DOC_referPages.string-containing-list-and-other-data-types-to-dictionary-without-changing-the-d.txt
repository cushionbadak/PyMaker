Natural Text
I have one string as below:I need to get the dictionary from the string as below:I tried with the following:But it is storing values as all string:Is there any way or regex to store the values as same data type as it has in string?
If you are 100% sure that the data is "safe", you could  it as the parameters to :If you are not sure, better don't use , though.Alternatively, you could use your regex and use  to evaluate the :(Note: I did not check your regex in detail.) You could also try to apply  to the entire expression, instead of the less safe , but this would require some preprocessing, e.g. replacing  with  and adding quotes to the keys, that might not work well with e.g. string values containing those symbols.
 cannot do that, but you can! You can write a function like the following that takes the   writes out and converts them to the appropriate type.To add this to your code, simply do:Example:Note that the order in which the -blocks are written is very important since  does not raise any Errors but the correct type is !
