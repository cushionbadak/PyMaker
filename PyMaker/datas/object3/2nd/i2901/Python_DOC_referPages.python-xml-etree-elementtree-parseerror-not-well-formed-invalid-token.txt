I have the following code: I get the following error message: I checked probably all questions to this error message on StackOverflow, nothing helped:I tried to edit file with another editor (as adviced here);I added this line:  (from here);Tried to add DOCTYPE;Checked the file with W3 Validator;etc.Then I tried to import another XML file with completely another structure - and error message remained the same - even the position: .And then I tried to change the file's name to the non-existent - and the error message remained the same! So it is not a problem of file, it is something else. And I can't understand what.P.S. This is one of the XML files I used:EDIT: Probably I can't import file in the way I did in the fromstring() function?
