I have two pyqt programs. Both should be available to run by themselves, but I need to run one of them from the other. The one that will only run manually is called  and the second one (the one I want to call from ) is called . I tried to follow this example and I get the new window, but with an errorAttributeError: 'bar' object has no attribute 'exec_'I guess I could create it, but I don't know what to put in it. So how do I make another window pop by clicking a button in the first window?Bonus points for somebody who can make the original window inactive. Here is how my function look right now:Unimaginative, I know. 
Do you want to just call the second gui program using ?You can then disable your first GUI or do whatever you want with it.  The new GUI is running in a separate process.  
@ballsatballsdotballs answer did not work for me, but was very close. Referring to the docs (same for Python2 and Python3) states:  should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string. By default, the program to execute is the first item in  if  is a sequence. If  is a string, the interpretation is platform-dependent and described below.I'm not sure if this has changed only since the original answer was posted (>4 yrs old), but for completeness, the following Popen construction worked for me:One could also substitute "python3" if desired.
