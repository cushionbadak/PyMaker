I'm looking to use OrderedDict in my code since the Ruby version of this project uses YAML for maps and settings but OrderedDict hasn't been updated for Python 3.The Ruby version of the project uses this file: https://mega.co.nz/#!zhYRwA4B!HceqC3-NmmN44U70--jMxiAWQ4wz5MdAeilteKAOnSMI changed the import lines to read as:I already know v3 doesn't make use of iterkeys so how would I change iterkeys to something MutableMapping understands?I've seen many examples of how to change it but I don't understand how to use them here.Maybe I should use something else for YAML file support in Python 3, perhaps?Edit: I called my file yaml.py. I shouldn't have done that.I also had a file path in there it didn't like. I've removed it and it works.Edit 2: I've just realised I've screwed up my question. It should have been about OMAPs in Python not YAML. I'll open a different question for that. Thanks for the help guys.
