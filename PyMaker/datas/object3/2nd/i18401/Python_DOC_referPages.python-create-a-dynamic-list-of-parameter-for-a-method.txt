Natural Text
I want to create a XLSX file in python. For this, I use xlsxwriter.In my XLSX I want to highlight some part of text with the write_rich_string method.But, my string is not a fixed value. The part I want to highlight can be randomly placed into it. Or I can have multiples part of the text to highlight.So, can I create a "list of parameters" for the call of write_rich_string? And what is the method to made this?Example:
If I understand what you're askingâ€¦ you've got a list like this:And you want to pass that to  as a bunch of separate arguments (along with one normal argument).The way to do that is explained in the tutorial under Unpacking Argument Lists: Just put  before , and it will be unpacked into separate arguments:In general, if you want to convert a list (or other iterable) into separate values or vice-versa,  is the answer:But for the exact rules on what you can and can't do, you'll need to read the docs.
