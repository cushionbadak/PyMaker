I have looked at other questions on SO like this one but they are too techy for me to understand (only been learning a few days).I am making a phonebook and i am trying to save a dictionary like so,But i get error write() only takes 1 argument and obv im passing 2, so my question is how can i do this in a beginner freindly way and could you describe it in a non techy way.Thanks a lot.
It's better to use json module for dumping/loading dictionary to/from a file:
While JSON is a good choice and is cross-language and supported by browsers, Python has its own serialization format called pickle that is much more flexible.Pickle is Python-specific, doesn't work with other languages, and be careful to never load pickle data from untrusted sources (such as over the web) as it's not considered "safe".Pickle works for other data types too, including instances of your own classes.
You need to use the  module and  your dict, then you can use the module to write the new object to file.When you read the file, you need to  to convert it back into a python dict.
