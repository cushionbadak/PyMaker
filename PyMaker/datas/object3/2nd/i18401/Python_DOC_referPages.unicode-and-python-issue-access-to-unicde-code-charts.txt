Yesterday i wrote the following  to convert  to  :When  you call it such as :  ,  it , is equivalent to  in  and .When you reada number such as reading from , and want to show in , this is very useful.I downloaded   of  from http://unicode.org ,Because i need to wrote  According to it should get  as parameter and  store ,Also i'm newbie in pytho.My questions are, how can store ? , how can  store , how can split an  to another format ? how can use ?Notes: I found to use  , but i couldn't use it.may be you can
You need to read the Python Unicode HOWTO for either Python 2.x or 3.x, as appropriate. But I can give you brief answers to your questions.My questions are, how can store 2bytes? how can utf8 store , how can split an unicode string to another format ?A  object holds characters; a  object holds bytes.Note that in Python 2.x,  is the same thing as ; in 3.x, it's the same thing as . And in both languages, a literal with neither a  nor a  prefix is a . Since you didn't tell us whether you're using Python 2 or 3, I'll use explicit  and , and  and  prefixes, everywhere.You convert between them by picking an encoding (in this case, UTF-8) and using the  and  methods. For example:If you have a UTF-8  object, you should  it to  as early as possible, and do all your work with it in Unicode. Then you don't have to worry about how many bytes something takes, just treat each character as a character. If you need UTF-8 output,  back as late as possible.(Very occasionally, the performance cost of decoding and encoding is too high, and you need to deal with UTF-8 directly. But unless that really is a bottleneck in your code, don't do it.)So, let's say you wanted to adapt your  to take a UTF-8 English digit string instead of an integer, and to return a UTF-8 Persian digit string instead of a Unicode one. (I'm assuming Python 3 for the purposes of this example.) All you need to do is change  to , and change  to , and that's it.how can use unicode code charts?Python already comes with the Unicode code charts (and the right ones to match your version of Python) compiled into the  module, so usually it's a lot easier to just use those than to try to use the charts yourself. For example:â€¦ i need to wrote PersianToInteger('unicodeString')You really shouldn't need to. Unless you're using a very old Python,  should do it for you. For example, in 2.6:If it's not working for you,  is the easiest solution:However, either of these will convert digits in any script to a number, not just Persian. And there's nothing in the Unicode charts that will directly tell you that a digit is Persian; the best you can do is parse the name:If you really want to do things in either direction by mapping digits from one script to another, here's a better solution:
