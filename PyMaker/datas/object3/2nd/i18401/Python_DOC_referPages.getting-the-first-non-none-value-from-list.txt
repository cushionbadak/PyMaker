Given a list, is there a way to get the first non-None value? And, if so, what would be the pythonic way to do so?For example, I have:  In this case, if a is None, then I would like to get b. If a and b are both None, the I would like to get d.Currently I am doing something along the lines of , is there another way?
You can use :If the list contains only Nones, it will throw  exception. If you want to have a default value in this case, do this:
 is an  recipe found in the Python 3 docs:  One may choose to implement the latter recipe or import , a library that ships with  recipes and more:Use:Why use the predicate?"First non-" item is not the same as "first " item, e.g.  where  is the first non-, but it is not the first  item.  The predicate allows  to be useable, ensuring any first seen, non-None, falsey item in the iterable is still returned (e.g. , ) instead of the default.
Adapt from the following (you could one-liner it if you wanted):This takes the first non  value, or returns  instead.
I think this is the simplest way when dealing with a small set of values (will work in a list comprehension as well):Will always return the first non "None' value
