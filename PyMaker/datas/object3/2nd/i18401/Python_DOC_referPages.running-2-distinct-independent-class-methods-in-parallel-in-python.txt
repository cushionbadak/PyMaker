I'm new to multiprocessing in Python. I have a simple program like:With func being CPU-intensive and returning a different value each time they are called.I have a machine with 2 8-core CPUs with Ubuntu and Python 2.6.5 installed (can't update, unfortunately), and another machine with a single i7 processor and Python 2.7.5 (also, can't update). I also am unable to install new packages.I believe I could gain some performance if all 3 methods were to be ran at the same time (the OS in theory should allocate them to different cores), but I'm not sure how to proceed. The documentation is cryptic at best for multiprocessing.Could you please point me to some examples or give me some advice on how to accomplish that? Thanks
Doug Hellmans "Module of the Week" often have good examples:http://pymotw.com/2/multiprocessing/basics.htmlHis book on the Standard library is worth the money as well.
Well, this is very close to one of the examples in the docsâ€¦ But I think this would be easier with a  than with explicit processes, and even easier with  than with a simple pool. Plus, the  module's docs are a whole simpler than the  docs. So, let's do it that way:If you're using Python 2.5-3.1, you won't have this module in the stdlib, so you'll need to install the backport.For comparison, here's what it would look like using an explicit  for each function:
