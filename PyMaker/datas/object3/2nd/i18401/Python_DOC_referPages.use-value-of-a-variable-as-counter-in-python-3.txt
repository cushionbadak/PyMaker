I want to take an input from the user and and store it in a variable, lets say . Then use this  as a counter for a . doesn't work!code:Output:I also tried using range which gave me an error:Traceback (most recent call last):  File "/home/ramupradip/reflect.py", line 6, in     for i in range(1,k):TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer 
Read the input like this:... I guess you forgot to convert the number to , but it's impossible to tell if you don't show the relevant code. Other than that, the looping constructs shown in the question should work fine, but the first one is preferred in Python, just be careful with the indexes:Equivalently:
That does not make any sense.You could want this:Where  is the total number of iterations set by the user and  is a value that changes from  to .Or you could want this:Where  is a value from  to  and the user input doesn't mean anything. Or you could want this:Where  is the start value set by the user,  is a value set by the program and  is a value that starts from  and ends in See the documentation for more info http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range
