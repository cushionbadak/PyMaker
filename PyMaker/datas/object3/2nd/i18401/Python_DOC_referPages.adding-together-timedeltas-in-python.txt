This question already has an answer here:Python format timedelta to string                    21 answers                So I have this list:Collectively that is 2:00 hours. I'm trying to add those up to get 2:00 time delta, which then in turn needs to be turned into a string of 2.0 Hours. Respectively 1:30 Hours would be 1.5 Hours as the final countdown.
The naive approach would be to take the  from each object and  them but this is not as robust as Haidro's solution:This results in a  object with the correct delta that you can use however you want.
The obvious way to sum anything number-like and addable in Python is with the  function:(For most number-like types, you don't even need the  value, because they know how to add themselves to .  explicitly does not allow this, to avoid accidentally mixing dimensionless intervals—e.g., you don't want to add  to a …)Whenever you're using  with  for number-like values, you're probably doing it wrong.If you don't provide an  argument to , it will do the wrong thing with an empty list, raising a  instead of returning the  value. (The sum of no numbers is 0; the sum of no s is ; etc.)And if you do provide an  argument, then it's just a more verbose, more complicated, and slower way to write . Compare:
