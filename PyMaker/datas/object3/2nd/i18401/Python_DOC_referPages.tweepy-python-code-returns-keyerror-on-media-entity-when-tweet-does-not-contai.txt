Hi people of StackOverflowI am relatively new to Tweepy/Twitter API and am having a few issues getting it to return the URL's for images.Basically, I have written a snippet of code that searches for tweets against a particular hashtag, then returns image URL entities that exist in the tweets. I am hitting an issue however when a tweet is returned that does not have any media in it. Error shown below:Below is my code:I am guessing I need to encase the for loop in some kind of if statement, however I am struggling to get my head around how.Any help would be much appreciated.EDIT:I think I might have found a solution, however i'm not sure it is particularly elegant.....using a try/except.
You could check for the existence of the key:Or get an empty list if there is no such key:
