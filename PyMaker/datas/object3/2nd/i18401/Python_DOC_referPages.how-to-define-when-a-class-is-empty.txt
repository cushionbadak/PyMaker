I wrote my own vector class:I want to define that V(0,0) is an empty vector, such that this would work: (The first case should return "Vector is empty")
Define , like this:
You can implement the special method :Note that in Python 2, the special method is named .Alternatively, because you have a vector, it might make even more sense to implement  and provide the actual vector length instead. If  is not defined, Python will automatically try to use the  method to get the length and evaluate if itâ€™s not zero.
If you're just concerned about the output. Just extend the  method.Output will be:Vector is emptyV(1,2)
