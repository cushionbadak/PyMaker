Could anyone please explain what is wrong here:I get proper results for 'T' and 'C', but 'A' and 'C' won't replace. Got really stuck. String looks like 'ACGTACG'.
You are first replacing all s with s before then replacing all s with s again (including those you just replaced s with!):Use a translation map instead, fed to :The  method requires a dictionary mapping codepoints (integers) to replacement characters (either a single character or a codepoint), or  (to delete the codepoint from the input string). The  function gives us those codepoints for the given 'from' letters.This looks up characters in , one by one in C code, in the translation map, instead of replacing all s followed by all s. has the added advantage of being much faster than a series of  calls.Demo:
Mutable data is your enemy :)See, you first replace all s with s, then, in another iteration, replace all s with s again.What works:It prints .
