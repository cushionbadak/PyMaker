The following code is giving me error Python Code:How could I fix the error - Secondly how can I append both the values of i and j if the if condition is true? Here I'm trying to append i only.
You need to iterate over a range based on , not  itself:You can append both numbers as a tuple:or simply append them individuallydepending on your needs.
Try this: 
You cannot iterate over integer ():You should use  to iterate  times:
probably you meant range(2) instead of 
 is an , so  will not work, as the error explains. Perhaps you meantThe same goes for the second -loop.(See ; in Python 2.x use )By the way this whole thing can be a single list comprehension:
the  statement apply to the Python concept "iterable", like list, tuple, etc.. An int is not an iterable. so you should use  or , which receive an int and produce an iterable. second, do you mean append a tuple:  or a list:  ? I'm not quite clear about the question.
