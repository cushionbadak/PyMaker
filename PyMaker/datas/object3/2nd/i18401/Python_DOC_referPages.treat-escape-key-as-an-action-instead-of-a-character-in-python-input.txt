In a command-line application, I'm using the following code (from Andreas Renberg) to ask the user a yes/no question (it just uses the standard ):If the user types  (or an equivalent) the function returns , and  returns . If they just press , the  value is chosen.However, if user presses  on their keyboard, it gets treated as a character. Is there instead a way to cause the function to return  if that key is pressed? The few results I have found in my own searches seem overly complicated or only work on some operating systems.
If you want to catch the  keyboard press you have to implement something like  method which will get you one character at a time.Here is a simplistic implementation that works.Then you just have a  loop with  until you get an  or .Note: I haven't specified a way to determine the platform since there are multiple ways to do that, and there are a lot answers on SO on that topic.
