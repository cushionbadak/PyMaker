I'm trying to figure out how to change this code.  Instead of counting the number of times that the target value appears, I want to be able to return the number of values in the list that are greater than the target value.Do I change the 5 line too?
The change is fairly trivial:Don't forget to properly indent the line that follows this.Note that the most Pythonic way to write this function would be to use :
You can use a list comprehension approach:UPD:This is actually a short form of:So, yes, there is an intermediate list - generator expression is a better choice.
You change line 4 to :or, you use the more functional (but probably hard to understand for a beginner):P.S. I've also changed  to the nicer looking .
No, you would only change Note that the  statement requires indentation on 
No in this case you are changing the equivalence test to a greater than test.You are currently testing  which will execute the (properly indented)  line on every equivalence.To do a greater than test you'd need to change the test to .The code would look like:
