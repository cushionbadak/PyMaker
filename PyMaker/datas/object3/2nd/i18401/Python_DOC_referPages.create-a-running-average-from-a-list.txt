First time Python user and I am lost.  I need to create a table from a list that displays the daily temperature and the running average of temperature up to that day.
A running average is just, for each value in a list, the average of all of the values up to that one. For a stripped-down version of your example:The running averages are , , , and .So, at each index, the running average is the running total, dividing by (index + 1).You can get the running totals with :And you can get the (1-based) indexes with :So, just divide:Or using  in Python 3.4, or its backport/predecessor  for 3.1-3.3:Of course you can always do it explicitly if you prefer:â€¦ or even:
I'd go with this:
Here's another way to do it:Using cumulative series is a very useful way of working with sums over parts of a series.
Here's a way to do it using itertools and operators
