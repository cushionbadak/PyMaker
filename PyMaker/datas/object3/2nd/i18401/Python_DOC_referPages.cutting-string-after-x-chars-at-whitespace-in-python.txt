Natural Text
I want to cut a long text after x characters, but I don't want to cut a word in the middle, I want to cut at the last whitespace before x chars:gives mebut I wantAnother example:gives mebut I wantWhat is the easiest way to do this?

You can use  or  to remove everything after the last space of the remainder:The second argument to  limits the split to the first space from the right, and the  index takes whatever was split off before that space.  is a bit faster, and always returns three strings; if there was no space then the first string returned is empty, so you may want to stick with  if thatâ€™s a possibility (that version would return a list with a single string in that case, so you end up with the original string again).
