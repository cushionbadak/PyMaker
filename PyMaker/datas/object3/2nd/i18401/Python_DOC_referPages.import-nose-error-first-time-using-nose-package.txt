The problem is that you haven't installed  properly.Like most packages,  expects you to install it, not just use it out of the source in-place.The official Python docs include Installing Python Modules. However, that document may be a bit over-complicated for novices, especially Windows users, and it doesn't mention some of the newer, simpler options. But briefly:Download the source archive.Unzip it (or untar it, or whatever); often just double-clicking it on Windows will do this.Open a cmd (aka "DOS shell") window. to the source directory.However, you will probably find it a lot easier to just automatically install things using , or pre-made binary packages.Having done this,  should end up in the right place in  so you don't need to do any  munging in your code, and you should also end up with the command-line scripts like  somewhere useful, like .The specific problem in this case is that, as part of the installation process,  figures out whether you're installing for Python 2.x or 3.x, and runs a tool called  to fix the code appropriately. Because you never did that step, you ended up with 2.x-specific code. As you guessed, it's the  statement vs.  function that bit you firstâ€”but if you got past that, there are dozens of other things that would fail similarly.
