Basically it works for almost every case I've tried besides 0.93. I then added "print money" in the while loop to see what it was doing after every loop and this was what happened:Can someone explain what the hell is going on?
Floating point numbers can't represent most decimal fractions exactly, just like you can't write the result of 1/3 exactly using decimal floating point notation. Use integers to calculate with cents instead, or use the  module.This has nothing to do with Python, by the way, but with the way computers generally do floating point math.
 is integer division.  is the modulus operator (remainder of integer division) bit of thought you could pass in a list [25,10,5,1] and do it in a loop
You can't express most fractions exactly using floating point. I Think that integers are the best solution to the problem in your case. I rewrote your code  to use cents and python 3.
