Note: this code works fine on Ubuntu but not on mac and instead of changing the mac/python settings locally I'm trying to make change to the code so it'll work everywhere..but it throws error:[Errno 1] _ssl.c:503: error:140770FC:SSL  routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocolnow code's not using urllib.request instead using httplibI want to change the code so it'll take SSLv3 as default protocol, something like this:I looked around and found few links but nothing is working!this link is for ubuntulink for python urllib and cURLpython bug fix, but again for urllib
Note: The HTTPSConnection constructor allows to pass an ssl  as argument since python 2.7.9, which should be used in this case.This answer predates that change and therefore only applies to outdated versions of python. just calls  on the opened socket to initalize a https connection, unfortunately you can't specify any parameters in python2.7 (python3 allows passing the ).If you want to specify the protocol version, you'd need to monkey patch one of these two:Method 1: patch :This changes the protocol version for all connections made with .Method 2: patch :This changes the default protocol version for all code that uses , therefore also affects other libraries.edit:Method 3: because httplib actually accesses only  from , you could also just replace  with a class providing . Using  makes it very elegant to write this:
