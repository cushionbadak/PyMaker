I have to write a program that reads a list of numbers from a file then outputs the average.If my file contained3458321My program would output: 38I know how to create the file:This bit works but I don't know how to do the second part.
Split number string using , then convert to int. Sum all number, divide it:If file is huge, above will cause problem (taking too many memory). In such case, use following (process line by line):
This code should do what you want.It uses list comprehension in order to build a list of all the numbers in the file, it uses  to remove the newline character  from the line, then it uses  to convert the number to an integer (at this point, the number was still a string). The file itself is read using  which outputs a list of all the lines in the file.Finally, it prints the sum of all the numbers in the list divided by the length of the list (which gives the average of all the numbers).
