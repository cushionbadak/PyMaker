 objects do not have a  because, by their very nature, they're being shared across threads, and it would be inaccurate and misleading.However, they have a  method that gives you the approximate size, for exactly this kind of purpose.If you want exact values, you need a second  for that, where each task puts something on the out-queue, and some extra thread (or possibly the main thread) loops over it and counts up the tasks done so far. Or, alternatively, something simpler, like a global  counter with a global  protecting it.However, I think it would be a lot simpler to write this in terms of a pool or executor. That would take care of queueing up tasks for you, and returning a value for each one to the main thread, without you needing to manage anything. For example, using , the backport of the Python 3.x  module for 2.x, here's your whole program, with progress added:
