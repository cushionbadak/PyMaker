I'm playing with a function in Python 3 that queries small blocks of XML from the eBird API, parsing them with minidom. The function locates and compares dates from two requested blocks of XML, returning the most recent. The code below does its job, but I wanted to ask if there was a simpler way of doing this (the for loops seem unnecessary since each bit of XML will only ever have one date, and comparing pieces of the returned string bit by bit seems clunky). Is there a faster way to produce the same result?
Use the  to parse the dates into  objects, then us  to return the greater value (most recent):Running this now against the URLs you provided, that results in:This returns a  object; if returning a string is important to you, you can always still return:e.g. format the  object to a string again.
