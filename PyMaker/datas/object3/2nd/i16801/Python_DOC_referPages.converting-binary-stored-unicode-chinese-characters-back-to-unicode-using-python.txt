I'm working from an OpenOffice produced .csv with mixed roman and Chinese characters.  This is an example of one row:This section contains two Chinese characters stored in binary which I would like displayed as Chinese characters on the command line from a very basic Python 3 program (see bottom), how do I do this?When I open the .csv in OpenOffice I need to select "Chinese Simplified UEC-CN" as the Character set if that helps.  I have searched extensively but I do not understand Unicode and the pages do not make sense.Thank you in advance for any suggestions.
Thanks to a suggestion by @eryksun I solved my issue by re-encoding the source file to UTF-8 from ASCII.  The question is different but the solution is here : http://www.stackoverflow.com/a/542899/792015 Alternatively if you are using Eclipse you can paste a non roman character (such as a Chinese character like å¤§) into your source code and save the file.  If the source is not already UTF-8 Eclipse will offer to change it for you.Thank you for all your suggestions and my apologies for answering my own question.  Footnote : If anyone knows why changing the source file type effects the compiled program I would love to know.  According to https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html the interpreter treats source files as UTF-8 by default.
