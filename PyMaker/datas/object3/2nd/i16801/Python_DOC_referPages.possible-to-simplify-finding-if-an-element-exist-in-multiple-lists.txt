This is my Python code, it's usable but... I'm sure there a way to simplify this long code. Anyone have a good answer for this?
You can use  and a generator expression:See a demonstration below:
As I feel is obligatory for Python questions involving collections, here's an answer based on :Beware though, that this answer becomes inefficient (compared with your original code) if the trees change to a different collection that implements  by doing something faster than a linear search.
Use :In essence,  is equivalent to a series of  operations on an iterable of booleans, while its cousin  is equivalent to a series of  operations.
 is in at least one of those lists if & only if it's in the concatenation of the lists, so:
You can use . It will be less efficient, but looks simpler.
