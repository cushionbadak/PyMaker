I was trying to test how the lists in python works according to a tutorial I was reading.When I tried to use  or , the interpreter gives me .Please let me know how I can get a result from these two methods:
 and  change the list in place and return  See the mutable sequence documentation:The  and  methods modify the list in place for economy of space when sorting or reversing a large list. To remind you that they operate by side effect, they don’t return the sorted or reversed list.Do this instead:or use the  and  functions.These methods return a new list and leave the original input list untouched.Demo, in-place sorting and reversing:And creating new sorted and reversed lists:
For reference, you can see the documentation here specifically says:The sort() and reverse() methods modify the list in place for economy of space when sorting or reversing a large list. To remind you that they operate by side effect, they don’t return the sorted or reversed list.Don't be afraid to read the manual!
A simple ascending sort is very easy, call the sorted() function. It returns a new sorted list: sorted() accept a reverse parameter with a boolean value.
This methods operate in place. This code works (python 3.x)
