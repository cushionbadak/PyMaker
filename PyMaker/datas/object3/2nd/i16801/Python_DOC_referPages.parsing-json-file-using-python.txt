i need a help in parsing json files using python.this is my sample json filei have tried the following code,but itz throwing a key error if any attribute value is null,how do i skip those attributes and continue parsing for remaining data.
Use the  method to get a default value if a key is not defined:and perhaps:to default to an empty dictionary for the nested list items. The latter can still fail if there is a  or  key but the value is an empty list.You can preprocess each item a little:then use:etc.
