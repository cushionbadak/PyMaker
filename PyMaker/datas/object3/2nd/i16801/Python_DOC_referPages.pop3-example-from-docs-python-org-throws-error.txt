Curiously, the script also fails to ask for the username, only asking for a password which is where the "Authentication failed." comes from I am guessing.I made the following changes for my script to remove the possibility I keyed in the user/password incorrectly:And got the following error:So I am convinced that this is where the issue is:Can anyone shed some light on this? I use the docs.python.org regularly for example code and this is the first time I have had example code fail. I tried changing the password to something really short and simple, adding "@servername" to the username and still cannot get a list of emails.Example code is on this pageUPDATE: I would appreciate if the downvotes were at least explained so I can learn from the process.
