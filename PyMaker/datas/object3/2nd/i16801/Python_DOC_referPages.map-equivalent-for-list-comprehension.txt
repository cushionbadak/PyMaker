Is there a map equivalent for this?I mean, something like this:but it doesn't work. Just curious.
You are looking for : applies each item from the iterable as separate arguments to the callable. The nested generator expression could be replaced with an  object for more mapping goodness:Like all callables in , this produces an iterator, not a list. But if you were using Python 3, so does , anyway. If you are using Python 2, it may be an idea to swap out  for  here.
Nothing beats , like Martijn explained. But if you like to use only , then you can simulate what  internally does, like thisOr you can use , like this is nothing but unpacking the values which we received with . So, the value of  will be the first argument to  and the value of  will be the second argument to .
Something like this.Still, it is rather inadvisable to use map, not list comprehension.
