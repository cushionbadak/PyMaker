Yes.When importing a file it is being run.To avoid this, file1.py can be:And then the text will be printed only if file1.py is the main file being run directly.
In a sense yes. When you import a file, you will run all the script and you will also initialize all the methods.To ensure that code is only run when the file is run directly and not when it is imported. You should put all your main code in  and do it as:
The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the import statement is defined as a call to the import() function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of import() is used to perform the name binding operation of the import statement. See the import statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.import file using pythonTo print 'file2' your code, you need to pass it as a command to the Python interpreter,there's no  function that gets run automatically, so the  function is implicitly all the code at the top level, and call How main does in python
