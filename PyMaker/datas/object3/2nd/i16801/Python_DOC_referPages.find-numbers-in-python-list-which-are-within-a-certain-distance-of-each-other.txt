I have a list of numbers in Python.  It looks like this:I want to keep all the numbers which are within + or - 7 of each other and discard the rest.  Is there a simple way to do this in Python?  I have read about the list filter method but am not sure how to get what I want working with it.I am new to Python.UpdateOutput would ideally be [84, 86, 87, 89, 90] and another list [997, 999, 1000, 1002].  I want to retrieve the sequences and not the outliers.  Hope this makes sense.
This is algorithm problem, try this:Output:
If your problems allows transitive relations, i.e. x is in the group as long as it's at most 7 away from any element in the group, then this seems to me like a graph theory problem. To be more specific, you need to find all connected components.The problem itself is pretty easy to solve with a recursive algorithms. You would first create a dictionary in which every key would be one of the elements and every value would be a list of elements which are at most 7 apart from that element. For your example, you would have something like this:Which would give you something like thisNow you need to write a recursive function which will take as input an element and a list, and it will keep adding elements in a list as long as it can find an element which is at most 7 apart from the current element.Somewhere in the code you also need to remember which elements you have already visited to make sure that you don't get into an infinite loop.You need to call that function for every element in your list.This code should give the following output for your input:

For any problem like this my first port of call is the Python itertools module.  The pairwise function from that link that I use in the code is available in the more-itertools module.I haven't tested for edge cases, so it's buyer beware :)
