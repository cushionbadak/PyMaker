I have a list whose elements are either a json object or None. What would be the most elegant way to convert it into a list of 0's and 1's. For example here is my input :j1, j2, j3 are json objects. The expected output is I can implement this using a for loop followed by if statement. Is there a way to do it which is more elegant/pythonic?

You can also use map function on your list, here's a python shell's session:
