For example, there is a built-in function  in Python. The problem is, when the module  is imported, the definition of function  is changed. How can I used the original function  in the  module?For example:and the code will not work! Sorry I am a newbie in Python.
You can still reach the object on the  module:(The module was renamed to  in Python 3; underscores removed, made plural).You could assing  to a different name before you import all from :or don't use . Use  perhaps, and use  to use the NumPy version that way.
You should try to avoid using from name import *. Because of that problem it is really looked down upon to do that.This way you know exactly what you are using and where it came from. It is more readable and understandable.This is really bad, because you have no idea what you are importing. If there are several modules in the package that you don't use it will import them all. You only want what you need to use. Some libraries can get really big which would add a lot of things you don't need.
