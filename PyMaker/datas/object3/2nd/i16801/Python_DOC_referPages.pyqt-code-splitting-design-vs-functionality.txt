Am struggling to comprehend how to split code in (Py)Qt.  The aim is to have the design & navigation tabs in QMainWindow, each tab triggering code in other files.  So far it only launches with the ActionClass in the same document / putting in an external document causes 'app not defined' when clicking the tab.  The below works without errors, but is clunky.  The examples I keep seeing have all code in one document.  Is there another way to do this e.g. where the ActionClass is in another file/writing u.lineEdit.setText instead of app.u.lineEdit.setText.  It seems inheritance & an instance of Main can't be accessed from the ActionClasses doc, so I can't see how they would communicate back to the Main?  Much appreciated        
As suggest @M4rtini you  can separate your code into python modules. And then import them (use them) in your main module.For instance the code you posted can be separated in to files:and In order to understand how import works see the link I left you above.More explanationLest's see:The correct way of executin code inside a  method is creating an instance. See the example below.So, you line reads:and should reads:On the other hand, is a bad practice put code that's not for initialize the instance inside the  methods.If you don't need the instance but yet you want to store the functions inside a class (something like a c++ namespace) you creatinguse   decorator.So, your  could be rewritten as:ans then you can use it like this:
