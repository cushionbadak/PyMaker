In Python , as we all know there is a useful function : zipfor instance:we can "add" these lists in one line:But it seems zip created a new list.In many cases , which I want is just a pair of data( a[i],b[i] ) , I don't want the "zip" list at all.In c# , we can make a iterator to get pair data from a and b , so we could avoid to make a new "zip" list.What about python?
It is :Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.  Like zip() except that it returns an iterator instead of a list. Used  for lock-step iteration over several iterables at a time.Example:Note that in Python-3.x  is gone,  returns an iterator.
You don't need a function per se, just use a generator expression:Output:
Generator for fixed or variable number of iterablesYou may create your own generator in Python too:Calling from command line:
Try to use map() as below:
