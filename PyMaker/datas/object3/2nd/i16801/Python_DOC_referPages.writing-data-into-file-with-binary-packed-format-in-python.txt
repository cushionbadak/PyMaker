I am reading some value for file and wants to write modified value into file. My file is .ktx format [binary packed format].  I am using struct.pack() but seems that something is going wrong with that:I want to write in both ways little-endian and big-endian.
again you can check the docs and see the format characters you need https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.htmlalso note that it is a lowercase  , not a one (as also covered in the docs)
I haven't tested this but the following function should solve your problem. At the moment it reads the file contents completely, creates a buffer and then writes out the updated contents. You could also modify the file buffer directly using  and  but it might be slower (again, not tested). I'm using the  class since you seem to want to unpack the same number many times.An alternative is to use the  which makes it quite easy. I don't know how to implement endianess with an .
