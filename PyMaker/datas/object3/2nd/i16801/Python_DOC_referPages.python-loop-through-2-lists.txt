I am writing some code in Python that is almost working, but there is one thing I am unable to figure out.I need to loop through 2 lists. I want to loop through until the first list is complete; whereas the second list should repeat itself until the first list is complete.I want to input a list of databases and a list of streams. Then I want the code to output the 9 lines by replacing where it has "+ stream +" and "+ item +". The item part works fine, but I don't know how to output the list of streams while iterating through the list of databases. I want the streams to cycle through and then repeat. So it will start at 1a and then reach 3c, and then start over again at 1a. I want this to happen until it reaches the last database in the list.Here is the output:My output has STREAM1a every time, but I want it to cycle through the pattern of 1a, 2a, 3a, 1b, 2b, 3b, 1c, 2c, and 3c. As mentioned, if I have more than 9 databases, then it would start over at 1a again. How can I achieve this?The only part of my code that isn't working the way I want is where it says "+ stream +".
You should use itertools.cycle. This will allow you to get the elements of a list in an endlessly repeating cycle. Add this code at the start of your loop:or as @HughBothwell suggested, you can use zip and include it in the definition of the  loop:Either way will give you the next stream at each iteration of the loop. If you have more dbs than streams, then it will repeat.
The trick is to use iterator from  called bonus - command line parameters parsing using docoptSmall bonus: to let you call the script and conveniently enter paremeters from command lineInstall  package (just once)Write modifed version of the script db.py:Printout usage string:Show some help string:And call it for real use:
