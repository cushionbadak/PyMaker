I got an error for a simple print statement, what could be the possible error, have changed to float and tried but still error persist.error: Thanks in advance...
In Python 3, print() is a function, not a statement.A generator expression is like a list comprehension, except it creates an object that produces results when you iterate over it, not when you create it. For example,produces a list, [0, 1, 4, 9, 16], whileproduces a generator object that will produce those numbers when you iterate over it.If you give a function only one argument and it is a generator expression, you can omit the parentheses around the generator expression, so you do not have to do myfunc((i + 1 for i in something)).So you are creating a generator object, and passing it to the print() function, which prints its representation. Itâ€™s doing exactly what you asked for, just not what you meant to ask for.You can initialize a list from a generator expression:but it is easier to use the list comprehension:A simple example of how you might use the generator object is:although in that simple example it would obviously be easier to write:
There is no error. I think you are simply trying to print a list. Use  to get a list instead of a generator:Output:To print on separate lines, you would do:This uses the  approach to join all the elements of the list with the specified delimiter (in this case a newline: )Output:Or as @MartijnPieters suggested (for python3 only), you can also do:
