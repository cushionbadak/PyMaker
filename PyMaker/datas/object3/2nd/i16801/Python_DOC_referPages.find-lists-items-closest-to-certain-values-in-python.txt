I have a list of sorted floats , as well as a list of unsorted floats . Now, I need to find out for every element in  between which values of  it lies, preferably by index of . So for example, if I would need the output for index  of  to be , because  is between  and .Basically, it is the same as seeing  as bin edges and sorting  to those bins, I guess. What would be the easiest way yo accomplish that?
I would use  ( in Python 2.x) to accomplish this:Example usage:You will have to decide what you want to happen if  isn't between any pair in  (i.e. replace !) If you want indices (although your example isn't using them), have a play with .
Thanks - I'm aware of how to code that step-by-step. However, I was looking for a pretty/easy/elegant solution and now I am using numpy.digitize(), wich looks pretty to me and works nicely.
Q: What would be the easiest way yo accomplish that?Instead of giving you the code, I think you should see this pseudo-code and try to write your own code! Don't just copy paste code from the internet, if you want to educate yourself!Pseudocode:I think that this can make you understand the point and then be able to select the easiest way for you.
