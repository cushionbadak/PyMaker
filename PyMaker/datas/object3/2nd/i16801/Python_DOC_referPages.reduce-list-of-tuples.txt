As part of my journey into learning python I am implementing Bulls and Cows.I have a working implementation that uses list comprehension but I figured it might be a nice solution to solve this using a generator and -ing the final result.So I have my generator:And my reduce implementation:Where  is the user input and  is the randomly generated number for the user to guess.As you can see, this is not exactly a working implementation, this will just return the counts of the ed tuples.What I need is a replacement for , I have no idea how to construct this. is a randomly generated number, say:   is entered by the user, say:  The result of  would be:  The result of the  should be: , which is the count of all non- values of the first element and count of all non- values of the second element
If I understood the process correctly, you want to count what s are not , and how many s are not :This increments a counter only if the  or  value is not . The test produces a boolean, which is a subclass of  with  and ; summing an integer and a boolean results in another integer.Since you are feeding it non-empty strings, you could simplify it to:I'd rewrite  to:e.g. use  to pair up the digits of  and .Demo:Note that unpacking in function arguments was removed from Python 3 and the  built-in has been delegated to library function; your code is decidedly Python 2 only.To make it work in Python 3 you need to import  and adjust the lambda to not use unpacking:
