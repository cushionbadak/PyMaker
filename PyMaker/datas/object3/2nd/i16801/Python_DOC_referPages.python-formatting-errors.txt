Natural Text
I want the newline  to show up explicitly when printing a string retrieved from elsewhere. So if the string is 'abc\ndef' I don't want this to happen:but instead this:Is there a way to modify print, or modify the argument, or maybe another function entirely, to accomplish this?
Another way that you can stop python using escape characters is to use a raw string like this:orthe only proplem with using  is that it puts your string in single quotes, it can be handy if you want to use a quote
Just encode it with the  codec.In python3,  has become .  Additionally, we need to be a little more careful about bytes/unicode so it involves a decoding after the encoding:unicode_escape reference
Simplest method:The other methods are better if you want to show all escape characters, but if all you care about is newlines, just use a direct replace.
