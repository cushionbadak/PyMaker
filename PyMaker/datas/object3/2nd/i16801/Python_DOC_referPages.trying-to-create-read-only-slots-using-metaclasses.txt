I wrote some code based on what I read here, here, and here.Executing the above gives:The slots and read-only behaviour work fine, but apparently there is some problem with the property getters, since while  which uses  and  directly is giving the correct values, the attribute accesses using  and  are instead giving the value of .Please advise me on what is wrong with my code and how to fix it.
The  here creates an anonymous function:That function references , which is a local variable of the function in which it was defined.  Unfortunately, it's not copying the  value at that momentâ€”it's keeping a reference to that  variable, and once you get around to actually using that function, the  loop has completed and  is left with the last value in ; namely, .To fix this, you can use a somewhat-hacky-but-widely-recognized way of capturing it by value rather than by reference: create a parameter that shadows the other variable, but with a default value with the value you want:As Karl Knechtel mentions in the comments, you can also use , which eliminates the hacky bits altogether:Lastly, as your question was originally posted on Code Review, I'd note that you should probably run your code through .
