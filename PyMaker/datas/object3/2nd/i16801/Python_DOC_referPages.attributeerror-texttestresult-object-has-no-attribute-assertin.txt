I am trying some Python with selenium, I have some defined tests in simpleUsageUnittest.py:Alone this set is working perfectly, but then I am trying to create some suite, testTestSuite.py:And while running this suite I encounter AttributeError: 'TextTestResult' object has no attribute 'assertIn',  and since I dont exactly understand it I cannot fix it ;) If I delete assertIn lines in simpleUsageUnittest.py - then it is working again, but it is of course not what I want to do! Also Asserts in Python 2.7 not working for me example assertIn was not a big help since I am using Python 3.3.5 and Selenium 2.41.0. Can someone explain it to me? Or direct what attributes can I use to save my assert? ;)Full trace:SOLUTIONOK, it looks like in my testTestSuite.py, while executing, TextTestRunner treats "self.asserIn" lines in simpleUsageUnittest.py as self == TextTestRunner not as self == TestCase (I dont know if I explain/understand it correctly, but it is how i see it ;)). Here is fixed testTestSuite.py:'setUp' and 'tearDown' are missing because they are called automatically after every 'test'.
