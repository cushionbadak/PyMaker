So I'm trying to decide which of these is more efficient, or if there is a difference between them. The program I'm writing iterates through a for loop (python) and does some stuff, and then, depending on a flag, will write to a file.Example A:Vs example B:In the case of A it has to check every time if it's true, but in the case of B if it is true it has to then re-do the for loop. My thought is that they're equal, but I'd like opinions of more experienced programmers
Based on the Big O complexity analysis of your example(s):The above is less efficient because you are iterating over  twice.i.e: But please test yourself, use the  module and most importantly of all you are worrying prematurely about optimization. get it working first!Read also: When to optimize
Example C:As others have said, you will probably not be able notice the difference between any of these approaches.
