I've been trying to understand for a while now what's the difference between  and . I know the last one is new on Python 3.5 and both are based on , but I'm not able to understand the difference yet.
The definition of  clearly mentions:It is equivalent to:    (except that the input and check parameters are not supported)As the Python 3.5's subprocess document says:Prior to Python 3.5, these three functions (i.e. , , ) comprised the high level API to subprocess. You can now use  in many cases, but lots of existing code calls these functions.It is a common practice that when some functions are replaced, they are not instantly deprecated but there is a support window for them for some versions. This helps in preventing the breakage of older code when the language version is upgraded. I do not know whether  is going to be replaced in the future or not. But based on the document, what I know is that they are pretty much same.
