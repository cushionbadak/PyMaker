Now that SHA-1 will be banned next year by major browsers, I want to detect which sites are still using it. Is there a way to get this information using Python (such as Python's ssl library)? I can use  but I'd prefer a Pythonic solution (that is compatible with my async framework). s_client example:I dug through the ssl docs but couldn't find hash algo references. And I don't know how to get this info from the ssl context. TIA!
The signature hash algorithm is not a property of the SSL connection but a property of the certificate. Once you have the certificate you can get the algorithm using get_signature_algorithm from OpenSSL.crypto:With Python3 one can also use signature_hash_algorithm from the cryptography package:
