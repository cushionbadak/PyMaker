I would like to retrieve built-in class from Python using a string. By trial/error, I have found a way to achieve it:Is there a more Pythonic way to do it? Is there a safer way to do it?
Best to do it through  and not grab a modules . Grabbing dunders is generally not the best idea since they are subject to change; that's why built-in functions like  are around; it goes and grabs the dictionary for the object you provide,So, instead of:use:with the same effect while also being safe and more readable.
You could use Python's built-in  function which would avoid referencing anything with a double-underscore name (and be safe since the string is from a trusted source):
