I'm working with dates in python.RESULTI want to remove the repeating day(11) at the same time its value in time.UPDATEI managed to find the index of the duplicate using the above code then I remove the other except the last occurrence of the duplicate then appended by the code below
 both lists, group by day, and take the first occurrence of the date in the group, dropping the following ones (duplicates), that is, if you want to keep the first item.Do it in one-line using :result:if you wanted to keep the last item, just replace term by 
If you are trying to do what @Keiwan suggested, then consider creating a new list rather than removing unneeded values. Removing an element from a list runtime complexity is O(n), while appending an item to a list is usually of O(1).The right solution, therefore, would be - having a set of "already used days", initialized to be emptyhaving a list of new times, initialized to be emptyrunning over the list of daysfor each day, check if it appears in the "already used"; if it is - skip it. If it is not - add it to that set, and append the appropriate time to "new times".
