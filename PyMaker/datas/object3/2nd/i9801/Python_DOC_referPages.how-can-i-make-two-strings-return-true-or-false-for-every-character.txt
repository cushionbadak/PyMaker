I want to make a function that takes in a student's test answers and an answer key and return a list that states if they got the answer right or wrong using 1's and 0's.Here is my codeMy output should give me:instead it gives me this:What am i doing wrong?
This can all be simplified by using a comprehension and zip: However, to address your problem, you actually are doing an unnecessary extra step with that inner loop. It is an extra inefficiency that you don't need. Rely on the fact that your two lists are equal, so iterate over one, and just compare against the other list. Use , so that in each iteration you have access to the index and value.Also, you are not using your default keyword arguments properly. You are assigning them as a string by default and not really doing anything with a default case for that kind of assignment, so remove it. Observe:Output:
This is happening because you  and  are counting through a range i.e. they are counting  and you are also iterating through every value of Y for each value of X instead you should compare variables in the list of the same index In this algorithm it iterates through the length of X and compares each vallue of the list with the same indices e.g. it checks if Also in your function you make X='student' and Y='answer key' this is fine because you only have two parameters and it overrides them but if you were to add more later this could cause a problem, if your intention was to just have these as comments I suggest just putting a  underneath it is cleaner
If you want to figure out what you're doing wrong, I've strategically put in 2 print statements that will show you what the issue is with your code.
Just in addition for other answers I'd recommend you use map function
