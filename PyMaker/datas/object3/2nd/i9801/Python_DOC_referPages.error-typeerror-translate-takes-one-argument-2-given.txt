I am new to python. I'm getting an error while executing the code:**Given below:My Code is :
First of all, I feel the need to advise you on how bad of an idea it is to run this program. Even as a prank.With that out of the way, this is a opportunity to learn about error messages. Let's take apart the error message to see what it is telling us.First we have the backtrace, this is not the error itself, but shows the calls that were made to get to the function which returned the error. The first line shows the file and line number of the function call. The second shows what the call was. From this we can tell that on line 14 of rename.py, rename_files() was called with no arguments.The next set of lines is where the error took place in this case. We can see the same information discussed in the previous section, plus the error message.The message is telling us that one extra argument was given to the function translate(). We can now look back at the line that the error returned on, and see that the function call to translate() has two arguments, None and "0123456789". Replacing these with a single argument with fix this error.Once you have that error fixed, everything will still not work!If we take a look at the documentation, we can see the expected argument is a translation table which can be generated by calling str.maketrans(). So, your code could be changed to be the following:Please for the love of god, do not run this code though. Give it a single file to rename, do not scan for files. Especially when you are new to python, you might do something wrong and unintentionally rename a lot of files you did not intend to.
As you can see in the method's documentation,  expects only one parameter. You are sending  and  in .Also, the method doesn't expect a  like you apparently think, as it's also stated in the docs.The table must be an object that implements indexing via , typically a mapping or sequence.To create this object, use the maketrans method.
