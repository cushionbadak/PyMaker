Natural Text
I am working in a system where I have no admin rights. I have my local environment where I have installed python3, pip3, and bs4. It seems that the default system python2.6 also has a beautifulsoup package installed. As a result, my Python code tries to pick up bs4 and ends up picking up the python2.6 one.My code is:I am using pip to install bs4 with this command: Is there any way to force it to pick up the python3 one?
Python 3 can't "pick up" python 2 package. You have not installed the correct bs4. For ubuntu, the package name is: python3-bs4. Also your error message in  block is misleading as it points to python2 bs4, while the code is is python 3.If you can't install a new package on your system, set up a virtual-environment and install your dependencies by pip.
