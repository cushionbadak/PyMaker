I tried using read from csv file.Then I stucked at replacing:The error is: error: nothing to repeatWhat have gone wrong? Or is there any possible way to do this? The desired output should be just like:Thanks in advance. Cheers.
You can use  by dict  - but need escape  to :Also you can create  from :EDIT by comment:
Most punctuation characters have a special meaning in regular expressions. Here you end up with, eg: , which means an optional boundary followed by a boundary. Not what you meant.For passing arbitrary strings into a regexp, it must be escaped using :This will be , which means a boundary, followed by a , followed by another boundary.
