Natural Text
I'm trying to write a python script which will traverse through a directory recursively and create files of different sizes inside all of them. So far I have reached here. Well I haven't written any mechanism for creating files with different sizes but I need it. I very well know there's something wrong with the file creation logic I have written. Any help is highly appreciable. My code: 
Don't use a fixed . Use  to create a random size. Use  to build the full path to a file.
You are using  in the wrong way: with  you actually do not change the directory where you are working on. Your script will create files only in the directory where you run it. I do not know exactly what  does, but probably a solution could be to replace  with You need the  because  return a list where the first argument is the current directory where the command is "walking". Try to print the output of  once to get a feeling with it.EDIT:Replaced the  with  after comment from @LutzHorn
Try this
