I have a short list with coordinates: (0|0) (10|0) (10|10) (0|10). Im trying to use these coordinates to calculate the area of the square they build. for loop should run 4 times and perfom the math written below.when running i get the following error in the area = .... line: TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
You are trying to access the index of an , which is meaningless, since each  is a list, not a nested list.Assuming you get a rectangle (or square) for sure, you are good enough with
the value of  is an int. Therefore  is trying to index into an int, hence your error. You can remove the for loop and your code should work.
