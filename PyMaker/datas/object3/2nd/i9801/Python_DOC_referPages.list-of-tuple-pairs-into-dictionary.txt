I am having trouble with dictionaries in Python. I realise the task is very simple, yet I can't figure it out. My task is to write a function, which converts a list of tuples into a dictionary, where the keys of the dictionary represent the people (from the tuples) and the values represent their friends. Per exp:must return:Any help? Thank you. An if someone has a good intro on dictionaries somewhere, it would be greatly appreciated. I just can't figure them out.
A very quick way to brute force this solution is to use a defaultdict.This will add to our output dictionary the people and their friends if either the "person" or the "friend" is a required key (the first person in the input tuples).
It is way easier to construct this dict containing  (apparently) by using a  with a  as the default factory:Also, use an auxiliary  of  containing the first name from each tuple. That way you can check for membership and, if two pairs are names in the  set they'll be added to each others resulting sets:A  is just a special kind of dict that makes these tasks less tedious. Now,  contains:Due to the fact that your tuples are contained in a set, you can't have predetermined ordering unless you move them to a list and then sort them. You could also change  to have a default factory of list with  and use  and  instead of .As for an introduction to dictionaries, you could look into the section on Dictionaries of the Python Tutorial.
