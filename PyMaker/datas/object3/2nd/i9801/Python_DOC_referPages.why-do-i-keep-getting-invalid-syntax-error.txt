Natural Text
Whenever I run, IDLE tells me "invalid syntax" at the line . Apparently if I change every 2F in 2F_Rect, 2F_Text, and 2F_TextRect with something else like "apple" or "b2F" (anything random), I will not get the error. Could somebody explain to me why I will get a syntax error just because the variable has "2F" in its name???I apologize I had to copy-paste the entire file
Variables can't start with numbers.You can see why by seeing Python's grammar
