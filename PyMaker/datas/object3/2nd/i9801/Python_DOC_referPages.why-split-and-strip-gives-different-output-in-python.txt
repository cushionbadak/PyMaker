I was trying to extract the state name from the string .When I tried , I was given the correct result 'Rhode Island'.However, when I tried , I was given the wrong result 'Rhode Islan'.I got confused why the character 'd' before the left bracket was also removed when I used rstrip function.
 -> string or unicodeReturn a copy of the string S with trailing whitespace removed.If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.If chars is unicode, S will be converted to unicode before strippingin your case the chars = ['[','e','d','i','t',']']which contains 'd' there fore trailing string that formed by given chars is try regular expression
 doesn't do what you want, it removes all characters specified from the end of the string, so it removed '[', 'e', 'd', 'i', 't', and ']'. What you want is to split on '[' then take the first element:
