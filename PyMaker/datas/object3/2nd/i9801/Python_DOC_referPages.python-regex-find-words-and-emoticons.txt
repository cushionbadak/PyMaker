The re module has a function  that takes care of correct escaping of words, so you could just use Note that word boundaries might not work as you expect when used with words that don't start or end with actual word characters.

This requires you to use  or  to avoid them being interpreted as special characters, but rather as the ASCII characters 40 and 41. Since you didn't understand what @Nicarus was saying, you need to use this:Note: I'm only spelling it out because this doesn't seem like a school assignment, for all the people who might want to criticize this. Also, look at the documentation prior to going to stack overflow. This explains everything.
