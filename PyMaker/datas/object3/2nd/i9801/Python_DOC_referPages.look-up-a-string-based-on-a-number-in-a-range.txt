I'm trying to create a rank system for my gaming group, similar in nature to Supercell's Trophy System in their Clash of Clans and Clash Royale games for android/iOS systems.I have the layout of the ranks all figured out, and we already have a point system in place that works ... I just need to now program in the actual ranks.The ranks work very simply: The individual's point balance falls within specific values, and the rank corresponding to that value is the person's rank. I created a simple table to show what I mean ... here's an excerpt of what it looks like:So here's the simple rank system layout, it goes all the way up to Commander at 42,000 points. My question is this: How do I associate the Rank with the point value, without having to type out all the lines of code like this? 
You can use bisect for this.
A slight improvement to Daniel Roseman's  solution to would be to use a single list of 2-tuples:The advantages here are that it's easier to read at a glance, and less prone to mistakes when editing your code to introduce new ranks, tweak limits, etc.It also returns the highest rank when supplied a points balance higher than any accounted for in  (as specified in your comment), rather than raising an exception.Example:
