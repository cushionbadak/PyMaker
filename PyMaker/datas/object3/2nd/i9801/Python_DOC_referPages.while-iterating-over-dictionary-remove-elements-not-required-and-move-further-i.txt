My concern here is if name_3[0]>50, add it to html table and if name_3[0]<=50, discard it and iterate to next value in dictionary because I don't want to add entry below 50. Below is the logic which I think of. But can we iterate through next value ? 
As far as I know, it is never a good idea to change a dictionary (or list or some set) while iterating over it.Maybe add those values, which you want to keep, in a new dictionary instead?
As per your last comment:Iterate over the values in the dictionaryOnly assign size_KB and operate on it if the first entry in value is greater than 50.i.e (you don't need the else block):Size is only getting assigned when  is greater than .For your html:
