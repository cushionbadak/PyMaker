Thanks to whoever looks at this. What I am trying to do is create a randomly jumbled list. However when I run it, it doesn't seem very random at all. It is possible I am overlooking something, or that is just as random as it gets. Please get back to me when you have a chance.
Your shuffle isn’t a fair one. It moves a random item in the list to the end of the list as many times as there are items in the list, but that means the first item only has a slightly less than 1 − ((n − 1) / n)n chance of being moved, where in a fair shuffle it would have a (n − 1) / n chance of being moved. For a list of 7 elements, that’s about a 34% chance for the first element to stay in the same place, compared to about a 14% chance in a fair shuffle.Use a simple, standard shuffle, like Fisher–Yates:Or the built-in .
