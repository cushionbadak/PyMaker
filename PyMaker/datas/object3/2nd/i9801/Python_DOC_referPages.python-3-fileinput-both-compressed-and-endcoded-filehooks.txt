Natural Text
I need to both uncompress and decode a set of gzipped files, and the filehook module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html) has hooks to both, but I am unable to apply both:Is there a syntax to apply both of these hooks onto the same FileInput instance?
Looking at the source and noting that  and  support encoding parameters, it shouldn't be too difficult to roll your own:
No, there's no way to combine these. You cannot even use  with the default  by passing text mode, because  refuses to accept  on the assumption that  always means text.The only solution is to write your own.
