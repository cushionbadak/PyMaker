I am new to programming and I am trying to return a dictionary from one function and use it in another, however I keep getting this same error as said in the title. Here is my code:
You are returning a value from read_qa(). So you must assign this function to a variable where the returned value can be stored.Also in def of take_quiz() it expects an argument which have been called "database" in function declaration. So you need to pass a similar proper argument while calling take_quiz().temp = read_qa(), and then ,take_quiz(temp).You can use any valid variable name instead of temp.I hope this helps...
