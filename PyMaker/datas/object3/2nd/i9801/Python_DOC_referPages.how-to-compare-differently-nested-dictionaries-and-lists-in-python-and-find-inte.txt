I now have two (more or less complex) lists / dictionaries. The first one contains image names and the image pixel colors in hex. So it looks like this: So in this case I would have 2 images 2 x 2 px.The second dictionary contains a lot of hex-values as keys and an id as value. It looks like: Now what I would like to do is to look if there is a color-value from my images (first list) that matches with one of the second list. If so, then I would like to know the filename from the first list and the value, the id,  of the matched key in the second list. How could I achieve this? 
Use dictionary view objects to produce an intersection between your  lists and the hex-id dictionary: produces the intersection between the key set and your list of hex values.The above assumes you are using Python 3; if you are using Python 2 instead, use  instead of .Demo:
