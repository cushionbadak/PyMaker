I am trying to write a function to solve the function N = 10 * (Log2 N)^2+1000, but it does not work, can someone help me to fix it? 
Or iterate the function some times, provided it is by chance a fixed point iterationwhich gives the outputwhich looks like slightly less than one correct digit gained per iteration.
IMHO:This is what you are looking for based on this equation:function N = 10 * (Log2 N)^2+1000answer would be 1441.4082507040794
It is hard to understand what you actually want.Also the code you wrote doesn't seem to have anything to do with the problem stated in your question.Assuming you are having problem to understand how to use the log function:lets say you want to calculate log function with base 2 then:Output:Assuming that helped.NOw,let's try your function;it should look something like this:Output:
