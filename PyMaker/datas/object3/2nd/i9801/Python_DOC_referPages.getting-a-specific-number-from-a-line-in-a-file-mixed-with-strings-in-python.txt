Natural Text
I have a file in which among other lines there are certain lines which start are like as followsTheir distinct feature being starting with *SOLIDI would like to get the number in the same line after EB so first iteration should give 1 and second should give 42what I used isit would give me 1, and 2, as output. I can of-course increase the -2 to -3 but the comma would still be there and when I have 1 or any number less than 10 as the last number it would also include B with that. Any suggestions to this? I could also use ',' as delimiter for the problem of separation of number from alphabet would remain!
1st, get the needed column with split then get the number with regexor using regex alone
