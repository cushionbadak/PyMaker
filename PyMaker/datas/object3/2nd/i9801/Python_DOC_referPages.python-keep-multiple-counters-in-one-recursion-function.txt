I am trying to count the number of python files and non-python files in a path recursively. The few problems I have isI had trouble in keeping multiple counters in one recursion function.Also the return I want is a dictionary format, but I can only do it this way because I have to return it with path.I use  to check if the function is working alright, but it shows a lot more files(the top 7 files) I never seen in my folder, why is this happening?When BTW we have to use recursive function, it is mandatory as the Prof requested.
You don't need to iterate directory recursively yourself. You can use  which yields directories, files for you:You cannot change local variable / argument of caller. How about returns ,  and use in caller like below?Alternatively,  is also available since Python 3.5.
You can pass a dictionary as an argument to the function and change the values of the items in the dictionary. First intialize the dictionary:Then modify it inside the recursive function:This will work because dictionaries are mutable.
This function takes a pathname and returns . It calls itself on each entries in directories. This is meant to be as close to the given code as reasonable.
