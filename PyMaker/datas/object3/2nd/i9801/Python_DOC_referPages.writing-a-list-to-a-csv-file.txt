Natural Text
I've got a piece of code that extracts coordinates from a KML file.  It works beautifully and prints to the screen the way I'd want it to print to a CSV file.  However, when I attempt to write it to a CSV file, the resulting file is empty.  I've tried both the method below and the standard text output method using  and .  All have the same result.Here is the KML I'm using: And the code:****SOLVED****Final working solution is this:I abandoned the csv method and went with a text file output, just renaming to csv.  I end up with the result I need.  Thanks to all that contributed.
The  and  should be happening once, at the beginning of your loop.  As it is now, you are re-creating the file for each item, throwing away the last item.  Edit Now there may be another issue: it looks like  is a string, but  expects a list of items, and fills in the commas between the items automatically.  You might want  instead of  depending on your specific use case.Edit 2 Use  instead of  to get the whole line on one row instead of one character per row.  The brackets make it a list of one item rather than a string, which behaves in this context like a list of its characters, one at a time.
