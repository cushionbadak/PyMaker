My first post here.I'd like to create a search function, searching a list for any raw_input entered.So far, I've been able to call a path on computer and append each item to a list.I know I can list.index() for a complete file name, but I'd like it to search forsimply any character(s) one might want to input.Here's what I've got so far:::Now, with this code, the filename has to be typed in exactly...So, it'll take my path(users/user/temp) and make a list from it, searchthe list for the filename and return the index at which it lies.How can I search for say.. (you) in the list and bring up a result thatmight be (youarewonderful.txt).Thanks, I'm very new to Python, so any insight or code improvements are welcomeas well.-peer
This gives a list of indices:This is called a list comprehension, and it uses the  function to keep track of the indices.  If you aren't familiar with these, I recommend the official python tutorial here
I've got a lead!Next, I added:::Sorry Patrick, this is more along the lines of what I wanted to do.  Thanks anyways!  -although I don't quite get what you were getting at.  I'd like to know, though.Here is completed program, don't know how I got here:::Woo Hoo-peer
