Is it possible to override the  field of a metaclass (i.e. class deriving from ) using a get-set property? The following code works for getting , but not setting it:I've tried a few substitutions for  in the setter function, but none of them work: leads to recursion. gives So, what this boils down to is how to set the  field when it isshadowed by a property on the metaclass. Any ideas?(Yes, I am aware that defining the  property has no effect on the actual  of the class, although that can be arranged by overriding )
 doesn't support data descriptors, only plain descriptors, as only  is implemented.Put differently, the assignmentfails because the  proxy object does not implement the  method, and thus that assignment tries to set  as an attribute on that proxy object.You'd have to manually access the descriptor on the  object:For symmetry's sake, I've used the same manual descriptor access in the getter, although  would work too.Above, I hardcoded  rather than search the MRO; you could also use a helper function to find the right descriptor with a full MRO search:Either way, now you can intercept  being set:
