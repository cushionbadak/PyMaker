Natural Text
I have three python lists:filePathstextToFindtextToReplaceThe lists are always equal lengths and in the correct order.I need to open each file in filePaths, find the line in textToFind, and replace the line with textToReplace.  I have all the code that populates the lists.  I am stuck on making the replacements.  I have tried:How do I iterate over each file to make the text replacements on each line that matches find?
When you need to use the indices of the items in a sequence while iterating over that sequence, use enumerate.Another option would be to use zip, which will give you one item from each sequence in order.Note that for Python 2.x  will produce a new list that can be iterated - so if the sequences you are zipping are huge it will consume memory.  Python 3.x  produces an iterator so it doesn't have that feature.With a normal file object you could read the entire file into a variable and perform the string replacement on the whole file at once.
I might do something like this without more informationIterate over all the file paths, open the file up for reading and a separate one for writing. Store the files lines in a variable as in this code i will be overwriting the original file.  Do your replace, remember if there is nothing to replace python just leaves the line alone. Write the line back to file.
You can read file to some temporary variable, make changes, and then write it back:
