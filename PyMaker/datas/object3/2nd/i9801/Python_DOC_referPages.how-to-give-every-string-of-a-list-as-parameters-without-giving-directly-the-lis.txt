Natural Text
Maybe it's not clear enough, let me explain :I want to write into a csv file, i'm using a list with 3 strings in it for example and i want to give every elements of the list to as .I cannot give directly the list otherwise it will print " ['test1', 'test2', 'test3'] "  in only one cell of the csv file.I was thinking about a for loop maybe, but i'm not a beast with python so any help would be appreciated. Couldn't find any help on the internet.
I guess this will help you.
From the CSV docs, it looks like anything passed to .writerow() that isn't a string (eg., your list) is stringified.Try this?
