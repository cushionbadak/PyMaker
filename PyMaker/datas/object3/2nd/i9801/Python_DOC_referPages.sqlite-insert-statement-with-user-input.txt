Is there such thing as:Basically this statement inserts the borrow item and date, time when the specific user borrows the item.Or  
 accepts parameters, but they follow the SQL template as a tuple.The  placeholder must not be enclosed in quotes ,  will take care of putting them around the value of the string parameter . Edit:But still your SQL will not work because  does not support a  clause, at least when  are given.
