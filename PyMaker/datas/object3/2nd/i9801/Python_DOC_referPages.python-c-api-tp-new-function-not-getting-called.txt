I am developing a new Python data type using type objects. I used the "Defining New Types page for Python 2.7.12" as a guide and was able to adapt the examples on that page to my specific needs. I am able to create my new data type and add it to a Python module. When I run things from Python, I can create a new object like this.In this case, my  function is called and I am able to fill in the default data items the way I want. However, if I try to do the same thing in C++ by calling , my  function doesn't get called. As a workaround I can call  on each data member with no problem. I see the same issue with my  function, where calling  does not result in my  function getting called. I've spent the better part of a day trying to track this thing down with no luck. Any help would be appreciated.
The best way is to call the class object, just like in Python itself.Credit: I just learnt it from this answer.
