I use python for programing, and i wonder how to extract a number by locating a specific word. For example, StoneA weights 10kg moves with speed 20m/s, StoneB weights 30kg moves with speed 40m/s. I know i can use re.findall to extract numbers. But if i just want to extract numbers relate with speed (which is 40 and 20). Is there a way to do it by locating the word "speed" or "m/s"
You can use :Regular expression  captures one or more digits immediately followed by .
