For example:Wanted result:
Three possible approaches:ReadableThis makes it very clear what's going on, but requires four lines and repeated calls to , which is slightly inefficient.ConciseThis is very compact, but for many people it takes a moment or two to remember whether the nesting of multiple- list comprehensions goes left-to-right or right-to-left.LazyThis will work correctly even if  and  are generators or other one-shot, lazily-evaluated iterables, e.g.... which won't work with the first two approaches.Note that I've used  rather than  in these examples, which is the conventional way to name variables in Python.
