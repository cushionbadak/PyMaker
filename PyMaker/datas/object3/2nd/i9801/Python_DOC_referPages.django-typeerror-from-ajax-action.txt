I'm using DjangoTables to display records. I want to use Ajax on a Delete link to delete the relevant Site record (and the Deal records linked to it) without having to refresh the table page.Clicking on 'Delete' deletes the relevant records and vanishes that row of the table as I wanted, but then I get this in my console:That doesn't look good. Why is it there, and how do I make it go away?static .js file:View:Tableurls.pyDetailed console output:
