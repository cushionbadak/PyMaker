I want to make a conditional test for python to check that the value of a given inputted number is equal to or less than 9, and greater than or equal to 0.I get a printed message saying:entered value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 9!Which obviously is wrong, because the entered value is 23. That then suggests to me that the <9 condition has been ignored for some reason. Is there some way for me to have a numerical range with a single if? Or will only a single condition be interpreted per if statement?PS: I am using Python 3.6.0b if that is of any relevance.
""This doesn't work in python.You need to specify the variable twice like this:
You can write
That chained expression isn't doing what you think it does. What you want is:Or if you're not comfortable with chained conditionals you can use the verbose form:The expression:Is the same as Which evaluates to  when  is 23. Reference:Comparisons
input : output:
