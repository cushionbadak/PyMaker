I have a list of lists and I should find the sublist whose second element has the max value.I implemented it as follows, but I would say it's a bit 'suboptimal' :-)and thenThere's a way to accomplish that in a more coincise form?Thank you very much for any hint!ByeFabio
 accepts an optional  parameter;  compares the return value of the  function to determine which one is larger.
Another simple approach using  function:The output:https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#sorted
Here is another option (though not a very efficient one):Find all the sub-lists whose second element has the maximum value:Find the first sub-list whose second element has the maximum value:Split it into two statements in order to improve efficiency:Find all the sub-lists whose second element has the maximum value:Find the first sub-list whose second element has the maximum value:
