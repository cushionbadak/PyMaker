Currently I'm making some small research on wave files using only Python.One problem I can't solve right now, is splitting wav data. format file with 24 bit sound depth correctly.So the basic idea is: given  - start and  -end, and I need to get the , which is quite clear.I think my code is quite straight forward and it works fine with 16 and 8 bits depth sounds, but after I tried 24 - it fails.I take rate and convert it into milliseconds, my Start and End parameters also convert to ms.And after, basis on this calculations, assuming they're right I'm finding start_point in my source audio and then write from this point to the end.What may I do wrong?How to solve this problem, using only Python without any external libraries.Thanks, in advance.
If you could use an external library, I'd recommend the soundfile module, which handles 24-bit files out-of-the-box.If you really want to use pure Python, you should at least use the built-in wave module, which at least takes care of the header for you. You'll still have to convert the raw bytes into something meaningful on your own.It's hard to tell what's going wrong in your case, because you are showing only a part of your code. You should show the code that works for 16 and 8 bit and doesn't work for 24. I don't see any mention of bit depth in your code.It probably helps if you have a look at my tutorial about the  module.
