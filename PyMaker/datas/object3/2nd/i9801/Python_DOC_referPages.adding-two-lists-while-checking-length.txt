I'm stuck on a question where I have to add 2 lists together while factoring in the length. For example, if  and  the answer would be  or . What I have so far is:I'm not really sure how to appraoch this question since I'm new to lists. Would appreciate the help!
You should use  from itertools with a  of  in a list comprehension: pairs the elements in the input lists ( and  here). If one list is smaller, pairs the remainding elements of the larger list with the value supplied as the  (which we assign to  here).Now,  equals:Similarly, you could utilize  instead of the list-comp:and get the same result for .
Poor man's approach:
I would use the  solution too, but building in your code this is what I would dofirst make sure that the first list is the longest, and if that is not the case exchange them, then make a copy of longest list and finally add the elements of the shorter list position-wise to the copy and return it
Although  is more neat, another possibility is to use a trial/error approach (if you are tired of "ifs"), as shown here:
Documentation on :Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with . Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.Here's the code:Output:
