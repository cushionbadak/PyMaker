I have a multiple instances of a class. I consider two classes equal, when a certain attribute matches.All instances are in an array . I now create a new instance of said class . When I do  it ofc outputs .My question is: How is membership checked when using ? Is it normal comparison (which means I can use  in my class to implement the equality of classes)? If not: How can I achieve that  matches if a certain attribute of a class equals?

From the docs:For user-defined classes which define the  method,  is true if and only if  is true.For user-defined classes which do not define  but do define , x in y is true if some value z with  is produced while iterating over y. If an exception is raised during the iteration, it is as if in raised that exception.Lastly, the old-style iteration protocol is tried: if a class defines , x in y is true if and only if there is a non-negative integer index i such that , and all lower integer indices do not raise  exception. (If any other exception is raised, it is as if in raised that exception).
Behavior of  is based on the  method. Let us see with an example:Now when you do  on m you can see 'Hello' printedAs per the  document:For objects that donâ€™t define , the membership test first tries iteration via , then the old sequence iteration protocol via , see this section in the language reference.
