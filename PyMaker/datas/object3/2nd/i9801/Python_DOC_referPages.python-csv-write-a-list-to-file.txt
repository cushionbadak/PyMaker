With the formatting you have in , you can just write it to a file:To properly use ,  should just be lists of the columns and let the  module do the formatting with tabs and newlines:Note that  will automatically close the file.See the csv documentation for the correct way to open a file for use with  or .

If you have built/joined the strings in  manually, you can omit that step and just pass the original data structure to .
The  parameterThe  parameter controls the delimiter in the output. It has nothing to do with the input .Why your output is garbled iterates the input. In your case you are giving it a string (, etc.), therefore the function iterates the string, giving you a sequence of chars.How to produce the correct outputGive it a list of fields instead of the full string by using . In your case the string ends with , so use  as well:This should be what you want:Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
