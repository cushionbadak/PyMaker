I've the following code in python: What am I doing here? Am I multiplying an array and a number? What is the result?I saw this topic:What does asterisk * mean in Python?But I guess it's not related.
The operators in Python are magic.  They invoke special methods depending on the class of the operand.  In this case a special method called  is called from the  class, since a list object is on the left-side.In the case of a list, the list is repeated by the number of times given on the right (the parentheses are meaningless in this case).  Tuple and string () objects can be multiplied in a similar way.If you want to see what the special methods are, and their corresponding operators, see the  module documentation.By the way, you use the term array, which is understandable coming from other languages.  However  does not create an array, but a  object.  That might sound like semantics, but arrays do exist in python, but they have a specialised use.  There is an array module in the standard library, and the  module also has arrays, see here.  For everyday use though,  is the norm.
if you run the code  you get . Similarly, if you run  you get . So the asterisk is repeating/multiplying the list. 
You're making, and concatenating, six copies of the list. I.e.
