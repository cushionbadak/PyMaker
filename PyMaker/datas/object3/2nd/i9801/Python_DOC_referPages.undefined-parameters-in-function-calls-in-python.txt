Whenever I program something in python with , the code looks like this:My problem is, I don't really understand why  or  is working: I didn't define the parameters , ,  and . Looking at the code in the  - module, the functions expect a paramter called  or . I know how to use them (at least well enough to develop some small applications), but I don't know how to define a function which uses this parameters. I feel like I don't know really much about this part of python, though I can work with it.So my Question is:how can I define a function, what is called with the following Syntax:I don't need to know how to make a function what accepts a varying amount of parameters (combined with my problem), but it would be fine too.
What you are referring to are called keyword arguments. Arguably one of the best ways to define a function with specific keyword arguments is to provide defaults. It's common for the default to be  if you don't have the need for any other default:You can then call this function like so:You can also do what tkinter functions do, and accept  as a parameter. This gathers up all named arguments into a dictionary that you can then iterate over:Note: you don't have to use the name  -- you can use any name you want (, , ), but  seems to be the most common.
