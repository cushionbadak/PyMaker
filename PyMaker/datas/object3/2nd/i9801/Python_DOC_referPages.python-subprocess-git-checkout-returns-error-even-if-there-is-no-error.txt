I am writing a script to automate some GIT tasks. I know about GITPython but I prefer not using that. Even tough it may be easier.I got the following piece of code:This piece of code given the command  does indeed checkout the master. BUT it will stop executing, apparently because the error variable is not empty. I tried to print the outputs on error which is the following:As you can see, it succesfully checked out the master branch (Also verified by ). But why is the second line filled in the error variable? How to handle this? Or is there no way of correctly handling this? Or should i not do any error checking? What is the best solution/explaination for this?Thanks!
Its not an error ! its the output on stderr :)If you are on a linux terminal, you can test this by running the followingAccording to subprocess docs communicate() returns a tuple (stdoutdata, stderrdata)i.e. the output on stdout and stderr. If you want to check for errors, you should use the  attribute.in your case
algrebe answer is the right answer for your question, but this might help you.Idea is to use try-except for execution and poll for checking if error occured.With some error handling and format of response (git returns string with \n character for new line and that's how it's written in console) you get generic function that handles all git commands.edit for comment: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments
