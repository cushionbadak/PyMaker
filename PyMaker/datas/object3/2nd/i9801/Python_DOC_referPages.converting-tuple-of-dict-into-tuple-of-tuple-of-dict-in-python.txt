I have query resultset data in format of tuple of dict. I want to group the data into tuple of tuple of dict based on specific condition.Real Output:Expected output: Here we are grouping base on yearPlease guide us to get the data, while we are processing the query instead of processing one by one records and converting into specific formate.
You can sort the dicts based on the year and then use  with year as : will group the consecutive elements with same key and return  tuples. Then each iterable is converted to tuple within generator expression which is given as a parameter to . Update: The above one-liner has O(n log n) time complexity since it sorts the data. With couple more lines the task can be completed O(n) time by utilizing :Note that this will return the groups in arbitrary order since  is unordered collection. If you need to process the data in "full" groups (only one group for each year) and you can't get the DB to return the data in sorted order this is the best you can do.In case you can get the data from DB by batches in sorted order then you can still use  without needing to pull everything before:Output:
