Natural Text
I want to create a program which will save data to a text file and it should create a text file everytime my program runs.is there any way to do this.
You can try something like this:This is the simplest possible script which will create a file and write  in it, when you run it. But this is very primitive way of working with files. There is another way which is considered as a best practice while working with files. And it is to use  context manager as below: As you can see, it is shorter, cleaner and it lacks  part because the  context manager does it for you, so you don't need to bother about closing files.
