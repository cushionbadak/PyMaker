I have a dictionary in python that contains unicode values in it. I want to calculate the md5 sum of this dictionary. I tried to use the answer to this question:Computing an md5 hash of a data structureBut the problem is that  returns this error:
The  library seems not to support unicode objects (anyway, it's written for Python 2, and I'm guessing you're using Python 3).  How about using the built-in  module?
