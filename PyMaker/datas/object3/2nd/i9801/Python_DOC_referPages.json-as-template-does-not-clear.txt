I'm importing a JSON file and using it as a template over which I modify some of the properties. isn't pulling the template  fresh through each iteration of the loop. (I'm able to pull old, modified values from previous iterations in  in the "modify properties here" area.) My understanding is that  points to  rather than serving as a copy but  doesn't appear to do the trick either, nor does . What is the correct command/way to empty this variable and pull the template fresh after each iteration? What is the most efficient way to handle this?
Since JSON is usually structured as nested objects, you would need to use .
