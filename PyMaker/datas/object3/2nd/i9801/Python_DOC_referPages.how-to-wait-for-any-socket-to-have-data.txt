I'm implementing a socket-client which opens several sockets at the same time. Any socket may have data at a different time and I want to execute code when any socket has data and is readable.I'm not sure how to implement this, I was looking at select.select but it seems to wait for all the sockets to be readable.I'd like to avoid using multiprocessing to handle data on the sockets, I would like it to be serial in reading from each socket but read when there is data available.How do I wait for any socket to be readable?
You can use  for your problem:
If you are on POSIX, take a look at :
If you're using Python 3.4 or newer there is the  module in the standard library. It will use the "best" I/O multiplexing implementation that your system offers (select, poll, kqueue...) There's a simple echo server example at the end of the documentation page https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.htmlThere's a backport of this for older Python versions available as well.
