I am trying to make a calculator that determines whether the user can vote after entering their date of birth. I have tried using some other posts to get where I am currently but I am now stuck.I have this error: And my code is:Any help you can give would be great, thanks!
 is a Python  and cannot be compared with an int directly. is the integer representation of the number of days. This can be compared to another integer.It's worth noting that this does not include nor account for leap years, nor does it actually determine whether you can vote, as it takes the current time, rather than your age at a certain cutoff date. Additional avenues for improvement.
Try this:    from datetime import date
 is an object:To get the total seconds, for example:To get the days:To see the attributes and methods of an object like  just do 
Why dont you make things simple and just subtract the age(year only) from the current year? See below how to get current year only:
The issue is your variable  is not simply the integer number of days. Please refer to here to learn more about the datatype.The solution to your problem is choosing the correct attribute. Long story short:should resolve your immediate issue. Also it would be good practice to use variables to represent 6570 or at least make it clear what that number is (18 years * 365 days) in some way.
