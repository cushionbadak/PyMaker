I am currently doing an experiment on a dataset using differential privacy concepts. So, I am trying to implement one of the mechanisms of differential privacy namely Laplace mechanisms using a sample dataset from  UCI Machine Repository and python programming language.Let's assume that we have simple counting query where we want to know the number of people who earns '<=50k' which are grouped by their 'occupation' and this is the Laplace function I am trying to use So, my question is how could I apply the function against the the data I got if we take , I know that Laplace Mechanism works by adding a random noise from the la place distribution to the true answer we get from the query. A bit of insight would be appreciated...
Assuming you have already loaded the csv from the link into a database to conduct the sql query, you can apply your Laplacian function by first loading the results of the query into a pandas dataframe using :Then you can apply your function using  using  to pass in your epsilon:The above would obviously replace the  column with the adjusted values, you could choose to keep the new series separate, attach them to the dataframe as a new column with a different name, or clone the dataframe first to keep the old dataframe around too.
