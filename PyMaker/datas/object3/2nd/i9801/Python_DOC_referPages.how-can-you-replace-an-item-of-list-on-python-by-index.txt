For whatever reason (I should be  using JS), I am using Python to create an encryption/decryption program. In the encryption program, spaces are carrots (^). In the decryption program I have:When given the string "^^^", the output is... "TypeError: list indices must be integers, not Unicode". All I'm looking for is a function or statement.
you are iterating over the list element, but later you are using the element as an index where you need an integer instead. seems like what you want should be as belowORbetter way can just use  method
this code is iteration all the elements in the list, not index.try to use replace for string. no need to convert to list
please do like this
Focusing on error you are getting,You can using character for list indexing, if you need to mutate string you should use enumerate,
