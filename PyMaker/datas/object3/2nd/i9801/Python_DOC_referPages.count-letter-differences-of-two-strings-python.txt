I'm having some problems with an exercise about strings in python.I have 2 different lists:and I need to compare those 2 lists according to their position so the 1 letter together, then the 2...using the min length (so here length of list1) and store the letters in a new variable according to if they are different or the same.I tried to code something and it seems to find the same ones, but doesn't work on the different ones since it copies them multiple times.I would appreciate some help. Thanks.EDIT: Output result should be something like this:The thing is that the letter A is only shown on identicals but not in different even if F!=A.
You are getting unwanted duplicates because you have a nested pair of  loops, so each item in  get tested for every item in . The key idea is to iterate over the two strings in parallel. You can do that with the built-in  function, which yields a tuple of the corresponding items from each iterable you feed it, stopping as soon as one of the iterables runs out of items.From your example code, it looks like you want to take the items for the  list from the longer string. To do that efficiently, figure out which string is the longer before you start looping.I've renamed your strings because it's confusing to give strings a name starting with "list".outputWe can make the  loop more compact at the expense of readability. We put our destination lists into a tuple and then use the equality test to select which list in that tuple to append to. This works because  has a numeric value of 0, and  has a numeric value of 1.
The problem is the inner loop. You are comparing each of the letters in list1 with all the letters of list2.Instead you should have a single loop:
