Say i want to doMy question is, how could i run subprocess.call(["foo"]) every x seconds, then kill the process, then repeat x seconds later?
To run a command every x seconds you can use a infinite loop and If you don't know how to stop the process I recommend  you to check https://stackoverflow.com/a/4791612/2588566If you just want the process to run x time sleeping use a  loop instead.I don't know what command you want to run. In this example you run a python server serving files in the current dir. It start the process, keep it running for 10 seconds, then kill the process and waits 5 seconds (So you can check it has been stopped). So you have a server running 10 seconds and a gap of 5 seconds between each execution.
 does not return until the process  finishes.Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return the returncode attribute.Use  instead.
There is a system of instructions can be done. Code does not need to set the cycle, starting from the main function, the implementation of the output and rest, and then restart the process
