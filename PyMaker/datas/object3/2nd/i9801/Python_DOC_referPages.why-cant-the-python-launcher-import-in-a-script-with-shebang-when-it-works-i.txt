Here's the kicker, though: it works in scripts without the shebang line.For example, this script works:But this one doesn't:Why is this? What difference is the shebang making here?
The  launcher actually handles shebang lines even on Windows. This means the Python version a script is run in may differ depending on the shebang line. For example, a shebang line of  will always run Python 2, and  will always run Python 3. Without a shebang line,  pretends the shebang is , which it handles using its built-in rules for selecting a Python version (see the Python Version Qualifiers section).

If the shebang is specifically ,  instead follows the PATH environment variable to mimic the behavior of Linux's
