I've followed several tutorials with exact instructions and pip isn't working no matter what I do. I am on Windows 7 trying to install PIP on the latest version of Python. Any idea what I can do to fix this? All the tutorials I can find are outdated and dont provide a lot of information.
@eryksun is right, you haven't installed  correctly, and there shouldn't normally be any  in .It looks like the PIP bootstrap script (I dunno what it's doing or how it got there): that script does have  on line  in a function named .So, eitherdelete it and run , ormove it out of Python installation and run it as a standalone script as per its docs.
