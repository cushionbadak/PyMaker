I am creating a wrapper around a few python scripts and have run into a slight issue when there are multiple versions of python installed on the computer.  For example on my Mac there is python 2.7 accessible via "python" at the command line and python 3.4 available "python3".  Is there anyway to determine how the current python instance was started so that I can be sure the subprocess will be using the right version?The above code will not execute properly on my computer but on a computer with only python 3.4 installed it works fine.  Changing the argArray to use python3 works on my computer but breaks it on others.  
To get the executable used to launch the current Python interpreter, read . It's the absolute path to the Python interpreter binary currently running (though it can be the empty string or  in weird cases, like frozen executables and the like).
The version of Python being executed can be checked via :The  attribute is available in all Python versions >= 2.0.If you require a certain version, you can add a check in your module:
