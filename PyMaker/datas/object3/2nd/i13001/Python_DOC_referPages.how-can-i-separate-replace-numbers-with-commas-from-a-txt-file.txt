Natural Text
I need some advice and suggestion on how to substitute commas with dots and separate numbers. I explain well. this is what I got from a file:12,1899995803833,0,135000005364418,0,058296699076890913,0600004196167,0,141000002622604,0,098975196480751My problem is that the first of all I need to replace SOME commas with a dot, in particular I need to replace the first, third, fifht comma and leave the second and fourth. Then I need to reduce the number of significative numbers and put a tab, as following:12.18,         0.13,         0.0513.06,         0.14,         0.09As you can see the two raws are different in lenght, so I can't change the element at a specific position.I thought about creating a single string for each raw, and then after looking at the average position assign a range. For example, the first comma is always the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th character. So I can say "Ã¯f in this position range there is a , change it to ."But this is not the case of the others comma, because the difference can be very big, for example 29,3099994659424,0,521000027656555,2,4002988338470529,75,0,531000018119812,2,46150183677673(and this is what I want to have:29.30,         0.52,         2.4029.75,         0.53,         2.46)I thought to run the programme more than 1 time, so first I substitute the first comma and eliminate all the numbers after the second digit, then I do the  same for the other 2 columns but it seems very long (I have many txt files). Other ways could be:-assigning a true/false value to each comma and then iterate whit a for cycle-divide all the number in list and then taking numbers on 1-3-5 position calling them int, the ones on 2-4-6 calling them dec and by using the write text function, write directly int,decMay I use the regex? Do you know a more elegant way of the two I am working on?Also, can you sketch how to set up the program?  I did a course on programming in Jython some years ago at university but I don't remember really a lot.Thanks everyone!
Maybe there's a more elegant way, but I tried looping over the 'rows' then splitting each row on commas, then dealing with the pieces in pairs:In Python  uses the formatting 'minilanguage'. You can do all sorts of things with it. This gives:You could also use  directly as an array of floats, e.g. in NumPy.
Use  from the standard library to achieve the alternating substitution of ',' to '.' on each line.  As example:would produce the following using the list comprehension:I have nothing further to add on the formatting beyond what @kwinkunks provided.  Building on his answer you could convert the  list of lists into a printable string by doing the following:
