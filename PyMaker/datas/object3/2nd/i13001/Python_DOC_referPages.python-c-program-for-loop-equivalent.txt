I was using the following  loop in my C program:What would be the python equivalent for the second  loop, ()? I tried the following but there is an error:How to do it?
If you're trying to get the actual index values for some reason (and/or need to control the inner loop separate from the outer), you'd do:But if what you really want is unique non-repeating pairings of the elements, there is a better way, :That gets the values, not the indices, but usually, that what you really wanted. If you really need indices too, you can mix with :Which gets the exact index pattern you're looking for, as well as the values. You can also use it to efficiently produce the indices alone as a single loop with:Short answer:  is magical for stuff like this.
If you're really just interested in the indexes, you can use  rather than .
