You can easily capture standard output by just temporarily redirecting  to a  object, as follows:The output of this program is:showing that the redirection successfully captured the output and that you were able to restore the output stream to what it was before you began the capture.Note that the code above in for Python 2.7, as the question indicates. Python 3 is slightly different:
This Python 3 answer uses . It also uses a reusable helper method , although this helper is specific to the function being tested.Note that the  arg is passed automatically by the  decorator to the  method.A general-purpose  class, possibly a mixin, can in principle be derived from the above.For those using Python â‰¥3.4,  also exists, but it seems to serve no benefit over .
