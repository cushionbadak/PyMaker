Is there a simple way to convert to the following recursive structure, where each following tuple is appended as an element of the prior tupleWhat is the limit to this nesting? Can I have a 1000 or 10000 such nested tuples?UPDATE: It seems  nesting is unlimited (tried with 10000 after setting recursion limit to 100).On Window 7, Python 3.5) the recursion limit is around 300 at first, but can be lifted as (reference). This is not related to structure , but may be related to Python routine accessing nested levels of the resulting structure.
You could dowhich iterates backward through . You can probably construct a very deeply nested tuple, but you might have trouble printing it out.
Using :
For the nested construction:for how big it can be, I don't know but I would assume it depends on your machine, your settings and so on...
