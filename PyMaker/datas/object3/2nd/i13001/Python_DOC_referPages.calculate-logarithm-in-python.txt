Natural Text
I am wondering why the result of  in python = 0.405465108108 while the real answer = 0.176091259.This is the code that I wrote:Can someone tell how to solve this issue?
From the documentation:With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e).With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as .But the log10 is made available as , which does not resort to log division if possible.
Use the log10 function in the math module.
The  function is to the base , i.e. natural logarithm. If you want to the base 10 use .
If you use log without base it uses .From the commentReturn the logarithm of x to the given base.  If the base not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.Therefor you have to use:
