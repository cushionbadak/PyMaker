Im trying to produce a table with one row with numbers increasing by one and another with the respective composites with the limit being 100 like: is a permanent list that starts off as 2-100 I whittle down as I pull out every composite number within the function, at the end it should only contain prime numbers. is a list I fill with composites of a certain number (2,3,4 etc) that I then wish to check with the current  list to make sure there are no duplicates.  I print whats left, empty the list and increase the current variable by 1 and repeat.This is the coding ive come up with, I understand its very sloppy but I literally know nothing about the subject and my professor likes us to learn trial by fire and this is what ive managed to scrounge up from the textbook.  The main issue of my concern is the adding and removing of elements from certain lists
I think I'm understanding your description correctly, and this is what I came up with.I used a  to keep track of the number you have added to the composites already. This makes the problem pretty simple. Also, advice when writing functions is to not overwrite your parameters. For example, in , you are doing  and  several times. Sample OutputPrimes
