Natural Text
I am writing a program which saves the last 3 scores in a text file for each user of my game. I have already written the code that saves it I am now bringing the data back into the program which will work out the users high scores . I also already have the scores saved in separate lists All users 1st score saved in 1 list all users 2nd score in another and the same for 3rd score. I am trying to put these in their own high score list so when I joint the lists with the names(in another list) I will be able to sort by score but will be attached to name. Bellow is the code I have written:By the way it is in a for loop for i in range 2 as their are currently only 2 users. I know I'm being incredibly stupid by having the or as it means only one event needs to be true for it to work but when I tried and it didn't work either. Please work along these lines as my tutor said 'I had the right idea' I also hope this helps anyone else which is comparing list items with integers in python as I couldn't find anything on the internet . Thanks,I await guidance
You want to use , not .You can also use  syntax instead of using .What you should really do is use Python's built-in  function. A clean, single-liner instead of that 6-line  block.
Probably not allowed for this assignment, but for others who need to do something similar, the easy/fast way to select the top 3 values from a large sequence of values is to use . If you have multiple sequences, you can  them to avoid concatenating (avoid increases in peak memory usage). You can even attach the names (with  and ) to each input sequence so the selected high scores include the associated user: would then be a  with three elements (from highest to lowest score, ties broken by user name), each element being a  of the form .
