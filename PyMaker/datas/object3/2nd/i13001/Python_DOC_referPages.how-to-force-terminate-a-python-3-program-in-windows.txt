I am running Python 3 code in a windows Command line prompt. The program has an infinite loop that I use. (While (1))Sounds like bad design but it's meant to be like this. Is there a way to force close the program without having to close the command prompt. In the terminal, Ctrl + C often works for this. 
You can use  or .https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exithttps://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit
Ctrl-C generates KeyboardInterrupt Exception, so unless you blindly catch all exceptions and ignore them, it should do just that. (If you do catch all, can add an exception for KeyboardInterrupt). Interestingly, this does not work for me because I am using Cygwin.You can force-terminate the program using task manager. However, if you have more than one python process running, this can be tricky. To do this, have your process print PID in the first lines of the log file (you do have a log file, right?)To see process: tasklist /FI "PID eq 1234"To kill process: taskkill /PID 1234 /FAdvanced process interruption:Have your program wait for command on a socket.
