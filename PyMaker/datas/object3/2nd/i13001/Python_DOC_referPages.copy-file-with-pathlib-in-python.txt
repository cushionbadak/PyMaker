I try to copy a file with I get this exception:... how to copy file with pathlib in Python 2.7?
So what about this?The problem is  create a  object if you're using Unix/Linux,  if you're using Microsoft Windows.But  need string as arguments. So just use  here, when you use  function on a  object it will return the original path.
The cause for  not working is that you are not using the latest Python, Python 3.6  can handle  objects (or subclasses thereof). That for older versions of Python this throws an error is because those implementations of  expect string arguments for , and not  type arguments. What you actually want to be able to write is:You can subclass Path to include such a method, and adapt the creation of . I find it easier to just graft/monkey-patch/duck-punch it on the existing You can put this code anywhere you like, as long as it gets executed before calling the  method on any of the  instances. The argument to  can be a file or a directory.
Since Python 3.5, without importing , you can do:For Python 2.7,  provides the , ,  and  methods.The file will be loaded in memory, so this method is not suitable for files larger than the machines available memory.As per the comments, one can use  and  to copy text files, but if you need to deal with the encoding at copy time  an  present the advantage of two extra parameters: is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handledThey both have the same meaning as in .
You can use pathlib rename method instead of shutil.move().
