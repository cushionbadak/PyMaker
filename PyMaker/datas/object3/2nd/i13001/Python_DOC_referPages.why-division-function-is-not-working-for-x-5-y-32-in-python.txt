When I testing division with  x = 5 , y = 32 so, division function does not working.This is impossible: '1/0' , in that I added 'try & except' after it 'return float(x) / float(y)' not  working.Where I'm doing wrong in this code? I'm beginner in Python. 
There's a few bugs you need to fix here. First of all you overwrite the parameters in the division function:Then in this line:If x is not 0 this is true because the  operation will return true if any of the conditions are true. So for example if you have x = 1 and y = 0 you still perform the invalid division. You could fix this by checking just for .A much better way to do this would just be to let python do the division and catch the ZeroDivisionError that is raised if you attempt to make an invalid division:This is much more in line with the overall Python philosophy of "Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission".
