I want to do something like this:what I want is that when I perform I can get the object a that use this method by its attribute b.I can't pass any new variable to the function because this in implementation is a class written by other people that changing the input variables means changing a lot of stuff.Can anyone help?
Since it seems that you construct the  instance within the  constructor, then give your  instance a reference to the  instance:It is possible under certain Python implementations to sometimes find an instance using the , but as the documentation says, using it should be avoided "for any purpose other than debugging.":The first  call will find among others, the  of the  instance; this would probably be of type ; we then go through all the objects of the dictionaries referring to , and if any of these is of type , and it has attribute  whose value , we return that object.Thus the clause  shall print true.But seriously, don't use this code.
