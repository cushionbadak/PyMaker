I really need some help with this code. I have to write code using the input file , containing dates in the form , read all lines into a list, find the earliest and the latest dates and print, then transform the date string into the form  and print all dates. I have written the code and it's working fine, but I don't know how to transform the date into the form .What your told me, I have do that, but it not working. What if i want to read it from a txt file name , that already have all the dates in it. For example, if you look at my code, I create a value returning function called , and then I  it and open the , file and read all the dates from the txt file.Here Iis what I have so far. I have have create a create a function called  and also I have define the function. But when I run the code it give me a error message.. Here is the error it's giving me
Use datetime:Prints:You can use a datetime date for max and min as well:While I am using  in the example, that could be another source -- such as a file. In the case where you have YYYY/MM/DD as digits in a string, you can also just use lexicographical sorting to determine min/max as well:If you need to convert or validate a date, use datetime.
