Natural Text
I am trying to create two programs one that writes the data to file golf.txt and the second which reads the records from golf.txt and displays them.  The first program I am trying to get the program to quit when you leave the input field blank.  Here's my code for the first program.With the second program I can't get the program to display the output I want on one line.  Here's the second program.Any help or suggestions I can get would be greatly appreciated.
Two main problems:1.) you first code has  which is wrong in two ways: is a function. you already saved the input so you should be comparing with  and . returns a  when you dont input anything, not a .so change to:  or even  (does the same things)2.)  will automatically read EVERYTHING in the file as one string. You want to split it into each component so you can either do something like:orthen print (with leading and trailing spaces in your middle string!)
Got both programs working program 1:program 2:
Eliminate spaces from the  before checking (I would use  method). And compare it to the empty string  instead of space(s) .
With the "while true" block you keep asking and taking the names and the scores, but you overwrite them so you always will have just the last pair.You need to keep them all, so you can make a list:The second program opens the file, read lines one by one, splits them and print:
