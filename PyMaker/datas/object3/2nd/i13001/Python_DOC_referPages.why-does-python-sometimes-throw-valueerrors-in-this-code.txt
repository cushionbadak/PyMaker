I have some Python 3.5 code that looks approximately like this:I am trying to follow the principle described in the python subprocess documentation here, namely that in the case of a TimeoutError, I should kill the process manually, then complete the communication.In principle that sounds fine, but periodically (maybe every 1 in 50 times, very approximately), I get an error like this:Line 125 is the second  line in my case.It would appear that this is failing because some stream underlying the process object has closed or terminated - perhaps sometimes by chance this happens between the  and the ?. But if so, is there a graceful way I should be handling this? The Python docs don't appear to cover this case.
To workaround  raising  in the exception handler, you could read from the streams directly (simpler code path -- don't use it in the general case):On Python 3.5, you could use :Though it handles  the same way as your code and therefore you can get  anyway. If you get  with this code; report the issue at http://bugs.python.org
