Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Python: replace terms in a string except for the last                    3 answers                Suppose I have this piece of text:I want all but the last  to be replaced with a comma:Is there an easy way to do that in regex? As far as I know, the  method in regex replaces the strings all the way through. 
 method has a  argument:Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.Then, use  to check how many  in the string and then  (because you need the last ):Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range . Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.Demo:
If you want a regex solution, you could match all the s which are followed by another one later in the string.... is a lookahead which makes sure there is a match later in the string without including it in the actual match (so also not in the substitution).  It's sort of like a conditional on the match.
