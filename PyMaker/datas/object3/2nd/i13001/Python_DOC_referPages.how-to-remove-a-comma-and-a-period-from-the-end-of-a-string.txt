I have a paragraph such as this:Shank spare ribs ball tip, frankfurter alcatra rump pancetta picanha  beef ribs biltong pig venison chicken ham hock. T-bone beef ribs  chicken pork jerky tenderloin andouille turducken kevin short ribs.  Drumstick bacon short loin, chicken turducken leberkas chuck swine  pork belly doner biltong ham hock. Swine hamburger tenderloin meatloaf  prosciutto pancetta meatball tongue drumstick ham hock. Meatball  bresaola landjaeger doner brisket pork belly pancetta spare ribs  corned beef tenderloin bacon fatback pork loin boudin rump kevin  andouille beef ham capicola biltong. Pork chop corned beef swine  turkey, prosciutto biltong kielbasa short loin ground round cupim  shoulder.And I need to write a code that will find out how many times a certain word is said. I can't figure out how to delete the commas and periods that are next to those words! Here is what I have so far:

you can do this with Counter pretty easily:
There are several things that may help. First, :Note not passing a parameter to :If the optional second argument sep is absent or None, the words are separated by arbitrary strings of whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, return, formfeed).Next, instead of , you could use  to count each word's occurrences:Another option over  is a simple regex:Finally, as part of your question exactly, you can use  to strip characters from the end of strings:
You can just split your string by the occurrences of non word character except those between expression like  in "T-bone"  using DEMOBut if what you want is remove only commas and period the following will work fine:
