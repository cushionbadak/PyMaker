The Python code below lets me read the file size.But given the following conditions:I know the drive name;There is only one file inside the folder;I know the file extension;I don't know the file name (or I know only certain letters);I don't know the folder name (or I know only certain letters);Can you help me build the code to find the size of the file?
As stated by tmoreau, you can use the glob modulehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.globIf you only want to match one file you can try :of course you will have to adapt the glob_pattern according to what you know of the directory names.
