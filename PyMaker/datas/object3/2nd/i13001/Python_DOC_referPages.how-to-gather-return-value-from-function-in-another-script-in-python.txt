Due to the guidelines I cannot import  into . I want to be able to store the value returned by  from  in a variable in. I learned that with subprocess I can run the Is there a way to go about this? Edit: The reason why  cannot be imported to  is that there are many test scripts like  which keeps on changing according to test. The  is supposed to be a generic framework which has basic functions to evaluate the test passed or failed by reading the return value from (the return value is ). If I import the script in the top of the file it will not be generic anymore, I think. I'm open to other suggestions.Why the downvotes?
You could use subprocess.check_output to get the output written by another scriptthe file "b.py" writes its output to stdout the file "a.py" executes "b.py" as subprocessNote: value returned by check_output is a byte array and should be decoded to convert it to stringExecuting "a.py" from command line Disclaimer: This is the simplest solution for the given (for training) problem (not the best). Technically I am printing the output to stdout and capturing it in parent process. To solve the same on a more serious problem mechanism such as IPC, RPC, etc should be used.
If you can't use  statement; you could use  instead, to get the return value from  function:
The simplest way is probably to drop the return value into a file, then have your main pick it up.Note that I included  when reading to prevent you from picking up any trailing new line. Also keep in mind that this will work as written if both python files are in teh same directory.  If they differ in location, you will need to specify a path to  in the open statements.
