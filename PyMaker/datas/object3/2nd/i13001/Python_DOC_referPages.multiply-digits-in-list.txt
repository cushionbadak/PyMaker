Let's say we have list of numbers and we want to multiply all numbers in it as long as product is digit.For Example:Can I somehow use  here? What's pythonic way to solve this problem?
This can be solved easily by a simple stateful algorithm:While there is an equivalent functional way (with ), that will not be as simple since you either need to reassemble the result list in each step, or carry the current number value separately.
This might do the trick:
This is better I guess:
