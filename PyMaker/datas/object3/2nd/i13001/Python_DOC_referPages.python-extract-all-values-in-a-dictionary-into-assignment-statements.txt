For a dictionary , what is the most efficient way to assign the strings to their definitions:When no assignment statements are used, I need to call the entry with the dictionary, eg. , but I don't plan to use this.Note: Thanks for pointing out that it was a string. However, I am now assigning the string terms to their corresponding values in the dictionary.

Not the most pretty way, but it works.(Or use locals(), but Colin beat me to it)
