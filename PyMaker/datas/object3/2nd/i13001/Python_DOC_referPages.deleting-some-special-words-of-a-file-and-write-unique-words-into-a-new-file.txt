Natural Text
I have 2 files, one is a text file containing some sentences. The other is a file which contains the words I want to delete them from the file. first I have to omit the special words, and then write the unique words into a new file, each word in a line. here is the code I wrote. but it doesn't work. in simple words I want to omit some words first then find unique words.I know that's basic, but I'm new in programming. 
Welcome to programming! It's a fun world here :). I hope the answer below will help you.Firstly, you are looking to get every unique word. Here, the  object may be useful for you. Using the , you can iterate over every word and add it to the set, without worrying about duplicates.From my understanding of your code, you want to find the difference between the  and the , and then write that to disk. Since you are only interested in unique words, and not worried about the counts, then  can come to your rescue again.Here, the  operation simplifies the need to iterate over the new words. You can do likewise for .Finally, you want to take the difference between two sets, which is also available in Python. To do that, you either will be looking for:words in  that are absent in , orwords in  that are absent in .In the first case, you would do:In the second case, you would do:More documentation on sets can be found here on the Python docs. I would encourage you to use Python 3 rather than 2, which I see you are, so keep sticking with it!To write to disk, with each word on a new line, you can do the following:Currently, you have the following code pattern:I might suggest that you do, instead:In this way, you don't need to explicitly open and close the file; the "with open" line can automatically take care of that for you.I believe the rest of your code is correct, for reading and writing information from and to the disk.If you could update your question to include more detail on errors that are cropping up, that would really help! Finally, whatever answer you find most useful here, don't forget to upvote/accept it (it doesn't have to be mine, I'm happy to simply add to the corpus of information and help around here).
