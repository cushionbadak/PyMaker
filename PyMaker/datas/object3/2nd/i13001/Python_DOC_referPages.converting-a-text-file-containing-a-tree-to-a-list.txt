Natural Text
I am doing a project for school and in order to even get started I have to find a way to convert a line in a text file to list. I know how to do this normally (for example if I'm given 1 2 3 4 5 6) but the text file I given is a binaryTree (including the characters '[' and ','). The actual text file is below.Whenever I do this the way I would for 1 2 3 4 5 6 and call myList[0] I do not get the root 3 (for the tree in the first line) but instead the call returns the fist bracket '['. Can some one please show my the method to convert each line above to a multi-deminial list of represent a tree.
You can use  to turn strings into other built-in data types:
