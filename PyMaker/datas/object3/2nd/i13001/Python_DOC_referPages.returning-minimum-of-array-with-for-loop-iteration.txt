I received this line of code that I'm having trouble understanding syntactically.What I know so far is that  and  are both arrays of integers and that  is also an integer. From my understanding, the  function requires an iterable or two arguments, so I don't quite understand what values are being compared in the  function. 
Letâ€™s disect this line!The core part of this is the following list comprehension:List comprehensions are a way to create a list by looping over some sequence. In this case, we are creating a list with elements of the value  for each  in the  list if the value of  is lower or equal to .So in other words, it selects those coins which are lower than the price, and then for each of those, it gets an element from  with the difference of the price and coin as the index.Finally, that list is passed to  which just returns the element from the list with the lowest value. That value is then incremented by one and returned from the function.You could write this all in a very verbose multi-line code like this:
Your code:has a list comprehension which is equivalent to:
