It's my first time writing here, so I hope I'm doing everything all right.I'm using python 3.5 on Win10, and I'm trying to "sync" music from Itunes to my Android device. Basically, I'm reading the Itunes Library XML file and getting all the files location ( so I can copy/paste them into my phone ) but I have problems with songs containing foreign characters.Output: How should I handle that "&amp;" in the file name?
There are a couple of related issues in your code e.g., unescaped xml character references, hardcoded character encodings cause by using regular expressions to parse xml. To fix them, use  parser such as  or use a more specific  library (I haven't tried it).
