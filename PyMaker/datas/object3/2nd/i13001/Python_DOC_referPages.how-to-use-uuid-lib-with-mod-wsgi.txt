This is the traceback:Not sure where the problem lies... has the uuid.py lib a bug?
uuid is bundled with python since version 2.5, see docs, you should not install it in your virtual environment.There is no need to install it.
After wrestling with this today, what solved it for me was actually Daniel Roseman's comment.If you're getting this error in Python 3, it's because you've inadvertently installed the  Python 2 backport, which is masking the standard library , which is what you presumably want to import.So: Run  to uninstall the extraneous backport.Make sure none of your packages list  as a requirement for python versions greater than 2.5.
