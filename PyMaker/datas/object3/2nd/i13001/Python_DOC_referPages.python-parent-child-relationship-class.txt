I've written up a class as seen below. I want to add the attribute of 'parent' to my base class Node. I was wondering if someone could show me how to properly do this. I've been given guidance on how to do it but I'm not entire sure how to write it syntax wise. Here is the suggested way to do it...generally I would hide the parent attribute behind a property so when  its set, the children array of the previous parent can be modified so  if you say n.parent = x, it actually remove node n from it's parent  and set the parent valueupdated
Example code, incorporating  to avoid reference cycles that can delay cleanup (or prevent it entirely in some cases, particularly on Python 3.3 and earlier):Typically, to avoid issues with changing parent class prototypes, I put additional parameters to child class  methods first, not last. Because I gave  defaults on , this makes  very simple:As you can see, by moving the  unique  param to the front,  can stop paying attention to changes in the  ; the new  works with the original  or the new  (that accepts  and assigns ) just fine, because it's less tightly coupled to the exact parameter ordering. Note that this does mean that if  is not passed positionally, then all arguments must be passed by keyword.Please comment if I made any mistakes, but that should be close to correct. In general, I had the  class use the  accessor to simplify the code by removing the difficulty with handling  properly ( is not weak referencable).
