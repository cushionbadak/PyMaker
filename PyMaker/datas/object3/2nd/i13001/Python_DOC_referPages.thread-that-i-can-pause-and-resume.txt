I'm trying to create a thread, that does stuff in the background. I need to be able to effectively 'pause' it when I need to and 'resume' it again later. Also, if the thread is in the middle of doing something when I 'pause' it, it should make the calling thread wait until it finishes what it's doing.I'm pretty new to Multithreading in Python, so I haven't gotten all that far.What I have pretty much does everything except make the calling thread wait if pause is called while my thread is doing something.Here's the outline of what I'm trying to achieve in code:I think I basically need a locking mechanism, but within the same thread?
s can be used for this.Here's an example filling in your skeleton:Hope that helps.
Use  instead of a boolean variable, and add another event for busy state:edit: previous answer was wrong, I fixed it and changed variable names to be clear
