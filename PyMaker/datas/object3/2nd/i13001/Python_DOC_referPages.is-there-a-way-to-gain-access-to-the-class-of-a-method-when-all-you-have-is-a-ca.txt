I have code that is like:How do I access  or  from f?  is of little to no help, but as  gives  it must be possible, but how?
Each bound method has the  attribute which is theinstance to which this method is bound, or (copied from here)More about bound methods (from Data Model):If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace)  through an instance, you get a special object: a bound method (also  called instance method) object. ... Bound methods have two special  read-only attributes:  is the object on which the method  operates...So  will get you the class instance:And  or  will get you the type object:You'd only use  for old-style classes.
