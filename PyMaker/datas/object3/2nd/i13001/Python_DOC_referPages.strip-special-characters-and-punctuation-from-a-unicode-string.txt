Natural Text
I'm trying to remove the punctuation from a unicode string, which may contain non-ascii letters. I tried using the  module:However, I've noticed that the characters  and  don't get removed. Does anyone know why and is there any other way to strip punctuation from unicode strings?EDIT: Another approach I've tried out is doing:but I would like to avoid converting the text from unicode to string and backwards.
 and  are classified as Math Symbols (Sm), not Punctuation (P). You can match either:The  method exists too and takes a dictionary mapping integer numbers (codepoints) to either other integer codepoints, a unicode character, or ;  removes that codepoint. Map  to codepoints with :That only removes only the limited number of ASCII punctuation characters.Demo:If  is not enough, then you can generate a complete  mapping for all  and  codepoints by iterating from 0 to , then test those values against :(For Python 3, replace  with , and  with .
Try  modulePrints-
 matches punctuation characters.Those punctuation characters are  and  are not punctuation characters. So they won't be removed.Try this instead
