If I have the file:How can I create the list:I need to retain the original order from the load file. So [pgm4, pgm5] must be the 2nd sublist. My preference is that the new sub-list is triggered when the grouping variable changes from the previous one, thus "A, Z, C". But I can accept if the grouping variable must be sequential, i.e. "1, 2, 3".(This is to support running the programs in each sub-list concurrently, but waiting for all upstream programs to finish before proceeding to the next list.)I'm on RHEL 2.6.32 using Python 2.6.6
Simply use . Code:Demo:The blow code do the same thing as the above code does, but keep the order:
After my OP, additional web searches found this:  How do I use Python's itertools.groupby()?Here is my current approach.  Please advise if I can make it more Pythonic.loadfile1.txt (no grouping variable - same output as loadfile4.txt):loadfile2.txt (random grouping variable):loadfile3.txt (same grouping variable - no dependencies - multi-threaded):loadfile4.txt (different grouping variable - dependencies - single threaded):My Python script:Output when using loadfile2.txt:
