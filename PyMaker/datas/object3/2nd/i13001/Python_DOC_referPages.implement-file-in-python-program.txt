This program allows user to input the type of food they want and the subtype as well. after that the bill or rate is calculated. When I run the program, the error is:     TypeError: an integer is requiredbut when I make it into : the same error comes: TypeError: an integer is required.Here, only one case is shown even though the menu has 5 cases, that is selecting Indian food and roti with curry. If this gets correct, I will do the rest.Is this the right way to implement files in python? I can't write anything into file.
Your issue is here: When you pass a single argument to  is expects and integer (how many bytes to read IIRC).Use  with no argument to read all data from the file.Also  is unnecessary.   Just call   no need to store return value, unless you're expecting something to go wrong.EDIT:  I have a few recommendations:  Use a string rather than an int and a key for your dictionaries.  This way  will provide a key you can use directly.Also, you are reading a writing to the same file too often, it is messing up your reading.  See here for more pythonic handling of files.  I would recommend encapsulating your reads and write this way.If you just want to check that you have written the data to a file, simply use  and assume it work unless it throws an error.  See my answer here.I'm not entirely sure what is supposed to happen, but here is my best guessHope this help!
