You probably want 
An easy way to tell if a string represents a valid  is to simply attempt to convert the string to an  and catch the  exception if it isn't a legal . Similarly with . Here's a brief demo in Python 2:outputHowever, normal Python code (generally) wouldn't use a function quite like that: it would assume that the data is correct and wrap the conversion code in a simple  block rather than using that crazy nested structure to test data before you're ready to process it. A sensible CSV won't have different datatypes in random positions, so your code shouldn't need to guess what type of data is in a give field. OTOH, not all CSV's are well-designed... :)
