The requirement is to iterate over every pair of unique key combination in python and get intersection list of values for every pair of key. To achieve this I am iterating over keys twice and in second iteration I am bypassing all the keys having lesser value of key compare to key of first iteration -As mentioned in others post I can create combination of dictionary keys and iterate over it but as I have to process values simultaneously I used above approach.What will be most pythonic and efficient way to achieve this ?
There are much better tools for this; use the  generator to pair every key with every other key:Demo:You may want to use sets to calculate the intersections:
