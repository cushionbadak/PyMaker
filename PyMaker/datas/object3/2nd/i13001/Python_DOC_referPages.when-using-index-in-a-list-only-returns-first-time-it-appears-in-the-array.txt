When I run the program it only returns the position of the first time it appears in the array. i.e    ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your     countryPick a word from the sentence above: ask'ask' appears in the sentence in the 1 st positionWhy does this happen and how can I fix it?Sorry if this is a stupid question I am a coding noobie
The other answer is better.I left this one as an example of an alternative way.according to the python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlyou should probably use a for loop (the easiest way) or probably it will be a good example of writing a generator.
 accepts additional start index (and end index). Pass the index to find next matched item index.
