Script 'top.py' makes use of another script 'myScript.py' by passing an argument to it. Script 'myScript.py' contains: The use is achieved in 'top.py' by simply calling 'myScript.py' with an argument 'myHelperArgument'. However, in top.py I cannot make use 'myHelperArgument'. Is this possible? If not, any suggestion on a possible solution (given the intention above) is welcome. Of course, I prefer not to write to a file and read later.
