I'm using  to read a  file. has an iterator which returns each row as a  and I know how to get single column values out using the title of the columns:But is there a way to get out a bunch of columns with one statement?I'd like to do and get a  of the values of those keys but it's giving me .I understand that it's trying to hash the tuple and that it's not what I want.I could create a list of  and then use  to index into the dict but I'm wondering if there's a more Pythonic way of doing this.
As described, the following approach should work nicely:Or a bit more concise:Tested in Python 2.7.9
Batteries included: . Create a getter object:Then call the resulting object on each row:Or calling explicitly if you hate  (or really want  of the values instead of the  an  returns for each call):
