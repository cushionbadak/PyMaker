Natural Text
I have a text file containing CPU stats as below (from sar/sysstat)My goal is to build lists for each column (except the CPU, %nice and %steal) so I can plot them using bokeh, so tried to split each line to list and then I don't know how you can ignore certain values i.e. Is there a better/short way to do this? More specifically, the logic I used to ignore some of the items doesn't look good to me. 
Here is a more dynamic version that would scale to more columns. But there isn't really anything bad about your implementation. 
This is a bit more generic. You can define a list of desired column names. It uses csv-Dictreader to read the file. The names are given without the  suffix. In addition, it converts the time into a  object from the module datetime and all other columns into floats. You can specify your own data conversion functions  for all columns, using the dictionary .Result:
First you could use  or  to represent ignored values (this is a common convention).Next you could store all values into a single list and then unpack the list into multiple lists using .You could write this using a couple list comprehensions, but I don't think it's any more readable:
