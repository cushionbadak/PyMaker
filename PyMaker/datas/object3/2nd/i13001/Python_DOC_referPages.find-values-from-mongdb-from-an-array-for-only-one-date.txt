I am aware of a similar question available in SO but mine is little different Find values in mongdb. I am trying out a hotel booking app. Here I store the info about on which date the rooms are booked, which means the rooms are available in all other dates. I am working with  and .I am using the  function. I have a option called alternate dates, where the user gives in another date. I want to display the availability of only one day that is, if room is available on the first date then the search should stop if not it should continue to the next date and give result if available.This solution gives result for all the given dates.solution of Find values in mongdbThe data stored is I do the query like thisHere I give the input as So when I get the result I don't know on which date the room is available.Is there a way I can solve this problem.When I run this code I get the resultBut I dont know for which date the room is available. In the above case it is available only on .So is there a way to say that it is available on .And for another case:Here it is available on , but it should show only the first availability date i.e .The output should be the same as above:
You need to use the  method.You will need to use the  operator to select document where the "Booked Date" is in your "date_list" then use the  operator to return the the "Room No" and the corresponding list of "available date" using the  operator.Then all you will need is handle the rest of the job client side.Then using  to print the result:which yields:Now another way of doing this which is less efficient is that you can denormalize your "available_date" array or list using the  operator then  your result by "available_date" in ascending order. From there you will need to  your document by "Room No" and use the  operator to return the first date for each document.As you can see this a lot more unnecessary work to the server and therefore is not a good solution.Which yields:
