It is not a good idea to use  in such a complicated way when you can use  with  function in a more Pythonic way:Note that using  will perform slightly better than a generator expression because by passing a generator expression to  python will get the values from generator function by itself, since using built-in function  has more performance in terms of execution time1.From PEP 0289 -- Generator Expressions:The semantics of a generator expression are equivalent to creating an anonymous generator function and calling it. For example:is equivalent to:Note that since generator expressions are better in terms of memory use, if you are dealing with large data you'd better use generator expression instead of map function.
You can do this using Counter as well: Output:
 is an inferior tool for this job.  Look at a  instead.  It's a dict subclass, so you should be able to use it however you were planning to use the dict.
