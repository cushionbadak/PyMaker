This is probably straightforward but I'm new to this sort of programming and struggling to wrap my head around what I need to do.I'm trying to build a list of filters to apply to an image. I have seven filters I can apply and each filter can either be  or  (on or off). The filters are:What I want to produce is every possible permutation of these filters in their states. There should be 128 possible permutations (2^7) but when I run the following code I get 5080 permutations:I'm likely using the wrong method – all this is doing is shuffling the sequence of filters, which I don't care about. I tried updating the filter list to have two items for each filter, eg.  etc, but running  against this gives me duplicate values (eg. both on and off states in the same list).I'm struggling here – can anyone give me a nudge in the right direction for approaching something like this? Looking in the docs, something like  seems along the right lines but I still can't wrap my head around it. Help appreciated.
What you are looking for as far as I understand is called a powerset.Here are some implementations for this method:Getting the subsets of a set in Python
You are using  the wrong way. Look at the documentation:You are just mixing your  values and creating all the possibilities, which is 7! = 5040.What you want is the  of  seven times.
