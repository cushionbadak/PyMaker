I have a timestamp like:How do I convert this so that I can easily get the month like "January"? And in general convert it to a nice format like:
You can use  module.  expects a time string and its formatting and returns a  object, on which you can call  to format it according to your needs.There is also a python-dateutils module, which can do the same.
The strftime() method in datetime modulecan achieve this. It expects a string pattern explaining how you want to format your date.The above code prints something like "It is 12 Nov 2015"You can find more format codes at https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
