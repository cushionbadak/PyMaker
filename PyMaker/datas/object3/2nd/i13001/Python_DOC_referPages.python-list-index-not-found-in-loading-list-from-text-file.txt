Natural Text
The assignment was to get a user to input 4 numbers, then store them in a text file, open that text file, show the 4 numbers on different lines, then get the average of those numbers and display it to the user.Here is my code so far:The problem is loading the numbers back from the text file and then storing each one as a variable so that I can get the average of them.I can't seem to find a way to specifically locate each number, just each byte which is not what I want.
You'll have two main problems.First,  is for adding an individual item to a list,  not for adding one list to another.  Because you used  you've ended up with a list containing one item,  and that item is itself a list... not what you want, and the explanation for your error message. For concatenating one list to another   or  would work, but you should ask yourself whether that is even necessary in your case.Second, your list elements are strings and you want to work with them as numbers.  will convert them for you.In general, you should investigate the concept of "list comprehensions".  They make operations like this very convenient.  The following example creates a new list whose members are the respectively ed versions of your  output:The ability to add conditionals into a list comprehension is also a real complexity-saver. For example, if you wanted to skip any blank/whitespace lines that had crept into your file:
Your list (my_list) has only 1 item - a list with the items you want.You can see this if you try  print(len(my_list)), so your print(my_list[1]) is out of range because the item with index = 1 does not exist. When you create an empty list and append output, you are adding one item to the list, which is what the variable output holds for a value. To get what you want just do 
You can change the end of your program a little and it will work:
