Natural Text
I have a python data frame with a column called "accreditedThis column should have the data of accreditation: "10/10/2011"Or put: "Not accredited"But in most of the cases when isn't accredited the column have some text, like:"This business is not accredited....."I want to replace the whole text and just put: "Not accredited"Now, I wrote a  function: I'm implementing the function with a loop, is possible to do this with the ".apply" method?
You could use the vectorized string method :The first argument passed to , e.g. , can be any regex pattern. The second can be any regex replacement value -- the same kind string as would be accepted by . The  in the regex pattern makes the pattern case-insensitive so , , , , etc. would all match. Cythonizes the calls to  (which makes it faster than what you could achieve using  since  uses a Python loop.)
