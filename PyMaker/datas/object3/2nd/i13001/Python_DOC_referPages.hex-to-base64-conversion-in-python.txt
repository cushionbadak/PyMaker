I want to convert a simple HEX string such as 10000000000002ae to Base 64.The hex string is to be converted to bytes, and the bytes are then encoded to base64 notation, so the expected output for that string: EAAAAAAAAq4=I found a tool online. http://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_base64.php?lang=enBut I have a bunch of HEX values that I need to convert in a script.
Python has native support for both HEX and base64 encoding:
In Python 3, arbitrary encodings including Hex and Base64 has been moved to  module. To get a Base64  from a hex :
The tool you link to simply interprets the hex as bytes, then encodes those bytes to Base64.Either use the  function to convert from a hex string to bytes, or use the  class method. Then use the  function to convert that to Base64:orIn Python 2, you can also use the  and  methods to achieve the same:In Python 3, you'd have to use the  function for this.Demo in Python 3:Demo on Python 2.7:
Python has native support for both HEX and base64 encoding:
In case someone is looking for a python3 one-liner (bash):
In python3, you may use  to bytes, use base64 package convert bytes to base64
