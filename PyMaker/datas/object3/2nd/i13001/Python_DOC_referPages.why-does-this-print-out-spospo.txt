Why wouldn't the output be ?
Let’s check how slicing works: – slice of  from  to  with step If  or  is negative, the index is relative to the end of the string:  or  is substituted. But note that  is still .The slice of  from  to  with step  is defined as the sequence of items with index  such that . In other words, the indices are , , ,  and so on, stopping when  is reached (but never including ). If  or  is greater than , use . If  or  are omitted or , they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of ). Note,  cannot be zero. If  is , it is treated like .So  means , , . is negative, so  means that .  is , so we get the following slice: .As per above definition, we now the the items with the following indexes: , , . We stop at  because that is our end, and we don’t include that.So the result are indexes , which is .Finally, that string is multiplied by  which repeats it once: .
