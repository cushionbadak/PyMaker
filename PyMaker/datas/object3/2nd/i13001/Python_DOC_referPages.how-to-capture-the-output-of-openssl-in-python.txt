I am trying to run the following openssl command in python:This command is supposed to generate a fingerprint of the certificate. I am trying to capture the output through the file object. But when I read this file object, there's nothing in it. I have executed this command on the command line and it runs fine, generates the fingerprint. Could you tell me how can I get the fingerprint?  
You achieve this natively within Python using the  module.
You can use two modules to establish what you want:  and .Using  you can check for the output for the process using , which reads data from stdout and stderr until EOF.Using  module works fine as well, using both  and  methods: (please note that os.popen() is deprecated)If you want to write the value to a file, that works as well, which you can verify by opening a file  in your current working directory:The  notifies us that 77 bytes were written to the file, which you can verify by opening it in your favourite text editor.
