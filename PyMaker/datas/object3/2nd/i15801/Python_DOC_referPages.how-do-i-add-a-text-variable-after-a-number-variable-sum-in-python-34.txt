Natural Text
I need to add the user input for unit to appear at the end of the measurement. For example, if the user inputs cm for the unit of measurement, I want x cm; instead of just x.
Just put in another comma:The  function just converts each argument to a string,* and prints them on a line together with a space between each.**Just like you can use that to print , you can use it to print whatever's in ; if that's , it'll print .(Note that you probably didn't want that space at the end of , because  is already going to add one there.)In general, once you get beyond trivial cases, it's usually more readable to use string formatting. But for simple cases (while you're learning, for quick&dirty scripts, for exploratory debugging, etc.),  with multiple arguments is usually fine.* A string converted to a string is just itself, which you can already see with .** Although you can configure the "on a line" and "with a space between" with the keyword arguments  and ; see the linked docs.
