In python is there a way to inverse a string using a 'for i in string' but starting from the last char rather than the first? I would like to avoid using a counte rand I do not want to use INVERSE.Thanks for the feedback!
Easiest way is to just use a slice:(By the way, best not to use  as a variable name as it is also the name of a module)
