Assume to have this number:Now, if we print this variable we get  (i.e., that number in scientific notation). How can I print exactly  (i.e., in decimal notation)? Ok, I know I can use , but the fact is that I don't know in advance the number of decimal digits (e.g., I may have  or , etc.). Therefore, I could count the number of decimal digits and use that in the  function. In doing so, I have a related problem... is there any way to count the decimal digits of a decimal number without using ?

... is there any way to count the decimal digits of a float number without using ?Nope. And there isn't any way to do it using  either. Floating point numbers that aren't an exact sum of powers of 1/2 don't have an exact number of decimal places. The best you can do is perform some sort of guesstimate based on the leftmost non-zero digit and some arbitrary count of digits.
In general you can't count the number of decimal digits, but you can compute the minimum precision and use it with  format specification in str.format or equivalent function:You'll need to increase precision if you want to display more than one significant digit. Also you might need a slightly different logic for numbers > 1.
