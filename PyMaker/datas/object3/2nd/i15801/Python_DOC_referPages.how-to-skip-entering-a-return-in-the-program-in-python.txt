I have a python program that SSH's into a system, runs a .py script and has to cat a file.Once it has run the .py script after SSHing into the remote system, I have to manually hit "return" for the cat program to display the contents of the file. This is because the program is stuck at that point.What I have looks like this:
If I understand correctly you want to run a python script, wait for it to finish, and then cat a file?  If that is correct, you would have to use two subprocess calls.  Your line as written is running run.py with arguments cat and ../../file.xmlWhy does run.py wait for user input?  My first choice would be to change that.  With that not being an option, I may go for something likeI am not sure what your plan is behind all of this :)  If this is the extent of what you are trying to do, a shell script would be a better choice.  Something like this-If it is something else, the docs for the subprocess module can explain lots of different ways of entering input into and reading output from a subprocess.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
