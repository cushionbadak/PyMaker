Natural Text
I am trying read a txt file and put the data into a dictionary. My file looks something like this:Basically, a word and integer separated by a colon. I want to open and read the file, split each line where the colon is, and put the data into a dictionary like this:{'Alex':3, 'John':6, 'Sam':8}So far my code looks like this:How do I assign the name as the key and the integer as the value and put it into the dictionary?
Like this:str.split() returns a list of all the tokens in the string.  You can grab both of these values using the syntax I showed.You can then index it in the dictionary via the name variable, as you can see.Edit: As @MauroBaraldi in the comments points out, you don't need the  anymore as  will do that work for you.
Your problem is with  will return a list.  You can unpack the list like this:And then do:
Here are another approach to solve the problem.A good practice is open files using . It closes automatically when get out of context.
You can use following code to get desired output. You can separate the words by using split . rstrip is used to remove the newline.output:
In the above code,  will remove the new line character,  will split the string on ":", so you will get two value name and age that will be stored.    name is key and age will be the value stored
