I came across this issue that I don't have sudo access to install any software on redhat servers(python is installed). My python script depends a lot libraries. How could I use this libraries from the source code?
If the python 3.3 or higher can use the venv, if not try to see if you have virtualenv 
You do not need root access to install libraries for Python.Ideally you would use virtual environments, installing with , to isolate the different libraries needed by different applications. However, to achieve what you want the simplest solution is to create a directory in which you place the required libraries, then add that directory to the  environment variable.When Python starts, it adds the directories from  to the  list, so they are searched when the interpreter looks for libraries. See this manual page for more details of how libraries are loaded.
 has already been mentionned a few times and it's really the best way so far to manage per-project dependencies - but in your case it won't solve non-python system packages dependencies (GCC for non-pure python packages, and system libs and headers).
