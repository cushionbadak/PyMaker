Natural Text
I want to extract data from one of my files, and then use it in a calculation in Python. Here is my code:How can I use the data in a calculation? I want to take the data in my text file and multiply that by the number that the user has input.
A few comments (and an answer): is a list of strings (returned by the  method). If all the file contains is just one number (the conversion rate), then  would be better because it returns a string.But even then, you can't do calculations with  yet - you need to do a conversion to a   first. In your case, you'd have to do something like  if the number is on the first line in your file. (With , it would be  - do you understand why?)Why are you opening the file in append mode at the start of your function, only to close it immediately afterwards?Have you read about the  statement?You should be using better variable names. , , ,  and  don't speak for themselves. Your computer has enough memory to store longer variable names.You should read PEP-8 (Style Guide for Python code)You should read How do I format my posts using Markdown or HTML? in order to avoid issues with improper indentation like in your question.
