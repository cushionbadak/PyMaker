I have a list of dictionaries:What is an elegant/short way to convert that into a [exercise x student] "mapping table" dictionary? Like so:You can assume the map contains at most one answer per exercise per student.
This generates the output you want:    
The straight forward way would be to gather them in a dictionary, like thisOutputFirst, if the  is not there in , then a new dictionary will be set as the value and then in that dictionary, if  is not there, we set an empty list as the value and we append the current dictionary in that list.
