I would like to get slice objects from subscript notation. So far, I have used a hacky trick to exploit Python built-in subscript to slice conversion features:For example,  will return .Does anyone know of a more straightforward way?
If you must use subscript notation, then your current solution is the most compact besides maybe a dynamic class created with :But code like this is usually hard to understand/maintain/extend/etc.  Instead, I would recommend that you use , which allows you to create slice objects directly:The built-in was made specifically for this purpose (well, that and a few others such as type-checking with ) and is therefore very portable as well as pythonic.
