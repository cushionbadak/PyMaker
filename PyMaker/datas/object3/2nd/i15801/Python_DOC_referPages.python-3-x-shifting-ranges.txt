suppose I have a range like this:which would have the following values as a list:I would like to shift this range (possibly multiple times)and iterate over the results e.g.Creating an equivalent list is not a problem. But I'd liketo know if it is possible to create something like this asa range to save some space in memory and of course it would be nice if the solution could be about as performant as:
You can wrap the range in a generator expression, applying the shift and modulo on the fly:Demo:You could make this a wrapper object as well:This will behave just like the original range, but applying a shift to all values produced. It even lets you alter the shift!Demo:Best trick this wrapper now supports: reversing the shifted range:
I guess the simplest way is to  two ranges:
You can use itertools to chain two ranges. This code works even if the ranges have step > 1.Testing:
