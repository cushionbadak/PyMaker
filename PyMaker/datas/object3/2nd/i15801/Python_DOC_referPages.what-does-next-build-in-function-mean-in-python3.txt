Natural Text
So what does  keyword mean in python 3? I am using 3.4.0 and sublime 3 text editor and when I write  in it it turns blue? I tried to search about it but I haven't seem to find anything more specific.
 is not a keyword but a built-in function.The Python documentation also includes a list of keywords; you'll see it is not listed there.In Python 2, iterators defined an  method, but that has been renamed to  in Python 3. It is probably that method name the syntax highlighter tries to color-code; the Python 3 package for Sublime Text adds  as highlighted too.
