I have an application written in Python that stores many lists of basic datatypes (int, floats etc) which are in turn rarely accessed. I was looking at some libraries that could compress this data before further processing.I looked at gzip and other similar libraries. It seems to me that they all work on strings. Why is that? Is there any limitation at applying LZ77 to a list of int rather than a list of chars? Is there a python library out there that will do what I want? 
You will first need to serialize the Python object(s) using pickle or cPickle, which will convert it to a series of bytes.  Then you can use any compressor, such as zlib, to compress it.  Then you can use zlib and pickle to turn the data back into objects.  Both pickle and zlib can work solely in memory.
if you have python 3.4, you can do this with the lzma library.  If you are in python 2.7 you can use the bz2 library to compress data in memory.The examples in the links look pretty good so I won't re-write them here.
