I have to make a program in Python 3.4 that let's me input numbers and names that go into a list, and then I have print out the numbers that are less than average of the sum. I've been stuck with the last part as I don't know how to print out only the numbers that are less than average of the list. Let's say the list is [190, 188, 185, 174, 172] and the average is 181.8, how can I get it working?//edit I got the first part working with this However, I got another problem. Is there a way to tie 2 lists together?
here in my code  function will give you sum of all element of list num.  will give you no of element in num.
