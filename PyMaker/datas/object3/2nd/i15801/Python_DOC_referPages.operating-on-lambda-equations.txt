I've found that python doesn't like it when you operate on lambda equations.yields the error:I'm currently working on really long equations where I need to substitute a lot of equations, but  Python won't let me operate on lambda equations.Are there any ways around this in python? 
Using  creates an anonymous function.  Hence, you need to call it as one:See a demonstration below:Or, in simple terms, doing this:is the same as doing this:Note however that PEP 0008, the official style guide for Python code, condemns the practice of naming lambdas and using them in place of normal functions:Always use a  statement instead of an assignment statement that  binds a  expression directly to an identifier.Yes:No:The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is  specifically  instead of the generic . This is more  useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use  of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a   expression can offer over an explicit  statement (i.e. that it can  be embedded inside a larger expression)Source: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations
