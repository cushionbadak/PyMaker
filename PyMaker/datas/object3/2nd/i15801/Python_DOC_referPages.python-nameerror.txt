I have the following code that uses 3 strings 'us dollars','euro', '02-11-2014',and a number to calculate the exchange rate for that given date. I modified thecode to pass those arguments but I get an error when I try to call it withI'm fairly new to Python so my knowledge is limited. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Also the version of Python I'm using is 3.4.2.
The command line does not automatically assign "us dollars" "euro" 100 "02-11-2014" to  currTo,currFrom,currAmount,currDate.Instead the command line arguments are stored in a list, sys.argv.You need to parse sys.argv and/or pass its values on to the call to currencyManager:For example, changeto The first element in  is the script name. Thus  consists of the next 4 arguments after the script name (assuming 4 arguments were entered on the command line.) You may want to check that the right number of arguments are passed on the command line and that they are of the right type. The  module can help you here.The  in  unpacks the list  and passes the items in the list as arguments to the function .
