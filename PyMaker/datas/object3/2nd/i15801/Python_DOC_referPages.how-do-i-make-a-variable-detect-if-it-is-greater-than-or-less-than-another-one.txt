I am currently learning Python, and I decided to build a small "Guess the Number" type of game. I am using the random feature, and trying to make it so it will detect if the user's input is equal the the random number. This is my code:I am not exactly sure how to make it detect if  is equal to, less than or greater than . Any help? Thank you! :)
Your code to check "equal to, less than, or greater than" is correct, but you've got a problem earlier in the code.In Python (3.0 and later),  returns a string. So, you're comparing , a string, to , a number. Some languages might convert one way or the other automatically, but that can be confusing,*, so Python refuses to do so, and instead raises a .The solution is to parse the input into a number, like this:This will raise a  if the user gives you invalid input, like the letter  instead of a number from 1 to 10. If you want to deal with that more nicely, you use a  statement.As a side note, you probably want  instead of . If you've got everything right, this doesn't make any difference, but if you've made a mistake, it helps catch the mistake.So, putting it all together:(Notice that I used  in the  clause, so we skip over the rest of the loop and don't have to worry about  not being a number anymore. We could also move the whole loop into an  cause on the , or add an  check on each , etc., but that gets a bit clumsy.)* Consider comparing the string  to the number . A language that converts the string to a number will say that ; a language that converts the number to a string will say that . Neither one is "right" or "wrong", but both are surprising half the timeâ€¦
You can use the following code:
