I am trying wait for any of multiple multiprocessing events at the same time, so I came up with code like this:It works like the comment says. But how does this work? Is the  polling bot methods all the time? Or is it called as soon as one event gets set?Bonus question: Is there some clever way to adjust the code to wait for any number of events, i.e. a list of events?  does not work as expected.
It only waits for the first one. This is due to python's support of short circuiting.
Wait on a thread or process is blocking, so it will block the current thread for going future until the timeout or the thread has finished. The semantics of  in Python is short circuit, which means that if the first one returns true, then the second one will not be called - simonzack said.Waiting on a number of threads would be kinda hard to implement and maintain for a variety of threads. I would suggest you to use Message passing, and get each process to send a message to a Queue when it is finished. This way you could just check if the queue was of ´len(n)´, where ´n´ is the number of threads/processes. see more here Queues in multiprocessing
