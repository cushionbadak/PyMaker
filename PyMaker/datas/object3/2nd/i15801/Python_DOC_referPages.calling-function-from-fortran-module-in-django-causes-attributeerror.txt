I compile it with  like so:If I go to , I can import it and everything works ok:In  I have an app called just . It has a view which looks like this:The error message is: . PS. I'm a  and  newbee, so I guess I could make some "stupid" error. EDITNow, thanks to , I manage to call a fortran function, at least I do not have error any longer.

So, my codes now look like this:So, my question is how to check whether fortran module works or not?EDITThanks to laike9m and Vladimir, I finally did it. The problem was in the path to the file. I had to put the file right in the root folder of the project.
