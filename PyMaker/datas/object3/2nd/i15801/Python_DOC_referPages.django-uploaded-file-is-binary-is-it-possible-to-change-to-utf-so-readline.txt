Uploading a file in Django (1.7) using Python 3:outputsIf I call  I get bytes back.Normally that would be okay, I could just read the file and decode it, however in this case I'm passing the file on to another function that expects to call  on the parameter it receives, and  needs to return unicode rather than bytes.Is it possible to set encoding or such on an instance of , so readline would return unicode rather than bytes? Or do I have to use  to first read in the entire file and then pass the instance of  to my function?
The general way to handle this may be to write a custom upload handler and tell Django to use it. But I've never done this, so I'm not sure.But a simple approach would be to just wrap the underlying file object. (If you use  instead of  you shouldn't need to worry about the overhead.)
