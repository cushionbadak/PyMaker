I'm fairly confused as to the proper implementation of command line arguments in a program.  I've looked around and am confused whether or not a for loop is necessary.  I know for sure that there will always be only two arguments passed to this program.  Ultimately, is a for loop necessary in this situation?  Here's the code in the main function:Thank you all for your input!    
You do not need to use a loop if you know exactly how many arguments you want.I have noticed that in your code that you check the number of sys.argv is greater than 1, you need to check that it is greater than 2 as the first sys.argv (sys.argv[0]) is the name script that you are running https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=sys.argv#sys.argvIf only one argument is passed to your program it will currently result in an IndexError.
you can try argparse:https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html
