I want to convert a list to csv but some data hava ',' in them. So when I writeelements being my list name, the data which contains a "," is sent to the next column, but it is a part of a single name. For Eg.  the CA moves to the next column.What can I do?
First, you should be opening the file using the  parameter (read the docs for the  module).Then, choose  as your quote character so other CSV tools (Excel?) that expect quotes can react correctly to your file:
use .from the documentationIf you are using a special quote char, the application you are using to read the csv needs to be configured to use it as the quote char
The values that have to be quoted will be quoted, automatically. For example, if you use  as delimiter, the value "Smith, CA" has to be quoted since it contains a .Your question does not say anything about how the  variable looks, so I'm making a guess here. If you have elements in an iterable and each element looks something like , the code you posted works just fine. I completed your code example as follows:It will produce the following output:Note 1: Since you are using , it is only values that need to be quoted that will be. Other values like  or  are not quoted.Note 2: Using  as a quotechar is not very common, as @TimPietzcker just noted. But it works.
Here's a working example, but note this won't be readable in Excel as someone commented.Output:If you actually want to open the  file in Excel, use the default  parameter. Also you  to support non-ASCII characters and also provide the byte order mark (BOM) signature that Excel requires to read the .csv properly:Output:
