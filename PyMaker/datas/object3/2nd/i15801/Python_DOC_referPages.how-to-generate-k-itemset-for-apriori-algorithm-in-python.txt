this is the first time I am trying to code in python and I am implementing the Apriori algorithm. I have generated till 2-itemsets and below is the function I have to generate 2-Itemsets by combining the keys of the 1-itemset. How do I go about making this function generic? I mean, by passing the keys of a dictionary and the number of elements required in the tuple, the algorithm should generate all possible n-number(k+1) subsets using the keys. I know that Union on sets is a possibility, but is there a way to do union of tuples which is essentially the keys of a dictionary?For example, if my initial dictionary looks like: {key, value} --> value is the frequencyI take the keys of this dictionary and pass it to the candidate_gen function mentioned aboveit will generate the subsets of 2-itemsets and give the output of keys. I will then pass the keys to a function to find the frequency by comparing against the original database to get this output:How do I generated 3-itemset subsets from the above keys.
I assume that, given your field, you can benefit very much from the study of python's itertools library.In your use case you can directly use the itertools or wrap it in a helper functionOutputPlease note that the order of the elements in the -uples depends on the order that you used in the iterable that you pass to .
