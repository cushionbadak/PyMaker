hello im trying to write a game about having a village and keep it alive for 100 days but while writing the save system i came across an error this is my code:  the population one works but when it gets to name it gives me the error  
This is because  is a new line.  Try  or  and this should solve your problem.  Also python accepts forward slashes  for paths on Windows, so it is probably safer to use those.Read about escape characters here.Also, it is generally bad form to name a variable "file" because  is a built-in function in python.
