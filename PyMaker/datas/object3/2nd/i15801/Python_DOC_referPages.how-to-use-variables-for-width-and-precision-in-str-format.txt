How can I use a variable in the str.format() specification for width and precision?(I'm in Python 3.)This works fine:But this gives an error:Specifically, I get:How can I use a variable for the precision and width?
tryThis builds a format string from the variable value.
Encase  in bracketsThis is evident from the following quote from the Format String Syntax documentation:A format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within  it. These nested replacement fields can contain only a field name;  conversion flags and format specifications are not allowed. The  replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the  format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a  value to be dynamically specified.
