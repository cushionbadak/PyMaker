Which of the following is the proper way to return something with Python when using conditionals? Does it matter? And why?
The proper Python way would be:"Simple is better than complex" remember? :)Regarding your edited question, I would use  because "Flat is better than nested." and this solution saves an indentation level.  You'll appreciate this when:is actually something like:Besides, the  in this case is unnecessary (both syntactically as well as visually) and redundant; it simply wastes space.That said, you may want to consider using a conditional expression instead:This is a very concise and elegant alternative when , , and  are all nice and short.
I think this may be a trick question. The first one is not syntactically correct:In Python, an  clause, like anything else that introduces a suite, has to end in a  character.If you fix that, then they're both syntactically valid, and both semantically meaningful. In fact, they mean the same thing. They'll even compile to almost the same code, except that the first one might cause Python to generate some extra code for a third "fall off the end of the function" case that never gets called.But, as iCodez's answer explains, both of these are an anti-pattern; just , or , as appropriate.Note that even in the case where evaluating  raises an exception, the different possibilities are still all equivalent (up to the contents of the traceback)â€”they'll all just raise that exception.
