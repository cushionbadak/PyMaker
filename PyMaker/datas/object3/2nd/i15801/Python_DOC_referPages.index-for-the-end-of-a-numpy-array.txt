I have a function that loads some data into a 2D numpy array. I want to let the function call specify a number of rows and columns that can be removed from the beginning and the end. If no parameter is specified, it returns all the data.Now,  and  could default to . How can I set the defaults for  and  to refer to the end of the array?My only solution is:Is there a better solution, something like:For the record, example data could be:
You can just use  directly in the slice, for example,or you could write your function like:Here, you could also replace you min defaults with  too.  This works because  is used as the defaults in the slice object.  For more explicit docs on using  in numpy slicing, see the Note box at the end of the Basic Slicing docs description.
