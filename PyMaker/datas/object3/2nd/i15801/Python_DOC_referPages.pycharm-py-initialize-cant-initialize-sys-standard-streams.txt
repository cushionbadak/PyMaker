I'm trying to use PyCharm IDE but none of my programs compile even simple Hello World. PyCharm gives this error: I'm not able to find the solution for it and also referred the link PyDev: Fatal error Python32\lib\io.py, line 60, in <module> but there is no solution there.Python 3.4 is installed on my Win 7 OS system.
I faced the same problem because I created a file named , remove that file in your project, your error will disappear.
Yes, as you said in the comment, the problem is in the filename 'abc'. You will be able to run this file within PyCharm, if you uncheck: Add content roots to PYTHONPATHAdd sources roots to PYTHONPATHin the menu "Run/Debug Configurations". 
Finally found how to solve this problem in PyCharm: never use a name like  or .Simply use another name, like  or 
I have the same problem, just change your file's name from io.py to something else, It's work!
try this:File->Setting->Editor->File Encodingschange the Project encoding to UTF-8
