Is there a way to tell the python unittest execute all assertion in a method and show all cases it fails, instead of stop at the first failed.
Python 3.4 introduced the  context manager. Your code will look likeThe ugly way to achieve this without  is to make  calls within a  block, print the errors caught, and raise the  explicitly after the loop if at least one test failed. 
Alternatively, you can make a data-driven-test with the help of  package:DDT (Data-Driven Tests) allows you to multiply one test case by  running it with different test data, and make it appear as multiple  test cases. can also have the data coming from a file, but it has to be a JSON file.
Generally no. Unit tests stop at first fail. If you want to compare all lines you need to have a local list and then put the different lines into the list. Then assert that list length is zero. Or a local boolean variable.
