Taking  for example.I just want to know is it an  or  or  .so I put this:it prints: zipWhy class name are lowercase?It prints: (zip, object)That's impossible. Python doc says  returns an  (or ?), but  apparently is not inherited from Iterator or alikes according what  prints.So the two questions ,thanks for help.
Nothing in Python inherits from  or , as they embody a protocol. Python looks for the  and  methods, not for a specific base class. Any object can be an iterable or iterator, simply by implementing those methods. is a built-in function defined in C code, and it follows the naming convention for all built-ins; these are always in lowercase; the type it returns is not all that relevant here and follows the function name.The  and  classes are abstract base classes; they implement special hooks that essentially return  if the instance or subclass against which you are test implement the required methods. is both an iterable (it has an  method) and an iterator ( returns the object itself and it has a  method): is not a generator, as it doesn't have any of the special generator methods:
