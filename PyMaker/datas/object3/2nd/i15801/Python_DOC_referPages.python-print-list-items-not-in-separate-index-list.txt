I have two lists:I'd like to print everything in  except for the indices in . I've tried the following, which just returns a generator object:  
The reason your comprehension does work is that  is the value, like , not the index, like , and of course  is not in .To get the index along with the value, you need . Then you can do this:Also, note that printing a generator expression (as you did) is just going to print something like ; that's why I converted your code to printing out a list comprehension, so you get  instead.If you instead wanted to print, say, one line at a time, you could loop over the generator expression:But really, it's easier to just collapse that into a single loop:Or, even simpler, format the whole thing in a single expression, maybe like this:â€¦ or even let  do it for you:Finally, as a side note, calling your list  is a bad idea; it hides the type/constructor function, which may want to use later on, and it also makes your code misleading.
You shouldn't call your list  or you're hiding the  type itself. will give you the indexes and corresponding elements of the list.Putting the comprehension in square brackets makes it into a list, which is easier to print than a generator.
Your print result is a generator , you need to put your list comprehension in a list sign () or use  function,also you need to check the indices not the values , so you can figure it out with  :
