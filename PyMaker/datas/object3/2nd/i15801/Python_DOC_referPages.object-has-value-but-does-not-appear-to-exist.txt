I have the following Python code:I was stepping through it in my debugger and noticed that even though  , the flow jumps to the  statement.To test this I tried:Can someone explain what is going on here?
 always evaluates to  in Python:Consequentially, doing this:will always cause the  block to be executed.For a complete list of what evaluates to , see Truth Value Testing in the Python docs.If you want to check if  is defined, then you could use a  block and catch for a  (which is raised when you use a nonexistent name):But this begs the question of why you need to do this in the first place.  If it involves dynamic variable names, then I would like to say that those are considered a bad practice by most Python programmers and should be avoided.  They can quickly lead to maintenance problems and it is very easy to lose track of the names that were created.
