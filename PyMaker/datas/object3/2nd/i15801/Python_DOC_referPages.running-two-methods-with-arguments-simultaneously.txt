That's not what you want; you want to pass the function itself, and the arguments, to the  object so that it can call them. That's exactly what the  parameter is for, as shown in most of the examples for .

You probably want to store them all in a list, and then  them all (whether immediately, or later). For example:
You want the args keyword argument:
