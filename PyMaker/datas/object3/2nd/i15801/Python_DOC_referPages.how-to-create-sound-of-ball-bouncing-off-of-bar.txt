I am currently working on a little pong game, I am wondering on how to add sound to my game so that when the ball bounces off of one of the paddles, it will make the sound I want. This is my code, and my sound file that i have is called "blop.wav".
Since you're specifically doing this in PyGame, you want to use .See the docs, and linked examples, for full details, but basically, the key points are:Call Construct a  for each wavfile.Every time you want to play a sound, just call .By default, this will get you 8 channels; if you try to play 9 simultaneous sounds, one of them will fail to play. If you want to do things like, say, stop a background loop temporarily to free up its channel for a sound effect, you can handle it manually, or you can reserve some of the channels for different purposes, etc. But usually, the basics are good enough.Which formats  can handle depend on which libraries were compiled into your PyGame/SDL build. The  format should always be there, but if you don't want to rely on that, you can always use the stdlib's  module to read the file, then the  constructor.
