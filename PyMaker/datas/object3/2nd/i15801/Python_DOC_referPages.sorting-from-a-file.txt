Each new value begins on a new line e.g:Currently, I have the sorting of A - Z working. However, I am having difficulty sorting via the values. Could anybody help me with sorting from Highest Num - Lowest Num? (10 - 0)The code I have currently to read the Values is this:And this is what I have to sort from Highest to Lowest:
Pseudocode, do not attempt to copy paste. Write a function that strips the string values for sorting functions inside the sorting method, then return which one is superior.//ordering is already ok if they are equal or 1 is smaller than 2 depending on ascending/descendingDoes this help? I am not a python expert so it's hard for me to provide python specific answers but the principle is the same.
Define sorting criteria however you like:And use it to sort the file:To sort a large file that do not fit in memory, you could sort the file in small batches and merge the sorted results.To find out what  means you could search google using keywords: .
