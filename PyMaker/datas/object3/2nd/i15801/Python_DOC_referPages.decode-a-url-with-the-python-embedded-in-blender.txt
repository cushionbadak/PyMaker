Natural Text
I have this trouble:I'm working in a script for Blender, that takes an text who comes from a URL and make a 3D object of the text.This text could be written in any language for example: Spanish, English, Russian, Arabic, Chinese, others...And for have in mind, the Python that comes with Blender, doesn't have all libraries, in particular doesn't have urllib. Also I can't install any external libraries.So I copied and pasted the unquote function in my code to transform the text. And here started the troubles.For example if I get:  after the unquote I get  and it's fine.But if the text is:After the unquote is  And what I wanted is : And finally if I have this text: Which is decoded into , but I expect:  As far as I researched, the problem is the encoding of the string, because if I do this:The string is converted correctly and I get : . But in the case the text be arabic, this doesn't work. And I didn't figure out what's it's the correctly encode for Arabic text, because those that appear en encoding python documentation didn't worked.Anyway the problem it's more general, because I don't have chances to know how is the text, I only have the part of the url where the text lies.The curious fact is that hardcoding the string in any type of text in my code, works properly.So, anyone knows a way to properly encode and decode this URL to a string in the right way ?Thanks,Gonza.
I figured out, that the problem was work with an outdated urllib.Recently I tried with the urllib for Python 3 that lies in my computer and worked perfectly. Was my mistake for no checking what I was using.And I managed to import the parse.py in my code :D Now I only do
