I have a list that can contain several elements of different types.I need to check if in this list there is one or more elements of a specific type and get its index.I can achieve this goal by simply iterate over my list and check the type of each element:Is there a more pythonic way to accomplish the same result?
You can use  and a generator expression:The advantage of this solution is that it is lazy like your current one: it will only check as many items as are necessary.Also, I used  instead of  because it is the preferred method of typechecking in Python. See PEP 0008.Finally, it should be noted that this solution will raise a  exception if the desired item is not found.  You can catch this with a try/except, or you can specify a default value to return:In this case,  will be returned if nothing is found.
You can use list comprehension.Get all elements of type string:Get all indexes of elements of type string:
