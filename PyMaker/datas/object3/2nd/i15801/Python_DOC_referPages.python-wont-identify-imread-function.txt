I am using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu and I was experimenting with images before beginning an assignment for my algorithms class. I have downloaded numpy, scipy and skimage packages and I keep getting the error that 'imread' 'title' and these inbuilt functions are undefined. Any idea what could be wrong?
Try adding:to your imports.
Where is the imread function imported from? You can easily see all functions within an imported library. See- allhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/139180/listing-all-functions-in-a-python-moduleIf you are looking for SciPy's imread, you must do it along these lines...ororPython does not inherently know what the title function or imread functions/methods are without having it spelled out explicitly. Importing requires you import each function/class/library etc with respect to scope. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html Also - first comment is correct. You will need PIL installed to use the imread function.
