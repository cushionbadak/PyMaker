This:in Python2.7 produces the expected result, i.e., for each call it prints the argument, followed by the list of results of matching against each re.  However, in Python3 the output is:i.e., it seems to forget the contents of  after the first call.  What?
Because, in Python 3.x,  doesn't return a list, but an iterator.Return an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable, yielding the results. So, once the iterator is exhausted, it cannot be used again. In your first call to , the  iterator is exhausted. So, further iteration with  loop, in the subsequent  calls, will exit immediately.To fix this, you can explicitly create a list, like thisOr you can use list comprehension, like this
