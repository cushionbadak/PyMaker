You can use  and  to dynamically assign variables.
It was already discussed here:Using a string variable as a variable nameIn particular, something like this should work:
You can try using a dictionary, with the keys being a_true, ect and the values being the numbers.dict={}dict['a_true']=35etcor you can do the whole thing in a loop.
You can through list of letters and concatenate every letter with '_true'Output: In case you need to concatenate it with all letter (Upper case + Lower case.)That would give you: UPDATEIf you wanna create variable with name 'a_true'. This is not the best to do it. However, you can use Dictionaries. It's a way to map variable using  to get . In this example. we add 'a_true' as a key, to get a value. would give you:  would give you:
