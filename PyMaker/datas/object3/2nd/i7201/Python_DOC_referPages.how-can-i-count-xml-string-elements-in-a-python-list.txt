The problem:Write a function, , that takes as its argument a list of  strings. It should return a count of how many of those strings are XML  tags. You can tell if a string is an XML tag if it begins with a left  angle bracket "<" and end with a right angle bracket ">".def tag_count(tokens):    count = 0    for token in tokens:        if token[0] == '<' and token[-1] == '>':            count += 1    return count    list1 = ['', 'Hello World!', '']    count = tag_count(list1)    print("Expected result: 2, Actual result: {}".format(count))My results are always . What am I doing wrong?
