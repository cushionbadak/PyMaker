When adding boolean expressions in python, it seems that enclosing them in parentheses casts them into  when you add them, but not doing so maintains their types:Why is this? It seems to me that parentheses should only be used to change the order of operations (except for some cases where you use parentheses to define tuples), not the type of the contents, so I would expect:
This is integer addition, since  is an integer instance.   doesn't define addition, so  is resolved on the parent class .This is a chained comparison, it's  in disguise.This is a regular comparison, it's  in disguise.
