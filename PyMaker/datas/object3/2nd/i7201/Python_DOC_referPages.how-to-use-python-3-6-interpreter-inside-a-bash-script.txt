I want to have a little script, that will find, run and report about all the tests in the folder, like this one:But, when I run it, I get some errors, which I do not get on Windows (like using of  without an argument). As I've understood, it's connected with the fact, that build-in and default version of Python on Linux is 2.x, whereas I am using 3.6. How should I change the script, so it would use Python 3.6 interpreter?EDIT:So here's one of the files with tests that I run:And the error:
First, install it for your python3 (if you have it and  installed)Then, in order to run coverage for python3, run So your final script should look like this:Also you can replace  with path to your pythons bin. For example . So You can call it this way as well:
The problem is that the  command on your Linux host has been installed for Python 2.  That is, somewhere there exists a  script that starts with:And on your system,  is python 2.The best solution here is probably to set up a Python 3 virtual environment for running your tests (and then installing  into that virtualenv).  You may also want to investigate tox, which will handle this for you automatically.
