So this is the default behavior when you give a bad variable name:what I'm looking for is something like:( is automatically assigned None)I'm using this on dynamic parameter handling and would like to use a behavior that if the parameter is not given, a default value is being used. And I have some code that I don't have control of that have used  handling. Is it possible for me to just add some dynamic header like below and save the mess by not changing all other code?Edit: A way to do the specific problem above, is to provide a default option, let's say:This assumes that a default parameter table is available. Is it still doable when you don't even have the default parameter table or it's not possible to generate one (infinite possible parameters like print())?Edit: To center the question into methodology I have rephrased the title and removed reference to override NameError.
I don't think Python offers something like that. However, you could always do:If you are trying to define a function, I would define it like this:You can call this as both  or .
