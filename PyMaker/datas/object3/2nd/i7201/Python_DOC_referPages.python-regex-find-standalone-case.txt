Natural Text
I have a string of time for example:I want to only find the first standalone '2010', but applying the following code:will also find the second '2010' embedded in the mm/dd/yyyy format.Is there a way to achieve this (not using the ';' sign)?
You can use  to find only the first occurrence:From the documentation:Scan through  looking for  the first location where the regular expression  produces a  match, and return a corresponding match object. Return  if no  position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is  different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the  string.Emphasis mine.
I don't know if you have to use regex but  in Python3 will return the lowest index of the start of the string you are looking for. From there if you know the length of the string which I assume you do you can extrapolate it out with a slice of the string with another line of code.  Not sure if it's better or worse than regex but it seems less complex version that does the same thing for this occurrence.  Here is a stack overflow about it and here is the python docs on it
