I created my own array class and implemented the imul() method, but when i call the *= operation on an instance, the instance itself became a NoneType object. Any idea why it worked that way ?
Just because you printed a valid result, doesn't mean thats how the method will return the data. It does modify the data, but since you have no return, the actual value will be None. You can , and it will work
