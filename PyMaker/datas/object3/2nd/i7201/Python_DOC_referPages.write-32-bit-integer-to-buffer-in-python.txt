I'm trying to write 32 bit integer to byte array (which is Node.js buffer).As i know, Node.js Buffer objects  function returns array of pseudo-randomly generated numbers encoded in hexadecimal format.So i interpreted Node.js  method in Python:But then,  function has its own nested functions  and , I have read the official documentation, But i didn't understand what was exactly returned from these functions.Is there any equivalent method for these Node.js functions in Python? As i know equal action in Python can be done with  module and  method works too, But i'm not sure how. Thanks in advance.
Python provides methods like  See hereSo in order to convert number to 32 bit we take length in to_bytes method to be 4 i.e . function converts the bytes to int See here Default representation in bytes is signed representation of integer.From docs :  You can check out the hex representation to converting to integer
