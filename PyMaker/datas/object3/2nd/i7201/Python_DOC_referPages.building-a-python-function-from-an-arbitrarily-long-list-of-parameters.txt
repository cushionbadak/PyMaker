I am trying to construct a python lambda function from either a single parameter or a list, and am unsure what syntax to use to build the lambda:The lambda should check if x is an instance of any number of classes that is passed to the function (either one or many).Is there a general way to build functions from an arbitrary number of parameters in python, maybe as a kind of comprehension? 
You could loop over your  args using .Although I'd prefer just passing in a  of classesand calling the function as
If you want to check that an object is an instance of any listed class, you don't need to define anything:From  documentation :If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such  tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types.In your question, you mention , it would mean that you should  instead of  in your boolean logic. If you want to check that an object is an instance of every listed classes, see the answer with .
