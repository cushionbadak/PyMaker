I'm looking for a formatted byte string literal. Specifically, something equivalent toPossibly something like .Does such a thing exist?
No.  The idea is explicitly dismissed in the PEP:For the same reason that we don't support , you may  not combine  with  string literals. The primary problem  is that an object's  method may return Unicode data  that is not compatible with a bytes string.Binary f-strings would first require a solution for  . This idea has been proposed in the past, most  recently in PEP 461. The discussions of such a feature usually  suggest eitheradding a method such as  so an object can control   how it is converted to bytes, orhaving  not be as general purpose or extensible   as .Both of these remain as options in the future, if such functionality  is desired.
From python 3.6.2 this percent formatting for bytes works:
This was one of the bigger changes made from python 2 to python3.  They handle unicode and strings differently.   This s how you'd convert to bytes.This is how you'd decode to string. I had a better appreciation for the difference between Python 2 versus 3 change to unicode through this coursera lecture by Charles Severence.  You can watch the entire 17 minute video or fast forward to somewhere around 10:30 if you want to get to the differences between python 2 and 3 and how they handle characters and specifically unicode. I understand your actual question is how you could format a string that has both strings and bytes.  Here you could see that I have a string a variable and a bytes variable.  This is how you would combine a byte and string into one string.
