I have to convert a number to a list depending on its decimal value. For example, the number () would be  because  and  are  and  respectively.How can I do that? 
Here's a basic approach:You could also do this iteratively, but likely it won't be necessary unless you are dealing with very large integers. Note, the above function takes  input, so pass it  if you want to start with a string.Note the way this generalizes:Dispensing with the decimal literals, using hexadeciml literals:
For an iterative approach:Or in one line:This uses shifting and bit masking to extract each byte, and uses the length of the integer in bits to determine how long the list should be.
If you're using Python 3, then the  method does most of what you need:That  is the number of bytes in the output; it's a required argument. You can compute how many bytes you need for a given  using the  method:And a larger example:
So, you're trying to convert you decimal integer to a hex digits pair. For small (16-bit decimal ints), you can do it like this:
