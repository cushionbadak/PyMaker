I have a superclass as below:And I worked on a subclass:When run test cases:a = Bag() a.insert(3) a.insert(5) b = Bag() b.insert(5) b.insert(5)b.insert(5) print(a+b)My output is:{3: 1, 5: 4}However, the expected output should be:3:15:4How could I get the right format output? Thank you very much!
Currently your  function returns a normal dict instead of an instance of . Instead of that you can use the  with a new instance of  and return it.Demo:You may also want to checkout bag data-structure() provided by Python's standard lib for other functionalities possible with it.
Because once you add  and  you no longer have a , just a regular dict. If you want addition of Bags to return another Bag, you have to modify your  function accordingly, such that it returns a  as opposed to , which is just a regular dict.
