I want to create a simple Python based utility which can get all the download URLs from a web page and download the content. I found several methods of doing this and the best I found was "urllib". But unfortunately the problem with me is I can't save those with the proper extensions as the URLs look like below,But the content can be in different formats i.e. .mp3, .ogg etc. How can I identify the type and save these contents with the correct extension. 
You can use  and ,The idea is to extract  HTTP header and ask to  to guess related extension.I will use this question's URL as example (it doesn't provide extension)Output:A  header is like: , but only the first part () is expected by , that's why I splitted it.
