I have a list of objects with multiple attributes. I want to filter the list based on one attribute of the object (country_code), i.e.Current listDesired listI can achieve this by creating a dictionary and a for-loop, but I feel like there's an easier way in python using the filter() or reduce() functions, I just can't figure out how.Can anyone simplify the below code using in-built python functions? Performance is a big factor because the real data will be substantial.Working code:Worth noting I have also tried the code below, but it performs worse than the current working code:
I think your first approach is already pretty close to being optimal. Dictionary lookup is fast (just as fast as in a ) and the loop is easy to understand, even though a bit lengthy (by Python standards), but you should not sacrifice readability for brevity.You can, however, shave off one line using , and you might want to use  so that the elements in the resulting list are in their orginal order. Also, note that in Python 3,  is not a list but a view on the dict.If you really, really want to use , you can use the empty dict as an initializer and then use  to set the value (if not present) and return the modified dict.I would just use the loop, though.
I think that your approach is just fine. It would be slightly better to check  instead of .However, here is another way to do it with a list comprehension:The last bit abuses the fact that  and  returns .
