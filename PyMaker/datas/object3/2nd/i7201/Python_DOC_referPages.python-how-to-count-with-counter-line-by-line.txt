Natural Text
I have the following code which opens a text file that contains comma separated numbers.The results are:What I am trying to accomplish is for the program to read the first line, run Counter to check the number of times a number appears, then read the second line, re-Count (i.e. add count to previous count).Where am I going wrong? It's currently not even counting the numbers, since there are more than 1 instances of "1".
Is that right code you want?
