I move dictionary  What is the best way to loop through each user by adding 1? So the next user would be user2.Thanks  
Instead of assigning user1 as the variable name for the dictionary you could create a new dictionary variable where the key is the user and the value is a nested dictionary with all of the information about the users like this:Then you can iterate over the nested dictionary for all users user1, user2,...userN instead of assigning each user to its own variable.Update:Here's how you would then loop across the nested dictionary:where k is the key ('user1', 'user2' etc.) and v is the nested dictionary containing the information for the user.
You can do that, using  or  depending on your scope:But as stated in the comments, I would recommend using a list:

The below is also a valid dict to convert to json.user1 is users[0], user2 is users[1] ...users.append({...}) to add more etc.And if you loop and want the user number:Prints:
