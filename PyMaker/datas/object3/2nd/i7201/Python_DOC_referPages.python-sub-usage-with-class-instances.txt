Can anyone explain how the above code works. Can't get my head around it.I understand that  is an operator overloader in python and intercepts the p1-p2 call. But how does it work with two separate instances of class ?
 is supposed to be the magic method equivalent of  arithmetic operator, so not sure why you're adding them... That aside, when you do , it is the same as . The  function is invoked on , the calculation made and the new  object returned.
Now you edited the question, the answer is simple:You have two points as arguments , so, self, obviously in your example would be , and other is , after doing all the calculation, you return a new Point, so,  and  are not modified.Important adviceThe most rare thing, is that you call it , but indeed, you are actually adding! I mean, please... either change the method definition and replace + by -, or change ... just a piece of advice.
