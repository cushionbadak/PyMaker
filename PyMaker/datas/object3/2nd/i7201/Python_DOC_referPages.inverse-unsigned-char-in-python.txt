I have the code in C++:where ASCII2Hex is a function which translate ASCII code of a char to HEX. I must write the same in Python so I do this:But how should I implement (~LRC) + 1 since LRC is a unsigned char, in my case it is int, I can use some module like ctypes or struct, but when I do it like this: it does not give me result I am expecting. , and I though I should get , but I am getting  so it does not give the same result like code in C++. How can I convert it the correct way? Thank you in advance!P.S. output of C++ program is giving I am trying to get the same with Python 3EDIT 1in C program gives . and it is the same I can get in my Python code. but gives  and I do not know what should I do to get the same in Python..EDIT 2ASCII2Hex function:
The easy way to do this is to let  do most of the work. We just have to send it a  string, not a text string.outputWe can make that function much more compact, although the result is less readable:We can easily do  in Python, but we have to be careful, for two reasons. Firstly, Python doesn't have unsigned integers, secondly, Python's integers are of unlimited precision. But we can deal with both of those things by supplying a suitable mask. If we want to restrict the result to 8 bits we can use a mask of :outputOr we can do the addition after inverting the bits but before we do the masking:
You can simply AND with 0xff to force the result back into the unsigned char range:
