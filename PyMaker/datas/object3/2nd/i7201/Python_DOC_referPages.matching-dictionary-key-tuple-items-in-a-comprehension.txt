When using a comprehension expression that scans a dictionary,if I know the keys of the dictionary are simple 2 items tuples,is it possible to "expand" them to named  variables?e.g. if I have: I know I can do and getBut this loses a lot of the semantics and I wanted to know if I can somehow do something more like:(which I know does not work).Also I don't understand why the error returned for the last expression is: 
I would go with:as the clearest solution.The error you are getting is because when using the  keyword python is trying to assign an item from  dictionary to  which is a literal means create a new dictionary. instead, use  as this is how python expands dict items.
You can't quite do that, but you can get close if you "upgrade" your keys to namedtuples. I'm using 'kind' as the name of the first item in the namedtuple because  is a built-in type, and although we can safely use it here I think it'd make the code a bit confusing.outputActually, you don't really need namedtuples, although I think they make it a bit nicer. ;)
It is possible. Try:this returns
