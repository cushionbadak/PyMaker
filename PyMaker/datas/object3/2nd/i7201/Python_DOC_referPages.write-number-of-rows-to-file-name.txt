I dont have any idea how to update my code below to the level that I can write the amount of changed row - in the CSV - to the file name. I have did some stuff with count and row, but it is making any sense.  Can somebody give me some tips
This could be done using the  library to create your list of CSV files. Use  to take then existing filename and split it into a filename and extension, the number of rows can then be easily added using a  statement as follows:You were already creating a list of rows to be written, so once this list is complete, you will know how many rows there are. With this you can then open the output file with the number of rows added to the name, and write all the rows to it.
