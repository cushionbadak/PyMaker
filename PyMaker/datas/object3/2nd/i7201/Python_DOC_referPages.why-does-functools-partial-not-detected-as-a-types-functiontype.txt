In my code I need to detect if a variable is a function or not and preform some actions on it. Everything went well until I now created a partial function using  and suddenly some of my tests fail:Why is there a difference between those? Both varieties are callable... Even more importantly, how can I detect if some variable is a function or not even when it's a partial function if I can't use ?
 is a class with a  method, it says in the documents:Return a new  object which when called will behave like func(bold emphasis added by me)We can confirm this in our Python REPL:A Python equivalent would be something like this:So it creates a simple wrapper object around the function, and an object like this simply isn't a function.  only works on actual functions.What you're looking for is a way to check if an object is callable, for that you can use the built-in  function:
In most cases, you don't need to know if something is a function.  Frequently, all you care about is that the object is callable.  To check this, python has a builtin function called .Note that just because  returns , it does not mean that calling the object will succeed.  However, the same could easily be said for calling functions :-).If you really only want to handle functions and  objects, then you can write your check as:But this isn't sufficiently "ducky" for my tastes.
