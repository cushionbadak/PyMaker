I have read few articles and saw videos of Lane Detection and thus decided to learn how it worksI'm completely new to OpenCV so kindly forgive me for dumb Doubts.I took Udacity Opensource Project to develop Lane Detection,but I'm not able to execute the code. I 'm getting a value error which I'm not able to understandCode:The Resulting Error:I'm using python2.7Please Guide me.Your Sincerely,Vidit Shah
One possibility is dividing by zero creating Nans when you calculate gradient; try filtering out for . This potential source of errors will crop up only rarely.The most important issue is that the threshold is set too high in the Hough transform (at 55) for the structure of your code. If the Hough Lines stage does not identify lines then you will not be able to plot them.You can get around this by either lowering the threshold (and losing quality in your line-detection for the cases when it does work) or adjusting something else in your code, for example using error handling or pre-processing the image differently so that there will always be lines output by the Hough step.
