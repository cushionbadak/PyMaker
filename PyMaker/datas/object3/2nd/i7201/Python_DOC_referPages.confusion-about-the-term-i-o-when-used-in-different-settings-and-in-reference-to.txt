It seems when I google what I\O is,  I get hits that show it stands for "Input" and "Output".I see blogs on Python titled, "Python File I\O --Part 19, Advanced File Input and Output "If I go to the Python docs  and search for input/output:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlThe examples are limited to print statements and reading/writing files.I see no examples of web-services or networking as Input/Output in the "Input and Output" section of the Python docs, despiteseeing  the term I/O used often with these concepts. Is I/O containing the same meaning when referring to web-services and networks as well? I've been doing a lot of reading on the GIL and multi-threading recently andthe term  has popped up in addition to .I/O bound seems to refer to a state where there is a lot of CPU idleness, due to the slowness of getting data to the CPU. Multi-threading seems to be used often with Webservices and Networking because I'm assuming there is a lot of CPU idleness, i.e I/O bound heavy tasks because you are always for waiting a user-input to act upon.Now are the  statements as well read/write files also considered I/O bound tasks?Finally, the term  has also popped up in the Python Docs regarding GIL:"The GIL is controversial because it prevents multithreaded CPython programs from taking full advantage of multiprocessor systems in certain situations.    Note that potentially blocking or long-running operations,, such as I/O image processing, and NumPy number crunching, happen outside the GIL. Therefore it is only in multithreaded programs that spend a lot of time inside the GIL, interpreting CPython bytecode, that the GIL becomes a bottleneck."So the reference to I/O in this text, says that all I/O tasks bypass the GIL --so does that mean  etc -- all these types of tasks bypass the GIL and are can be exploited by multithreading? Thank you. 
Yes, I/O stands for Input/Output. This is from the point of view of your program. Input can come from many different sources, such as a keyboard, mouse, or network connection. Similarly, Output can be sent to many different sources. Most programming languages define input and output operations which can work with a variety of sources and destinations. This makes is much easier to write code because we just receive and send data without worrying about the details of where it comes from or goes to.
