I want to know if someone knows of a python function that returns a combination of columns without repetition. For exampleEven if its a custom function you have made I would like to see it and understand the logic behind it. Also if possible I want functions from modules readily available in python by default so don't want something like numpy where I have to manually install it via pip.Thanks :)
You can use  and exclude items in the same column after generating column indices using :You can generalize this for multiple rows and columns by checking that no column in each combination is repeated:
For larger square matrices, you could take use permutations of columns:Regarding the last line: given an  matrix, there are exactly  ways to pick an element from each row without ever picking two or more from any column: You have  choices in the first row,  in the second, etc. Hence, each combination that meets your requirement is pinned down by a permutation.  gives a list of all valid indexes. For a given index ,  gives a list corresponding to that index.
