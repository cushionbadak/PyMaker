Does anyone know how can I convert unix timestamp to readable dates in Python? I've been using this:but it gets taxing when I have to convert many.Appreciate the help.
I think some of the confusion around this question stems from the word "Taxing", people often assume that this means from a computation time perspective but I suspect that you have not yet learned about for loopsIn essence, you need to capture the timestamps in some kind of iterable, given that you are using a csv I suggest you look at the csv python module. Then you can iterate over the iterable:

If time format isn't really important to you, this will do:Example of usage:Example generates a list with timestamps (ready-to-use data). Next we convert timestamps (in loop) and print them. Code processes (generates, converts and prints) 200 timestamps faster than I can blink, 1k timestamps in less than 0.5 second and 100k in less than 12 seconds. Tested on old PC.
