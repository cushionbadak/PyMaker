I have a binary file containing the position of 8000 particles. I know that each particle value should look like "-24.6151..." (I don't know with which precision the values are given by my program. I guess it is double precision(?).But when I try to read the file with this code:I get as output:I skip the whole list of values but as you can see those values are far away from what I expect. I think I have some kind of decoding error.I would appreciate any kind of help :) 
What you are printing now are the  composing your floating point data. So it doesn't make sense as numerical values.Of course, there's no 100% sure answer since we didn't see your data, but I'll try to guess:You have 8000 values to read and the file size is 64000. So you probably have  IEEE values (8 bytes each). If it's not IEEE, then you're toast.In that case you could try the following:if the data is printed bogus, it's probably an endianness problem. So change the  by  or .for reference and packing/unpacking formats: https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html
