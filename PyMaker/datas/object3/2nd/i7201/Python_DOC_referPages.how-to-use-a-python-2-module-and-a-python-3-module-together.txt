I want to be able to make calls to both this Python 2 API and this Python 3 API from the same code.There is a Python 2 version of the latter API but its surface is too small. No Python 3 version of the former.I found this document that seems to suggest the only way to make them compatible is by manually making several changes to the code, which, since I learned python a couple of days ago, is likely to lead to a host of errors and problems.Other ideas to access both APIs together also welcome.Much appreciated.
That bitso-py library is just a Python wrapper for a REST API. If the library is not compatible with Python 3, you can make the relevant REST calls directly using something like the  library.
