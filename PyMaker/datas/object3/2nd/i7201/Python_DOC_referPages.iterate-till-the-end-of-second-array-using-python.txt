I have done something like this:  I was just tryig to replace the equivalent tuple value with the array value, without changing the associated numbers. But the list only goes till the len of array  and not . What I want to get as output is something like this:  
Just add the unprocessed tail of  to the processed part:
You can use :Check the doc
If it's acceptable to mutate the original  list, I'd simply replace the first  tuples by iterating on :Note that Python tuples are immutable.  would fail with the error:TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignmentThe above code modifies the  list in place by replacing old tuples with new ones. It cannot modify the old tuples.
I think the problem is the zip function. The documentation says that (zip) "Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted."  should do the trick
