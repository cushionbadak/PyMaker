I have a PostgreSQL database table that has a JSON datatype column. When I store JSON strings in the database,  is not preserved. This can be reproduced with this code snippet:The output of this Python code is:How can I store  as a key in the JSON column? The JSON object also has keys for  and , so the value stored must be  or .
From RFC 7159:An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets  surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members).  A name is a  string.And from the Python docs:Keys in key/value pairs of JSON are always of the type str. When a  dictionary is converted into JSON, all the keys of the dictionary are  coerced to strings.JSON does not have any concept of non-string dict keys. If you want those, you don't want JSON. The closest you'll get with JSON is detecting the string  gets converted to and hoping that you never need to actually use the string  as a dict key.
