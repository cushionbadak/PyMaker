Given a list:I'd like a one-liner to return a new list:
Another trick is first to join the list with underscores and then re-split it:
Just use 2  clauses in your comprehension, e.g.:
This is not a one liner, but is nevertheless a valid option to consider if you want to return a generator:Original answer valid only for versions Python 3.3-3.7, kept here for interested readers. Do not use!
using the  recipe to flatten a list you could do this:...or does the import statement violate your one-liner requirement?
Since so many answers here were posted (over ten), I thought it'd be beneficial to show some timing stats to compare the different methods posted:Here's the script I used to test:Each method is tested against the sample list given in the question about one million times. To keep things readable, each timing result was rounded to four decimal places.Note: If you have a new, unique method that has not been posted here yet, contact me in the comments and I'll try to add a timing for it too.
Split each item into sublists and flatten them:
One-liners are over-rated. Here's a solution using a "traditional"  loop.outputThis also works:It's shorter, but I think the previous version is clearer.
You can do:
This works:
You can try this:Output:
