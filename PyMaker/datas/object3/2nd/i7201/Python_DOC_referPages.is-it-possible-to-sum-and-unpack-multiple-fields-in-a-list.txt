My code is becoming incredibly verbose in certain areas, and it would be nice if there was a more Pythonic way to accomplish the following task:I'm still new to Python, but I know about some tricks, like I could cut the lines I'm writing in half with...but I don't want to sacrifice performance by re-iterating my lists over and over again just to save SLOC. What I'd like to do is something like this...I've tried several versions of this but I keep getting syntax errors. Is there any way to do this in Python?
IIUC, you want to have  sum up 3 fields in parallel. This is just not possible with the current builtin. I'd recommend the best, and possibly the only option without resorting to any other libraries: a  loop.If you want to get creative, and account for an unknown number of attributes, you can use a  to store your totals and  to dynamically access fields.This is still roughly linear because the inner loop is constant in size.If you want to  in one line, I'm afraid this isn't possible unless you go for a number crunching library like numpy.An example:
The  function just only return one number. Maybe you can write one function to return many numbers:
If you're somehow opposed to using an explicit loop here and don't want to rely on additional third party libraries, you could take a functional approach and use something like .
