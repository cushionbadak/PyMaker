I was playing around with enums. In particular, I took this bit of code from the  docs:Then, call  on :As you can see, there are two identical attributes -  and  there.From the docs of :[...] With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for  that object.So why does  register  as having identical attributes with the same name and how do they differ?
 is basically just , and  can return pretty much anything. Enums have a custom  implementation that has changed a few times; in 3.4, that  implementation accidentally put  and  in the list twice, once explicitly and once from an MRO search.
