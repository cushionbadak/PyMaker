I have a data set as the following:input file:and I need Python code to print out all the possible pair combinations of  values with common .  There are millions of id and corresponding addr value records in the main test file. So, the code should be able to read columns from a text file.The output will be as follows (only showing for 301 and 302, the rest will continue the pattern):So far I have done the following, but I do not have any idea how to code the pair combination part. I am new in Python, so will appreciate if someone can help me do the coding with a little bit of explanation.
How about something like this:Prints:Alternatively we can put the values in a Dictionary:output prints:meanwhile output2 outputs:update2 or 3: Is this the desired output??
How about this (if you don't care about duplicates)? [Live Demo]Output:
This problem can be split up into two parts. First, construct a dictionary that maps identifiers to lists of addresses. Second, generate the length-2 combinations of each of these lists.
