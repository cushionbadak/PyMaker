I read the Python Logging HOWTO, and there is a description I don't understand:If you want to set the logging level from a command-line option such  as:and you have the value of the parameter passed for  in some variable loglevel, you can use:to get the value which youâ€™ll pass to  via the level argument.What does it mean? There is no example, it would be nice if someone could give one.Can I set the logging level like this?
The assumption is that you are using something like  to define command line arguments:The argument to the  option should then be one of the level constants defined in the  module;  would then be a way to get that value for a string.
