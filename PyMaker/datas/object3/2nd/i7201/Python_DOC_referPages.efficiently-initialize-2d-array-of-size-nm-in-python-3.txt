I am using Python 3 and am trying to create 2D integer arrays of a known and fixed size. How can I do this?The arrays I have in mind are the Python-provided , although I am not averse to using a library like NumPy.I know this can be done via lists, but I want to use an array since they are much more space efficient. Right now, I am initializing lists in this way, but I want to replace it with an array:For example, in C, I would writeHow can I do this in Python
You can use numpy:For example:Note that if you specifically need integers, you should use the  argument
The numpy equivalent of the code you posted is: reserves uninitialized space, so it is slightly faster than , because  has to make sure that everything is initially set to 0.Note that, like in C/C++, you should write values before reading them, because they initially "contain garbage".Docs:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.empty.htmlhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html
