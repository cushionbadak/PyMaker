However when I run shell or any other script with django context from other directory I get the following result:notice scripts appended before /media which results in an error when I try to access the file from scripts directory.my models:Is this some kind of bug or is FileField's path supposed to depend on folder from which I'm trying to access it.
Django's  uses  to get files location. On the other hand  calls  to get the path. This is what causes path to be relative to current directory, which is useful in local environment.If you want to set it to some absolute location you need to set  setting.
