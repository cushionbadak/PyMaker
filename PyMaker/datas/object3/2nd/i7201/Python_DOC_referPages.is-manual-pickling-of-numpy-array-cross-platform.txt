I use python3 to pickle a dictionary that contains text keys to text or  (linked list) with an integer .Is that file cross platform (over machines that installed python3, scipy, and numpy) ?Is pickled dictionary containing just text and numpy array cross platform?pickle is cross-platform: Is pickle file of python cross-platform?numpy's  file format is cross platform: Is numpy.save cross platform? ... Not sure about what happens if I manually pickle a numpy array. I checked on two different machines with intel cpu for an integer numpy array and the values remain the same.manual pickling a numpy array:
Manual pickling of numpy array with integer dtype if we don't have to fix import.This is because if the an object has a reduce method, pickle will use it.'s doc https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.reduce.html"How numpy ndarray get pickled" does not reference the source code: How does Python 3 know how to pickle extension types, especially Numpy arrays?In anceint time, Pickling with protocol 0 is not portable for floats, NaN, Inf:https://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2010-May/075980.htmlOfficial doc on pickling floats on python 3.1 with text protocol:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.htmlThe new algorithm depends on certain features in the underlying  floating point implementation. If the required features are not found,  the old algorithm will continue to be used. Also, the text pickle  protocols assure cross-platform portability by using the old  algorithm.numpy's source code for writing to a file is in  and (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.13.0/numpy/lib/format.py,https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.13.0/numpy/lib/npyio.py#L435-L512)The header can be saved as text.The data is simply a  if pickling argument is true, which is the default value for .In , I found:pickle.dump(array, fp, protocol=2, **pickle_kwargs) also says:The  format is the standard binary file format in NumPy for  persisting a single arbitrary NumPy array on disk. The format stores  all of the shape and dtype information necessary to reconstruct the  array correctly even on another machine with a different architecture.So manual pickling of numpy array is cross platform (if we don't have to fix imports) because  also use pickle and is cross platform. uses protocol 2. The  is 3 for the two python 3 on the two machines.
