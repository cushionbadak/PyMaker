So I have a program that rips my movie collection but I'm trying to automate it further. My purpose is to search through each folder and look for a ".mkv" file and if it's found move it to the root folder then delete the original folder.I have gotten this to work and it's operational but I'm curious how it could be wrote better. Is there a way to essentially do this pseudo code?The folder structure isHere is my code that works.
Keep a mapping of extensions to destination pathsThe nice thing about this is the support for multiple extensions in the future.Check the extension by splitting with Using , you can specify the destination as a directory. That simplifies things to check if a directory is empty. Otherwise, errors will be thrown (if the directory isn't empty)
