If I had:How would I create a new dict with the keys of the first dict and the items of the list, resulting in this?
To bring the keys of adict together the values from alist use the zip() function.I've used ordered dictionaries here because the question only makes sense if the dictionaries are OrderedDicts; otherwise, you can't guarantee the pairwise one-to-one correspondence between adict and alist.
