I am learning regex of python.I would like to check the words in a file are replaced by re.sub() function.My code above uses re.search() but I am afraid that it is redundant because re.sub and re.search scans the same 'line' independently. Are there any easier way to check whether the words in the file are really replaced or not? Thank you very much.
See re.subn:Perform the same operation as , but return a tuple .For example:
you can compare old with new string
