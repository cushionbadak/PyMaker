Basically im making a small piece of code to remove the end character of a string until the string passes .I used http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html to see why I wasn't getting any output, it passed a + symbol as a digit, just like the numbers 6 and 0.Am I doing something wrong or does python treat  as a digit?
 is a method not an attribute, so (as was already mentioned in the comments) you need to call it.Also you check each character (starting from the left side) for  but if it's not passing the  test you remove a character from the right side. That doesn't seem right. You probably wanted to iterate over the  (or using slicing: ).But you also could simplify the logic by using a  loop:
