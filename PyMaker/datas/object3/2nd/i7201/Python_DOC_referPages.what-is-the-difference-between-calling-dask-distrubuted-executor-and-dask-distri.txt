I have a question about the concurrent futures gist from the dask documentation: https://gist.github.com/mrocklin/ef9ccd29a6ec5f4de84d6192be95042aWhen we instantiate an Executor, does that mean it instantiates a scheduler as well? The repr of the executor says So what is the difference between calling Client() and Executor()? The documentation seems to be very similar if not the same. In the concurrent futures examples some first instantiate a Client and then an Executor with the IP address of the Client.
They are exactly the same.  Executor is an older name for Client.Originally Dask used the term  to match the concurrent.futures API.  However this term was confusing for Spark users, for which  was used for their worker equivalent.  We changed the term  to  in 2016 and will eventually deprecate this term.
