I am curious whether there is a better way to achieve something like this?My intentions are to avoid unnecessary boilerplate. The provided example is obviously just simple enough to let the others understand what I had on my mind.
I'm going to presume that  won't suffice here (for both your example classes that value is equal to the parameter value you passed in).To set up per-class values at class-definition time, as of Python 3.6 you can use the  classmethod: is called for all new subclasses, and any parameters you specify in the  line are passed into that method, letting you parameterise that specific subclass.
I think you're better off with simple inheritance and a class variable:This looks cleaner to me (especially if you have more variables than just one), and uses less "advanced" features (i.e. someone reading your code doesn't have to google how  works).Also it works for both Python 2 and 3:If you were to use , you could even have it default to the class's name and be overriddable with a simple class variable. This prevents you from using the same name for the class and instance variables though, so you'd have to use something like :Usage example:
