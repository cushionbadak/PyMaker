Problem:Iam working on a feed generator which collects feeds from various online sources and I need to divide them into domains ,urls and ip addresses.According to my logic i can be able to differentiate them into ips and rest.And on applying regex on the remaining i thought of differentiating them into domains and urls but all are going to domain list and not to urls.CodeWhat I triedTo differentiate ip addresses i used socket library and used socket.inet_aton method to verify whether it is valid ip or not, if it is valid ip address then iam appending to list.I took some help from regex tutorial and wrote the regex to differentiate the domains Solution I wanted (Edited)Wrongly Asked. What I wanted is extract the domain names from urls  and find domain_name as  and sent it to domain list and also send the full url to url_list.Suppose item is www.google.com it should send google.com to domain list and www.google.com to url list.suppose item is abc.net it should send to domain list and not to url list.Any suggestions on how to solve this ?
