simply try this,First list your directory filessplit file by and take first argument.
You can use os.listdir which take path as argument and return a list of files and directories in it.With that list, you only have to do a comprehension list which split each element on '.' (dot), take all the elements except the last one an join them with '.' (dot) and check if the element is a file using os.path.file().
