This is my piece of code with two generators defined:When I execute:The result is as expected:However, if I execute:The result is:Why? I thought any generator can be used only once.
 is not a generator, it's a function. What it returns when you call it is a generator, a brand new one each time you call it. Each time you put parenthesis like this:It is a brand new generator to be iterated on. If however you were to first doand iterate over  twice, the second time will fail as you expect.
no, you can not iterate over a generator twice. a generator is exhausted once you have iterated over it. you may make a copy of a generator with  though:for the other issues see Ofer Sadan's answer.
Why? I thought any generator can be used only once.Because every call to three_line_gen() creates a new generator.Otherwise, you're correct that generators only run forward until exhausted.Can generator be used more than once?Yes, it is possible if the results are buffered outside the generator.  One easy way is to use itertools.tee():
Because in One liner is  Object while the three liner is a .They meant to be different.These two are similar.
Yes, generator can be used only once. but you have two generator object.And the result is:
