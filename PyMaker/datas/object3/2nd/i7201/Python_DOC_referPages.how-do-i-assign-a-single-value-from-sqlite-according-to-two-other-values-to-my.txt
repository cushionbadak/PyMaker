I'm trying to create a simple online login form using Python and SQLite3:The email and password values entered into the html form are assigned to the  and  variables respectively. What I'm trying to do is, once the user logs in, he is greeted with a welcome message ("Welcome, UserName!").My question is, how do I assign the  value from my SQLite database table to my Python variable ?I've also tried this code:But that gives me an error:  There are 15 rows in my database. I'm assuming that the criteria () isn't being applied.How do I fix this?

If there is only one column in the row, you will still get a 1-element tuple back. You need to unpack the tuple first in order to fix this:
