I am fairly new to Python, but i was wondering if i could utilize Python and its modules. To retrieve a href from page 1, and then the first paragraph in page 2.Q2: Also, how could I scrape the first 10 link hrefs with the same div class on page one, and then scrape the first 10 paragraphs, while looping?
Yes, I believe you should be able to.Try to lookup the requests and beautifulsoup python modules.
There are two python modules that I would use for this: requests and regular expressions. I would use requests to get the website raw html and then use a regex to get for example your paragraph:the requests line here is self-explanatory and the regex says look for the first  tag then the brackets mean return just this bit of  which is as many  of any charachters  up to  the closing  tag. Finally the re.DOTALL just means that it will math newlines as part of the lookup
An alternative to using beautifulsoup would be to use the webbrowser module.With the webbrowser module you can open in the default webbrowser or even specify a preferred browser to open (using the default is preferable, however, as of course there is no guarantee that the user's preference will match yours!)So you could open a url like so:or like this:Unfortunately, if you just stick a hashtag (for an anchor) onto the end of a url, webbrowser doesn't seem to like this. Instead you should define your anchor using a variable and pass it into a function as a parameter:There are more webbrowser examples on this pageHope this helps
