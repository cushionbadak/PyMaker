This question already has an answer here:Convert string representation of list to list                    14 answers                I have a string likeand want to convert this into a list likeI have tried various methods of slicing the string into a list, but while that does work, it is keeping  and  as strings, while also being unable to change easily for different lists.Is there an easier way, aside from massive  loops and slicing? 
Not that I'm advocating for the use of , you can just doI'll suggest that you instead use , a "safer" .
If it just contains primitive objects (like strings, integers and such like) you can use :
Consider the  function for a direct conversion.  If you care to do your own processing, then try this:Output:Can you finish from there?  Each element is a string image of the value you want.  For the true strings, you'll have to strip off the extra quotation marks; for the numeric values, you'll have to use .To tell which is which, try the  method.
