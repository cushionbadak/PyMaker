I think the specific thing you're trying to do can be done like this:But you should also look at the Django testing documentation, if you haven't already. You can use the testing client to fake the web request.If you want to experiment with mock tests that don't access a database, check out Django Mock Queries. (I'm a small contributor to that project.) I've also tried mocking views, but it's fiddly.
