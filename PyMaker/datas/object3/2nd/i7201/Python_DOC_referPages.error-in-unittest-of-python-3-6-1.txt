Unfortunately, that name conflicts with Python's standard library, which has an  module.In fact, look at the last two lines, one of which says:Which suggests it tries to get  from , but since you have an  file in your working directory, it tries to import  from that file, not Python's standard library.Try to rename your  to something else and see what happens.
