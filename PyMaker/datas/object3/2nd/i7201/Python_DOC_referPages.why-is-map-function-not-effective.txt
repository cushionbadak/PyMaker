I am not struck or anything, but I feel this weird. Below is the code snippet I have worked on:I have created my own hash table class. It has a method called put which accepts key-value pair and "HashTable.data" attribute displays all the values in the table.It works completely fine when I use put method with normal key-value pairs. I know that the solution can be implemented using:But I would like to know why the map function is not effective? When I try to map every input_value with "put" method, it has to add the value to the instance if I am not wrong. My reason is I may not be using the mapped value but syntactically when I am mapping, it is supposed to update the instance variable.Below is the hash Class I have created for reference.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you are using Python3. With python3, a  facilitates lazy evaluation, meaning it will not carry out its functionality unless it really needs to. What you are trying to do is use a  to produce side effects. Sure, you can do this with:The  forces evaluation to take place.However, using  for side effects is somewhat of an anti-pattern. I would prefer something clearer and more idiomatic such as the  loop you mentioned.As an example:Nothing happened to  thus far. Now, apply  to the  object.The s are classic symptoms of side-effects. However...So, it works. But it certainly doesn't look good.
