I expect that if I substract two datetimes in Python, I'll get datetime with substracted days, weeks, etc...Here is my sample. What I get are just substracted hours, minutes and seconds. Date variable is taken from database. On type() function returns datetime.datetime.My current example:Given datetime is    2017-07-27 01:18:58.398231Current datetime is  2017-07-31 20:23:36.095440Result is            19 hours (68677 seconds)
The following line returns only the 'seconds' component of the difference and does not take into account the days/hours/minutes components of it.What you need is to use total_seconds() instead of just seconds since that's what you're trying to compare in subsequent conditions. Use it as follows:The rest of the code remains the same and you will get your desired output.
If you subtract two datetime objects the result will be a timedeltaIf the second timestep was earlier than the first one, the results can be irritating. See negative day in example. is only a part of the result, you are looking for
