Natural Text
I am trying to create a Python command-line app, which supports both interactive (currently using Cmd) and inline modes (like Python's ). Is there a good way to do it without duplicating the 'line parsing' code?
Use the  method:Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt.
