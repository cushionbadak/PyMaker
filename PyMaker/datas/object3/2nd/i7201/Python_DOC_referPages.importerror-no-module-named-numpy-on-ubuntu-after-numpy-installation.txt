try from the command line,then you should be able to  in a new python session.but to really handle this sorta thing well, you should create sandboxed environments for projects where you specify not the packages and even the python version used. that way you don't accidentally install a package in the wrong path, or have it installed for python2 but not have it available if your default python is python3, that sorta thing. if you download anaconda, you get a great way to manage all that:https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.htmlotherwise you can use  (stands for 'virtual environment'): https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
