I am trying to make a program that will:Copy & Paste a Directory and place it, and it's contents into a new location. I do not think my code is right for this, I think it is simple just moving the file to a totally different locationI am getting this error as well
If you genuinely want to copy, rather than move, then shutil.copytree is a better bet.  will, well, move the entry, deleting the original.You're getting an error because Macs have access control lists on the folders that it thinks should always be there, and  is one of those, since it's used to store all the files visible on your desktop. Since  is trying to delete that, it's meeting the ACL and being denied. should show you the ACL, displaying something like: If you'd like to cut and paste rather than copy and paste the directory, you could either use  or  and find files and folders inside  and move all of those, or use  on  and then remove everything inside  while leaving that folder alone.
