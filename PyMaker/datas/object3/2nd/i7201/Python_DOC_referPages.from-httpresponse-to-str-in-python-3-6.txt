From a POST request to Vimeo API I get a JSON object encoded as HTTPResponse.I do not find a way to convert the HTTPResponse to a str or Json object. In stackoverflow I found and tried the following options: but none of them worked.Please can you help?Thanks
try with requests module
From Python docs (emphasis mine):Class whose instances are returned upon successful connection. Not instantiated directly by user.And also:See also The Requests package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface.So you're probably better off using requests directly.After having made your request, just use .
Use can use http.client module. Example:For more information, refer this: http.client
