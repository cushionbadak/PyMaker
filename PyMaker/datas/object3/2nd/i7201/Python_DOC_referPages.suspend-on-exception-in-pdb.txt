Is there a way to set a dynamic breakpoint***, suspend on exception, in pdb?***dynamic in the sense of not tied to any line numberIn pycharm (pydev), this is possible and is a nice feature, but often times, I have to use pdb due to limitations of the pycharm debugger (no jump functionality and/or the machine doesn't have pycharm).
