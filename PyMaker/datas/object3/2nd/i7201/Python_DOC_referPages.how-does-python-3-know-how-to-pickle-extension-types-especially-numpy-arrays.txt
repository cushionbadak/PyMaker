Numpy arrays, being extension types (aka defined using in extensions the C API), declare additional fields outside the scope of the Python interpreter (for example the  attribute, which is a , as documented in Numpy's array interface.To be able to serialize it, Python 2 used to use the  function as part of the pickle protocol, as stated in the doc, and explained here.But, even if  still exists in Python 3, the  section (and  a fortiori) was removed from the doc, so it is unclear what does what.Moreover, there are additional entries that relate to pickling extension types:copyreg, described as a , but there's no mention of extension types in the copyreg module itself.PEP 3118 -- Revising the buffer protocol which released a new buffer protocol for Python 3. (and maybe automates pickling for this buffer protocol).New-style class: One can assume that the new-style classes have an influence on the pickling process.So, how does all of this relate to Numpy arrays:Does Numpy array implement special methods, such as  to inform Python on how to pickle them (or )? Numpy objects still expose a  method, but it may be for compatibility reasons.Does Numpy uses Python's C-API structures that are supported out of the box by Pickle (like the new ), so nothing supplementary is necessary in order to pickle numpy arrays?
Python 3  still supports , it is covered under the Pickling Class Instances section.Numpy's support has not changed in this regard; it implements  on arrays to support pickling in either Python 2 or 3:A three-element tuple is returned, consisting of a function object to recreate the value, a tuple of arguments for that function, and a state tuple to pass no .
