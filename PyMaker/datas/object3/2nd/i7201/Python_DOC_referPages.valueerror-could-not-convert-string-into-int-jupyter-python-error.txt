Error message is as follows,ValueError                                Traceback (most recent  call last)       in ()            2 FN0 = 'uci-news-aggregator'            3 with open('%s.csv'%FN0, 'rb') as fp:      ----> 4     id, title, url, publisher, category, story, hostname,timestamp =       pickle.load(fp)
Hmmm, there's a pretty good  package in the stdlib that will help you for that job.https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csvWhy are you trying to use . It cannot work.
