This question already has an answer here:how to interpret this error “UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 164: ordinal not in range(128)”                    1 answer                I'm writing a script in Python 3.5.3 that takes username/password combos from a file and writes them to another file. The script was written on a machine with Windows 10 and worked. However, when I tried to run the script on a MacBook running Yosemite, I got an error that has something to do with ASCII encoding.The relevant function is this:The error is as follows:What's happening here? I haven't gotten this error before on Windows, and I can't see any problem with my attempt to encode into UTF-8.Edit: Notepad encodes in ANSI. Changing the encoding (just copying and pasting the data to a new .txt file) to UTF-8 solved the problem.
Your program doesn't say what codec is used in the file , so Python is in this case trying to decode it as ASCII. 0xaa isn't an ASCII ordinal so that failed. Identify what codec is used in your file and pass that in the  parameter for open.
