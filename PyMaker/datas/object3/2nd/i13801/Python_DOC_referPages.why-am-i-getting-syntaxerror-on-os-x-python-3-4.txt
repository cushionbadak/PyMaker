I just got a new MackBook Pro and installed Python 3.4.I ran the terminal and typedI got:I typed:All good, but when I tried to do something a bit more complex I ran into trouble, I did:I get the error:My guess is that the error is on the 'print("Hello World")' but I have no clue as to why, I don't need to indent it if I want it to run after the loop is finished. Any help will be appreciated. 
Notice the "..." prompt? That's telling you that the interactive interpreter knows you are in a block. You'll have to enter a blank line to terminate the block, before doing the final print statement.This is an artifact of running interactively -- the blank line isn't required when you type your code into a file.
Because it is syntax error. this is how python console works - you can see that you have three dots before print('hello world') which indicates that python still expects indendted code that belongs to while block. You need to double-press enter in order to get to normal mode. (Signalized by >>>). Also in future if you encounter similar problems always try to run them from file and not only from console. 
This is caused by a quirk of python's interactive mode, which treats newlines specially.When you have a  prompt, it must be followed by a continuation of the preceding compound statement, rather than the beginning of a new statement, which it would in non-interactive mode. Press enter again to make the  prompt go away.Observer that this fails:But this works:You can read the nitty-gritty details in the grammar reference. Interactive input uses the  start state, and non-interactive input uses the  start state.
You have to use space for indentation (and ";" to separate two instruction :
