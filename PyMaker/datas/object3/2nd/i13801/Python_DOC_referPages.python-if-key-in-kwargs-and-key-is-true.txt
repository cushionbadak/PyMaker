It feels like there should be a better way of writing this condition since I'm repeating both the key and variable.
While @EmanuelePaolini provided a great answer, there's another thing that I want to nitpick. You don't need to to check if something is true. For example, your code block would become this:And @EmanuelePaolini's solution would become this:
Assuming you really do want to check if the returned keyword argument , here's another slightly different way:I think adding the  argument is a little bit more explicit/clear to the reader. Using the above, EVERY value returned by the  method will cause the clause to be skipped except for when it contains a value of . However, Python is very nice when it comes to type casting to boolean - very often it simply isn't necessary to explicitly check . If this is the case, you can simply do this: Doing it this way, the statement reduces to  in only a handful of cases. Here are some of them (possibly not all - though the docs says this covers all of them): - Python's null value, , ,  - an empty container like a , , , or  or  - an empty string,  - any numerical that is equivalent to zeroinstances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a  or  method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value .In this case, EVERY value returned by the  method will cause the clause to be executed except for when it contains a value that evaluates to , such as one of the examples above. Any other value will evaluate to . (Side note: containers that contain values which evaluate to  nonetheless evaluate to , e.g.,  or  or ; this can be unexpected for inexperienced Python users).If you want the key added to  with a value of  at the point in time you check for it: 
A better way:relies on the fact that  if
