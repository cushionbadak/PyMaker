This question already has an answer here:Does Python have an ordered set?                    13 answers                This is my code:Output:I wanted to print the length of item values respectively as they are arranged in the dictionary, but they are appended to the set in an arbitrary manner. It should be like:
There's no reason to make a  here unless you want to throw away duplicates (which s do), which would result in no recorded value for something like  (same length as ). If you want to print the lengths, I would recommend doing so directly from the original dictionary. However, dictionaries are arbitrarily-ordered just like s are, so you'll have to sort it:
Sets have no defined order. This is impossible without writing your own print function, which for example could use .A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozensetIf you want to maintain the order, you might want to use normal lists. Uniqueness will need to be assured in some other way, for example checking your list before updating it.
