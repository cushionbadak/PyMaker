I am trying to find a way to pass my functions default arguments to the decorator. I have to say I am fairly new to the decorator business, so maybe I just don't understand it properly, but I have not found any answers yet.So here my modified example from the python functools.wraps manual page.I want the  to be passed, too. So that the output should be:

Default argument is part of function signature. Its not exists in decorator call.So to use it in wrapper you need to get it out like shown in this question.Output:
