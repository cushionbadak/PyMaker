I run into the case of using an enumerator on selected elements form an iterable (i.e. a sequence or an iterator or similar) and want that the original indices were being returned instead of the default , starting by  and going up to .A very naive approach would be the declaration of a new generator object called ... a new list object .Using Pythons build-in  function would yield this output for a  slice:The expected output of our own enumerator  again for a  slice:Do you know any better, more pythonic and more readable solutions? :)
Here my comment as an answer ;)Prints:
I don't like using , but maybe it's okay here.To expand out of the one-liner:
To answer the further questions in comment:Normal slice won't work on , since it does not support the  method.Yes,  was removed from Python 3, and the regular builtin  works with the same generator semantics.
You could use  + , to select elements with original indices:It does not duplicate the slice information and uses existing functions with familiar behavior.Or if you know that the original iterable is small; you could call :
