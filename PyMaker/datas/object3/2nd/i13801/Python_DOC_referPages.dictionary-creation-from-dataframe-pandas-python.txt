I want to create a dictionary where the key is a state name and the value is the sum of all the count corresponding to the state. Example from dataFrameI was trying to use the following, but not sure how to include a sum function inside this, also not sure if I should be using a zip method here:
Calculate the sum by group in the dataframe and then select the  column and use  to convert the resulting Series to dictionary:If you have more columns in the df than those two you probably want to doto avoid calculating the sum for all of the columns.Edit:as EdChum suggested  can be shortened to  which gives you the same result.
That won't work properly, since the  constructor will replace the value of each  as it goes, rather than summing. It's not a one-liner, but:will get you the total counts, and the Counter class has some extra functionality that may be useful for dictionaries of counts.
