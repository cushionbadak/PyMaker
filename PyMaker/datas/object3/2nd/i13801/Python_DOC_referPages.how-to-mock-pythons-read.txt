I'm trying to test the  method in the following class:As I understand it, I should be mocking the  method (in , or maybe the  method, but none of the examples I've found have the call to  or  deep inside a class.I already tried , and many variations thereof, but not one of them even make sense. I'm kind of lost as to how to even start this.Is this even the right way?
Mock the  function; you can use the  utility function to provide a suitable mock:The  call creates a new global  object in your  namespace, so when the  method runs it'll find that object rather than the  built-in function.By passing in a  argument to , you can dictate what is returned by the  call.
