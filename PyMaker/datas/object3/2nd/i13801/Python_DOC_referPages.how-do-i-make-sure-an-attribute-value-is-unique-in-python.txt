I'm scraping a website that contains a list of people. The same person can show up more than once and it's possible for multiple people to share the same name:I want to create an object for each person and discard duplicates.I'm currently using a list comprehension to loop through all class instances and see if  is already in use. Is there a simpler way of doing it?
Define  and  in your class, compare the instances based on the value of  and calculate hash using it as well. And instead of a list use  as it will automatically filter the duplicates for you in an efficient way:Don't assign the instances permanently to a variable, otherwise it won't be garbage collected(Note that this is true only for CPython):Output:
Global storage for your ids is fine, but its better to leverage  instead of  for that, as checking  is O(1) while  is O(N)
