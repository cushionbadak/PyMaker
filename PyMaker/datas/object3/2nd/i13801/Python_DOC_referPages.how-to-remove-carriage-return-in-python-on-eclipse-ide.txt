Natural Text
I want to write a file by copying the contents of another file that has '\r' at the end of every line. I want to remove '\r' while writing to new file file 1 (source)input input output file 2 (destination)input input output I tried the above code, but it didnt work. Please help
From the doc for :When reading input from the stream, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is '', universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.So call .
Guys I was able to solve the problem, The main thing we need to do is while reading and writing, it should be in "rb" other wise it wont work.
