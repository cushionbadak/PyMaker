This may seem like a duplicate of this: Python define a word?However, it is not because I am trying to implement that answer (that works for that thread's OP but not for me) into my code.Here is my function:Note:Also, this contains a bit of HTML :/ sorry but thats what the other answer used.So, the Error when I try to use this:Note:line 104 of functions.py is: Line 210 of re.py is the last line of this function:If there is anything unclear in this, please tell me (and I'm not quiet sure about what tags to add for this one :/). And thank you in advance :) Feel free to change anything or even re-writing the entire thing but just make sure to use the variables/lists:define_word (for function name)user_define_inputIf you wish to see the git for this, go to this link: https://github.com/DarkLeviathanz/Multitool.gitAdding:or changinghas given this when this is entered: define test:
will convert the bytes to a string.UPDATEthis is the last state from the script in the chat (still far from perfect...):
 returns a byte string. The exception indicates that you can not use a Python string as a regex pattern when applying it to a byte string.The byte string will (usually) be an encoded unicode string, in this case it looks like UTF-8 encoded data. Therefore you need to decode the byte string into a Python string so that it can be used as the regex pattern:That should fix the problem for you.You do need to know what encoding to use. That can be done by looking at the  response header, which for this URL is . Alternatively, as this is HTML content, you can look for the  tag.Finally, you could use the  library which will handle this for you:
After a few changes, this is the code that I stuck with although it still has a few flaws.and this to split the user input into a list with two items:So thank you to whoever helped me fix the code :)
