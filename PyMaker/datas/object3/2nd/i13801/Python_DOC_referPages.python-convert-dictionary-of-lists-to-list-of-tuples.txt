I want to convert dictionary of lists to list of tupleHere is an example: entry dataWhat I want to have is:The lists in dictionary are same length.So as you can see, x_axis is in 1st possition in every tuple etc.A bit like rotation it by -90 degreesEdit.1 I want to have the same order of elements in tuples as order of keys and number of keys is not defined by default. So I could have write keys to some var like:keys = d.keys()if I do:l = here what I want with vars in tuples in order of keys-list
Using : is not needed in Python 2.x. (In Python 2.x,  returns a list, in Python 3.x,  returns an iterator)UPDATEUsing pre-defined keys:NOTE:  will not work because Python dictionary does not guarantee key order.
You can use  function :If you care about the order you should pass the values by a custom order to  function.for example :Or use an  if you want to use  and unpacking :
