I know that in Python the  method doesn't have any return value, but I can't find any information on whether in some cases it throws an exception.  If it doesn't do that either, then I guess the second part of this question is superfluous.If it does, then what would be the "correct" way to handle the  method throwing an exception inside a "with" statement used to open the file?Is there a situation where  could fail immediately after a file has been open and read from successfully?
Yes,  can throw an  exception. This can happen when the file system uses quotas, for example. See the C  function man page:Not checking the return value of  is a common but nevertheless serious programming error. It is quite possible that errors on a previous  operation are first reported at the final . Not checking the return value when closing the file may lead to silent loss of data. This can especially be observed with NFS and with disk quota.A non-zero return value of the C  function leads to Python raising an  exception.If you wanted to handle this exception, put a  block around the  statement:Of course, the  could also have been thrown during opening.
 can throw exceptions, for example, if you run out of disk space while it's trying to flush your last writes, or if you pulled out the USB stick the file was on.As for the correct way to deal with this, that depends on the details of your application. Maybe you want to show the user an error message. Maybe you want to shut down your program. Maybe you want to retry whatever you were doing, but with a different file. Whatever the response you choose, it'll probably be implemented with a - block in whatever layer of your program is best equipped to deal with it.
You can use Then you checkIt's return True if file is closed and false otherwise.
