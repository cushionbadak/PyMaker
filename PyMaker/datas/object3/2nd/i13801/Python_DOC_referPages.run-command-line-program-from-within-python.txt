I am trying to run a blat search from within my python code. Right now it's written as...When I run the code, I specify file names for "fastafile" and "pslfile"...This doesn't work as "fastafile" and "pslfile" are variables for files created and named when I run the code, but if I were to use the actual file names I would have to go back and change my code each time I run it. I'd like to use the command line arguments above to specify the files.How would I change this so that "fastafile" and "pslfile" will be replaced with my arguments (new.fasta and test.psl) each time?
You should make use of argparse to take in command line arguments (it'll give you variables with names f and p that hold the file names), then just form the command string from there.https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.parse_argsConvert argument strings to objects and assign them as attributes of the namespace. Return the populated namespace.Previous calls to add_argument() determine exactly what objects are created and how they are assigned. See the documentation for add_argument() for details.By default, the argument strings are taken from sys.argv, and a new empty Namespace object is created for the attributes.


Instead of using , it's considered more pythonic to use , which eliminates the need to sanitize the input from argv:You can also incorporate ApolloFortyNine's answer and use Python's great  module to get the arguments and pass them onto .
