Say I don't know what is in , how can I check if  is an element in my list.  And if  is an element in , then how can I know which index it has (for this case  is in )?
how can I check if "bye" is an element in my list.then how can I know which index it isYou can skip the first step because if you try to find the index of a value that isn't in the list, you will get a value error which you can handle like this:

you can try .i will hold the index if  is in the list, otherwise it will be False, because  raises ValueErrror if it can't return the index.
You can use the in operator to check if a specific item exists in a list. To find the index of any item in a list just use the  function. If you are a beginner in Python you can use the below method else you can check out exception handling.
