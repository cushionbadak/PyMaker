I am trying to connect to a page that takes in some values and return some data in JSON format in Python 3.4 using urllib. I want to save the values returned from the json into a csv file.This is what I tried...I am getting an error below:EDIT: Found a solution to my problem. I answered it below.
You have found a server that apparently doesn't want to talk HTTP/1.1. You could try lying to it by claiming you are using a HTTP/1.0 client instead, by patching the  class:and re-trying your request.
I used FancyURLopener and it worked. Found this useful: docs.python.org: urllib.request Hope this helps those having the same problems as mine.
