This question already has an answer here:Performing len on list of a zip object clears zip [duplicate]                    2 answers                I know how to use the  function in Python 3. My question is regarding the following which I somehow feel quite peculiar:I define two lists:and I use the  on these in the following ways:when I type  at the interpreter, I get this:So, I type  at the interpreter and I get the intended result, but  when I type  again, I get an empty list.What I find peculiar is that no matter how many times I type  at the interpreter I always get the intended result and never an empty list.
Unlike in Python 2, the  function in Python 3 returns an iterator.  Iterators can only be exhausted (by something like making a list out of them) once.  The purpose of this is to save memory by only generating the elements of the iterator as you need them, rather than putting it all into memory at once.  If you want to reuse your zipped object, just create a list out of it as you do in your second example, and then duplicate the list by something like
The  function in Python 3 returns an iterator. That is the reason why when you print  you get - . From documentation -Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.But once you do -  - you have exhausted the iterator. So after that anytime you do  would only result in empty list.In case of , you have already created the list once,  is a list, and hence it will always be that list.
