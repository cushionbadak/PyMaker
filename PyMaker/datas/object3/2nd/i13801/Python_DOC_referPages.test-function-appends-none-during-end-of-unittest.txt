I've been working on some code to practice unit testing. The original is supposed to get all file names in a directory, and list the number of files with the same extension. When I run the same function using unittest, the test appends a  at the end, breaking the test.returns this output:and my unittest code:returns this output:Why is there an additional  output at the end of the unittest output?
Your function doesn't use a  statement, so Python returns  (the default). You are printing that value. Note that your test isn't broken by it, your test is actually not testing anything, only running the code.Simply remove your  call:You should consider changing your function to return the a report to print rather than print directly, then your unit test more easily can make assertions about the right output having been produced.You should also consider learning how the  library could help you here; you could mock out the  call so you don't actually have to create test files, and instead leave it to your mocked  call to return a pre-determined list of strings.
