On Code Academy there is this course where in the example they showThe above example will NOT be related to the rest of the code I show. That was just an example for the  statement. Now I was under the impression that when ever writing an  statement it had to end in an like the above example.However when doing the assignments this does not work:However this works:My question is how come the  is not needed next to the  and " but is still needed. I thought whenever writing an  statement it will automatically have to end with . In that very first example, that's how it is shown. Do you understand my confusion.
In the example given,  and  are functions, and as such require parentheses. The  itself does not need parentheses at the end (and it shouldn't have them)
No,  has nothing to do with  is a function.  is a call to that function. So,  tests if the  function returns true when called.In other words,  is equivalent to
As has been mentioned  are functions so they require . In example two of your question you are comparing your value to the string  because it is a string it does not require .Within an  statement you can use parentheses to make the code more readable and ensure certain operations are evaluated before others.Differs from:
Because string objects are not callable so what are you expecting then:Then use  not that efficient tho:
