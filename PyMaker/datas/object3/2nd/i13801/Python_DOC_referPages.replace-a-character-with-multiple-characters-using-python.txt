I have been trying to solve the following problem using Python, and so far without success:Assume you have a string with the characters '0', '1' and '?'. the '?' sign can be either '0' or '1'. Your goal is to print all the possible outputs for such given string.For example, the output for the string '0?1?' should be '0010', '0011', '0110' and '0111'I have tried the following:The result is strange, and is not what I am trying to get:Any idea why it is not working, and how I should change the code for this to work?
 is a generator function , when you do - The  statement does not automatically loop over all the values in the generator and yield them, you have to loop over the values and yield them one by one, Example -Example/Demo -[Edit]: Note that as of Python 3.3, you can use the new yield from syntax:
Anand's answer is correct and shows what is going on with your function.You can also do this task non-recursively by using the itertools product function.  For example:
What you've done is also perfect, but the issue here is you are getting a generator of generators.. you've iterate over those to get the values..
I know this post is 2 years old, but this solution  might help other people checking this post in the future:Using python 3.6 (but works for previous releases too) and format:
