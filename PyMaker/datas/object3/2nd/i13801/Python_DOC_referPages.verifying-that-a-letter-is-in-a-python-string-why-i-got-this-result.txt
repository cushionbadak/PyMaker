This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I am new to programming, and am learning on Python 3.4.  I am working on an exercise to determine if a user defined letter is a vowel or consonant.My original if statement looked as follows:this returned that my letter was a vowel every time.I have since learned the answer was to  have an if statement that looks as follows:My question is why did my original if statement return that it was a vowel every time, and not give me an error?My though process is that it is verifying that it is a string.
Any non-zeroish value evaluates to True in a condition.  Also, comparison operators ( in this case) have higher priority than logical operators (,,).  (Details: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)So python interpreted your if statement as:Since 'e' is not zero or zero-like, that part of the if was true, so your expression was true.An easier approach than your working solution is:Which checks if letter is a character in the string.
