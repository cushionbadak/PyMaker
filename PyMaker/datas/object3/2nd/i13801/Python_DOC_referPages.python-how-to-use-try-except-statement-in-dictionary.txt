You'd have to put the  around the assigment; you cannot put it inside an expression like you did:Alternatively, move the assignment to a separate set of statements:or explicitly test for the length of  so you can just select  with a conditional expression:where the  test is true if the list object is not empty.You could also use the  function ( in Python 3) to pair up keys and values; it'll neatly cut off at the shortest sequence, and fill in  values for the missing elements:Here, if  does not have 3 values, then their matching keys are set to  automatically:
You can actually use the 'in' keyword to see if something exists as a key in a dictionaryJust a note, avoid using 'list' as a variable name.Here's what you're trying to do I'm assuming:
