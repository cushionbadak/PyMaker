I am trying to make a function that takes an input, compares that input to a list of lists and returns an item from another list with the same number of objects.Example:If  is 1, 2 or 3 function returns If  is 4 or 5 function returns If  is 6, 7 or 8 function returns I'm new to python and have been thinking about the problem for a while and looking around for clues with no results. Any tips/clues that might help me figure this out would be appreciated! Thanks!
You can loop through each list in  and check if the input is in one. If it is, you can print the corresponding index of  (assuming it is composed only of single values), which you obtain by using enumerate in the loop.In this case, I returned .
zip is a function that combines ("zips together") lists.It will generate pairs from each list:Additional preprocessing would let you look up the value directly. For example, you could write all the keys (from the first list) for a given value (from the second list) into a .
The function:note: you may want to add some error handling to it. Index ErrorTest run: Docs:For loop
To be more flexible, you could make an alphabet list (at least for this example) at the beginning of the function. 
This should do what you're looking for:$ python so.pyac
