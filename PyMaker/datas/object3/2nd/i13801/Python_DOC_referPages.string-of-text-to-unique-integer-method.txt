Natural Text
Is there a method that converts a string of text such as  to a number other than which only converts one character at a time?
In order to convert a string to a number (and the reverse), you should first always work with . Since you are using Python 3, strings are actually Unicode strings and as such may contain characters that have a  value higher than 255.  however just have a single byte per character; so you should always convert between those two types first.So basically, you are looking for a way to convert a  string (which is basically a list of bytes, a list of numbers 0â€“255) into a single number, and the inverse. You can use  and  for that:
You don't need to convert the string into tuple is overwritten. Collect items using something like list comprehension:To get the text back, use , and join the characters using :
Treat the string as a base-255 number.(Note this is essentially the same as poke's answer, but written explicitly rather than using available methods for converting between a byte string and an integer.)
