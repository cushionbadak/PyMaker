In python 3.x ,  and  return views. Now while views certainly have advantages, they also seem to cause some compatibility issues. For example with  (ultimately it's with ). As an example this and this answers on stackexchange questions work just fine with python 2.x but raise an Exception when executing them in python 3.4.A minimal example would be:Which raises  with python 3.4. While for the minimal example the Exception is quite clear, this question arises because of the same problem and here the Exception is a lot less clear: What is the best practice to deal with this issue? Can we hope that in a new release of  (or ultimately ) this issue will be dealt with or should we just start to write things like  when using  just to be sure not to run into trouble with python 3.x?
More of that error:So the minimal example is:Without the dtype specification The  is treated as an . Usually you have to work at keeping  from treating an object as a list of numbers. can handle , treating it as a iterable.  So there's some detail in how  handles an iterable that is different from .A generator expression works the same way, e.g. .   can iterate through it,  either treats it as an object or raises an error.If all the errors that the SO mentioned boiled down to  handling a generator, then it might be possible to fix the behavior with one  change.  Developers certainly wouldn't want to tweak every function and method that might accept a list.  But it feels like a fundamental change that would have to be thoroughly tested.  And even then it's likely to produce backward compatibility issues.The accepted fix, for some time now, has been to pass your code through .https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.htmlfor dictionaries:Fixes dictionary iteration methods. dict.iteritems() is converted to dict.items(), dict.iterkeys() to dict.keys(), and dict.itervalues() to dict.values(). Similarly, dict.viewitems(), dict.viewkeys() and dict.viewvalues() are converted respectively to dict.items(), dict.keys() and dict.values(). It also wraps existing usages of dict.items(), dict.keys(), and dict.values() in a call to list.
