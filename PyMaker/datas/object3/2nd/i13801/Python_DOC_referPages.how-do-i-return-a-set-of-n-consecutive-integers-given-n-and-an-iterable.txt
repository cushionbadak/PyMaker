For example, calling  returns {2. I cannot use anything in , all I can use is  and  and I cannot make a secondary list to track the values or use len.Here's what I have so far:
It should be pretty easy to do this with a simple  loop over the values in the iterable. Just count how many times in a row you've see the current value and when it reaches , add it to the results:I don't bother to avoid repeated counting of the same value, since the  will ignore any duplicate values added to it.If you need to use a  loop for some reason, you can always convert the  loop into one.The  loop:is almost equivalent to:The only difference between the two versions is the existence of the  variable during the iteration. (The iterator used by a  loop is never bound to a variable name.)
Or  use range and index instead of slicing:If you have to use next,use an inner loop in range n-1, see if all next n - 1 and prev  are equal and add to the set if the loop finishes:
Do it recursively:
You can use :Example:Edit: Whoops, I guess I read "I cannot use anything in itertools" as "I found nothing in itertools that I can use", but you probably meant "I am not allowed to". Anyway, I'll leave this here for those who can use stuff from ...
