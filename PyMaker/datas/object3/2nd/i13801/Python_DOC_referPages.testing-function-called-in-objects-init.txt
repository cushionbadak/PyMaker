I have a class that looks like this:I would like to test the build_connection function within the class, but I'm not sure what the best way / most Pythonic way of doing that would be. I realize that I could create the object and mock out the various functions called in build_connection, but I was wondering if there was a way to test build_connection independently of the object being created, ie I don't want to necessarily do something like this:I'd rather do something more like this:
If you really want to test  without otherwise instantiating the class, mock the object itself.
