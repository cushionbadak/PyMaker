I am a beginner to python. When I try running the above code I get the error:TypeError: 'int' object is not iterableI'm trying to get a random number from a range (defined in range_of_numbers) to print a certain amount of times (defined in number_of_trials). Please help, what am I doing wrong?
Use  to make an iterable (list if you're using Python 2.x) which will be used for iteration.and you need to pass two integer to , not an interable (or list):
I think what you want to use is choice.Then changetoThe choice function will randomly pick an element from a non-empty sequence.
One issue and one suggestion in your code -You are doing -  - this is wrong, you are trying to iterate over an integer, you should do -  .The best to use here is  (Instead of ). Especially if the  is not continuous.Example -From documentation of  -Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq.
It should be like You got the error due to the fact int object are not iterable that is :i.e)
