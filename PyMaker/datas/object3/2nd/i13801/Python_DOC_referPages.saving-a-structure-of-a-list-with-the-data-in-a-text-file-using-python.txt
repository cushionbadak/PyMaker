Natural Text
I have a list of lists of tuples which I want to save in a text file as a string and later read it from another Python script and use ast.literal_eval to transform it from string to list.My question is if its possible to write in a text file not only the data in the list but the whole structure my list of lists of tuples has.For example to have a text file like this:Does this makes sense?
This sounds like a situation better suited to  than writing to a text file and using .
Writing out the repr will work, so long as all the values are Python built-ins with literal representations (e.g. int, float, str, bytes). But you shouldn't do this; it's limited to Python literals and slower. Use the pickle module, the Python standard for serializing arbitrary data; it's faster, works with types that lack a literal representation, and (often) produces smaller output (particularly if you're using protocols 2 and higher).Edit: To your concern over reproducibility: pickles reproduce the original structure precisely.
