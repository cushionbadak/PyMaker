I wanted to create the consumer and producer thread in python simultaneously, where producer thread will append the queue and consumer thread retrieves the item which stored in the queue. And I need to start the consumer thread along with producer. Consumer thread should wait till the queue gets an item. And it should terminate when there is no item in queue. I am new to python, please help on this.Requirements:If there is a list of 10 numbers, producer thread should insert the queue with one item, and consumer thread should retrieve the number. Both thread should start simultaneously  .
Just put a special item once you are done:If there are multiple consumers, then you have to put the item back before you stop:
You can use the queue module directly. The documentation contains an example for your use case. As a side note, the module is named  in Python 2.However threading in Python won't get your program any faster if it is CPU bound, in this case you may use multiprocessing module instead (in IO bound cases threading may be more viable since threads are often cheaper). Mutiprocessing module also provides a safe queue implementation named .
 is blocking. If there are no items in queue it will just get stuck there. You should use  and handle Empty exception and exit.Ok full code to clear confusion
