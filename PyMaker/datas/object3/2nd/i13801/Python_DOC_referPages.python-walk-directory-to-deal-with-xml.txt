I'm a new comer about python, and I code this program to deal with xml in os.walk().This program can print "channel code" from different xml files, and they all named "mmiap.xml".It is the code:After run this program, it shows "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'mmiap.xml'"What's wrong? It seems that traversal is not walk depth. But I can't find the problem.PS: If I drag a mmiap.xml to root directory, channel code will be printed normally.
When you do -This would always only check inside the current directory, in which the script is being run, not inside the directory into which  has walked/recursed into .You should first check whether  is inside the  list , if so, you should then use  to join the  and the  to create the actual filepath that you want to parse.
