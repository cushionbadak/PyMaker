HI  i am new python  and please excuse me if this seems to be a silly question .I have a function in my code which returns an exception ResponseError and the ResponseError has two error codes 404 and 403 I want my exception handler to give two different messages based on the error code if the error code is 404 it should say "file not exist "if the error code  is 403 then "forbidden to access". 
If you are using urllib2 package in python then you could handle like this:For example the below code will print out "files does not exist"
