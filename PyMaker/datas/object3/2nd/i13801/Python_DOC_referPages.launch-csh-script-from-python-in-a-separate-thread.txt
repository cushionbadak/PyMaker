You're looking for :To clear up your terminology, a "thread" is a line of execution within a single program, whereas a "process" is a running program (which may have multiple threads).  When you start a program, it's almost always a separate process, which means it's running independently and asynchronously (not on the same thread).  The issue here is that  is written for the most common use cases, where you probably want to wait for the called process to finish before continuing.   is a class that gives you a lot more power.  It doesn't wait for the process to finish unless you tell it to, using the  method.
