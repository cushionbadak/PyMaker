I have this string which I wish to convert to a dict:to basically change it to something like: Nothing more complicated but I believe there is multiple steps in this problem. Would be nice if you could explain the solution or link to some documentation  :)
If you want to create a dictionary object from that string, you can use the  function and a generator expression which splits the string based on whitespaces and then by , like thisThis follows from the examples in this documentation section. So, if you pass an iterable which gives two elements on every iteration, then  can use that to create a dictionary object.In this case, we first split the string based on whitespace characters with  and then we split every string based on , so that we will get key, value pairs.Note: If you are sure that the data will not have  character anywhere inside the string, then you can replace that first and then do the dictionary creation operation, like this
I'm not familiar with Python 3, so this may not be the most elegant solution, but this approach would work.First split the string by spaces. This returns a list that in your case would look like this:Then iterate through the list and split each element by '='.Now in the body of the loop, just add it to the dictionary.
Look this way, View LIVEOutput:
In case you don't have the variables defined as a string. You just have variables.  You can look into the following functions,dir() will give you the list of in scope variables:globals() will give you a dictionary of global variableslocals() will give you a dictionary of local variablesThese will give you the dictionary which you can manipulate, filter, all sort of things.  Something like this,
