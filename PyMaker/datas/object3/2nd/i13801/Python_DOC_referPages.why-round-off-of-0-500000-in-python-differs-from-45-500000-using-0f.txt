Recently, I learned art of string formatting in Python 2.7.I decided to play with floating point numbers. Came across an awkward looking solution, as written below.BUTPlease help me understand, why this behavior is shown by .
The internal implementation for the  string format uses a round-half-even rounding mode.In Python 2, the  function uses round-away-from-zero.  In Python 3, that was changed to round-half-even making it consistent with string formatting.FWIW, the decimal module offers you a choice of rounding modes if you want more control than afforded by  or by string formatting.  The decimal rounding modes are: ROUND_05UP ROUND_CEILING ROUND_DOWN ROUND_FLOOR ROUND_HALF_DOWN ROUND_HALF_EVEN ROUND_HALF_UP ROUND_UP.
