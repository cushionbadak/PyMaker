I was wondering if there was a way to create a program that moves and clicks things at certain coordinates. I'm using Python 3 and Windows 8. 
Okay after doing more research I have found a library. PyAutoGUI Python3.x
Better to use ready libraries, such as suggested in other answers PyUserInput and PyAutoGUI, but also mouse moving/clicking can be done on low level using WinAPI through ctypes:
I believe you are looking for PyUserInput which is extremely easy to use!
