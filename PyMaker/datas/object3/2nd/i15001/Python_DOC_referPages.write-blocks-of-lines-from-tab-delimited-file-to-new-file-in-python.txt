I have many tab delimited files all with 280 lines that I want to break up into standard segments in separate files. I tried doing this as below, and I generate files, but most are empty and others have a very strange format (just random numbers in lots of places that don't make sense). How should I be grabbing these blocks of rows?
 is one row from .According to the csv module documentation, is a list of strings then.So  refers to columns 2 to 60 of the first line of your file.Not to some 60 rows, which according to your first sentence ("I have many tab delimited files all with 280 lines") appears to be what you had in mind.
