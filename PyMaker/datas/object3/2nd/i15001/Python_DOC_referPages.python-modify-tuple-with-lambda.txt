I have a tuple that looks like the following:So the tuple has 4 tuples in it, each of them storing a coordinate(another tuple) and a bool.(I do not use dict or list because I need this to be hashable)Is there a smart way to change the bool to true for a given coordinate? So what I want to express in a one liner is this:In state set pair[1] to True where pair[0] = (givenX, givenY)Is there a smart way to do this in python?Update:Thanks for all the answers. Here is what I did in the end:
Since s are immutable (they're plain integers after all), you'll have to reconstruct your tuple to modify them:Although I think the easiest way is to use  and convert it to  after making the required modifications:
It sounds like you're getting to the point where it would be a good idea to encapsulate your data in a set of classes.You can use  as the base for your classes, which will create immutable objects for which it is easy to create a new instance, with one or more different values. You can even subclass the namedtuples you create and add your own methods which will help with easily replacing values in the object whilst keeping code terse and readable eg.
Obviously, you cannot modify the tuple in-place, but you can create a new one with the generator expressions:If you already have some values set to  and want to keep them like that:
Yes you can do this with a lambda function.However this will result in a list of tuples so you need to convert it to a tuple again
