I am making Raspberry Pi program by using python.I want to write  of my python code.How can I get output status of ?test target class is bellow. I want to check outputs after calling stop, brake, rotateClockwise and rotateCounterClockwise.
If you trust  library, I think it is a good stating point, you can  it by  framework.   give to you the possibility to break the dependency from HW and sense the calls to that function.   That could be your test classFew notes:In python-2.7 use  available by  instead of I'm using  almost in every test if you are wondering why take a look thisMy tests should raise almost 1 bug in your code: typo in  method
