in the code below i'm defining a type then using the properties as keys of a dictionary:I know i can access the value in dictionary prod_map code like this: but my question is, is it possible to access this map by a string value? such as:I ask because some clients (for example a .net client) will be accessing this through a webservice and will only be able to pass a string value.Thanks
