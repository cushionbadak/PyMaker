I'm currently re-factoring a project (formerly big one file) into several seperate python files, each of which runs a specific part of my application.Eg,  runs the GUI,  does some maths, etc etc. Each thread includes the use of functions from imported modules like , , , etc etc.I already have a file  containing class definitions for my datatypes etc, which each .py file imports at the start, as per recomendation here: http://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-share-global-variables-across-modules.htm . This is working well. What I would like to do is have all my 3rdparty module imports in the  file as well, so that I can write, for example,  once but have all of my project files able to use  functions.Questions:1. Is this possible?2. Is it a good idea/is it good Python practice?My current solution is just to put(plus imports for all the other modules I'm using as well)at the top of every file in my project... But that doesn't seem very tidy, and it's easy to forget to move a dependency's import statement when moving code-chunks from file to file... 
Yeah I guess there is a more elegant way of doing this which will save redundant line of code. Suppose you want to import some modules (say), then you can create a file (say) and import the various modules as , So the  may look something like this:importing_modules.pymain.py
The other answer shows how what you want is (sort of) possible, but didn't address your second question about good practice. Using  is almost invariably considered bad practice. See "Why is import * bad?" and "Importing * from a package" from the docs.Remember from PEP 20 that explicit is better than implicit. With explicit, specific imports (e.g. ) in every module, there is never confusion about from where a name came, your module's namespace includes only what it needs, and bugs are prevented.The downside of having to write a couple  statements per module does not outweigh the potential problems introduced by trying to get around writing them.
