What is the difference between add and update operations in python if i just want to add a single value to the set.Can someone explain why is this so.
 adds an individual element to the set. So,works, but it cannot work with an iterable, unless it is hashable. That is  the reason why  fails.Here,  is treated as the element being added to the set and as the error message says, a list cannot be hashed but all the elements of a set are expected to be hashables. Quoting the documentation,Return a new  or  object whose elements are taken from iterable. The elements of a set must be hashable.In case of , you can pass multiple iterables to it and it will iterate all iterables and will include the individual elements in the set. Remember: It can accept only iterables. That is why you are getting an error when you try to update it with But, the following would work because the list  is iterated and the elements of the list are added to the set. is basically an equivalent of in-place set union operation. Consider the following casesHere, we explicitly convert all the iterables to sets and then we find the union. There are multiple intermediate sets and unions. In this case,  serves as a good helper function. Since it accepts any iterable, you can simply do
 is faster for a single element because it is exactly for that purpose, adding a single element:  expects an iterable or iterables so  if you have a single hashable element to add then use  if you have an iterable or iterables of hashable elements to add use .s.add(x)       add element x to set ss.update(t)    s |= t  return set s with elements added from t
 adds an element,  "adds" another iterable ,  or , for example:
 is intended for a single , while  is for the introduction of other sets.From help():
 only accepts a hashable type. A list is not hashable.
 in your code won't work.  accepts an element and put it in the set if it is not already there but  takes an iterable and makes a unions of the set with that iterable. It's kind of like  and  for the lists.
I guess no one mentioned about the good resource from Hackerrank. I'd like to paste how Hackerrank mentions the difference between update and add for set in python. Sets are unordered bag of unique values. A single set contains values of any immutable data type. CREATING SET MODIFYING SET - add() and update() Hope it helps. For more details on Hackerrank, here is the link.
add method directly adds elements to the set while the update method converts first argument into set then it addsthe list is hashable therefore we cannot add a hashable list to unhashable set.
