I need to do this, and I have come up with this for adding:That was the adding part of the program, but instead of using  is there anything to use for subtracting the two randomly generated numbers in ?
If you only ever have 2 integers, just use subtraction on the individual elements:The 'functional' way to subtract numbers in a sequence is to use the  function:The  function stands in for the  operator in that case.
