As I understand it, the python language reference is written in extended BNF format. While looking at the documentation for function definitions I noticed that the spec doesn't seem to support the usage of trailing *args or **kwargs parameters.See: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-defparameterAnd yet when I do a function def like so:The python interpreter considers it to be legal. What am I missing? From the spec it appears that you must have the * at the beginning of the function definition before any other parameters. 
It appears to be a documentation bug for which an issue has been raised.I think the definitions in the documentation are slightly simplified in order to be easier to read.  The "real" definition is given in the full grammar specification:This is more difficult to read but appears to correctly allow varargs with or without ordinary arguments.
