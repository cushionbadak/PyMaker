Natural Text
The idea is that I don't have to write a setup.py file myself everytime I want to compile a cython module or package, but rather have a function create it. The function should also run the created setup.py by itself.So the question also is "how do you write code that writes code?".
I found a working solution.create a compile_cython.py file with the following code:It still needs some modifications to also compile pure C or C++ files, but it's working for Cython files.In this setup, Numpy is automatically included. But I guess that's no problem as it doesn't actully include anything unless you use numpy functions, or does it?
