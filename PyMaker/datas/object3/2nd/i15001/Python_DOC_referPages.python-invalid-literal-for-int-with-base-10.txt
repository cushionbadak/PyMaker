I am a beginner and I am trying to get the sum of the last element of each line of a file. Could anyone tell me what is wrong? 
There are several problems in your code. Firstly,  is never reached, since  above it will exit the function. It might be better if you start using  instead (it automatically closes the file when done).It is good practice to use the  keyword when dealing with file  objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after  its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way.Secondly, if the last character in a line can not be converted to an int, then a  will be raised. When using  you should handle only the error(s) you are expecting. All other errors should propagate through your code, so that you know when something is wrong. Below is an improved version of your code. To capture multiple consecutive digits per line, I'd rather use regular expressions: is the pattern you are searching for in the  string.  is a raw string,  means a digit,  means one or more of the previous (that would be one or more ), and finally  matches the end of the line.
You are try to convert string character to integer in following statementJust  value of  variable in your code e.g.  Will not work because type of  variable in  so this statement will raise  exception.No statement will run after  statement, in code file is closed  after  statement.Use  loop to check result of  operation is equal to  or not. this will return True or False value so every  will append in the list e.g.e.g. of exceptionUse Exception handling to catch value error:-
you are trying to convert string to integer at line: so it is giving error. You can put this line  inside try block to remove error.
