I'm using python 3 and following a [tutorial][1]. I'm getting a problem and my snake isn't moving. It calls invalid syntax on vec_add() and when i remove some parenthesis, i get:The snake should be moving to the right.
In this function:Python does not support deconstruction in function argument lists. So you can write it like the following:This is compatible with your existing call to .
It's fine to use normal tuples to store & manipulate coordinates, but you might find the named tuple a more convenient data structure. The elements of a named tuple can be accessed by name or by index, and as a named tuple is a class you can add custom methods to it. Here's a short demo that adds vector addition and subtraction methods to a 2-element named tuple, it also adds a useful  method. By defining  and  we can perform vector addition and subtraction simply by using the  and  operators, which is easier to type (and to read) than using an explicit function call.outputSee the Python docs for namedtuple for further info; here's the Python 3 version of those docs.You could also define your own Vector or Point class from scratch, as in this answer. If you want to store a lot of points you may wish to add  to your class definition to minimize memory usage, as mentioned in the Python 2 named tuple docs.
