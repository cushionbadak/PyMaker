I have a file which contains configurations. I need to find a pattern to match multiple lines in the configuration file.Basically, I am looking for the following types of line:In file the block is as:Later on, I need to get the name of virtual server: virtualserver1description (virtualserver1.aaa.com) if presentand the multiple virtual-addresses and port (172.16.211.153 and https) if present.I tried various combinations trying to match the blocks but was not successful.This gives me only first line and second line as output for all the configurations present.What pattern should I use to match all blocks?
Well, in case your blocks can have no more than 2 'match'es, you can try using this regex:These named groups will hold corresponding data:See demo here.
Regex documentation:  matches if  matches next, but doesnâ€™t consume any of the string. This is called a lookahead assertion. matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match for  that ends at the current position. This is called a positive lookbehind assertion.  is used so that last match is captured as well.
