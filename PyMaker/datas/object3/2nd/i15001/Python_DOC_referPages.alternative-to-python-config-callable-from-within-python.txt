I want to have a Python script build a Python C extension module for whichever version of the Python interpreter with which the script is being run.To this purpose, I want to dynamically acquire the relevant C compiler flags – one way to accomplish this would be to grab the output of the  CLI tool, e.g. like so:Unfortunately, on systems on which several versions of Python are installed, this method may not find the right  – that is to say, the  associated with the currently-running version of Python. (Also, it is a bit ugly, methodologically.)Is there some way that I can acquire this information from within Python – something perhaps like Numpy’s ?
I have the answer: it is the built-in  module. … offering methods to access the same information  provides, including but not limited to: (which does what you think), (yields a  with many useful paths), and  (these return strings and a huge  respectively, to sift through all of the low-level configuration options), (yields the source  file), (for only the most intrepid configuration plumbers)… the first two of which will likely suffice, for anyone seeking  values without having to go through an embarrassing  dance to get it.Official Python 3  module docsPython 2  PyMOTW example
