For HTML5 and Python CGI:If I write UTF-8 Meta Tag, my code doesn't work. If I don't write, it works.Page encoding is UTF-8.This codes doesn't work.But this codes works.
For CGI, using  requires that the correct codec has been set up for output.  writes to  and  has been opened with a specific encoding and how that is determined is platform dependent and can differ based on how the script is run. Running your script as a CGI script means you pretty much do not know what encoding will be used.In your case, the web server has set the locale for text output to a fixed encoding other than UTF-8. Python uses that locale setting to produce output in in that encoding, and without the  header your browser correctly guesses that encoding (or the server has communicated it in the Content-Type header), but with the  header you are telling it to use a different encoding, one that is incorrect for the data produced.You can write directly to , after explicitly encoding to UTF-8. Make a helper function to make this easier:Another approach is to replace  with a new  object that uses the codec you need:
