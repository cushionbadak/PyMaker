I am getting the following error on my Raspberry Pi: When I type in to the terminal: What is causing this and how can I fix it so that I can install the module ?
Pip is not only a standalone executable, it is also a python module. In fact in the python docs it directly recommends using the  syntax for installing a package using pip. See https://docs.python.org/3.5/installing/index.html#basic-usage:The standard packaging tools are all designed to be used from the command line.The following command will install the latest version of a module and its dependencies from the Python Packaging Index:My guess would have been that your system's  (the executable) was being shadowed by the python2 version of the  executable. But it sounds like you don't have pip (the module) installed such that your python3 executable can find it, so you may need to reinstall pip (the module) specifically. For that use   (docs for ensurepip) which will install pip if it is not present from the persepctive of your python3 interpreter.The other issue could be that it's finding a file, executable or directory called  in your current directory, and it is trying to treat that  as a module, and it is not in fact a module.If it's not that I'm not sure. But it is definitely not because pip is not a module. 
 is a standalone executable. If  if in your path, you can just executeIf  is not in your path, then you need to navigate to the directory where  is located and then execute the above.If needed, add  to the command.The precise error you are encountered is due to  being a package, but  is used for executing modules.EDIT:  also comes with several helpful alias functions that point to different Python installs. In general,  points to your main Python install (the one you enter when simply executing ),  where  is a number such as  or  adds the install to your primary Python of version  ( adds to your  environment). Finally there is  where  is the same as before and  is the subversion. For instance  installs for Python 3.4.
I had the same problem.  I found that an old pip directory was left over from a python 2.7 install, at .  This was causing python to try to load pip from there and fail.I removed that directory and my error has just become .I haven't solved the problem yet, but I'm working through it at http://bugs.python.org/issue29586
I had the same issue and none of the previous answers solved it for me.The error appeared when I uninstalled and reinstalled python to my PC. As it appears the previous existing version of pip wasn't completely removed and when I was trying to import it with  it was actually trying to call the previous version.To solve it first manually delete the pip folders in the following locations:Then download get-pip.py.Finally, navigate to the folder where you downloaded it and run:This procedure should reinstall pip and fix the issue.
