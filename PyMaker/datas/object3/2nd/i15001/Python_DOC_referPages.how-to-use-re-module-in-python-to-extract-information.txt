I write a little script to use collins website for translation. heres my code:I have some questions:I can't use re.search on p. it raises this error: is there a way to use  without saving it?After saving file I should reopen it to use re.search otherwise it raises this error:  why this error happens?in this program I want to extract information between  from first match. but pattern that I wrote not work good in all cases. for example translate('three') is good. out put is : "totaling one more than two" but for translate('tree') out put is:"a treelike bush or shrub   â‡’ a rose tree"is there a way to correct this pattern. regular expression or any other tools?
