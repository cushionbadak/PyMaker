This question already has an answer here:Python dictionary: are keys() and values() always the same order?                    8 answers                The collections.OrderedDict documentation describes an  as a a dict that remembers the order that keys were first insertedso the order ofis predictable.However, it does not say anything about values. If I only need to iterate over the values as follows, will the results respect the ordering-by-insert as well?A few quick tests here in CPython showed that to be the case, but that could just be coinicidental with the current implementation (I haven't tested any others).
Yes, the lists by  and  are arranged in corresponding orders in all dicts, not just in ordered ones.Prior to Python 3.6, the order was arbitrary for normal dicts, but it was the same arbitrary order returned by ,  and , provided the dict wasn't modified between calls to those methods.As of Python 3.6, dict respects insertion order. Beginning with 3.7, it has become a documented guarantee.
Yes, they are sorted in the same order as the keys are. This is the same with all  implementations.Keys and values are iterated over in an arbitrary order which is  non-random, varies across Python implementations, and depends on the  dictionaryâ€™s history of insertions and deletions. If keys, values and  items views are iterated over with no intervening modifications to the  dictionary, the order of items will directly correspond. This allows  the creation of  pairs using : .
