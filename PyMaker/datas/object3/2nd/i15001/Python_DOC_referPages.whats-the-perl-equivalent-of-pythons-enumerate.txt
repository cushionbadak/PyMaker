I'm looking for a function in Perl 5 that works similarly to Python's  built-in. It would return a list of references to arrays, where each array is :List::Util and List::MoreUtils don't seem to have this function. Is there another module that does?
You can use , like this
Perl doesn't have a built-in function to do that but it's easy to roll your own.Using :As of v5.20, Perl's new slice syntax does something similar:That slice syntax returns a list of index/value pairs but it's a flat list. The pairs aren't grouped into nested arrays. If that's important to your application you can use the pairmap function from List::Util to do it:
 returns an iterator, not a list, so you should really be asking for an iterator.In Perl 5.12.0 and up, you can use  to iterate over arrays:However, you should be very careful when using ; some people even discourage its use altogether.
Use the List::Enumerate module.
