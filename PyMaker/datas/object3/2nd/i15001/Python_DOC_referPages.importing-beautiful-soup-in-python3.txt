I am trying to import beautifulsoup in python3. I have this line:It says:I see that it is still trying to use python2.7 package. I have installed beautifulsoup for python3 using pip3 and on checking I found that the package is there in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/.Also on checking sys.path, I found that this path is present. Still I don't get why it is trying to use the older package,
If  executable has  in  then it means that the Python 3 installation is broken.Here's  on my machine:Note: no  directories.Make sure  is not set, and there are no stray  files in the default list (installation-dependent, above) of Python 3.4 directories that mention python2.7 directories, and  file or ,  modules do not corrupt .
Perhaps using virtualenv can temporarily solve your problem.Or maybe try That way you're only left with the version pip3 installed.
