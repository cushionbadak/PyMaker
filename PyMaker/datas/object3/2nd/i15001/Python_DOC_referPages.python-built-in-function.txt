is there a build-in equivalent of such function in python:in other words  would add and  would do  etc.And i know you can make it faster and prevent stack overflow ( :D ) but i think i remember such function but have no idea what the name is and dunno what to google.
You are describing the  function; in Python 3 it has been moved to the  module:Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value. For example,  calculates . You can of course use any callable; the  module offers several handy options:
Its what that  function is for!Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value
Looks like you're looking for https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.reduce (AKA https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reduce in Python 2), assuming there's a bug in your code and by  you actually mean  (otherwise you're looking for a never-ending loop:-).
