I am writing some code to do this:fill an array with numbers from 0 to 9 and then put the ones smaller than 5 at the end of it. My code is this:My problem is that when i run it, the loop that checks if a number is from 0 to 9 is ignored if i give anything else and it passes it to the array and that it gives me an error on line 16 (a[i] = a[i+1]). Thanks in advance!
For debugging in Python. Add  and then put  where you want the debugger to break.
There is debugger for python:https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.htmlmaybe useful to learn it right at the beginning.
