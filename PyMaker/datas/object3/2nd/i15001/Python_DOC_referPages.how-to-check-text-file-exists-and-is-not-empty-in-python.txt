Natural Text
I wrote a script to read text file in python.Here is the code.    I would like to check if the file exists and is not empty file but this code gives me an error.I would also like to check if program can write to output file. Command: ERROR:
To check whether file is present and is not empty, you need to call the combination of  and  with the "and" condition. For example:As an alternative, you may also use  with the  (without using ) because it raises if the file does not exist or if you do not have the permission to access the file. For example:  References from the Python 3 document  will:Return the size, in bytes, of path. Raise  if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.For empty file, it will return . For example:whereas  will:Return  if path refers to an existing path or an open file descriptor. Returns  for broken symbolic links. On some platforms, this function may return  if permission is not granted to execute  on the requested file, even if the path physically exists.
