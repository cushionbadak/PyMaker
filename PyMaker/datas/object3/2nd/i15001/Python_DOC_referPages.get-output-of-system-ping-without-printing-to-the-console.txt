I want to call  from Python and get the output.  I tried the following:However, this prints to the console, which I don't want.Is there a way to not print to the console and just get the result?
To get the output of a command, use .  It raises an error if the command fails, so surround it in a  block.To use  to know whether an address is responding, use its return value, which is 0 for success.   will raise and error if the return value is not 0.  To suppress output, redirect  and .  With Python 3 you can use  rather than opening the null file in a block.In general, use  calls, which, as the docs describe, are intended to replace .
If you only need to check if the ping was successful, look at the status code;  returns  for a failed ping,  for a success.I'd use  (and not  as that raises an exception when  reports the host is down, complicating handling). Redirect  to a pipe so you can read it from Python:You can switch to * if you want to ignore the output; use  to wait for  to exit; you can add  to have  do less work, as it'll produce less output with that switch:In both cases,  can tell you more about why the ping failed, depending on your  implementation. See  for details. On OS X the manpage states:and  lists further error codes.The latter form (ignoring the output) can be simplified by using , which combines the  with a  return:*  is new in Python 3.3; use  in it's place in older Python versions, making use of the  value, e.g.:
