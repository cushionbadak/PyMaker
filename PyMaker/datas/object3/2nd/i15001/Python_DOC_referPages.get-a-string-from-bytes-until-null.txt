Given a bytes object and an index, I want to read a string from the bytes between the index and the next null(\x00). For example:I can do the following:Since the bytes object is very large, I would like an efficient version of . I am new to Python and not knowing how the interpreter treats the  call when I only want to access the first split result. Or is the  necessary?Question: Is there a better and pythonic way to do ?
How about (in Python 2):This scans the string once looking for a null, and then creates a slice.
