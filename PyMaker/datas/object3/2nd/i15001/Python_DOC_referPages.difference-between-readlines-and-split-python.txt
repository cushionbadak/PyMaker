imagine we have a what is the difference between the split() method and the readlines() method It seems that both split each line and put it as a string in a list. so what makes them different ?
 splits the entire file into lines and is equivalent to , but is a bit more efficient. Your example,splits each line by its spaces, building a list of words in the line.  is overwritten on each iteration so unless you save values somewhere, only parts of the file are in-memory at a single time.
This is the main difference:A  object has  but not :A  object has  but not :And to answer your question, one is operating on a string object and one is operating on a file object.They don't do the same thing since one returns a list of lines when operating on a file and one returns a split line when operating on a string.
 does platform agnostic line splitting and  does generic splitting.As an example:
