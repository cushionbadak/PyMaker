I'm am creating an xml file with python using lxml.  I am parsing through a file by line, looking for a string, and if that string exists, I create a SubElement.  I am assigning the the SubElement a value which exists in the parsed file after the string I'm searching for.Question: how do I get all the xml output onto one line in the output.xml file?  Using line[12:] appears to be the problem.  See below details.Example file content per line:Python code:When I hardcode a string such as below, the output xml is one continuous line for the xml tree.  Perfect!  See below.When I try and assign the 13th character onward as the value, I get a new line in the output xml per .  This is causing errors for the receiver of the output xml file.  See below.I thought making the assignment on the same line might help, but it does not seem to matter.    See below.I have tried to employ , and parse the output xml file AFTER the fact and recreate the file, but that doesn't seem to help.  I understand this should help, but either I'm using it wrong, or it won't actually solve my problem.  See below.
