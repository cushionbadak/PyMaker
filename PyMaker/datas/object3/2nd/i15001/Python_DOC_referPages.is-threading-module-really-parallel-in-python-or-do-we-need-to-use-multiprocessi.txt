So, I have written this simple code to check if python threading module is really parallel and I found out that in this case,I have tried the same with Pool.apply_async which is actually parallel.So my question is what is the point of using the Threading module if it is not really parallel even it saves the IPC and uses the same memory area? Also, can threading actually be parallel using queue or something?
