I'm learning how testing is done in Python using . I am trying to test a specific situation that is quite common when using other libraries like . Specifically, testing that a function or method invokes another callable with the correct arguments. No return value is needed, just a confirmation that the method under test makes the call properly.Here's an example straight from the docs:Is it possible to do this using  or  from , without effectively writing my own mocked class? I  have searched for this specific use case, but couldn't find an example. Does  encourage an alternative way of exercising code like this?
You can use pytest-mock which makes it easy to use the mock package as a pytest fixture.
Well. I've come up with something that seems to work, but I suppose its similar to mock:
