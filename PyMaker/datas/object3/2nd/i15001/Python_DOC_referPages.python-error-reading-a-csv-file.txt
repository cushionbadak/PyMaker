This is my code. I am getting the error like as follows. I am new to python. kindly explain this.
Remove , you are opening in binary mode hence the  error:  You can actually remove both as the default mode is .
You are opening file in  means  please open it in  mode. change your code toThis will open file in  mode (not binary).
The last line of the trace tells where the error first occurred.  Since you opened the file in binary mode, python is reading bytes. Your file is csv and opening it in read mode will suffice.So instead of rb use r
