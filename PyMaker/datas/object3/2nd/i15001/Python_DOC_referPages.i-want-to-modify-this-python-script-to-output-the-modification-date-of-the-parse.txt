So the last programmer left me with this script, that grabs all the old content and writes it all out as a "partial' file.. which strips out all the container html and leaves just the html of the article itself. It then writes a manifest as JSON which gives the url, the title and the date created of all files. I'd like it to order all the files by the date created, in the manifest, and in the filenames created. (something like [unix-create-date]-[url].partial]). Then I can use the manifest file to list the file in the order they were created, and use the file names themselves as well.I don't know python, so I don't know how to get the file modification date in there. Thanks for any responses!Here is the full script.
You can get the modification date of a file by using :So in your code, you'd probably want to store it in the manifest around here:With that information you can then sort the files based on , or convert it to a  object, etc.
