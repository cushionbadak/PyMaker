I'm learning about Python classes and metaclasses.Below is an example which was modified from the article "Metaclasses Demystified" at the now-defunct website cleverdevil.org.But I encounter an error with this print statement:Below is another example of the same kind.Also, I receive an error for , but  works.   I dont understand the background behind all these things.
You have three separate problems:Metaclass syntax is different in Python 2.x and 3.x:PEP 3115: New Metaclass Syntax. Instead of:you must now use:The module-global  variable is no longer supported. (It was a crutch to make it easier to default to new-style classes without deriving every class from .)The error your code results in as written:... is not difficult to understand: your  object  doesn't have an attribute . Double-underscore name-mangling doesn't work the way you appear to think. This works:In Python 3,  is a function.NOTE: It so happens that the three separate problems you present in this question are fairly trivial to address, but in general, if you have more than one problem, you should ask about each in a separate question.
