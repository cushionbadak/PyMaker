..I dont quite understand last Note in this help (what is second set? is it pending/reprocessing set? how do I execute pending tasks and combine the results of both done and pending and then save in DB)My problem: I'm using asyncio with aiohttp, have millions of urls , few of them might raise timeout error. I want to send them in a queue for reprocessing or it should take care by eventpool.PS: I'm not using  method.
Here are the two sets from the help:The second set is the  set, jobs that haven't finished within the timeout. It will return a tuple with two lists of futures, one of those that are done, and one that are still pending.instead of:you should probably:Here is more information: https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.wait
