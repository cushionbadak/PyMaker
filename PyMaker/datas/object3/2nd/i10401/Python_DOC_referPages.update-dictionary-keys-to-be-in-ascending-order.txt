I have a dictionary:I want to make the second level key automated ascendlike this:
Regular dictionaries are unordered, so you will need to use OrderedDict.A global counter variable can keep track of the total number of entries.The sorted function will take a list of key/value tuples and sort them according to the key.If needed you can sort the innermost variables and stored them in an OrderedDict as well.
As martineau mentioned, If you want to keep a data set sorted, you'll want to use a collection/data type that preserves order. For a record like this, you can use tuples or namedtuples. These will allow you to keep data sorted, and having them in a list allows them compatibility with built in functions that allow to you insert future data into an sorted set.
if u don't need to keep the orderï¼Œu can copy the dict to other dict. A global variable can keep the second level key.output:
