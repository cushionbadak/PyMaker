I am working on a listing in django project. The scenario is that When i click on FAQ listing page then it redirects me to the listings where i get all faq. Now i have to search using different keywords. There is total five keywords through which i can search for particular results. Code isFirst when page refresh it executes first query which returns all data, now using ajax filters have to be applied, i have done all ajax code just want logic of this search. Search should perform like if i enter question only it should filter according to question, but if i search using question, status and created filed it should apply filter for all these three keywords.
