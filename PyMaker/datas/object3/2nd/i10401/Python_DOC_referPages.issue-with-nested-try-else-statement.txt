I am a beginner programmer and am writing a program that converts letter grades to GPA, or GPA to letter grades as entered by the user. I reference two functions to do the conversions in other programs. I am using the try statement to start by assuming it is a letter grade to convert to GPA, and that doesn't work i try the function to convert from GPA to letter grade.My program works, the only problem is that my else statement always executes, even if I enter something that is not a letter grade or GPA. I am guessing it is something easy that I am not seeing.
Your inner  will swallow any exceptions, which means that even if  raises an exception, the outermost  suite will still be 'successful' and thus the  clause will execute. There are several ways to fix this, but the way that involves the least amount of refactoring would probably be to re-raise the exception in the innermost  clause.Edit: Okay, based off your comments, what you're actually going for is something like this:
You can use an else statement with try catch. However, checkout how the docs recommends using try catch else. Catch should take an error. You should figure out what kind of error you want to catch. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.htmlAnother thing you can do is use a debugger to see what you're getting in each block. Just put the following code in the block you want to check out:import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
If you're trying to catch exceptions raised by functions on invalid inputs, probably you would like to rewrite the code to something like this:Also it is recommended to specify expected exceptions,for example:so you won't miss bugs, that you may be not aware of.
