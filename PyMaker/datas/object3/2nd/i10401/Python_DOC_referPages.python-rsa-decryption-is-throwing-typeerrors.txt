Natural Text
My RSA decrypt function:is sometimes throwing a  which tells that  provides a . Why is that? I cant explain it myself and it would be interesting to know why.For example it happens when:crypt-Text = [513300, 369218, 473524, 473524, 500307, 509880, 264366, 500307, 337068, 473524, 264834]  key = -159317  n = 540767
It's hard to figure out much from a tiny fragment of code. You are getting float results because your variable  is negative number. It is clear from the description of pow that you will get float results, which is not what you want. You really should be using the 3-argument form of pow, and your exponent should always be positive. By using standard RSA math you can always make your exponent positive by adding an appropriate multiple of Φ(n). In your particular case, Φ(n) = (631 - 1) * (857 - 1) = 539280, so key = 379963 mod Φ(n). You should correct the code that gives you a negative exponent.
