Natural Text
Currently I have this structure which I have successfully parsed from text file:And now I'm struggling to build output text based on states (current keys in Chain). Why? Because my probabilities of words are in float format, and I don't know how to convert them to percentage. My first thought was something like this:But this function generates repeating texts because, as I mentioned, I don't know how to properly code random function based on my probability format. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!Full code at Github Link
Python >= 3.6 now includes  which will take weightsPython <3.6See the recipe in the Python docs for creating cumulative distributions (this is what people were describing in the comments)
The trick here if that the values form relative probabilities of occurence of their key. You must take as step value a  where tot is the sum of the probabilities (here it is 1.). Then you compare it with first probability. If it is less, you choose this one, else you substract the probability from the step value and iterate with next probability. If you want to be super safe, you can make the last possibility a catch all to be immune to rounding errors (search for broken floating point arithmetics on SO...)Code could be:
