I'm trying to mock a call of method  which usually returns a list of dicts. As far as I understand from the Mock docs, if I want to return iterable, I should set side_effect param.But then the following code calls that mocked method:And the dict comprehention fails because  there is not a list, but dict .What I'm doing wrong? How can I make Mock method return a list of dicts?
