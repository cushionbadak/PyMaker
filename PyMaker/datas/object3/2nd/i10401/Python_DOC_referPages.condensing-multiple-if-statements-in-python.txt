I'm trying to write a function to check if an object is found in multiple lists and to remove the object from any list its found in. I want to know if there is a way to make it cleaner or smarter using some form of generic variable where you predefine the format or something along those lines. my code in its ugly form:What I'm hoping for is something like:I would like it to work for each list, would I need to loop through? any suggestions would be great! I have the workaround but I would love to learn a more elegant way of coding this!
How about creating a list of lists and looping over that? Something like: 
In a one-linerIf you use , only the first found match of  is removed from the list. Therefore, it depends if the lists possibly include duplicated items, which (all) need to be removed:1. If all items in all lists are uniqueHowever 2. If one or more lists possibly includes duplicated itemsIn that case ' filterfalse() will come in handy:Then the test:
Make your  a list of all your listsThen do it this way
An alternative to the former suggestions, which is a bit clearer, is to define a helper function. So, instead of:You'd have:
