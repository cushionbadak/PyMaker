Lets say I have datetime in the formatI need regex like it should return match in same order always for any dateformat given aboveI need results in the same order always. 
You can't switch the group order but you can name your groups:: matches a day, can be accessed in python with : matches a month, can be accessed in python with : matches a year, can be accessed in python with Example:Demo
Named groups as suggested below is a good way of doing it (especially if you already have the regexes set up) but for completion's sake here's how to handle it with the  module.For more information, see the datetime documentation page.
You cannot change group orderings. You need to do a "or" of 3 patterns and then pass through the result to determine which group mapped to what, which should be pretty simple.
