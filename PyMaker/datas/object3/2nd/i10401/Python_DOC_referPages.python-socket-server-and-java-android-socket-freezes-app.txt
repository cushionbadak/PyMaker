I'm making a python server running on my computer and java socket client running on my phone. the minute the java tries to connect, the app freezes. Not saying anything in the logcat. I have no idea why...python 3.5.1:java:but actually, logcat never prints "connected successfuly". just "trying to connect".
This line is wrong:Servers don't call . Servers call  and . Only clients call .Since your server calls  and , but not , any client will hang trying to connect to it.Resources:https://wiki.python.org/moin/TcpCommunicationhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.htmlhttp://beej.us/guide/bgnet/
