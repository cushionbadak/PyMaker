Say I have two files:andNow suppose I wish to call  from within . It's not directly possible since both files depend on incompatible Python versions. Of course I can  a different python process, but how could I pass in the arguments and retrieve the results without too much stream-parsing pain?
Here is a complete example implementation using  and  that I actually tested. Note that you need to use protocol version 2 explicitly for pickling on the Python 3 side (at least for the combo Python 3.5.2 and Python 2.7.3).The Python 3 module (using the  module for the showcase)The Python 2 module using 
Assuming the caller is Python3.5+, you have access to a nicer subprocess module. Perhaps you could user , and communicate via pickled Python objects sent through stdin and stdout, respectively. There would be some setup to do, but no parsing on your side, or mucking with strings etc.Here's an example of Python2 code via subprocess.Popen
You could create a simple script as such :You'll be able to call it like that :This is obviously a security hazard though, be careful.Also note that if your params are anything else than string or integers, you'll have some issues, so maybe think about transmitting params as a json string, and convert it using  in the wrapper.
It's possible to use the  module to achieve what you want. It does require a small amount of hacking though.Given a module that has functions you want to expose then you need to create a  that can create proxies for those functions.manager process that serves proxies to the py3 functions:I've redefined  to contain two function called  and .client process that uses the py3 functions exposed by the .Once set up, this form gives an easy way of accessing functions and values. It also allows these functions and values to be used them in a similar way that you might use them if they were not proxies. Finally, it allows you to set a password on the server process so that only authorised processes can access the manager. That the manager is long running, also means that a new process doesn't have to be started for each function call you make.One limitation is that I've used the  module rather than  to send data back and forth between the server and the client. This is because python2 and python3 use different protocols for . You could fix this by adding your own client to  that uses an agreed upon protocol for pickling objects.
