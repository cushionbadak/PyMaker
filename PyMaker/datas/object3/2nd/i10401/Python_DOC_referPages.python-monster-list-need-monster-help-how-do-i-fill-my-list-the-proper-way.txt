So I started with Python yesterday and for my first project I want to make monsters battle each other.I'm still at the start and I want to fill a list with monsters I created. My monster function asks for how many monsters it should create and gives back a list with all of them.Somehow my code is wrong and only gives back one single monster :(The output of this code is for number = 3 for examplebut should be something like this
Your loop:iterates over the values in the  list. You are not getting indices, as Python loops are foreach constructs.Your list only contains the number :so all  is ever set to is . This in turn is why you only ever alter the element at index 0, everywhere you wrote  you could have written  for the same results.Rather than pre-build the list with zeros, just use  to add new elements as you loop, and use  to count out how many monsters you create:I renamed the function and list to the plural  to indicate this is not just about 1 monster.
simply replace with
