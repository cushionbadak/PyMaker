I have an json array that looks like this:And now I want to access this array in a program that I'm creating and remove a element, for example "Name": "dog".I'm not super familiar with how to work with json in python, but so far I have tried something like this:So first I read from the json and stores the data in a variable.Then I want to loop through the whole variable and see if I can find any match, and if so, I want to remove it. I think I can use a pop() method here or something?But I can't seem to get my if-statement to work properly since the jsonObj["inventory"][counter] is a dict and argOne is a string.What can I do instead of this? Or what I'm missing?
Making the change suggested by @arvindpdmn (to be more pythonic).The  loop is responsible to go through the array, which contains  objects, and for each  it will create a  variable that we use to try to get a match.editIn order to remove the element if it is in the list, I suggest you to use this:This way you will end with the list you want (new_list).
You can use filter:
