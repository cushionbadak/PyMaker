I need to change object variable directly from inherited class.Here is my code example: But it doesn't work:I also tried to use global/nonlocal keywords with my variable in B class, but no luck.In my main case, the  class is an event handler. And it should change the attribute of an object when an event fires. So I'm not able to use  in the  method.
 can only search for class attributes in the class MRO, not instance attributes.  is set on an instance of the class, not on a class itself.There is only ever one instance; it doesn't matter if code from class  or a derived class is altering attributes on an instance, it is just one namespace.However, in your case, you shouldn't even be using inheritance. You are trying to use an independent, second instance to alter the attributes of an instance of . Class inheritance doesn't give you access to instances of the base class like this.Refactor  to take an instance of , then act on that instance:Note that  is not a subclass of  here; it is not a (specialised) object of the same type at all; it is a different kind of thing, something that increments attributes of another object.Pass in the instance when you create an instance of :This does create a circular reference, which can keep objects alive for longer than perhaps needed. You may want to use a weak reference instead:Now  instances only hold a weak reference to their  instance, and will do nothing if that instance no longer exists.
