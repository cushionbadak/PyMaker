There is list named L.Which contains others list: L=[A,B,C,...N]I want to for-loop, where B is no equal A (see #2)Something like: for B is not A in L:How can I do that?
Just access the rest of the list by index:
You can use an  statement to filter out the cases you don't want:
Better solution using , either with  or with :Either one of these is significantly faster than using nested loops that require indexing (and bonus, requires only one level of indentation, reducing "arrow patterns" in your code).If the body of the loop was  and , the output of the  loop would be:For , you'd get:so choose whichever matches your desired behavior.An additional benefit of using the  functions is that they'll work just fine when  is a non-sequence collection (e.g. a ), or when it's an iterator that can only be traversed once (they'll cache the values internally so they can produce them more than once). Other solutions require explicit conversion to / or the like to handle the " is a one-use iterator" case.
