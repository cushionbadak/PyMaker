I want to run an external process in python, and process its  only.I know I can use , but how can I redirect the stdout to  (or ignore it in any other way), and receive only the ?
Unfortunately you have tagged this python-2.7, as in python 3.5 and up this would be simple using :With  stdout simply cannot be redirected:Use  objects and  with python versions less than 3.5. Open  using  in python 2.7:Communicate sends input to stdin, if piped, and reads from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached.
I found a simple trick:This will filter out the stdout, and keeps only the stderr.
