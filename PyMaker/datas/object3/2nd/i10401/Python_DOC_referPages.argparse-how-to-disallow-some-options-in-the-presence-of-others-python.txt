I have the following utility:However, if the  option is used, the  option should be disallowed, and conversely, the  option should only be used if  and  are present. How can I accomplish that using ? Sure, I could add a bunch of  blocks to check for that, but there's something built-in  that could do that for me? 
You can create mutually-exclusive groups of options with :, but for more complex dependency graphs (for example,  requiring  and ),  doesn't offer any specific support. That'd be going too far in the direction of the inner-platform effect, trying to rebuild too much of the full generality of a complete programming language within the  subsystem.
