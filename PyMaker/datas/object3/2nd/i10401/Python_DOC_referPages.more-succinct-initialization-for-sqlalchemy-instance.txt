It's my first attempt at sqlalchemy. I have a json file with my usr information and I would like to put them in a sqlite3 database file. It works but I find the instance initialization verbose since there are many columns in the table, as you can see below.Is it possible to use a dictionary as input to initialize ? Something like ?
If you know the property names in the JSON object match the column names of the Python model, you can just change:to:Double-star/ unpacking passes each key/value pair of the  as if it were an argument being passed by keyword. Since you didn't override  for your model, it already allows and expects the arguments to be optional and passed by keyword, so this lines up perfectly.
