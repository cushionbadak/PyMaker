Natural Text
i have been trying to read/write values(lists) in a .txt file and using them later, but i can't find a function or something to help me use these values as lists and not strings, since using the  function doesn't help.Also, im don't want to use multiple text files to make up 1 listexample:in test.txtim expecting to the list  in separate indexes, but by doing this code (which is totally wrong) i get this instead which is what i don't want
Sounds like you want to read it as comma separated values.Try the followingI believe that will put you on the right track. For more information about how the csv parser works, have a look at the docshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
To me, it looks like you're trying to read a file, and split it by .This can be accomplished byIt should output['cat', ' dog', ' dinosaur', ' elephant\ncheese', ...]And so forth.
