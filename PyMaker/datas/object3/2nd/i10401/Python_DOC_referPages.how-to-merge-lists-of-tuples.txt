I use python 3I have a list L, which contains another lists, which contains turples of point (x,y):I want to merge all lists from L, which have a adjacent points.As above: we must to union A,B because they have a adjacent points: (1,1) from A, and (1,2) from B. And obtain: L =[A+B, C, ...]I tried code something like this:But I can't union all of the list from L.Help*adjacent points are point , distance between them = 1, for example (1,1) and (1,2). (5,6) and (6,7). (8,7) and (7,7)
This is my crack at your algorithm:
