My eventual goal is to redirect the  from several subprocesses to some queues, and print those out somewhere (maybe in a little GUI).The first step is to subclass  into an object that behaves much like the . But that is where I got stuck. Subclassing the multiprocessing  seems impossible in Python v3.5.I found this snippet in the following post (probably Python 3.5 did not yet exist at that moment): Python multiprocessing redirect stdout of a child process to a Tkinter TextIn Python v3.5 you stumble on strange error messages when subclassing the multiprocessing  class. I found two bug reports describing the issue:https://bugs.python.org/issue21367https://bugs.python.org/issue19895I have 2 questions:Suppose I want to stick to Python v3.5 - going to a previous version is not really an option. What workaround can I use to subclass the multiprocessing Queue somehow?Is the bug still around if I upgrade to Python v3.6?EDIT :There is a known issue when you try to subclass the  class found in here:But the following should work:Sadly, even that doesn't work in Python v3.5. You get the following error:EDIT :Thank you Darth Kotik for solving the problem! Here is the complete code, updated with his solution. Now it works.
So as you can see  is just constructor method for  class. If you want to make a child class just do You can see source of this method hereEDIT:Okay. I got your problem now. As you can see  on a link above,  passes  argument to Queue. So I managed to get it working by doing it myself in  method. I don't completely inderstand where  object supposed to get  attribute, so I passed it manually.EDIT2: Turned out docs have some information about context here. So instead of manually creating it like I did you can do It will create proper context with  set (to 'fork' in your particular case) and you can pass it to your queue.
