I'm trying to make a calculator but little bit different.I'm thinking if a get input as operation like:At the moment, the program needs to make a problem with user's input. For example, if user types  for first number,  for first operation,  for second number. I can only write those inputs like , but I want to solve after print answer.
Grab the operations from the  module and create a dictionary of the available operators:After doing this you can use  as the  on , get the corresponding function for the operation and supply  and  as its arguments:Let's say we enter  and  and , then:Note, the numbers are wrapped in  before supplying them to the operator since they behave differently when of type .As a simple alternative, you could use  from the  module, supplying it an expression as input:Here you don't need to change anything to , you just join all arguments and make a string of the overall expression and feed it to  for it to do its thing.In essence your call will look like:With a result of 15, again.
