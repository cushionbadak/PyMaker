I have a list of string elements like I have a data set which has nested list structure like I want to assign each of the  strings as variable names for each of the  nested list, in the respective order. I know I can do this manually by typing . I don't think this is flexible enough, and I would have to manually change this line every time I change the names in .Is there a way where I can make use of the  variable to assign data to each of its elements?
