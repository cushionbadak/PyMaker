I am creating a program which uses a TTK Treeview as an item hierarchy.So far, the user is able to insert their own values into the tree, but I need to have a check running for when the user clicks on an item in the tree. I need the check to find the selected items ID and return it.The check I have running relies on the  bind. Currently, it finds the selected item and stores some information, but I need for it to also find the row the item is in or it's ID.I tried implementing my own tag using a counter and the tag attribute of Treeview items, but it would return the number as a . I also tried using the value attribute, but it returned the same problem.For information, I have read through many sites and a few questions on here, but none (that I have found) answer what I need.Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you for taking the time to read.
You can call the selection method to get a list of all selected items:
