I know 2 is a prime number, but when this code is ran it doesn't match the if statement condition . but  so it should be a equal:    
From the Python documentation of For a positive step, the contents of a range  are determined by the formula  where  and .A range object will be empty if  does not meet the value constraint.So when ,  is an empty range, because  is  and that doesn't meet the constraint . Therefore  loop never runs, so it never breaks, and as a result, the  block is executed and reports that it's prime.
