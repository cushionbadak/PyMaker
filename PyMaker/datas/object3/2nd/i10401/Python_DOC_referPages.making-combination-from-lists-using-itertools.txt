How would I go about using the combination function from itertools properly to use list a one time, b 2 times without replacement, c 2 times without replacement, and d and e one time each?
It seems like you are looking for a combination of  and : Use  to get the possible combinations without replacement for the repeated lists, then use  to combine all those combinations. You can put the lists and counts in two lists,  those lists, and use a generator expression to get all the combinations.For this example, the  generator has 48 elements, among others:If you want flattened lists, just  them:
What your are trying to achieve is the  and not the combinations of the item present in the list. Hence you have to use  instead.In case repetition is allowed among the lists which used more than once, answer is simple:  But in case  within the same lists, it will become little nasty and you need to combine the above answer with  and  (same as mentioned by tobias_k). This code will give the list of all :However, in case you need permutations instead of combinations, you have to update the above code with :
Updated given clarification of expected output:You want :Which will pick one element from each of its arguments on each iteration, cycling the rightmost element the fastest, leftmost slowest.You can use extended argument unpacking to express the repetition of certain arguments a little more obviously in Python 3:Or use tobias_k's solution for more general repetition of sequences (that will also work on Py2).
