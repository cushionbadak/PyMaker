I am trying to print a list of commit messages from a git repo using python. The code I am using so far is:I'm not totally sure what I should be doing here. After doing the HTTP request is it correct that I need to create a JSON and then convert it to a python object? Currently I'm getting the error . What am I doing wrong here? Any pointers would be really appreciated. thanks
The  method on requests object already return a proper dict. No need to parse it. So just do .Use  to get a dict from file-like objects and  with strings.
