I'm looking for a elegant way to initialize many objects.Let's say that I have a  module, which has an interface to SVN, Git, Make and other stuff.Currently, I'm doing it like this:and.. well, it doesn't looks good. Is there any way to do this in more elegant way? I suppose that it can be a design problem, but I have no idea how to solve this.I was thinking about creation  which will init all of these classes inside the  module. What do you think?
I wouldn't create a class and place it as a base, that seems like overkill, too bulky of an approach.Instead, you could create an auxiliary, helper, function that takes  and  on it. An example of this with a couple of objects from  would look like this:Your case also fits nicely since your objects don't have some initial value required, so you can generalize and treat them in the same way :-).Now your sample class can just call  with the defaults in  and be done with:the  function could of course be defined in  as required or, as a method in the class.
