I use  to iterate over all interesting HTML elements but I need to be able to tell whether the current element is part of a certain CSS class or not.The overall structure should remain the same.What is a fast way to check whether or not the current  has the  class or not?In above example,  is of  class, which has the property  but I don't understand what this means:classes  A set-like wrapper around the 'class' attribute.Get Method: - A set-like wrapper around the 'class' attribute.Set Method:It returns a  object, which has a  method and it turns out  works. So I construct this code:But I'm hoping there is a more elegant method.I tried searching for similar questions but all I found were various "how do I get all elements of 'classname'", however I need all s in the loop, I just want to treat some of them differently.
There is no need for iter,  does the exact same thing,  only more efficiently.  The difference is calling iter on a set makes the lookup linear so definitely not an efficient way to search a set, not much difference here but in some cases there would be a monumental diffrence:You can also use css selectors using lxml:Depending on the case, you may also be able to use contains:
You can elegantly use the membership test operator :For user-defined classes which do not define  but do  define ,  is true if some value  with  is  produced while iterating over .
