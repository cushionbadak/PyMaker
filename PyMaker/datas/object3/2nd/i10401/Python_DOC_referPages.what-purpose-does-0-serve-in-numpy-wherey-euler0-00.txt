Also what is the difference between this:and this:I realize that this returns an array of indices where the array  is negative, however I simply can't figure out what the  or the  at the end of the line is supposed to do.I couldn't find any documentation regarding this (I'm not even sure what to search for). I've already looked into the  documentation but that didn't help.
 means "get the first item of the sequence."  For example if you had this list:Then  would be the first item of that sequence: 5. returns a sequence.  Putting  on the end of that expression gets the first item in that sequence. means "get the first item in the sequence (which is itself also a sequence), and then get the first item in that sequence".  So if  returned a list of lists,  would get the first item in the first list.
Make a simple 1d array:Where returns a tuple  of arrays, one for each dimension:pull the first (here only) element from the tupleget the first element of the indexing arraythe whole tuple returned by  can be used to index the array.  ,  do the same indexing.The usefulness of the  value becomes more obvious when working on a 2d or higher dim array.  In that case  would give the 'rows' index array.  But the  is most common in the 1d case where the tuple layer usually isn't needed.
