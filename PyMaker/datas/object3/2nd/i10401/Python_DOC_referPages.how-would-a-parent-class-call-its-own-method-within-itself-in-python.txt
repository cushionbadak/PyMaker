I am trying to create the concrete class  class with the Mixins, , , .  is trying to inherit  from . When  is instantiated, I am trying to call both 's and 's   and add them to , . However, it turns out that  will inherit only 's value and all the classes will call 's value. How exactly can you overturn this problem?
This is the interesting part:To get the sum of parents' values, you have to call each of them:Alternative solutionAnother approach is to define that  always returns the sum of all inherited values, whatever they may be, without knowing which parent classes'  to call:This solution does not make any assumptions about the way inheritance is going to be configured.Remarks:The answer assumes that this is Python 3, because of the  syntax returns the bound  method of the parent class, if such exists, or defaults to a function which returns 0.
