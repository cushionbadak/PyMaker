I have the following code:I'd like to check every element in mod_add, but returns only one .With some values  it returns .What am I doing wrong?
If you really have to use :Edit:In response to the desire to  only one element from the list, it really doesn't make such sense to me to do that. But if that's what you wish to do, you can try:I hope this helps.
 and  are strings, they will be rightly treated as iterables by , not constants as you intend. You should either use a list comprehension or not pass  and  as parameters to :Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, so  can be replaced with Comparing integers instead of strings (which is probably what you want) is just another step away:
This is really the kind of thing you should prefer list comprehensions for.  and  (now ) are mighty tools to be sure, but Python tends to shy away from them in favor of more verbose, easier to read expressions.
