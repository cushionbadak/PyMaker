Is it possible to add values in dictionary in lambda expression?That is to implement a lambda which has the similar function as below methods.
Technically, you may use side effect to update it, and exploit that  returned from  is falsy to return dict via based on boolean operations:I just don't see any reason for doing it in real code though, both with lambda or with function written by you in question.
You could build a custom dict, inheriting from , overriding its  function. See the Python documentation.
