Natural Text
I'm looking for a library, I don't know if it's exists. I need to parse an url to check if there is a post request form inside it. If there is one, it should list the parameters of that post request. Example process:-url: http://www.example.com-It has a post request form to "saveprofile.php" with parameters "name,lastname,password"-Save those information to a text fileDo you know any library which achieves this goal?
As suggested, use urllib.parse:
