I have some group data like below a, b, c and so on. What I want to do is to calculate all possible combinations from the data. It's ok if the count of input data is always same. But in my case, I want to assume that the count of input data is from 0 to N, I mean a, b, c, d, e ...I think I have to use recurrent loop. But I'm not sure to use recurrent loop to resolve this problem.InputOuputThe expected output is all combinations with each value's all combinations.
If I am understanding what you're looking for, you can use itertools.product() over the powersets of the inputs (there is a recipe for powerset() in the docs).  The map() function can be used to apply powerset to each of the inputs.Here is how it works:First, it builds the powersets:Next product() pulls one element from each powerset:Lastly, we zip() together the above results with the variable names to make a dict():
