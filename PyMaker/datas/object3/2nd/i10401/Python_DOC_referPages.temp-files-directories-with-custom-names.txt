How to create a temporary files/directories with user defined names in python. I am aware of tempfile . However I couldn't see any function with filename as argument.Note: I need this for unit testing the glob(file name pattern matching) functionality on a temporary directory containing temporary files rather than using the actual file system. 
You can use  with whatever file name you need.e.g.OpenOrOr you can create a temp directory using  and then use  to create a file in the temporary directory.
