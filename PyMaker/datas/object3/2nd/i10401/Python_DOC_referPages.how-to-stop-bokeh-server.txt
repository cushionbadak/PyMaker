I do use bokeh to plot sensor data live on the local LAN. Bokeh is started from within my python application using popen: I would like to close bokeh server from within the application. However, I cannot find anything in the documentation. Also  does not give any hint how to do that.EDIT: based on the accepted answer I came up with following solution:I used  for ending the process. Maybe  would be better. I will try it.
Without knowing bokeh and assuming that you use Python >= 3.2 or Linux, you could try to kill the process with ,  or , using  with  or even better . If bokeh has proper signal handlers, it will even shutdown cleanly.However, you may be better off using the option , because with , the signal is sent to the shell instead of the actual process.
