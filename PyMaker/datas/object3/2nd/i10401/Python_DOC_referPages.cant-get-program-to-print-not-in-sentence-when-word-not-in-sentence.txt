I have a program that asks for input of a sentence, then asks for a word, and tells you the position of that word:However I cannot get the program to work correctly when I edit it to say that if the input word is not in the sentence, then print "this isn't in the sentence"
Lists are sequences, as such you can use the  operation on them to test for membership in the  list. If inside, find the position inside the sentence with :With sample input:and, a false case:If you're looking to check against multiple matches then a list-comprehension with  is the way to go:Then check on whether the list is empty or not and print accordingly:
Jim's answer—combining a test for  with a call to —is the best and most Pythonic approach in my opinion.Another variation on the same approach is to use -:However, I just thought I'd point out that the structure of the OP code looks like you might have been attempting to adopt the following pattern, which also works:In an unusual twist unavailable in most other programming languages, this  binds to the  loop, not to the  statement (that's right, get your editing hands off my indents). See the python.org documentation here.
