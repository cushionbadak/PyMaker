I have two tuples - one with the keys and another one with a collection of variables of different types (list, float64, int and array) generate with the help of the following formula from a dictionary:Now I would like to retrieve the variables from the list of values and give them names from the list of keys. How can I do that?
If you want to create variables in the global scope from your dictionary, perhaps you could update it like this:without unpacking the dict.I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for.
If it's really not possible to store your key/value pairs in a  and serialise them to data file in that format, you can use  to dynamically construct assignment statementsI'd explore the  approach first though, in case that can work for you. There are lots of good reasons to avoid runtime code generation using  and  where possible.
