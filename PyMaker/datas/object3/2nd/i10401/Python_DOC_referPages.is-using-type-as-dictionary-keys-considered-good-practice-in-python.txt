I have a lookup table like this:It looks awkward to me as the  is precariously linked to how  returns and represents a  in . If one day Python changes its way to represents  types in , all the codes like this are broken. So I want to have some advice from pros, is such type of keys considered good or bad? Thanks.
The question would more be why are you doing this in the first place? What advantage do you think using strings has?Class objects are hashable, so you can use  and  directly as keys. And when you do so, you ensure that the key is always the exact same object provided your classes are globals in their respective modules, making them singletons your program. Moreover, there is no chance of accidental confusion when you later on refactor your code to rename modules and you end up with a different type with that exact  output.So unless you have a specific usecase where you can't use the class directly, you should not be using the string representations.(And even if you were to generate classes with a factory function, using a baseclass and  checks or extracting a base class from the MRO would probably be preferable).So, for your usecase, stick to:Next, if you ensure that  and  are functions (and not methods, for example), you can use  and dispense with your mapping altogether:Note that this won't work with methods, as methods have to take multiple arguments for dispatch to work, as they always take .Single-dispatch handles subclasses much better, unlike your -based mapping or even the direct class mapping.
Just remove the  from the lookup and from the dictionary. SoThis fixes your immediate concern and is fairly reasonable code.  However, it seems like dispatching on the type is exactly what OO is for.  So why not make those varying report functions methods on the  object derived from its type?  Then you could just write:and the correct variant would be obtained from the class.
Take a look at that script, I don't think it's perfect but it works and I think it's more elegant than your solution :Edit : modification for Python3
