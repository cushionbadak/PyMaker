What's wrong with this program in Python? I need to take an integer input(N) - accordingly, I need to create an array of (N)integers, taking integers also as input. Finally, I need to print the sum of all the integers in the array.The input is in this format: This is the code I wrote : Its showing the following error.
 returns a list which you are trying to convert to an integer.You probably wanted to convert everything in the list to an integer:You can also use :
You could use sys module to take the input when calling the program and a lambda function to convert the string items in list to integers. You could also make use of the built-in sum function. Something like that:Example:The output should be 10.Modifying your code:Now, if you want to modify your code to do what it intends to do, you could modify your code like that:Note 1: In python when you use range you don't have to manually increase the counter in the loop, it happens by default.Note 2: the '' function will maintain the type of the variable you will enter, so if you enter an integer you don't have to convert it to integer. (Have in mind that  is not recommended to use as it can be dangerous in more complicated projects).Note 3: You don't need to use '' for your input.
You code fails because str.split() returns a list.From the Python documentationReturn a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter  stringIf your input is a series of numbers as strings:You'll want to iterate over the list returned by input.split() to do something with each integer.The result of this will be:    x = [1,2,3,4]
