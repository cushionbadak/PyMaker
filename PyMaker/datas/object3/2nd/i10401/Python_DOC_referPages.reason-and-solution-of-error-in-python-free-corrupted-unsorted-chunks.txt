I created a service using Python which connects to SQL Azure using  and only makes  queries. After 1 day (or a bit more), the connection begins to fail in queries and finally the service ends with the error: I am not be sure if there is only one error or more (maybe the first error provokes more errors).The code of connection is here:and I execute the query in the next form:Initially, the connection works fine. The problem occurs after a time of inactivity.I tried to simplify the queries but I donÂ´t believe that is the reason of error.*Maybe it is possible bug in ?
@APRocha, It seems to be not a bug of pymssql, it's an error from glibc when python free some malloc memory. Did you close the connection after done the sql opertion per request? If not, I suggest you do, or using SQLAlchemy with pymssql to manage the connections in a pool.Otherwise, I think you can try to use  to release the unreferenced memory at intervals, please refer to the document as reference.Hope it helps.
