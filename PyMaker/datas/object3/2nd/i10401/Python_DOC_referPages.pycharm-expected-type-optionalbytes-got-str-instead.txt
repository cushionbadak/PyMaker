I am using  to split up a path name, But Pycharm warns,expected type , got  insteadIn , it stated using  as the delimiter string. So how to fix this?
It seems like  is being treated as a bytes object (a small bug maybe?) or the warning is for another part. In general, what PyCharm and the error is essentially warning you about is that the parameter has to either be  or . That's  what  means,  is either  or  which in your case is .In a simple Python REPL the message is slightly different but the gist is the same:Instead you need to supply a  separator:or  in order to get it to work.Either there's a small bug in PyCharm and it's reporting  incorrectly here or the warning is for another part of your code.
