I am trying to understand the meaning of  field in numpy (see memory layout section of the reference page on N-dimensional arrays), especially for views into arrays. To quote the documentation:ndarray.data -- Python buffer object pointing to the start of the arrayâ€™s dataAccording to this description, I was expecting this to be a pointer to the C-array underlying the instance of ndarray.Consider . Form  as a view into  using a slice: . I was expecting  to point at location of  and  to point at the location of . I was expecting the memory pointer printed by  to thus be offset by  bytes from the memory pointer printed by , but this does not appear to be the case:The  key in  dictionary associated with the ndarray instance behaves more like I expect, although it may itself not be a pointer:So this begs the question, what does the  give? Thanks in advance.
Generally the number displayed by  isn't meant to be used by you.   is the buffer, which can be used in other contexts that expect a buffer.replicates your . this replicates .  But from Python you can't take , add 192 bits (3*8*8) to it, and expect to get .I often use the  value to check whether two variables share a data buffer, but I don't use that number for any thing.  These are informative numbers, not working values.I recently explored this inCreating a NumPy array directly from __array_interface__
 is a  object located at address ; the buffer it provides access to is located somewhere else.Memoryviews provide a number of operations described in the relevant official documentation, but at least on the Python-side API, they do not provide any way to access the raw address of the memory they expose. Particularly, the  number is not what you're looking for.
