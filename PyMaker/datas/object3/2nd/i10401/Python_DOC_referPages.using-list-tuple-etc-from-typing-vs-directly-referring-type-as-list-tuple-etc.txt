What's the difference of using , , etc. from  module:As opposed to referring to Python's types directly:And when should I use one over the other?
 and  are Generic types; this means you can specify what type their contents must be:This specifies that the tuple passed in must contain two  values. You can't do this with the built-in  type. is special here in that it lets you specify a specific number of elements expected and the type of each position. Use ellipsis if the length is not set and the type should be repeated:  describes a variable-length  with s.For  and other sequence types you generally only specify the type for all elements;  is a list of strings, of any size. Note that functions should preferentially take  as arguments and  is typically only used for return types; generally speaking most functions would take any sequence and only iterate, but when you return a , you really are returning a specific, mutable sequence type.You should always pick the  generics even when you are not currently restricting the contents. It is easier to add that constraint later with a generic type as the resulting change will be smaller.
