Natural Text
I have a file with a column of text which I have loaded. I would like to check the occurrence of country names in the loaded text. I have loaded the Wikipedia countries CSV file and I am using the following code to count the number of occurrences of country names in the loaded text.My code is not working.Here is my code:

Instead you should check if the key is present, and if not, initialize the value to 1.On the other hand, it will not, because the checkyields  for all values: a  object's  works with indices instead of values. You should for example checkif your list of values is short.For general counting tasks Python provides collections.Counter, which acts a bit like a , but with added benefits. It removes the need for manual checking of keys etc.As you already have  objects, you could use the tools pandas provides:This finds the rows of  where the SomeText column's value is in the English short name lower case column of , counts unique values of SomeText, and converts to dictionary. The same with descriptive intermediate variables:The same with :or simply:
