You're looking for .Since your return type can either be  (as returned from ) or  you should use :From the documentation on typing,  is shorthand for: is equivalent to .where  means a value of type  or .If you want to be explicit due to concerns that others might stumble on  and not realize it's meaning, you could always use :But I doubt this is a good idea,  is an indicative name and it does save a couple of keystrokes.As pointed out in the comments by @Michael0x2a  is tranformed to  so no need to use  here.Visually these might differ but programatically, in both cases, the result is exactly the same;  will be the type stored in *:*Use  to grab the objects'  attribute instead of accessing it directly.
