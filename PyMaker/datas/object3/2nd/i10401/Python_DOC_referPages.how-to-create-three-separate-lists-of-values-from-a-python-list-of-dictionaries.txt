I am new to Python. My question might come across as simple to experienced developers and coders but I haven't been able to find out an answer to this. I am retrieving some data through a database query. I have succeeded in organising each row returned by query as a dictionary having three keys and a corresponding value to each key. Essentially, I have organised all rows of data returned by the query into a list of dictionaries.The list of dictionaries looks somewhat like this:How can I convert this list of dictionaries into three separate lists corresponding to each key i.e. Date, Price and itemnumber?Thank you for your help. 

Use list comprehensions:One could also do this in a less readable one liner:Use  to turn the returned tuples into lists in the second case.
You could combine a listcomp and a dictcomp:Note that we have three separate lists, they're just more conveniently stored as values in a dictionary.  This way, if we decide that we want to add an additional trait (say, "purchaser"), we don't need to change any of the logic.
Edited to not [illegally] modify the  dictionary :(
