Natural Text
As far as I understand, everything in python is an object or a reference. For example: in ,  is a reference to the integer object . If I write , then Python will tell me the object that x is referencing is an integer. So what about statements such as ?if I try , unsurprisingly, I get a syntax error. I can speculate on why this is the case. Maybe  is a static method of a class, or maybe it has somehow been weirdly defined as non returnable, etc. I just don't know.Ultimately, I suspect that  has nothing to do with an object or a reference. However, that would surely go against the idea of everything being an object or a reference?    
When they say "everything is an object or a reference" they are referring specifically to data. So this naturally does not apply to statements. Of course, all expressions will result in data. For example  is  because it is an expression.There are some languages where  is an expression but python is not one of them.
