I need to store information for 6 items and their respective length, width and cost values and then work out some values based on user input.With the help of jcusick, I have now the code below. I now need help for the items marked in the comments (#).You do not need to write the complete code - pointing in right direction is perfect. So far I have:
I might consider creating a dictionary for each of the variables your are interested in (length, width, cost). Then you could always query the specific dictionary depending on what the user answers:
I think pandas might be overkill for a small piece of code like this. For your particular example, arrays would be a faster storage method. I would go so far as to say, though, that a list is probably the more pythonic way to handle this particular scale. Your performance won't be terribly affected either way here, and it's slightly more readable now, rather than using an array. For further reading, sometimes a namedtuple can be helpful in larger scale examples in which you keep, and access, records:https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple
I would suggest you look into Pandas and implement this more specifically using  DataFrames as they are perfect for what you are doing. Like mentioned by the other guys. Make sure your indentations are formatted correctly. If you don't want to use DataFrames which imho are perfect for what you are doing. I would suggest creating a dictionary of values and referencing them.
