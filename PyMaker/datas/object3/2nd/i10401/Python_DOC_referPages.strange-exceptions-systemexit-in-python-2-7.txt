Here is my code and error message, anyone have any ideas why there are such exception? Thanks.Source Code,Error Code,
This is expected behavior:  passes the result of  to  (to make it easier to set an edit code), and  raises an  exception.It's important to mention that using  is completely optional. Many TensorFlow scripts include it because it is more compatible with the Google Python coding style. However, if you need to customize the logic in your script, you are free to omit . (The same applies to .)
It's coming from the  call, about which the following is said:Since exit() ultimately “only” raises an exception, it will only exit the process when called from the main thread, and the exception is not intercepted.In your case,  seems to be called from the function  unconditionally, so avoid intercepting . If you want to handle all kinds of application-relevant exception, try catching  instead of the bare , since :...inherits from BaseException instead of Exception so that it is not accidentally caught by code that catches Exception. This allows the exception to properly propagate up and cause the interpreter to exit.
