Is there a way to test whether an item in a list has repetitions of 5 digits and above, and the repetitions being adjacent to each other?I can only think of using if statements, but my actual list is pretty long and it will be inefficient if the item contains repetitions in between an item, such as '1123333345', which requires me to write never ending ifs'.With my second method in mind, I'm not too sure how to proceed after knowing how many repetitions are there, and even so, it will return items having five repetitions but not adjacent to each other, such as '1212121212'.Any ideas?
The condition is that i only want the items with a repetition of 5  digits and aboveUse a regular expression:
