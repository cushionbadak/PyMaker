There is a compare package in R which contains a function of the same name, that compares two datasets under several aspects. So you can set different arguments to the  function and so define, which deviation of df2 from df1 should be accepted. So if you two equal datasets, but the one is longer because of covering a larger time period, so you can set .The whole list of possible arguments is:I am wondering if Python has a similar package? So I need one function / package that can handle different cases of difference & equality of two datasets. I didn't found an analogue two the compare function from R yet.The most similar to compare from what I have found is  function, which is not as broad as compare().
Well after months of working with Python I can present the answer to own question.For comparing two arrays use functions from numpy package.Documentation of these functions can be found here.That's now what I needed, but maybe it can be hepful for somebody: for comparing two sequences of text use difflib package, which helps to compare HTML, .txt files etc. Documentation can be read here.
