Natural Text
I am trying to search a large group of text files (160K) for a specific string that changes for each file. I have a text file that has every file in the directory with the string value I want to search. Basically I want to use python to create a new text file that gives the file name, the string, and a 1 if the string is present and a 0 if it is not.The approach I am using so far is to create a dictionary from a text file. From there I am stuck. Here is what I figure in pseudo-code:Thank you. It needs to be somewhat efficient since its a large amount of text to go through. Here is what I ended up with
As I understand your question, the dictionary relates file names to stringsIf each file is not too large you can read each file into memory: This example uses print, but you could write to a file instead. Open the output file before the loop  and instead of printing use On the other hand, if each file is too large to fit easily into memory, you could use a  as described in Search for string in txt file Python
