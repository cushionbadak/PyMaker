hope it work for you :
Cool! I hope you've had fun so far!Python makes these operations quite easy. Both of the functions you'll want to start with are builtins, so you don't even need to  anything!For inputs, this is probably best handled with .The  function prints output.
To take user input, use the  function. For displaying output to user, use the  function
