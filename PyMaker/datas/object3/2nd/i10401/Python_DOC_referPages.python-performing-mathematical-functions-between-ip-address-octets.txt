I'm trying to perform the following:When I use this as an example :Can someone please provide a method as to how this can be done? The mathematical sequence is no problem, i'm just unsure as to how I can take the octet values out of the decimal points to perform the math functions. Thanks in advance!
If you're on Python 3.3 or higher, you can leverage the  module to avoid reinventing the wheel, and it even provides a useful view as  that  can efficiently convert to a real :gets you output of .You could do this by hand if you really wanted to, I just like the self-documenting aspect of the above code. If Py 3.3+ isn't an option, you can get the same results with:That just splits the octets apart, converts them to , then shifts each of them left by 24, 16, 8 and 0 bits (to align the octets properly), which then allows  to combine them into a single .
Convert an IP address string to a list of integers like this: will be [64, 233, 187, 99].I will guess that the mathematical expression that you intend to perform is RPN for converting the byte sequence from a base-256 representation to a single number.  (Thanks to ShadowRanger for showing this).  You can obtain that single number easily as follows:x is 1089059683.
