I would like to know is there a method that can read multiple lines from a file batch by batch. For example:In this function, what I would like to do is: for every iteration, next n lines will be read from the file, batch by batch. Because one single file is too big. What I want to do is to read it part by part.
 and two arg  can be used to accomplish this, but it's a little funny:This will keep ing off  lines at a time (using  to actually force the whole chunk to be read in) until the  is exhausted, at which point it will stop. The final chunk will be less than  lines if the number of lines in the file isn't an even multiple of . If you want all the lines to be a single string, change the  loop to be:Another approach is to use  for the purpose, which avoids  functions:
You can actually just iterate over lines in a file (see file.next docs - this also works on Python 3) likeso your code can be rewritten tobut normally just processing line-by-line is more convenient (first example)If you dont care about how many lines are read exactly for each batch but just that it is not too much memory then use file.readlines with  like
