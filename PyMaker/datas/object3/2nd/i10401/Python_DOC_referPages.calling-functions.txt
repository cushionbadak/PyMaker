this may sound proper nooby, but I'm having some trouble with python functions.i do a level computer science and I'm making a currency converter using a dictionary to define the exchange rates of the currencies.for each conversion, i have made a function that does all the calculations etc for the converting. for example, if i wanted to convert sterling to euro, my script would use the SE function. after i have defined all the functions, there is a algorithm that says because SE is the function name for this conversion. however, when i run this code, it tells me that  cannot be used outside of a function, so is there a way in calling up the function?my code without using functions can be found here: http://pastebin.com/bt23MeTnmy code with the function attempt can be found here: http://pastebin.com/sLFwrDT8for those of you who are wondering why I'm using a dictionary, its because my teacher said that the exchange rates can change anytime so using a dictionary will mean the user only has to change the dict entry instead of changing each individual formula. i suppose i could make a scraper algorithm to scrape a website for each rate, but that'll probably be in my next version :)
 is used to return variables from a function definition. To call a function you have simply to write the name of the function with the input parameters in the round brackets. In your case  function has not input parameters so you have to call it as follow:
