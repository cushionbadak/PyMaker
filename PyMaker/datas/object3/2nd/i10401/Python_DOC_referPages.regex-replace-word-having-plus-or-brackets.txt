This question already has an answer here:Escaping regex string in Python                    4 answers                In Python, I am trying to doto replace a word with some text. Using  rather than just doing  to replace only if the whole word matches using . Problem comes when there are characters like  in word. For example . Regex treats this  as wildcard for one or more and breaks with error. . Same is in the case of  too.Could find a fix for this after searching around a bit. Is there a way?
Just use :It replaces all critical characters with a special meaning in regex patterns with their escape forms (e.g.  instead of ).Just a sidenote: formatting with the percent () character is deprecated and was replaced by the  method of strings.
