This  method return a tuple with a new socket and an address but why do i need a new socket if i already have one, so why don't use it?ps: When i program sockets in Java, i don't really have this kind of accepting stuff and i only need one socket per client and one per server, which makes sense.
Seems like you haven't implemented TCP in Java before.The example you are providing with, uses a default  and  which by default is TCP:socket.socket([family[, type[, proto]]])  Create a new socket using the given address family, socket type and protocol number. The address family should be AF_INET (the default), AF_INET6 or AF_UNIX. The socket type should be SOCK_STREAM (the default), SOCK_DGRAM or perhaps one of the other SOCK_ constants. The protocol number is usually zero and may be omitted in that case.If you were implemented  which is UDP, you wouldn't need to be using 
You have one listening socket active while the server is running and one new connected socket for each accepted connection which is active until the connection is closed.
