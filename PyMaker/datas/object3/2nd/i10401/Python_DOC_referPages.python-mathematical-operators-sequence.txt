This question already has an answer here:Operator precedence in Python -PEMDAS                    2 answers                And when we try to get result of this:We get the divide by zero error.Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in        print str((23-11)/a*b) ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero  But if we change positions: The result is zero:0Should we get always divide y zero error (because (b*a) is zero)?
 becomes becomes
In  this is what happens1.Calculate 23-112.Divide step by a(0)3.Multiply step 2 by b(5)It is step 2 which gives the zero division errorHowever in  this is what happens1.Calculate 23-112.Divide step 2 by 53.Multiply step 3 by 0.There is no ZeroDivisonError because the computer divides by 5 then multiplies by 0, not divides by 0*5. This is because in order of operations Multiplication and Division are of equal priority so they are just executed left to right.
The evaluation of  is decomposed as follow: ((23 - 11) / a) * bSee: Operator precedence
It's giving you a zero rather than an error because it's dividing by the first variable and multiplying by the second.Like, if you change it to ((23-11)/(ba)) or((23-11)/(ab)) it will return the divide by 0 error, too. But at the moment it's calculating (23-11)/5 * 0, I think.
