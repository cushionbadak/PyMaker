I would like to create network timestamps in NT format.I've been able to convert them to readable time with this function:Output:Now I'd like to do the opposite, converting  sec to this format:
If you understand how to perform the conversion in one direction, doing it in reverse is basically using the inverse of each method in reverse order. Just look at the documentation for the modules/classes you're using: has a  counterpart is matched by  (if you're on pre-3.3 Python,  doesn't exist, but you could define  outside the function to precompute a  that represents the  epoch for your timezone, then use  to get  seconds since  epoch directly, without manually adjusting for difference between  and Unix epoches separately) (which you don't really need, since you only use the quotient, not the remainder, you could just do  and avoid indexing later) is trivially reversible (just multiply and add, with the add being unnecessary if you use my trick to convert to  epoch seconds directly from #2) is matched by I'm not providing the exact code because you really should learn to use these things yourself (and read the docs when necessary); I'm guessing your forward code was written without understanding what it is doing, because if you understood it, the reverse should have been obvious; every step has an inverse documented on the same page.
    Your code that converts the Window's  value into a  isn't as accurate as it could be—it's truncating any fractional seconds there might have been (because it ignores the remainder of the  result). This isn't noticeable in the readable string your code creates since it only shows whole seconds.    Even if the fractional seconds are included, you can't do exactly what you want because the Windows  structure has values in intervals of 100-nanosecond (.1 microsecond), but Python's  only supports accuracy to whole microseconds. So best that's possible to do is approximate the original value due to this loss of information involved even doing the most accurate possible conversion.Here's code, for both Python 2 and 3, demonstrating this using the  test value in your question:Output:
