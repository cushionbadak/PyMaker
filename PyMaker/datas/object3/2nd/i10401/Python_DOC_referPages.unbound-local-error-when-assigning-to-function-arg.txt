gives me:-Why is init not visible inside accumulate? 
That's because during parsing the inner function when Python sees the assignment  it thinks  is a local variable and it will only look for it in local scope when the function is actually invoked.To fix it add  as an argument to  with default value of :Read: Why am I getting an UnboundLocalError when the variable has a value?
Since you declare  inside accumulate, Python interprets it as local and therefore referenced before assignment. (Note that I removed the  part). I am definitely not an expert about this, but got the hint from these posts : Here and Here.I guess someone could explain it better...
