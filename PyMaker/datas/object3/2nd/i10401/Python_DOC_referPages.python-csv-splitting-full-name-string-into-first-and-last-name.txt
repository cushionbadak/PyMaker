I have a .csv that has a full name column with around 50 first and last names. I would like to use Python to import the .csv and loop thru and split the full name into first and last name columns into a new .csv file. I am not sure how to go about this with Python.
Here is some code that will help you, you can use the csv module as others have suggested in the comments
