So here is what I am trying to achieve in Python:I have a list "A" with unsorted and repeated indices. I have a list "B" with some float valuesLength A = Length BI want list "C" with summed values of B based on the repeated indices in A in a sorted ascending manner.Example:So far I know how to do the sorting bit with:Getting the result:But I do not know how to do the sum.What would be a good way to create list C?
Use  in combination with a :And see a demo on ideone.com.
You could use groupby, if the order matters:or , if it does not:Note that s in python are unordered (you are not to trust any CPython implementation details).
It is actually a bit unclear what you want, but if you want them to be indexed by whatever the number is, you shouldn't even use a list, but a Counter instead:If you really want a list, you can usebut then any missing key would cause the rest of the values show up upper, which might or might not be that what you wanted.
