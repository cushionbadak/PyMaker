I am getting some error while writing contents to csv file in pythonErrorHow to fix it and what is the error?
You have error message - just read it.The file test_1/1/2013_.csv doesn't exist.In the file name that you create - you use a[0][0] and in this case it result in 1/1/2013.Probably this two signs '/' makes that you are looking for this file in bad directory.Check where are this file (current directory - or in .test_1/1 directory.
It's probably due to the directory not existing - Python will create the file for you if it doesn't exist already, but it won't automatically create directories.To ensure the path to a file exists you can combine os.makedirs and os.path.dirname.If the directories aren't desired you should replace the slashes in the dates with something else, perhaps a dash () instead.
