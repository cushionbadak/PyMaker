I have a function on zero or more Pyomo sets:This fails when I pass it a single set of integers, likebecause then I'm evaluating  on an integer. What's an elegant way of handling this situation?
You can always check if it is an  to catch cases where it is not iterable (lists, sets, etc. are iterables - integer aren't):so just do a check before you pass it into the function:
I think you're making things harder by implementing your own Cartesian product.  Python's provided  since 2.6, and it works with any number of input sets.I added the  function solely to show the exact result of expanding .  You don't need it, except maybe for debugging.Note also that there is no need to call  to test if a tuple is non-empty.   will do.
