I have read through similar questions on stack overflow, however non of them solve the unicode problem I have: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 302.Have tried:    import sys    reload(sys)    sys.setdefaultencoding("utf-8")however receive an error: NameError: name 'reload' is not definedI try to read file with danish vowels: æ, ø, å. In return receive 'UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 position 302 etc. Position 302 and further on include danish vowels. Is there a way to fix this?So far I have tried putting a specially-formatted comment as the first line of the source code: .  Did not give any result.Also tried: . But instead of reading file with characters as they are for example in the word "Europæiske" I get "Europ\udcc3\udca6iske".Then I tried suggestions from the blog (lost a link to that blog) to "import unicodedata", however, it was not well explained where to take it form there.
Simply open with the correct encoding.  You have to know the encoding that the file was saved in.  Western versions of Windows might be , or perhaps .  Modules such as chardet can perform an educated guess. Also, for for  module, open with  as well (see documentation for using :
that  thing is only for what's being used in the program itself, for example if you define a variable or function with Danish characters.what you're dealing with is I/O, so remember the rule: bytes on the edges, Unicode inside. this means use  when reading in, and  when writing out.
