I have a string, and I want to add unique non-ASCII characters to it. I need to do it in a loop because I may need to add more than one. The problem is that I don't know how to construct a proper Unicode string in the loop.For example, I would like to add , ,  etc to my string. I'm not sure how to do it.
You can use  ( in Python 3.x) to convert  to unicode string:prints Instead of appending characters, you can use  (or ):OROR
