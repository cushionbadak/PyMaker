Natural Text
I am writing a code where I want to search term "X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475" from mbox.text file. well so far, I can search the string and count the number of times it appears in the file. Now the problem is, I have to add the end digits of that string ( here- 0.8475 ) every time it appears in the text file. I need help because I stuck there and couldn't count the total of the float number appears at the end of that string. The content of my file looks like this:My code:How can I do that?
slicing returns a list not a value and the in-place operator for addition is  not . That being said you should use .Or even better using  and .Python 3.4 or newer solution using  from the  module.
