New here and hoping I can help as much as I am helped. Basically, I have been tasked with writing a fizzbuzz program in Python and so far so good except for some feedback I received. Now I have to ensure that the output of my program comes across horizontally and is not printed vertically on new lines. From my understanding, and my lecturers hinting, I need to turn function to produce strings and remove the print statements as well.Code is below:I have tried a whole host of things, and my lecturer doesn't seem too interested in help me. Womp. I was recommended to review this exercise were I played with this piece of code:When I do play with this code, I do get numbers to go across the screen. But for the life of me I can not seem to incorporate what I have written with elements from this. Where am I going astray? Thank you for any and all your advice/help. If you do choose to reply, please keep it as simple as possible for me.Cheers.Update: Thanks everyone for your suggestions, lots of thimgs I didnt know to try! I also found a thread here at: Can't figure out how to print horizontally in python?Which has answers to a similar issue.
