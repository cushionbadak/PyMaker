I suggest the popular module collections and defaultdict in this matter.
The values of the  should be lists,  which you allocate when the key does not exist, and which you append to if the key already exist.

A longer, but faster way would be to check first if is there, and if it is, append to it.  This is faster because we don't create a new list each time:You could also do it with a  block:
