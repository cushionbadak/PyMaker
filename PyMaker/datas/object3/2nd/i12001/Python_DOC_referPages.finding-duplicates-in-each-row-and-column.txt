The function needs to be able to check a file for duplicates in each row and column.Example of file with duplicates:As you can see, there is a duplicate in row 2 with 2 A's but also in Column 1 with two A's.code:
Well, here is how I would do it.First, read your files and create a 2d numpy array with the content:Then, check if each row has duplicates using sets (a set has no duplicates, so if the length of the set is different than the length of the array, the array has duplicates):Then, check if each column has duplicates using sets, by transposing your numpy array:If you wrap all of this in a function:As suggested by Apero, you can also do this without numpy using zip (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip):In your example, this code prints:
You can have a List of Lists and use  to transpose it.Given your example, try:
