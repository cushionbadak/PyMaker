How can I get the same output in DATA as hex(X_AX)? I need X_AX as one byte HEX for UDP communication.Current output looks like:X_AX range is -100 to 100
If you want a single byte representation, call  with format code  instead of , and it will output a single signed byte (which can represent all values from -128 to 127 inclusive, handling the -100 to 100 range you require). The  of said byte in the example case would be  when -ed, but when you  it to a socket or file in binary mode, the raw byte itself would be written.See the  module's format code documentation for other options by size.
