You need to use  function for this:
use the separator parameter to the print function, to remove the space by passing in an argument with no space.Like this:The default separator is a space. Specification is here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print

You could also just do
It turns out a combination of .strip() and ,sep='' was required to print correctly:
