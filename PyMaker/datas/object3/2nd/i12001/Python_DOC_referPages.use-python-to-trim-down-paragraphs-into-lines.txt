Natural Text
Let's say I have a long block of text (saved in notepad), 326 characters long.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam et nibh augue. Sed dignissim eu odio nec efficitur. Nulla aliquam imperdiet ipsum, eu mollis lacus cursus quis. Nulla dictum sem sem in auctor erat imperdiet sed suscipit elit ut lacus vestibulum  vitae consequat risus volutpat. Suspendisse suscipit velit id.I want it to say this:The steps I want it to take:If there is a period, add a new line.If there is a comma, add a new line.If the line is still too long (eg above 60 characters) add a new line at the next space.
This will do:result: explanation: matches any  or  that has less than 59 characters before it.  matches anything that has more than 58 chars till the next word.In the end,  matches any empty space in order to trim it off.
A solution using native Python code would be to use  for the first case, and then word wrap after. Using regex through  is probably more efficient, but this is far more readable to anyone trying to understand your code. It's also much longer, I don't know if you care about that. Anyway, here's my solution:
