I am writing to code to generate a csv file by scraping a html table from a website. The function will look at each row of the table  and store the data columns in a dictionary like shown below This is a simplified version but essentially I need a way to get the dictionary object  for each table row and write it into a csv, where the keys will be the header row. What is an efficient way to do this?
Use the  class; just send it dictionaries for each row:and for each dictionary you produce:Do make sure you open the writable file with the  option to let the  module control the line endings:This advise is omitted from the  documentation example, for some reason; but the object is a subclass of the  class and the advice there applies just as much.
