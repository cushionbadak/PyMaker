Natural Text
I am trying to find the difference between 2 text files using difflib in Python. I am able to print text which have been added or removed in the new file. But I want to print in which line the modification has been made. Even though I know how to count the number of lines in the file, I am unable to print the lines which have been added or removed. My code is here :Thank you in advance :)
The unified diff already contains information about the differing lines:The third line  tells you the location of the change.
