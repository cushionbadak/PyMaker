I have a decorator function  and it is applied to a function  as suchI am new to Python would like to know if I am writing the  function How can I access  in the add method in ?How can I access the return value of add in the decorator function?I am a little confused on syntax and concepts any explanation would be help.
A decorator consists of the decorator function and a function wrapper (and if you want additional arguments for the decorator another outer layer of function around it):In your case if you only want to use the decorator with your function you don't need to bother with the  and replace it by:I indicated the places where you can access  and  and the result.If you want to predefine values for  and  a custom decorator is not the best way. You could use defaults:or if you want to fix an argument you should use 
If you're passing arguments to the decorator with , you need three levels of nested functions to implement the decorator in the simplest way. The outer level is the "decorator factory". It returns the middle level function, the decorator. The decorator gets called with the function it's decorating as an argument and needs to return the inner most nested function, the wrapper. The wrapper function is the one that gets called by the user.The inner functions here are closures. They can see the variables in the scope surrounding the place they were defined in, even after the functions those scope belonged to have finished running.(Note, if you want your decorator to be able to decorate many different functions, you may want the  function to accept  and  and pass them along to . The example above only works for functions that accept exactly two arguments. A limitation like that may be perfectly reasonable for some uses, but not always.)
