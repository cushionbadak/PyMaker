Suppose I have  as a floating point is , so if I want the first two bits of that as an integer i.e.  = , how can I achieve this in python?I've tried taking the number to a power of 2 and casting to an int, so if I want  bits I do . But that is not working for me.The problem occurs when I have a number greater than  so  will give me  rather than  for the first four bits. ( = )
If you want the  most significant bits, one way to start is to use  to normalise your number to lie in the range . Then multiplying by  and taking the integer part will give you what you need.Instead of explicitly computing a power of  to scale by, you could use the  function to do the second part of the operation.
You can use  to convert a floating point number to a list of bytes, and then extract the bits you're interested in from there.
Here is a simplified Java program for the test case:Output:
A direct way to obtain the significant bits of the mantissa in the IEEE 754 format with builtin functions is: You obtain    + mantissa without non significant 0.
