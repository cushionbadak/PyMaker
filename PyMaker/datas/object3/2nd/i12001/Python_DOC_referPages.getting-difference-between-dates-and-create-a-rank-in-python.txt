In the code below, I'll just hard-code today's date so that future readers will get the same output that I do.The  module supplies a  object, which allows you to perform arithmetic with  objects. You can add a  to a  to get a new , and if you subtract one  from another the result is a . So it's very easy to get the number of days between two dates.output

Using this example you can calculate number of days between two dates:will print the total number of days between  and .
