Natural Text
I really don't understand the max or min functions, the meaning of them. For instance, when i write these in the notepad++, in the output i see a letter of the word. And i can't understand it. Why only this letter, not another letters of this word? Please, help me on this way. ThanksIn the Notepad++x = max ("Hello Home")print xy = min ("World")print yIn the OutputoW
As per the ASCII tableCapital letters points to decimal 65 to 90 (65-90 → A-Z )Small letters points to decimal 97-122 (97-122 → a-z)so, max value = o (decimal 111)min value = W (decimal 87)ASCII table  for your reference
To find out why, you can   over the strings:The highest number in there is 111, which corresponds to "o" (the ASCII value of "o" is 111).
