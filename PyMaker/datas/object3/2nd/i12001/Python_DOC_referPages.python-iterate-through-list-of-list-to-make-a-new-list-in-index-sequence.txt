How would you iterate through a list of lists, such as:and construct a new list by grabbing the first item of each list, then the second, etc. So the above becomes this:
You can use a list comprehension along with  (or  in Python 3)
As long as you know that  will not appear, you can take advantage of how  works with no function:
DRY:  has a recipe that sounds right for this task: 
You can do it manually without using any import if you don't want to.Keep N different counters where n is the number of lists in your list and increment them whenever you add a new element from that sublists. While adding them you should control that respective sets counter must be the minimum of all other counters if all lists have remaining elements.When you add the last element of list you can increment its counter to something like 9999 to protect our minimum rule.This will be harder to implement and I do not suggest you to implement in this way but this is also a possibility if you do not want to import anything or want to have a programming challenge for your level.
Solutions that filter out  won't work if  is a value from the sublists that you would like to keep. To fix this, you can do a list comprehension that iterates over the indices of the longest sublist, and only adds sublist items if the index is in range.
