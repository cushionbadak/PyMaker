But I gotI understand that I need to format my write but how?
You are passing 6 item to  function. Also you can not write a list on a file object you need to convert them to string. Or in this case you can concatenate them using  then write it to the file.Also note that you shouldn't open a file like that. Because external objects once been created won't be collected by garbage collector. You can simply use  statement in order to open the files which will close the file automatically at the end of the block.Also as another alternative approach (and more pythonic), for refusing of joining the items and converting to string you can use  module and write the expected sequences to a  file.
It looks like you're trying to write a CSV file. To do this, you can either use the CSV module or put commas between the values like this:This will make all of the values you're trying to write into an array, and then put "," in between each item. It also converts each item of that array into a string, as  expects each element to be a string.
