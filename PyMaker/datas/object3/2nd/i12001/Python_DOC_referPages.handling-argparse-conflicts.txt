If I import a Python module that is already using argparse, however, I would like to use argparse in my script as well ...how should I go about doing this?I'm receiving a unrecognized arguments error when using the following code and invoking the script with a -t flag:Snippet:Error:
You need to guard your imported modules withagainst it running initialization code such as argument parsing on import. See  What does  do?.So, in your  doinstead of just creating the parser globally.If the parsing in  is a mandatory part of application configuration, consider usingin your main module and passing  to , where you'd pass either  or  to :That is still a bit bad style and actually the classes and functions in  would ideally receive parsed configuration arguments from your main module, which would be responsible for parsing them.
