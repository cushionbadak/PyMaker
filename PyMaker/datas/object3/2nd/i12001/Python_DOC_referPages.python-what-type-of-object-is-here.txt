I'm struggling with the book LPTHW http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex39.htmlHere is the code:    What does  means in ? What type of object is this? Why the code below does not work? I get Update:It was a good idea to check one more time how  workshttps://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate . Thank everyone for the answers.
 returns an iterator of tuples.  Each tuple is an index and a value.  For example, if you say , you will get , , and .  Since you use , the first iteration for example will have  and .  You then say , but  is only one integer.  It is not a tuple or a list etc. so you can't split it into two variables.  If you were to say  instead, you could do that because  would be  when  is .   could be split into two variables so that  is  and  is .
 is assigned one of the values in the sequence that  produces; each iteration over  produces another one of those values (together with an integer counter, assigned to  in the example code). Apparently each one of those objects it itself an iterable with two elements.Your attempt produced a list with just integers, which are not themselves iterable, which is why the  assignment fails. Try this instead:This iterates over a sequence of  tuples, so the  iterable unpacking works.In general, all  does is add a sequence number; the default is to start at 0. So for each iteration in a  loop,  produces . That  is itself still just a Python object, which can support all sorts of operations.You can see from the  function in the same sample, that the code deals with a list of lists:so  is a list containing other lists. The code refers to each of those lists as buckets. The  function shows that those buckets contain tuples with two values, the key and the value:The  function handles one of those buckets, which contains 0 or more  pairs (and all the keys have hashed to the same bucket).
