Natural Text
So I currently have this code at the end of my program that allows the user to save the text file. I have no idea how to convert the data to string and that is what is giving me the error if i try to use this code.However, my  is a nested list with only integer values, ex: How would I make it so that the text file is looks something likein the text file after I save it? Also, is there a way to prompt the user if they were overwrite an existing file?Thank you for your time.
A compact way to write this is using list comprehensions. For convenience, I'll use  as the output file.outputTo save the data to a file whose name is a string stored in , just do:To check if a file already exists, use the  function. If you need further help on this aspect please ask a new question. Stack Overflow questions should contain a single question in order to maximize their usefulness for future readers.
