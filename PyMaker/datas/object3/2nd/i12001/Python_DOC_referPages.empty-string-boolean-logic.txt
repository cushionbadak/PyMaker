I just stumbled across this and I couldn't find a sufficient answer:Why then is:Am I supposed to conclude that  is neither  nor ?
Am I supposed to conclude that x is neither True nor False?That's right.  is neither  nor , it is . The differences start with the type:Python is a highly object oriented language. Hence, strings are objects. The nice thing with python is that they can have a boolean representation for , e. g.. For strings this representation is .
to check if x is True of False:for details on the semantics of  and  see this question
In python '==' tests for equality.  The empty string is not equal to True, so the result of your comparison is False.You can determine the 'truthiness' of the empty string by passing it to the bool function:
In a Boolean context, null / empty strings are false (Falsy). If you useAs snakecharmerb said, if you pass the string to the bool() function it will return True or False basedSee this doc on Truth Value Testing to learn more about this:Python 2:https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testingPython 3:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing
