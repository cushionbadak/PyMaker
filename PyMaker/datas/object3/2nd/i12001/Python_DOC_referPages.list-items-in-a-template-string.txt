I'm sure I must be missing something, is there a way of listing all the templates in an instance of ?  Or do I really have to revert to regex to find them?
You can use the regex that the template uses and extract the names:The documentation says the regex has 4 capturing groups:escaped – This group matches the escape sequence, e.g. $$, in thedefault pattern.named – This group matches the unbraced placeholdername; it should not include the delimiter in capturing group.braced – This group matches the brace enclosed placeholder name; it shouldnot include either the delimiter or braces in the capturing group.invalid – This group matches any other delimiter pattern (usually asingle delimiter), and it should appear last in the regularexpression.
Here's a completely different way to do it (triggered by Lutz Horn's answer but a lot simpler):Gives the expected output.
