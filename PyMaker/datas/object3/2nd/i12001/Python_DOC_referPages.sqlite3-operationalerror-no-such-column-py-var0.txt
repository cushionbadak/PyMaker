I'm writing code for a project, and when using SQLite3 I came across this error that I can't seem to fix.I've looked up the answer before, but it always seems to be a case of the SQLite reading a variable as a column title, but here the column it can't find isn't one of my variables so I'm a bit lost. I am attempting to insert data from variables into an SQLite database, and while at first I got a simpler version working okay, now that I try and integrate it into my full code I'm getting stuck again.Here's a trial version that I'm using to get the whole thing working before I try and use it properly:I know the code isn't great, I'm relatively new to coding so it's not exactly perfect, I just want to get that one part fixed because it will be used for quite a few parts of my program.The 4 variables its grabbing are being used because the original ones are  and the sqlite kept coming back saying they were unsupported.Here is the full error message:(Sorry I had to format this as code, it wouldn't let me post it as a quote)Originally I was using  instead of  but it kept saying my variables were unsupported, and a friend is using  and got it working, but she can't remember what she did, and now she's lost the file so I can't try and use it for help.Thanks in advance for your help, and if I've missed any information, let me know.
The syntax of your INSERT INTO statement isn't quite right.It should be:A question mark (?) is the parameter substitution symbol for sqlite in python; using this will ensure that your data is inserted into the database securely - see the sqlite3 documentation.
