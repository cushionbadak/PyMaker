Is there a way I can create named variables in the local scope from a json file?document jsonThis is my json file, I would like to create variables in the local scope named as the path of my json dictionaryThis is how I manually create them, I would like to do it automatically for all the json file. Is it possible?
I think you're making this much more complicated than it needs to be.If you actually want to create named variables in the local scope from the keys in your json file, you can use the  dictionary (but this is a terrible idea, it's far better just to reference them from the json dictionary).Lots of caveats, like the possibility of overwriting some other variable in your local scope, or the possibility that two dictionary keys could be identical after flattening unless you choose a delimiter that doesn't appear in any of the dictionary keys. Or that this won't work if your keys contain invalid characters for variable names (like spaces for example).
