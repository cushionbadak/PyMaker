i was doing some calculation and i got something like this:when i run my application it didn't print it out but when i test it on python shell, it print !!.so i test this, but when decimals goes over 13, like so:does python hide the decimal numbers but showing as rounded? knowing the result is quite important when debugging.is there any way that i can get the full decimals? (i did look up at python documentation, it didn't say anything about printing actual float number.)
It's called floating point round-off error. It has to do with how Python stores floats (in binary), which makes it impossible for floats to have 100% precision.Here's more info in the docs.See the  module if you need more precision.If you just want to quickly compare two numbers, there are a couple of tricks for floating point comparison. One of the most popular is comparing the relative error to the machine precision (epsilon):But this too, is not perfect. For a discussion of the imperfections of this method and some more accurate alternatives, see this article about comparing floats. 
Python tends to round numbers:However, floating point numbers have a specific precision and you can't go beyod it. You can't store arbitrary numbers in floating point:For integers the floating point limit is 2**53:If you want to store arbitrary decimal numbers you should use Decimal module:
