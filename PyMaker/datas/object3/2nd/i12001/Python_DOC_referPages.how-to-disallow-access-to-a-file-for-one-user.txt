I am trying to disable a user from opening a file.The purpose is that when a user will try to open a specific file, he would not be able to.Also, I want to be able to return the permissions and letting the user open the file. I only found ways to enable premissions: , but I can not understand how to disable permissions.
A Unix permission primer:Every file has an . This is a user on the system. Every file also has a . This is a group on the system. A  can be in one or more s. A file has exactly one  and one  that "own" the file.1So what does a number like  mean?The first number is used for some special flags such as , , . We don't need to bother with that right now. Just remember to set it to The next three numbers indicate the three permissions: one for the , , and  (everybody that is not  or ), in that order.To set the permissions we use a number from zero to seven (an octal number). This is actually a bitmask.  is for ,  is for ,  is for .In a table it looks like:2 and  should be self-explanatory.  means that you can run a file with  (this is not a security measure, and can be circumvented by the way). Note that directories are also files on Unix systems such as Linux. A directory must have the  bit set if you want to be able to  into it.The number you'll use most often are:7, for full access6, for full access except execute4, for read only.So, if you look at your command  we see that you've set read-only access for all users. This is not what you want.The correct permissions depend on which  and  own the file. If the file does not belong to the user you want to disallow access to, and is not in the group that the file belongs to, you can use:If we look at the table above, we see that it means:Read, write, no execute for .Read, write, no execute for .NO permissions for .If the file does not belong to the user you want to disallow access to, and is in the group that the file belongs to, you can use:This will make it readable for the  only. Note that this may have side-effects, as everyone else in the group can't read it now either.However, if the file belongs to the user, then you need to change the file . This can be done with the  function. e.g.:1: You can use ACLs if you want to assign more users or groups to a file, but in >95% there is no need to, and it only adds complexity that may be difficult to manage. It's often disabled by default.2: Table lifted from the FreeBSD handbook
