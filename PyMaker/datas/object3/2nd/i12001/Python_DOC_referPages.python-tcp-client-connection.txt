I'm trying to connect to a trading platform with tcp connection, the platform runs in java on my virtual machine. I tried with the following code:The code is not working, nothing really happens when I run it on the terminal, no error messages, o messages at all... am I doing something wrong in here? Is there a way to structure the code in order to be able to understand what's wrong?Thanks a lot
There are several things that might be causing your problem:The server does not like what you are sending it, and simply discards the data. Your client is blocked waiting for a response  at s.recv(..) - if the server does not respond, your client will simply wait.You may need to flush your client socket, as the data may be sitting in the output buffer unsent.I would suggest taking a look at the Python Socket HOWTO guide at https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.htmlI mocked up a quick test based on your script. This works for me, the only change I made was to fix the quoting of the message string.client.pyserver.py
