When you say ,  is now just an alias to the object that  refers to.  To make it a separate object, you can use slicing:Using  means to take all objects from the beginning to the end which means everything.  Since it is a slice, however, it returns a copy so this is a common way to get a copy of a list.This works in your case because  is a list, but if it is a dictionary, for instance, you can use the  module:orDictionaries also have the  method for shallow copies.
