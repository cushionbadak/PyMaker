I'm using Python 3.5.1, and I need to make a BMI calculator using the formula 703 * weight/height^2, after I input my height and weight, I get "TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'"And I'm honestly not sure how to fix it. This is my code.
There are three errors in your program:Since you are using Python3, you need to use , not  to read the user's weight and height.You need to convert the user's data to a numeric type using  or .Your indentation is incorrect.Here is a program that works:
Before I help out, I just wanted to point out that the code you have pasted has no indentation.  Python is indentation-sensitive -- did you just paste it wrong, or is this how your code actually looks? :)Now, there are probably two problems here:Python versionWhen I try running this code, it is able to take input from the    command line fine.  I am using Python 2.7.8.  The  method    has been renamed to  in Python 3.  So, if you are using    Python 3, you should change the  to .If you are on Linux, you can find out your Python version on the console like this:Floats and stringsWhen you take input from the command line, using  or , it is saved as a string, as shown here in the docshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#inputIf you want to multiply the two values together, you have to convert them to float, like this:I hope this solves your problems :)
