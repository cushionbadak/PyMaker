Im having trouble printing twin pairs.When i first did the code i was geting the first number to be prime but not the second number. so i took the prime checker and through it in the printTwinPrimeNumbers(twinPrime) function. but now it's saying that num 2 isnt defined. How do i go about having it check both the first and the second number. 
The variable  is undefined because it is only defined within , but you use it as a parameter for . Also,  is not needed at all, at it is just the same as  but with a different parameter. Just use  for both  and . Also, this is pretty wasteful, as you are testing the primality of each number twice. Instead, just create a list of all the prime numbers in that range and for each number check whether its "twin" is in that list, too.
