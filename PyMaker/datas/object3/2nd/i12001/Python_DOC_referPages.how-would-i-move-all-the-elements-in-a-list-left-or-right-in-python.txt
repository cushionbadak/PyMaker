This question already has an answer here:Python: shift elements in a list with constant length                    6 answers                I would like to make a program that will take a list:and be able to move all elements left or right, and drop anything that would be pushed out, replacing everything else with a 0:
You could slice the list to remove the relevant elements and add  to it:
Slicing is very helpful:You could also do the change in-place:Both ways, the default is to shift by one, but you could shift by any positive integer.  You can also use something other than  to fill in the missing elements with.
If you want the size of the collection to be preserved, use a deque from the collections moduledeque also has extend and extendleft methods to add multiple elements at once.
You can also make good use of  from  module in your case:The idea here is to keep the  of fixed size so whenever you append an item from either right or left the item on the opposite end gets pushed out.Quoting from Python Cookbook 3rd Edition :Adding or popping items from either end of a queue has O(1)  complexity. This is unlike a list where inserting or removing items  from the front of the list is O(N).
