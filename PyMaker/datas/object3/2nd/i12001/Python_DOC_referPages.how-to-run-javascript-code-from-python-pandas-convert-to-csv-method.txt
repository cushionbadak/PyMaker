I have been working Python pandas DF. I usually Load a csv files, but at the same time I have excel files too. I find out pandas is very slow reading Excel files. I have JavaScript code that will convert from excel to csv. I am looking to way calling this script to automating conversion to csv to speed the pipeline. Basically do conversion behind scene. What is the best way to do this? I can share JS code anytime.
