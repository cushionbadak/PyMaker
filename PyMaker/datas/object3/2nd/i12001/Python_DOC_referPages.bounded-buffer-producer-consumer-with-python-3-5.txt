I'm writing the classic producer/consumer problem in Python 3.5 using a deque as buff and 2 process that should work in parallel but unfortunately only the producer works, while the consumer doesn't "consume".. where am I wrong? This is my code:and the result of this is: Just for now I want to implement in this way, as an exercise, just to see if I understand the argument, although I know that it is not the most correct and that I should use semaphores or monitors. Maybe later I will try to implement it differently.Thank you all in advance for your help and good evening :)
You have defined classes with  loops in their bodies.The interpreter will execute the first while loop in your file forever. expects a callable as its target argument, so if you change the producer and consumer classes to functions the  block will be executed (though you still may not get the outcome that you expect).
