This question already has an answer here:Iterate through pairs of items in a Python list [duplicate]                    5 answers                Suppose I have a listI want to iterate over pairs (current, next) of this list. To clarify zip creates list [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3)]The problem is that if xs is a generator instead of list to achieve this with zip I would need to create a list from it and it is surely not the optimal solution.
You can use  which creates multiple independent iterators from one iterator.
This would work in case of infinite iterators etc.
You can first transform the iterator into a list (if you are sure iterator can't be infinite):
