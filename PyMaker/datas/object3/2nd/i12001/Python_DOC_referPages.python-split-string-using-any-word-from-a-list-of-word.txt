I have a list of words.I need to split another string based on any of these words.So, say, if the names to check are:Poverty Point FT Cedar Party Fire TrailsMailbox TrailCarpet Snake Creek Firetrail Pretty Gully firetrail - Roayl NPI want to modify them to look like this: Poverty PointCedar Party MailboxCarpet Snake CreekPretty GullySplit before one of the word from trail list and only copy the part before. Thanks!I should add, my code starts with:str(f[0]) is referring to the names from the first listnew_field is refereing to the names I have in my second list, which I need to create
you can use  here:
Well, here is more dynamic way to perform taskAs you can notice, I'm converting list into regex dynamically, without hardcoding. Script will render following result:
I believe that's what you're looking for. You may also add the flag  like so  if you wish for it to be case insensitive. See  for further documentation.UPDATE:In case you go line by line, and don't want the end you can do this:
As it seems, the requirements and solution shall be clarified and tested iteratively, I provide hereproposed solution incl. test suite to be used with .First, create  file:The file defines the function removing not needed text from processed lines as well as it containstest case .To test it, install :Then run the test:The  command discovers in the file the test case, finds input arguments, uses injection toput into it the value of  and parametrization of the test case provides the scenarioparameter.You may then fine tune the function  and list of  untill all passes.When you are finished, you may move the  function where you need (probably incl. list).You may use this approach to test whatever of solutin proposed to your question.
You could do this using a regular expression, for example:Note that the in this example the trailing space before the occurrence of eg  are maintained.  That might not be what you want.
