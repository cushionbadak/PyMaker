I have the following:I have directory with subdirectories which are filled with files. The structure is the following: ;Each file consists of two rows (first one is the comment) and 12 columns of data.What I would like to get is to go through all folders of elements (eg. Al, Cu etc.), open created file (for example named "mergedlj.dat" in  directory) and store all the data from each file in one adding Element name from parent directory as a first (or last) column of merged file.The best way is to ignore the first row in each file and save only data from second row.I am very unexperienced in bash/shell scripting, but I think this is the best way to go (Python is acceptable too!). Unfortunately I had only experience with files which are in the same folder as the script, so this is some new experience for me.Here is the code just to find this files, but actually it doesn't do anything what I need:Any help will be highly appreciated!!
Here's a Python solution.You can use  to get a list of the matching files and then iterate over them with .  lets you get the name of the file that is currently being processed, and this can be used to determine the current element whenever processing begins on a new file, as determined by .The current element is added as the first column of the merge file. I've assumed that the field separator in the input files is a single space, but you can change that by altering  below.You can use  to construct the glob and element regex patterns, but I've omitted that above to avoid cluttering up the answer.
