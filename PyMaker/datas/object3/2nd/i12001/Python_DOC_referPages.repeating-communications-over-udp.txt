When creating a  from the  module, a connection can be made and used continually for communication until one side execute a  command. Having written the following programs, it is unclear to me how to continue communicating with the server if (for various reasons) a  is required for use. Should the client keep running the  and  methods as needed and pretend that the server will receive the message and return a reply?ClientServer
Since no guaranteed connection exists when using datagrams, the client may continue sending messages to the server and attempt to receive replies. There is nothing special to do in terms of connecting, shutting down, or closing the socket. The server should use an appropriately written handler as before to receive and send client communications. The following examples demonstrate how to write such programs and include a command-line interface for specifying their parameters.UDPClient.pyUDPServer.py
