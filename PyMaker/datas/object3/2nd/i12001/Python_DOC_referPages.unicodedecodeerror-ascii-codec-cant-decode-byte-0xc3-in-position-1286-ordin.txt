I'm trying to use wordsegment in my python code and I use python3.4.4 and it used to work on my local machine. I deployed on production server and I get this error, I have no idea why this happened. Could someone help me out please?
Python 3 tries to deduce the proper input/output character set from locale settings, if all else fails. Presumably the locale on your production server is not UTF-8 locale, and that is why Python gets it wrong.You can force a certain encoding by using the  environment variable; for exampleor by setting a proper UTF-8 locale such as C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8.
