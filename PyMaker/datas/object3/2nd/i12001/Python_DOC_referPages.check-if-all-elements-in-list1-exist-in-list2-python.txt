This question already has an answer here:How to check if all items in a list are there in another list?                    6 answers                I want to be able to find whether all elements in list1 exist in list2, both lists containing chars. The number of times the same element appears in each list is important.I tried using subsets however that didn't take note of the number of times an item appeared in a liste.g. It would find list2 a subset of list1, whereas I would only want my function to execute if:as this means all items in list2 appear in list1.If anyone was interested, using a counter was inefficient for large strings so I ended up adding all elements of list1 to a dictionary, with the values being number of occurances of each element and subtracted all elements of list2. If any values ended up negative not all items in list2 appear in list1
You could count the items in both lists with  and check that the counts for the corresponding items in the first list are >= than those in the second:
You can use 
For your problem, you'll need toVerify that all elements in  appear in  butNo element in  appears more often than it does in This can be done quite easily using :This first checks (using ) that all the different elements of  are contained in . If that's true, it checks how often each element occurs in  and verifies that it appears less often (or equally often) in .
You can use :
Try to iterate over list2 and remove elements from list1, when found:If you need to keep list1, just copy it beforehand
