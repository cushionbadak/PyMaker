This is my code i am able to print each line but when blank line appears it prints ; because of CSV file format, so i want to skip when blank line appears
If you want to skip all whitespace lines, you should use this test: . Since you may want to do something more complicated than just printing the non-blank lines to the console(no need to use CSV module for that), here is an example that involves a DictReader:
Instead of This should work:
You can strip leading and trailing whitespace, and if the length is zero after that the line is empty.


my suggestion would be to just use the csv reader who can delimite the file into rows. Like this you can just check whether the row is empty and if so just continue.
This example just prints the data in array form while skipping the empty lines:I find it much clearer than the other provided examples.
You can always check for the number of comma separated values. It seems to be much more productive and efficient.When reading the lines iteratively, as these are a list of comma separated values you would be getting a list object. So if there is no element (blank link), then we can make it skip.
