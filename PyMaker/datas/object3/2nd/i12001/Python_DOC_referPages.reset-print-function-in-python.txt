I just started looking into the Python and need help on this.In the shell I didNow when I tried to print anything likeI am getting , obviously because print in now a intI am able to figure out that if I restart the shell, print starts working fine again.What I want to know that how can I reset the  to its original state i.e. print to console without restarting the shell?
You created a global that masks the built-in name. Use  to remove the new global; Python will then find the built-in again:Python looks for  through the current scope (in functions that includes locals and any parent scopes), then globals, then the built-in namespace, and it is in the latter that the  function lives.
You have "masked" the builtin  function by creating a variable with the same name. You could do one of three things:Quit python and restart it. This is guaranteed to work. :-) Delete the variable you created, as suggested by @MartijnPieters.Change the new variable to refer to the  function.For the last option, you'll need to .
