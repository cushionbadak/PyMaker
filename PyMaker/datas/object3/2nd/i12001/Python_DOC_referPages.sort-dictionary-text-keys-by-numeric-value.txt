I need to sort a dictionary by numeric val like the following example:I found this on SO:But this splits on the '.' and I don't have that option - any ideas on what I would do to make this happen?Sorted would look like this:
If the format of the key is alwys  where  are digits and  are letters and you want to sort the items based on the numerical value of the  prefix, you could use:The idea is to simply remove the right-portion of the string containing letters and then converting the remaining  part into a number.Alternatively you have to use a regex like:this should be more robust. It would sort  the same as , while the first solution would yield a .
You can use a regular expression for getting the numeric part at the beginning of the string and use that for sorting. Note, however, that this does not do any error checking: In case the key does not start with a number, this will raise an exception.
One option is you use an OrderedDict(). It works the same as normal python dictionary but it maintains the order of the objects that are inserted into it. Hence you don't need any sorting, just update the OrderedDict() in the order you need.
