I've a class like this based on , which also has a member variable that is a defaultdict (my guess: this is where the problem lies?):I'm using  to create different instances of  like this:The problem is after the futures have completed and returned their results, the  member variable contains nothing. To check, I make sure that  is non-empty and can even print its elements at the end of the , but once back in the main process, suddenly  seems to be gone.Should  be initialized separately? What is the right way to do this?
I think what's happening here is that the ProcessPoolExecutor is using pickle to serialize and deserialize your class instances, and the contents of the  defaultdict that is the 'B' attribute of your instances are not preserved.  You can verify this by creating and updating instances of your class in the interpreter, pickling and unpickling them and examining the results.If you create a container class to hold both defaultdicts they both survive pickling and with their contents intact, so this is probably the best approach.  For example (assuming python3):
