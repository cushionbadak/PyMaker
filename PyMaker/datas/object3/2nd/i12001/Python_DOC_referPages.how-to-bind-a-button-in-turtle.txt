Note: I've already tried to find solutions from https://docs.python.org/3/ and other stack overflow questions, but I haven't been able to find it.What I'm looking for is quite simple. While using a code like this:It simply runs the code  So first of all: Why does it not wait until I press "Up"? And second, how can I make it so that it does?
You need to do the  and  calls outside the  callback function. Like this:Note that in  I just have  not . The former passes the function itself to  so it knows what function to call when the  key event occurs. The latter just passes the result of calling  (which is , since  doesn't have a  statement) to . Also, your code omits the  call. That tells turtle to go into the event loop so it will listen for events and respond to them. Without it, the script opens a turtle window and then closes it immediately.BTW, the code you posted has an ; correct indentation is vital in Python.
You are calling the function when you put parentheses after it.  Just take those out to pass the function itself rather than what it returns:In Python, functions are objects just like everything else.  You don't need parentheses in order to use them.  You could do  and you would be able to use .  If you were to say , you wouldn't be able to use  any more because now  refers to something else.
