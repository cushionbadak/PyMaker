This question already has an answer here:Are for-loop name list expressions legal?                    2 answers                How is the following construct accepted in Python:There seem to be no complaints and it happily prints out . How is this allowed and what exactly does it do?
The syntax rule for  loops allows the iteration variables to be any of those specified in :where  allows for the following constructs:This means you can also do other wacky things like assign to slices:or, subscriptions:but I really have no idea why you'd want to do so.This is a by-product of s essentially performing an assignment statement for every iteration, as stated in the reference:Each item in turn is assigned to the target list using the standard rules for assignments (see Assignment statements), and then the suite is executed.So what the loop does is, it gets the iterator from the  and performs an assignment to each of the values in the . Essentially equivalent to the following  loop: can also show this behavior manifesting on the byte-code level. Using a slightly simplified version:you'd get an output of:where the relevant assignment is performed right after the the  command:unpacks the sequence and assigns it to  and . If you also disassemble  you'll see that if you ignore the initial loading of the tuple  and the returning of the value, the operations are exactly the same.
