This question already has an answer here:How to write List of lists in csv file in python                    2 answers                Okay, I have a program that outputs tuples containing integers and appends them to a list like this:I'm wanting to write the tuples to a file with the .write() function like this with "values" as the list the tuples are stored in:The expected result is a text file with its contents like this:The problem is that it says it can't write a tuple to a file; it asks for a string. I've tried to use the .join() function and the list() function to try to change the tuple either to a string or a list within the values list. Does anyone know how I could solve this issue? Thanks so much.
This is exactly what the  module is made for:
Seeing as how someones already shown the  way, here it is without.Just write em out in a loop. Each element in the collection passed to join should be a string so convert each value then use join make the comma separated lines.ResultNote you dont consistently have spaces after the commas in your output. If made my outout like the first line, without them. If you want them just change your joining string  =>
