I have mutiple listsI want to write them in an excel or csv file format which looks like this:When I used csv writer, i need to use  with additonal  so that the values will not be truncated in excel. It's fine, but still the other column is not appearing.I use python3.x so izip does not work I guess coz I've tried it. I tried  and  but the columns need to be of equal lengths and my data is big and i do not know how to place  to my missing values. Besides, I wonder if there is a way instead of replacing  to equalize my columns it does not look good.Thanks in advance!
