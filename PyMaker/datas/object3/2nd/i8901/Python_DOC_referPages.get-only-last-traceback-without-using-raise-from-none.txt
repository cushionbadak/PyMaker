I have a common situation in my projects, where I use custom Exceptions to wrap built in exception scenarios, like:along with a universal exception handler that looks like this:The known issue here is that I get both exception tracebacks, whereas in if-case I want only the last one. There are two solutions in this problem as far as I know.First workaround (use ):Second workaround (call the traceback before raising the second exception)No need to call  in exception handler, just use the  passed to the instance. Obviously first workaround is simpler.My Problem:Both of these approaches re-appear (repeating code/trick) dozens of times inside the code, every time I raise . Has anyone come up with a trick to handle this once inside the handler function?
