I thought  and the use of  is not related with thread, since  is a type of "thread" running under program's scheduler, so there should be only 1 thread running each process. But when I ran examples in Making 1 million requests with python-aiohttp, the code is like below:With Windows' Resource Monitor, I found that the code create 25 threads in 1 process.
The aiohttp library uses threads for concurrent DNS resolving by default in order not to block IO loop, see aiohttp/resolver.py. If you want asynchronous DNS lookups, you need to install python package , which in turn uses .You can then do:If you want to set  as a global default, this worked for me with aiohttp 2.2.3:
Python's standard library includes a module called  which allows to run python code concurrently by using  instances.   and  does not use the  module to operate.Python itself might use OS (low level) threads as an implementation detail - but this probably changes between different platforms and versions.  For example, the number of OS threads for a simple  for python 3.6.0 in Windows 10 is 3.Check out https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/asyncio/windows_events.py to find clues for what might start OS threads in windows.
