I have a large array and a function that returns index lists into the array, i.e.,A typical case is that the range is the entire array, . Unfortunately,  scales with  while  is of course constant-time. It's a pity that one cannot return  from .What can I return from  to use as an index for the entire array?
NumPy has a helper  which can be used to construct  and  objects:In general,  is exactly the same as .
Have a look at will return UPDATEAnd for your need  function should beUpdateas @Eric correctly noted it's better to pass  instead of .So function would be:
You can use  (translates to '...')Edit:I feel I should mention one caveat: If you are sure this will only be used on 1d arrays, it's a perfectly fine and simple solution. However, in a public interface I wouldn't recommend it because it doesn't generalise correctly if a user uses the output of  for indexing a multi dimensional array.For example  won't be safe anymore and the semantics of  will be inconsistent if  has three or more dims.That said,  isn't perfect in this respect either, for exammple  will behave inconsistently. looks like it's always giving the correct behaviour, but of course it's wasteful in most cases.
