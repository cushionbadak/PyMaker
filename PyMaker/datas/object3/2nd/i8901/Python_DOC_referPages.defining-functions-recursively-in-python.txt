I have a simple question about lambda functions. I want to do a loop, in which every iteration defines a new lambda function based on a lambda function from the previous iteration.I expect the result of f(3) to be 2.25 = 0.5*0.5*3**2. However, I get the following error:I thought lambda functions can be used flexibly like this. I suppose there is a known pythonic way of how to do this properly?
The name  inside your lambda is looked up at the time the lambda is called - at which point it refers to the lambda itself, thus the infinite recursion.The usual idiom for capturing a value at a particular moment in time is to make it a default parameter of the lambda, which gets evaluated at definition time:
When a  function is created, it maintains a reference to the local environment so that it can look up variables within the  when it is called. You need to pass in your first  function as a parameter to the second one:Note that this is covered in the Python docs FAQ.
