I have created a package  in this manner.All the Python shell snippets below are from a single interactivesession with the Python interpreter. I have split them up into multipleblocks to add my own commentary in between.Here is my Python version.The following import does not import  because  is notdefined in .The above behaviour has been described in the Python tutorial athttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package.If  is not defined, the statement   does not import all submodules from the package  into the  current namespace; it only ensures that the package  has  been imported (possibly running any initialization code in  ) and then imports whatever names are defined in the  package.The following imports only . It does not import .But strangely after the previous import, the following import ends upimporting  even if  is not defined in .Why does this happen?
Based off of the Python documentation that you cited, when you use  you are importing only the module  as well as  and not the functions of .I suspect the last code snippet you provided works because you have already imported  directly from  and reimporting  after you've strictly imported the bar function establishes the connection between  and .Do you run into this same issue when specifying ?
 is already imported in  namespace as  when you do . So when you then import all names from  namespace to current scope you also import . See:(I am on python 2 but the logic for this is the same)
