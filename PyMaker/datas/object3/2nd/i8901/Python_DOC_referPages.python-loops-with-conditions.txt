Function  will do needless iterations. Is there an idiomatic way to enforce the condition in the  loop?
You can use  for that:Given you do not need  and  in your computation (you only need them for bounds checks, you can even omit them).
Well, you can always use :provided that  does not depend on  and  does not depend on . Otherwise you can't really do anything.Note that this requires both  and  objects to support  (e.g. when both are real list). It won't work for generators.
You can't in-line that condition, but you can prevent the inner loop from being entered.  does have a  parameter you could try
