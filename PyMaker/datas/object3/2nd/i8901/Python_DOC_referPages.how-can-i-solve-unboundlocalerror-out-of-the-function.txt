I got a popular error in python like hereIf it runs, we got this error like the followingsBut in my case, the function is not the one I made but It's included in the library. In this case, how can I solve this problem without declaring the variable with global keyword in the function? I think it is not good idea to modify the function in the library. 
Since you can not control the function, it would be better to rename your variable. May be name it something different? And yes. Using global inside the function scope is bad. Since you didn't create the library, you probably can't modify it easily (the next update would rewrite your changes).  Even if you can modify it, using  would be bad
