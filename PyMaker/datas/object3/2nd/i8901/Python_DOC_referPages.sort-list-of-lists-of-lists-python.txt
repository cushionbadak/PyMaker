I have a List of Lists of Lists in python. I need to sort the highest level of lists based on one of the values in the lowest levels. For a toy model, my list is created first with list , which is a list containing lists with three items each: Then there is a larger list, , that is created by appending the small list and another item together:This is done in a loop, so if the loop has a counter of 5, it will proceed through a function that creates a list  5 times, each time, appending it to list . My goal is to sort the final list based on an element in the smallest list (the list that comprises the  list). I am currently printing the  list out line by line, with the  list ordered by the  of the lists within it (see: 5,10,15 in order, 1,3,6 in order, etc), so my output is this:However, i would like to print the  list in order of smallest to largest when looking at the element in  in the list that makes up the smallest array. So my ideal output would be this:I have tried sorting with , however, when sorting  with , i can only sort the items in list , which are  and . Is there a way to access the lowest level of elements for itemgetter? or another way to go about sorting this list?Thanks.
This can be done in one line:The  built-in function takes a  parameter: specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a  comparison key from each list elementUsing a  expression, the sorting key can be extracted.
