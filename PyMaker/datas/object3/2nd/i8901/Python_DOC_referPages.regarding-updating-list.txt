im trying to update a 2 dimensional list i use for keeping track of a stage in a console game. I use the following code for updating:and this snippet for flushing the board on a new update:The snippet used for printing the board is the following:The problem i get is, after flushing then updating, i get the "bird" on the new spot, but i get it on the previous spot also, even after flushing the list. Any reasons why? NOTE: The stage is a global variable declared on top of the file, while the functions are run in the proper order in a while loop. (Flush, Update, Print) NOTE: im using future to get the proper print function.
I think that in flushBoard you are using local stage instead of global. That's what happens when you use assignment. You should do:I'd recommend to read Python docs on variable scope.
If  is a global variable, you have to use the  keyword. Right now, you are just declaring and creating a new  within the scope of the  function.In the other methods, where you just access or modify ,  is not needed.Having said that, you could also use the  slice notation to modify the list, replacing it's entire content with new values. This way, you do not need .
