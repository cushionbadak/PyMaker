I am trying to program an insertion sort, the insertion sort itself does work however as this is part of more sorts I have programmed, I specifically do not want to declare a new variable for the sorted list outside the function and have the function return a sorted list to be consistent with my other functions. eg i don't want:Instead I want the insertionSort function to change my original lst variable and it does change when I pop the values to sort but does not change when I set it to the sortedLst before the function ends. Thank you in advance for any answers :). 
You don't change any global variables here at all.You could fix this by declaring  as global within your  function, but I'm not sure why you want to; it would be much better to simply return  and print that.
