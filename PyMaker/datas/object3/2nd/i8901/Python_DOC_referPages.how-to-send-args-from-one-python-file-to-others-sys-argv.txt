I have a script that can work with or without command line args. Say something like following "hello.py":Now I intend to write a "wrapper.py" that imports "hello.py" and in turn calls hello. I want to call hello and pass arguments to it such that "hello.py" can still use the logic around sys.argv. Say something like following.How can I achieve this? Is there any correct or clean way to do it?
Do not use  in ; pass a name to it instead, like thisThen in your wrapper just call 
You have incorrectly identified your problem; perhaps it becomes clearer if we rename the  function to describe what it actually does:Your function has two unrelated concerns: parsing arguments and displaying output. Instead, we can refactor it to introduce two new functions:This is more readable and separates out the unrelated functionality, making it easier to test and reuse. Now your other script becomes:This makes the other script clearer, too; not only can it use that display function directly, it's clear from the import that it doesn't have an interest in parsing arguments.Note that you can use argparse to take a single positional argument, and it's actually not much more code than you're currently writing:Also you get nice help:
