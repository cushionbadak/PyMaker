IPv4Use  and  types.I gave you the tuple form as you have the network address and mask but if you prefere the /X suffix it also accepts it. There are actually some additional ways.To use it you will just check if a certain  is  the  as if you were checking in an element is found inside a :IPv6Use  and  types instead and correct IPv6 ip strings when creating the objects.GenericIf both supporting IPv4 and IPv6 is desired,  and  convenience factory functions can be used, and the module will create the appropiate IPv4 or IPv6 class depending on the string format.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html
