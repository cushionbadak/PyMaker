I have my deployment system running CentOS 6. It has by default python 2.6.6 installed. So, "which python" gives me /usr/bin/python (which is 2.6.6)I later installed python3.5, which is invoked as python3 ("which python3" gives me /usr/local/bin/python3)Using pip, I need to install a few packages that are specific to python3. So I did pip install using:-"sudo yum install python-pip"So "which pip" is /usr/bin/pip.Now whenever I do any "pip install", it just installs it for 2.6.6. :-(It is clear that pip installation got tied to python 2.6.6 and invoking pip later, only installs packages for 2.6.6.How can I get around this issue?
If  isn’t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library:  If that still doesn’t allow you to run pip: Securely Download get-pip.py. Run .  Now you can use  to install packages for python3.5. For example, try:Alternatively, as long as the corresponding  has been installed, you can use  for a specific Python version like this:References:Ensure you can run pip from the command linework with multiple versions of Python installed in parallel?
On Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS I wanted to install pip for my second python version (python3) and the following command did the trick for me:
