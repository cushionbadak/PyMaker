When trying to evaluate f-strings with  I get a  about a "malformed node or string":Throws the following error:However it works without problems for raw or binary strings:Can I make  work on f-strings? And if yes, what do I need to change?
This isn't possible.  An f-string is sort of like the following1 :This is actually a dramatic understatement -- f-strings also support other types of expressions that aren't just name-lookups or simple things like item access that you can get with vanilla format strings.  e.g. They support any other valid python expression including function calls, mathematical equations, etc.The f-string gets evaluated by using the  protocol and the expressions that it contains get evaluated using normal python.  This means that an f-string can't be a literal.  It's an expression1.  Note that like any arbitrary expression, it cannot be evaluated safely -- so you probably wouldn't even want it to be "eval-able" by  anyway.1In the AST, you'll see that it is accomplished via the ,  and  ast nodes.  Of these, the only one which could be considered a literal is .
F strings can contain arbitrarily complex expressions.  A simple example.x8xThey are neither literals or nor anything like literals and are not suitable for literal_eval.
