Given the following program:In my do_something function, how can I identify that the 'the_func' variable came from the 'MyClass' class?  Specifically, how can I get an un-instantiated reference to MyClass?...returns nothing obvious.
Look at the  dunder:It's  that adds this attribute.  I also want to point out that your usage of  is somewhat strange.  It would be more usual to use  and  here rather than  and .  Then you would access the class object through  and .  
when you print , you get the function object.So  will give you the name of that class name in which the function is wrapped!
