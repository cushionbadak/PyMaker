Suppose that you have a program running, and part of the program deals with sets that have been created elsewhere on the program.  But you don't know the actual names of the sets, you need to find that out.  Is that possible?  If so, how?
The solution using built-in globals() and isinstance() functions:The output:
Now what are "the name" of those sets ?What I mean here is that your question doesn't make sense, it's just not how Python works. It's a typical XY problem, so please post a question about your real problem, not about what you think is the solution.
