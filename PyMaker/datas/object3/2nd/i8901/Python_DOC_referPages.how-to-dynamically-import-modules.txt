I am trying to import modules dynamically in Python.  Right now, I have a directory called 'modules' with two files inside; they are mod1.py and mod2.py.  They are simple test functions to return time (ie.  returns the current time).From my main application, I can import as follows :Then execute :and it works.I am not always going to know what modules are available in the dirctory.  I wanted to  as follows :However I get the error :I hope I am missing something simple.  Appreciate any advice.
The  instruction does not work with variable contents (as strings) (see extended explanation here), but with file names. If you want to import dynamically, you can use the  method:Note:You can not import from a directory where the modules are not included under  or the current directory like that (adding the directory to the path won't help, see previous link for why). The simplest solution would be to make this directory (modules) a package (just drop an empty  file there), and call  or use the  method.You might also review this question. It discusses a similar situation.
You can achieve something like what you are proposing, but it will involve some un-pythonic code.  I do not recommend doing this:
Super easy way:Swap out the string interpolation for long-hand if you are on Python <3.6
