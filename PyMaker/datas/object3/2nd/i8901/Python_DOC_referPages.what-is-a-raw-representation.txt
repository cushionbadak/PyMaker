I'm reading "Learn Python the hard way" (by Zed Shaw) and it says that  is used for "raw representation and debugging".I'm sorry for such a uninformed question, but I have no idea what does it mean. 
So you know  is used for most strings, that just calls  over the variable that is formatted. , on the other hand is used for  and will return the "raw string", which is easiest seen on string variables. Python printf String formatting - String (converts any Python object using ). - String (converts any Python object using ).When it says it is useful for "debugging", imagine you had leading/trailing spaces in a string... the "raw" format would be more clear.
