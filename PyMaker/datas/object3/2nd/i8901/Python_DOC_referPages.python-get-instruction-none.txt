how can I do to enter a lista of default when the lista value returned by the get function is none ?Thank you
You can use the  operator to assign a "default value" to a variable. This works because  is equivalent to . Thus you could writeNotice, however, that this will also use  if  evaluates to an empty list , or any other "falsy" value, not only if it returns . This may or may not be a problem in your case. Alternatively, use the ternary operatoror a simple  check (slightly longer, but IMHO clearer than the ternary):
