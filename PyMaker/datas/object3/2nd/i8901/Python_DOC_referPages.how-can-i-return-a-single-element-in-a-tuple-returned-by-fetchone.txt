I'm using PyMySQL to ping a Database and get the values back. I am doing that like so:I tested this and it works fine. Now the problem is I'm trying to get just the first element in the tuple  and I tried doing this like so:However that just give me the following error:I can't find much documentation on PyMySQL but that look right to me and it also makes sense so I'm not sure why it's not working. Here is the example I was following.
When you using  it returns a single dictionary with each value mapped to a specific key which will usually be the name of the column in your SQL database. So your code should look something like this:If you don't know what the key is then just  and it will print out the whole dictionary with all the keys and their corresponding values.Also, note that if your query returns more than one row you should be using  which returns a list of dictionaries so you will first need to select a tuple and then give it a key.
