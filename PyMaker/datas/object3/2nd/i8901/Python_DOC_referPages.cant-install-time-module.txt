I've tried  and , but I keep getting the error: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement time (from  versions: ) No matching distribution found for timeI'm working in PyCharm, but what really doesn't make sense is that I can import time in the Python Console but not in my actual code.
The  module is part of Python's standard library.  It's installed along with the rest of Python, and you don't need to (nor can you!) install it with .I can import time in the Python ConsoleYes, because it's already installed.but not in my actual codeI don't believe you.  Show us the exact error message you get when you try.
I think this is a PyCharm bug. I am using the time module with PyCharm and it complains that 'time' is an unresolved reference, even when I useat the beginning of my file. However, there is no run-time error when I execute my program, even though PyCharm does not recognise  as a valid module.
Try using  that should work fine.
I have also got the error, while referring the time on the 'requirements.txt' and pushing app to cloud foundry.So the errors is expected. So, its possible on other scenarios also.I just removed the time from the 'requirements.txt' before push my app to make it work.!
