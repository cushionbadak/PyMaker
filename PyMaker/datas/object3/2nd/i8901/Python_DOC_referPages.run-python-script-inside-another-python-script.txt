I have a script 'preprocessing.py' containing the function for text preprocessing:Now I want to use this function in another Python script.So, I do the following:Finally, I end up with the issue:The problem is surely that the 'stopwords.txt' file is located next to the first script, not the second. Is there any way to specify the path to this file, not making any changes to the script 'preprocessing.py'?Thank you.
Since you're running on a *nix like system, it seems, why not use that marvellous environment to glue your stuff together?Of course, your scripts should just use the standard input, and produce just standard output.  See!  Remove code and get functionality for free!
The simplest, and possibly most sensible way is to pass in the fully pathed filename:Then you can call it appropriately.
Looks like you can putin your second script. Please try.
