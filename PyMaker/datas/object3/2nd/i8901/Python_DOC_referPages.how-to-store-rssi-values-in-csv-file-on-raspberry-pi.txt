I am using Pi with builtin Bluetooth and wi-fi. How can I get continuously the RSSI values with the name of  of all the nearby Bluetooth Devices(Paired as well as without paired) and stored in a file?Thanks in advance.
Have you had a look at PyBluez: https://github.com/karulis/pybluez? I'm sure you can find what you need in regard to the Bluetooth component of your question in one of their examples.In regard to writing a csv file, have a look at the documentation here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
