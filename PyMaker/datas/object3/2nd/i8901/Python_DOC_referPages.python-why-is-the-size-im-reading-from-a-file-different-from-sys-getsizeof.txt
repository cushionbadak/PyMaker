I have a file that has a size of 10240 bytes. This is my script to get file size:Output: 10277I'm reading 10240 bytes from the file but when I print the size, I get 10277. How do I make sure I don't read more than 10240 bytes? I should be sending 10240 bytes to my Consumer but it looks like it's sending more. 
To get the length of , use . Assuming your file is sufficiently large enough,  will equal 10240; it won't read more than you requested. returns the total size of the Python object in memory, including any additional overhead used by the runtime. It is not generally useful in most all Python applications.
From the Python 3.6 docs:getsizeof() calls the objectâ€™s sizeof method and adds an additional garbage collector overhead if the object is managed by the garbage collector.So the extra size you're getting from  is actually the garbage collector data Python adds to the  object so it knows how to delete the data from the file when you're done with it, and any other data only the runtime needs to know about. When you serialize the  object to send it to your consumer, this overhead gets thrown away by the serializer, so don't worry. If you need to know how many bytes actually get sent, use the  function.
