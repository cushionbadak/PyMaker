I am trying to check whether variable data is either of type string or integer so that i can work on it.If its none of the above it is supposed to return false. I have tried to use  but it requires data to be of both types which is impossible. Any better method of doing it?Here is my code:
As a matter of fact,you can use a tuple of classes as 2nd argument to .isinstance(object, classinfo)If classinfo is a tuple of class or type objects (or recursively,  other such tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the  classes or types. If classinfo is not a class, type, or tuple of  classes, types, and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised.
You could use boolean  :or specify a tuple of possible types :So in your case, it wouldn't be :but
You can use the isinstance(object, classinfo) built-in function.This should do the jobHere's the running version: https://repl.it/Fw63/1This is what the documentation says:Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo  argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If  object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns  false. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other  such tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the  types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a  TypeError exception is raised.Basically,  takes 2 parameters, the first is the variable you want to check, and the second is the data type/ class you want to check if it is an instance of (in your case  or ). This tutorial explains it well.
