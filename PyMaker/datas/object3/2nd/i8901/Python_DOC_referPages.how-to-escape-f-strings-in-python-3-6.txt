This question already has an answer here:How can I print literal curly-brace characters in python string and also use .format on it?                    9 answers                I have a string in which I would like curly-brackets, but also take advantage of the f-strings feature. Is there some syntax that works for this?Here are two ways it does not work. I would like to include the literal text "" as part of the string.NameError: name 'bar' is not definedSyntaxError: f-string expression part cannot include a backslashDesired result:Edit: Looks like this question has the same answer as How can I print literal curly-brace characters in python string and also use .format on it?, but you can only know that if you know that the format function uses the same rules as the f-string. So hopefully this question has value in tying f-string searchers to this answer.
Although there is a custom syntax error from the parser, the same trick works as for regular strings.  Use double curlies:It's mentioned in the spec here and the docs here.
