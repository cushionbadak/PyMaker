I have a Flask app that's part of a task scheduling system. The business logic in many of the routes relies on the current time.I need to bring these functions under test. The tests will need to spoof timestamps, so that I can verify that the app responds properly depending on when various commands arrive.Are there standard patterns for writing these kinds of tests in Flask? I can think of a bunch of clunky, non-DRY ways to do it. Wondering if there are any more elegant patterns/tools...?
You can substitute  with a mock implementation. For example in Python 3 there's the  which implements this approach.
This works, but I'd love to find something cleaner:With that logic around , I can pass an optional  argument. If we're running in debug mode, then it can override the normal logic to fetch the current time.
