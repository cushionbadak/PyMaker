I'm working on a function that coverts an integer to hexidecimal.  There's more work to be done with two's compliment and handling negatives but right now I'm just working on getting the core logic to work.  Here is what I have:I want the output to look like this for this example:I'm trying to use a loop to iterate through  and check to see if an element in  matches a key in .  If it does I want to swap the list element for the dictionary value that it matched.  So if say  is found in the list, it will be found in the dictionary and that element in the list will be changed to  the matching dict value.  I don't know where to go from here 
You could use  to iterate over  tuples. For each value you could use  to either get value from  or use default value passed as a second parameter. Then just assign whatever the  returns to the index in :Note that I've changed  to contain integers instead of strings since the keys in  are integers as well.In case you just want convert  to hexadecimal representation you can use  builtin:
