I'm a beginner user for Python, but I get confused between literal and variables.This is what I know about a literal:  And variables: 
A literal is notation for representing a fixed () value.A variable is storage location associated with a symbolic name (pointed to, if you'd like).It's best explained in use:
In any programming language a Literal is a constant value, where as identifiers can change their values. Identifiers can store literals and process them further. Identifiers are name given to variables., , , , etc. are examples for literals. But in the statement , x is a variable and 123 is a Literal.
