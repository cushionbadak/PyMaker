Ok, I read all of these before and I think pandas could be a solution, but my problem is slighly different:Print a dictionary of lists verticallyPrinting Lists as Tabular Dataprint dictionary values which are inside a list in pythonPrint a dictionary into a table I have a dict of lists :  What I want as an output is :  (or even better,or a value matching A, B, C or (A,in) in another dictionary,but if I can merely have the first table, I'll be more than happy)No list contains repeats, but every elements in these lists are extracted from a same list (actually my problem is making a grid of annotated terms with the corresponding proteins, the keys being the annotated terms, which are functions related to these proteins in my context of study).I indeed can think of a convoluted way to do so (building vectors of 0 and 1 for comparison of each list to the general list, associating these vectors with the keys, putting this in a pandas DataFrame which will be well formatted by the magic of me restablishing the good number of entities per list, and print this), but this seems/is tedious/unpythonic.I think there must be a known way to do that with some module (pandas, prettytable, other?); and that I just don't know it.So I'll be glad for any insight about this. Thanks

Just a simple draft (based on a lot of ):It's not really flexible (variable column width, etc.) though but should be easily extendable.
Consider your input dictionary:Use  so that the iterable becomes the values present inside  (a.k.a ) which is a  and it's default value would be the  key (a.k.a ). With the help of a dictionary comprehension, the result computed at the last step would constitute the values of the dataframe. Transpose it so that the column headers become index axis and vice-versa.Later, fill  by .
