I will try to provide example for the question. Let's say we have 3 lists. e.g :-Or, say there are list values for each lines in the file.Now I want to write the three lists to three different files by creating them. The names of the files should be autogenerated e.g:-
I am assuming that your data is in the console and each list is a line.something like this:I merged all the data into one lists of listThis above part is not necessary if all the list values are line by line in one variable. If not you can merge them using some method.Now, write each line (list values) to the different file:This keeps going on until the last value of the list. So, based on how many lists are there. If you want to join the values inside the list you can change the  with something desirable in the single quotes ().Hope I helped.
You can see a detailed explanation here . But to sum it all up ,  you define an object of the type file , by opening a file(or creating one if it doesn't exist) , and then writing / reading / etc...
Use enumerate and string formatting to construct the file names.If any of the items are not strings change the write to If the lists are so long that creating a single string to write to the file is prohibitive, change the write to
