I'd like to find out if the idea below is safe for usage in unittest.  The issue that I have is that I want to perform the exact same set of tests but with slightly different setup work.  Sudo code to follow:
No, this won't really work; you've defined  in your test suites so that's the one that will be run, and the one in  will be ignored.By the way,  should be a class method.One way to fix this is to use a simple inheritance hierarchy and define  as a class variable in your child classes:
If you're using Python 3.4 or later, consider the use of subtests. Subtests provide a mechanism for parameterizing a test.For your code you could consider something like the following:The subtests will each report as a separate test, but allow you to reuse test code.
