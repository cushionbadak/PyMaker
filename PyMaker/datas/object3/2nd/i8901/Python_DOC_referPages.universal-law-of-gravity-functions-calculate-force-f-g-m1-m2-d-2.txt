I am currently trying to learn Python, so I can provide new opportunities for the children of my community.I am stuck a on functions, I am trying to calculate the force of between two bodies of space using the Universal Law of Gravity equation. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, I feel like I a might not even be calling the m2, so it can calculate or perhaps I need to make planet specific functions that then populate the equation, and require a user input? Here is what I have so far: I am learning from reading a book, and watching youtube, I know there are holes in my understanding. Any help or orientation would be greatly appreciated.  
I would do something like this:A few problems to point out: This gives the error  because you call functions like  and so when you use  it thinks you're trying to call  as a function. Don't forget to add a  between  and . This gives the error  because you can't just assign the parameter  a property without first defining what that is. If you want to have multiple options, use a dictionary like I do above or create a separate class.  Here you're just printing the value that you input. To get the input value, assign it to a variable. Then you must call the function  at some point with your arguments. Don't define your arguments within the function, get them outside and then pass them into it.
There are a few different issues with this code. I cleaned it up a bit below, hopefully this helps to set you on the right trackNote that the planet constants were moved into a dictonary and the  variable is being passed a constant
