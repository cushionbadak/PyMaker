Total beginner with Python, need help to achieve a task!I have two csv files. old.csv and new.csvBoth have same structure (A to Z columns), and each record has a unique identifier which is a number, in column F (sixth column). Between these two CSVs there are a few duplicates records.Iâ€™m looking for a way to eliminate records that are also in the old.csv, from the new.csv and output to a new file that has the same structure, so the new output.csv has truly only the new records.What's a good way to achieve this? I need to be able to run this on a windows machine through a command line.Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance!
Read the csv file and map it to tupleGet all unique identifiers in old.csvadd all items whose identifier is not in old.csv, add them to unique listWrite the rows to output.csvHope this helps!
A simple approach would be:collect all identifiers from old.csv in a setloop through new.csvif a record has an identifier that's noz in your set, write it to output.csvYou will probably want to use the csv module for reading and writing the files.
