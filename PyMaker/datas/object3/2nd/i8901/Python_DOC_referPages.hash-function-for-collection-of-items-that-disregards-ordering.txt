I am using a the  function to get the hash value of my object which contains two integers and two Strings. Moreover, I have a dictionary where I store these objects; the process is that I check if the object exists with the hash value, if yes I update if not I insert the new one. The thing is that when creating the objects, I do not know the order of the object variables and I want to treat the objects as same no matter the order of these variables.Is there an alternative function to the  function that does not consider the order of the variables?
You could use a  instead of a tuple:However, the removal of duplicates from the iterable presents a subtle problem:You can fix this by creating a counter from the iterable using , and calling  on the counter's items, thus preserving the count of each item from the original iterable:
Usually for things like this it helps immeasurably if you post some sample code, but I'll assume you've got something like this:You're taking a hash of a tuple there, which does care about order. If you want your hash to not care about the order of the ints, then just use a frozenset:
