I'm new to python and I'm trying to figure out how to access and use integers stored in lists of tuple pairs (a, b), such that I can divide a by b and if it meets a criteria, I append the tuple to a new list and I count the tuple. I would like to do this using only basic functions and for-loops.I borrowed some code from another stackoverflow question that I used to create the list of tuples from two separate integer lists of different sizes as such: This gives me:New tuple count:  41But I want to know if I divide 10 by 1 from (10, 1), 11 by 2, etc., will I get an integer, and if so, I want to add that to a new list and count the number of tuple pairs this is true for. I have tried this:I have also tried something like this:any help would be appreciated!
Try the following : It gives the following output You can easily adapt this for your program I think !!PS : The length of  above will give you the tuple count.
I would also like to add that you can reduce your code to get the original list of tuples to the following using .
