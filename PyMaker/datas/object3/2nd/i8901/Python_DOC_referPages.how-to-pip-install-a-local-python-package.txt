QuestionI installed a local package called  usingBut when I try to import the package from a sibling directory, it fails with an ImporError:Confusingly, the package  is listed as successfully installed as shown when I run :How can I install my local package so that it can be imported?BackgroundI am using Python 3.4 (32-bit). The package contains two files:The  file defines a single function. The  file is short:WorkaroundI currently add the directory containing the package () to my  variable as a workaround. But my question is how to install the package properly so that I do not need to modify the .
The problem centers on . It needs to declare a package:But this  must be in the parent directory of the  package, so in the end, the directory structure is:With this change, the module is found after reinstalling the package.This could also be caused by two Python installs (but wasn't in my case), and @Mr_and_Mrs_D gives an answer for that case.
Uninstall the python package then install it using:What is probably happening is that you have multiple python installs and pip is run from one install while you are trying to use the package from another.
