This is my decorator. I want any function that has this decorator to be checked if  is an absolute path or not. If not I want to fault the  by returning  if the decorated  returns . And returning  if the  returns anything other than .The thing is  is a folder operation (deleting, moving, naming, ...) hence I cannot just try it to see what it returns.Is there anyway I can check what value  will be returned without actually executing it? Is there any workaround?
You can try annotating your function with return type.Now you can get return type using  attribute.This does however require you to annotate return type of all functions which return type you want to check.To be honest, I also don't know when it was added to Python, but it works for me with Python 3.5.If you are hardcore programmer who has plenty of time, I think you can use  module to check bytecode of function for  statements and guess types. I don't recommend it though.
No, you cannot do this by definition. This is how dynamic languages work; you cannot know what type will be returned until you execute the function.
