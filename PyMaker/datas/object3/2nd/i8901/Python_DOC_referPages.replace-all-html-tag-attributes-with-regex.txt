I'm trying to figure out how can I add attribute  to all tags in  snippet and remove another attributes.For example:to:The  is a tag name in uppercase and _1 means ordering. So if this  would be a second tag, it would have  id. The ordering is in DFS meaning so if the  has some child like , the  tag would have id: .I tried to find all tags and then, remove their attributes and one by one add them their ID's. This finds all tags. My idea is like:But can't figure out how to continue.The snippet:
First replace all tag attributes with the id structure and a unique identifier. In a second step replace the unique identifier one by one in a loop.Code returns a tuple including the number of subs, this enables the break condition for the loop.Result
