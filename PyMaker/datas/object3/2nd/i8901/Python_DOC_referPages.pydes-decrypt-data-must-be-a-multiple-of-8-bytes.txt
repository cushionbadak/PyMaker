I apoligise now, my programming habits aren't very good. I have modified the basic pyDes code from thier website:When I run the program, the encryption works fine, however, the decryption throws the error:Sorry if this is really annoying and simple :-(
The problem appears to be your use of  to convert a  value to a string.Perhaps you settled on using this after trying the following codeand finding that it reports the error .One thing to note about the output of the  and  methods (and the inputs as well, for that matter) is that they use  objects, not strings ().  What you are doing is taking the  object that comes back from a call to , converting it to a string using  (which isn't the right way to do this) and then attempting to decrypt your string rather than the  value you got back from .What you need to be doing instead is converting the text to be encrypted into a  object, using the  method of a , before you pass this to .  You'll need to specify a character set to do this encoding in, such as .  Once you get the output back from ,  convert it back to a string using the  method of a  object.The encrypted data, however, isn't likely to be readable in any character set.  (It's quite likely not to be well-formed UTF-8, so don't try converting it into that.)  If you want to take a look at what it looks like, perhaps the best thing to do is to use the built-in  function, but only use that when printing the value.After making these changes, here's what the last few lines of your code look like:Here's the output from a sample run:The  sequences within the encrypted data are how Python displays individual bytes within a  object that aren't in the ASCII range.
