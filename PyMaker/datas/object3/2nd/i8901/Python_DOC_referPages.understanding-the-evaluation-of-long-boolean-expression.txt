This is a logic question we are learning in a Python class. I dont understand how the answer is 3, that is how  is , can anyone help?
Whenever confused with boolean expressions, it helps to use parentheses to make the sequence of evaluation clear. The parentheses can be placed by following the precedence rules and the associativity of operators. Then you can substitute and evaluate the results:If you evaluate the last example yourself, you'll see how it leads to  which yields  thereby allowing the  statement that contains it to run.
