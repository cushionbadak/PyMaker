Natural Text
I don't understand why when I set the symbol to real  seem to consider it a constant:
The issue is that the variable  in  and the variable  are not considered the same, due to the "real" attribute of . Hence, in the differentiation the  variable is treated as a constant, yielding .  To fix this if you intend on working with real variables, you can define your expression with a real variable . Instead of passing an explicit dict with the  keyword argument, you could also just call  with  to pull in all the entire local symbol table as a dict, which may be useful if you have many Symbol variables.
