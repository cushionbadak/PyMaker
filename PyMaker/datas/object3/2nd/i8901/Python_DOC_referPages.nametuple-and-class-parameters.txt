My lecturer wrote some code and I have no idea how to read it and google isn't helping, can someone please clarify how this code interacts.Is the method call for the classThe class Arc contains no methods, and no __init. I have no clue how these two are interacting since I thought class parameters accepted another class, and it made the current class a subclass or abstract etc. 
The  function is a class factory. It takes some parameters and returns a class. The class inherits from , but its values are also accessible by name as attributes (not only by index).The  class you show uses  to create its base class. You could equivalently write it with separate statements, giving the base class it's own name:If the  class doesn't have any methods of its own, there wouldn't be much point in defining it at all (you'd just use the name  instead of  for the class returned from ). I'm guessing there is some more code in the  class, just not anything relevant to your question. The behavior inherited from the base class is enough to create instances using positional or keyword arguments, so the  statement you show doesn't need any additional code.
