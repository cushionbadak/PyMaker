I have a series of files that are in the following format:For each file I want to do something like:do some work on the data, and save it as another file:Instead of doing all these for every single file, how can I iterate through multiple files and repeat the same operation across multiple files? In other words, I would like to iterate over all the files (they mostly following a numerical sequence in their names, but there are some gaps in the sequence). Thanks for the help in advance.
You should use Python's  module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.htmlFor example:
I would recommend glob.Doing  returns a list which you can iterate on and do work.Doing  returns a generator object which is an iterator.The first one will give you something like:
You can use os.listdir or glob module to list all files in a directory.With os.listdir, you can use fnmatch to filter files like this (can use a regex too);Or with glob module (which is a shortcut for the fnmatch + listdir) you can do the same like this (or with a regex):
If you know how your file names can be constructed, you might  to open a file with the  attribute, so that  fails if the file is non existent.
