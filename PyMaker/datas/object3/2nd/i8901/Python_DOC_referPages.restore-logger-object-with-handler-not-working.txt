Could I store the  object which contains  and restore it? As an example:And the console output works well but no output in file. Only the log in the  will be outputted to the file but not the log in .Any help is appreciated. 
I guess it's an configuration issue of the logger. Especially the log level. The default is 'WARNING'. So your logger.info(..) get's ignored. You have to configure the logger.Looke here: Docs for logging
