I'm trying to figure out how to copy CAD drawings (".dwg", ".dxf) from a source directory with subfolders to a destination directory and maintaining the original directory and subfolders structure.Original Directory: H:\Tanzania...\Bagamoyo_Single_line.dwgSource Directory: H:\CAD\Tanzania...\Bagamoyo_Single_line.dwgI found the following answer from @martineau within the following post: Python Factory FunctionUpdated: 18:21. The following code works as expected, except that I'd like to ignore folders that don't contain any include_patterns('.dwg', '.dxf')
 already contains a function , so you don't have to provide your own. Straight from the documentation:This will copy everything except  files and files or  directories whose name starts with It's a bit tricky (and not strictly necessairy) to explain what's going on:  returns a function  as its return value, this function gets stuffed into  as a parameter, and  calls this function as needed, so you don't have to know or care how to call this function . It just means that you can exclude certain unneeded cruft files (like ) from being copied. The fact that the name of the function  starts with an underscore is a hint that this function is an implementation detail you may ignore. expects that the folder  doesn't exist yet. It is not a problem that this folder and its subfolders come into existence once  starts to work,  knows how to handle that.Now  is written to do the opposite: ignore everything that's not explicitly included. But it works the same way: you just call it, it returns a function under the hood, and  knows what to do with that function:
