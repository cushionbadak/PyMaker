Natural Text
I have a application that converts from one photo format to another by inputting in  following:  "AppConverter.exe" "file.tiff" "file.jpeg"But since i don't want to input this every time i want a photo converted, i would like a script that converts all files in the folder. So far i have this:So how do i get the names of all the files and put them in . I am thinking taking basename (no ext.) for every file and pasting it in  and , but im at lost on how to do it.
I think the fastest way would be to use the  module for expressions:All those informations are on the post I've linked in the comments o your original question.
You could try looking into os.path.splitext(). That allows you to split the file name into a tuple containing the basename and extension. That might help...https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html
