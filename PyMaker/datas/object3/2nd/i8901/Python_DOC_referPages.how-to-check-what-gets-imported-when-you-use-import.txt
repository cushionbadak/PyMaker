I am new to python. I have a very basic question. When we use the following command (I understand its not efficient to import everything using *)from _ (any module name) import *How can I check the things that get imported using the above command?
You can use  to see what names are in the current module. By comparing the names before and after the import you can see what's imported:To exclude :NOTEThis won't catch objects that have been replaced (e.g. you defined  before importing everything in ).
