Natural Text
I have a very long binary number (200 digits 0's and 1's long) which I would like to decode. I do not know if this is in Binary 2, Binary 8, Binary 16 or any other (just a long list of 0 and 1)How can this be decoded (hopefully into some meaningful text) Is it through some program (say in Python)  or any tools that this could be achieved?
Wait I didn't think of what TigerhawkT3 mentioned.Are you talking about UTF-8, UTF-16?You might be able to use Python codecs module."codecs.getreader(encoding)Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its StreamReader class or factory function.Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found."This link might help.Good luck.
