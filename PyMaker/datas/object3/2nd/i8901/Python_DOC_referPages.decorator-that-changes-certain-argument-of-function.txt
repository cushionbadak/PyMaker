Working on a new version of the library I change one of the default arguments of several functions. So I'd like to add a temporary warning that occurs when user calls a function without explicitly specified parameters (so function is called with its defaults).It could be easily done just by adding the warning function and calling it inside each of base functions:However it would be more convenient to do it using decorator (for code readability). So I've implemented something like this:That works as expected when I call  without  parameter and if  is specified as a keyword parameter.But how to include the possibility that  can be called with only positional parameters? Calling decorated  will produce an  due to duplication of  parameter.Note: I cannot assume that the  is always the 3rd parameter as I need to decorate different functions. I also cannot change the parameters order to preserve backward compatibility.
