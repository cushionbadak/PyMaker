I have a numpy array with the shape All I want to do is to check whether the even number columns has a positive value, eg. . In that case I want to remove the whole row in my array. I put this up:This eliminates the desired rows but looks at the second column. I want it to check for column 4, column 6, column 8 etc too. Is there an way of doing that using my method above? 
If you are dealing with NumPy arrays, then you could use fancy indexing approach (indexing an array with an array sequence of integers) as shown:Explanation:To select positions of odd numbered columns whose values are to be compared:Next we subset the array based on these indices and see if the values under these columns are lesser than zero by providing  which performs column-wise check and returns an array containing a reduced number of rows after dropping the remaining ones.
Although perhaps not the most efficient way, you can use the elementwise and  for all the rows:So you mask out all items for which there exists an even column that is positive.You can make it more elegantly (with a minor performance penalty) by using :In case the  is not fully known in advance, you can use :
The general way is to build a list comprehension with a condition:
If you don't want a loop (as it iteratively shrinks your dataframe with some associated overhead):So in one line:
Without using a loop, there is no single command that will help you with your motive. I suggest looping over all the rows and then doing this.
