I want to execute the above command from Python code. Below is the code I have written.Running the above code, I get  error. As per my knowledge the unix os can't parse the echo command which is inside the braces.Help me fix this error.
First,  is discouraged in favor of . That's worth knowing because there's a lot of additional detail in the  documentation, including this description of the  parameter (emphasis added):On POSIX with , the shell defaults to .... Popen does the equivalent of:So now we know why your command doesn't work - it's not invoking Bash. As mhawke suggests you should instead invoke  directly, but you should prefer the  module over :Note that, since we're explicitly invoking the Bash shell, we don't need , and since the command we're telling Bash to invoke is a single argument we don't need to repeatedly escape them, e.g. with  as mhawke did.Once you've verified this command works, you'll likely want to move away from simply invoking  to one of  other functions that are more scripting-friendly, such as , which returns a  object you can inspect.As Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre suggests you can do a lot more powerful things with  as well, including starting the  substitutions as separate processes and piping them into a call to , thus avoiding needing to invoke  or write Bash syntax in Python. It's more verbose, but more extensible and maintainable.
The command runs fine in , however,  is executing the command in . You can check with:The command fails when executed with :You can explicitly run the command in  like this:Since you are probably interested in the output of the command you would ordinarily be able to use  to execute the command and collect its output. Unfortunately  likes to return non-zero exit codes when it detects differences in the input files, so that prevents simply using . You can cheat by piping 's output through :
or you could
