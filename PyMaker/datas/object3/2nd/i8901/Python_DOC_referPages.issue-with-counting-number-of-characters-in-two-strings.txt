The purpose of this function is to compare the number of times a color appears in the code and the number of times it appears in the guess to ultimately determine how many colors were guessed correctly. I am experiencing some errors with my current code, and I believe that the number of lines could be greatly simplified. More specifically, I think I am overcomplicating the task at hand.Does anyone have a suggestion of a better way to tackle this problem? I am very new to programming and it would be greatly appreciated.  
Maybe you can build up from something like this, using collections.Counter:This will give you the count of correct guesses, disregarding position.
assuming we ignore colors missing from both input strings, here is a way:
Hereâ€™s one way to do it: will count the number of each color in a word, given a list of colors to count from. This uses a list comprehension. explained:This will run countColors with secretCode and guess. Equivalent to writing:This will take them in pairs: the first one of each, then the second, etc. So, this will essentially create a list for each color:. is probably easier to understand here.
Wow, that's a lot of code... Can be simplified to:No additional modules required.  are not needed for this comparison, you should check against  when users input their combination.
