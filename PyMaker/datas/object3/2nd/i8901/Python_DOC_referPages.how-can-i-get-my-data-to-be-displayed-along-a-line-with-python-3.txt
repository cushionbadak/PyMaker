Natural Text
I am writing a program that counts how many times each letter is typed to help me with frequency analasis. My program works, but it always outputs part of my answers along a curvy line. Example output:I am using the following code:I am trying to get it displayed something like this:Thank you in advance!
To pad with a number of spaces:
Depends on how you want to display it. One of the ways would be to add tabs in your print statement.For example:
Since you tagged Python 3.6, use the new f-strings:There is no need to compute the percent string manually.  Just compute the float value  and use the proper formatting in the f-string. means: insert "percent" variable here in a field of width 5, with one place after the decimal.   is a format specifier that multiplies the number by 100 and adds a percent sign.   is inserted with no special formatting, and  makes a 2-wide field that is right-justified for numbers by default.Output of input "abbbbbbbbbbccc":See also:Format Specification Mini-LanguagePEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation
