I'm trying to pass a an unknown number of params to SQL Server in python 3.6.  Here is my code using pypyodbc:This works.  However, I'm never sure how many DUP_IDs I'm going to have.  I've seen some examples of using a list, but then if I have another variable such as is this case, , then I can't just use the list.So if somebody could provide a simple example of having a list (of varying length), and another variable and how to get SQL to run that I would greatly appreciate it!  I'm not bound to using pypyodbc if that is the issue and there is another way to do this.UPDATE:Thank you for the nicely formatted answer.  Just one quick follow-up question.  I'm still a little unclear how I would format 2 lists if I had to produce something like:Without the nice format join, I have some mess like this:How would I format the list twice as suggested?  Keeping in mind I won't know how long each list (the ID and MID_NM) are actually going to be.
Consider formatting the string to dynamically build  placeholders by length of lists, theargs and otherargs. Do note the last name should be at end of param list to correspond to last  placedholder. Once done building the prepared statement, pass to  with param values:
