I have this data structure in Python:How can I add the elements of each dictionary? The output should be :I am looking for a Pythonic solution for this. Any solutions using Counter are welcome but I am not able to implement it.I have tried this but I get an error:
Your code was quite close to a workable solution, and we can make it work with a few important changes. The most important change is that we need to iterate over the  item in .outputWe can simplify that a little because we don't need the keys.The code you posted makes a list of Counters and then tries to sum them. I guess that's also a valid strategy, but unfortunately the  built-in doesn't know how to add Counters together. But we can do it using .However, I suspect that the first version will be faster, especially if there are lots of dicts to add together. Also, this version consumes more RAM, since it keeps a list of all the Counters.  Actually we can use  to add the Counters together, we just have to give it an empty Counter as the start value.We can combine this into a one-liner, eliminating the list by using a generator expression instead:output
This is not the best solution as I am sure that there are libraries that can get you there in a less verbose way but it is one you can easily read.
