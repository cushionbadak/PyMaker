This question already has an answer here:How do I copy a string to the clipboard on Windows using Python?                    16 answers                I just need a python script that copies text to the clipboard.After the script gets executed i need the output of the text to be pasted to another source.Is it possible to write a python script that does this job?
See Pyperclip.  Example (taken from Pyperclip site):Also, see Xerox.  But it appears to have more dependencies.
On mac i use this function.It will copy "hello world" to the clipboard. 
Use Tkinter: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4203897/2804197(Original author: https://stackoverflow.com/users/449571/atomizer)
Pyperclip seems to be up to the task.
To use native Python directories, use:Then use:to call the function.
This is the only way that worked for me using  plus it's the easiest to implement w/ using the standard  suiteShout out to https://stackoverflow.com/users/4502363/gadi-oron for the answer (I copied it completely) from How do I copy a string to the clipboard on Windows using Python?I wrote a little wrapper for it that I put in my  profile <3 
GTK3:
I try this clipboard 0.0.4 and it works well.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clipboard/0.0.4
One more answer to improve on:https://stackoverflow.com/a/4203897/2804197and https://stackoverflow.com/a/25476462/1338797 (Tkinter).Tkinter is nice, because it's either included with Python (Windows) or easy to install (Linux), and thus requires little dependencies for the end user.Here I have a "full-blown" example, which copies the arguments or the standard input, to clipboard, and - when not on Windows - waits for the user to close the application:This showcases:importing Tk across Py2 and Py3 and  compatibility"unhiding" Tk root window when neededwaiting for exit on Linux in two different ways.
PyQt5:
This is an altered version of @Martin Thoma's answer for GTK3. I found that the original solution resulted in the process never ending and my terminal hung when I called the script. Changing the script to the following resolved the issue for me.You will probably want to change what clipboardText gets assigned to, in this script it is assigned to the parameter that the script is called with.On a fresh ubuntu 16.04 installation, I found that I had to install the  package for it to work without a module import error.
