I want to know that  should be in the 6th position in ordered list .What's the most pythonic way to do so?
Use bisect. It's not the most beautiful API, but it's exactly what you need.You'll want to use , which returns exactly what you want.
 is a module in the Python Standard Library that is perfect for this task. The function  in the module  will give you the index of the insertion point for the value.Let me give a code example for The result will be  because the list is 0-based, so in fact it is the 6th position.What you can do know is to use the result for an .or without the intermediate variableNow  will be . 
There is further concern with edge cases. For example, suppose you want to select the elements in the aforementioned  in the range of  and you pick them out using then you need to think about the case where  are actually elements of . Note thatwould both give index 2. Thus if  we need to lower the index by 1. Fortunately, there is a function  which does exactly this, i.e., in our examplegives 1. Overall, the left index should be computed using  and the right index  (which is the same as ).
