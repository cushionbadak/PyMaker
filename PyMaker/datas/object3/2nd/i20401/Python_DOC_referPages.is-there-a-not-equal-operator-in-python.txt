How would you say does not equal?Like Is there something equivalent to  that means "not equal"?
Use . See comparison operators. For comparing object identities, you can use the keyword  and its negation .e.g.
Not equal    (vs equal )Are you asking about something like this?This Python - Basic Operators chart might be helpful.
There's the  (not equal) operator that returns  when two values differ, though be careful with the types because . This will always return True and  will always return False, since the types differ. Python is dynamically, but strongly typed, and other statically typed languages would complain about comparing different types.There's also the  clause:The  operator is the object identity operator used to check if two objects in fact are the same:
Seeing as everyone else has already listed most of the other ways to say not equal I will just add:in this case it is simple switching the check of positive == (true) to negative and vise versa...
You can use both  or .However, note that  is preferred where  is deprecated.
There are two operators in Python for the "not equal" condition -a.) != If values of the two operands are not equal, then the condition becomes true.    (a != b) is true.b.) <> If values of the two operands are not equal, then the condition becomes true.    (a <> b) is true. This is similar to the != operator.
Use  or . Both stands for not equal.The comparison operators  and  are alternate spellings of the same operator.  is the preferred spelling;  is obsolescent. [Reference: Python language reference]
