I have a function which yields results as it downloads them. For the purposes of this question, lets say I yield a sting once every second but I want a convenience function to wrap my generator:...why doesn't that just print the 5 strings I'm expecting? Instead it appears to return the generator functio:How can I get this to yield the strings as a normal generator function would?
Can't believe I missed this; The answer is to simply return the generator function with suitable arguments applied:
You may have to use the new , available since Python 3.3, known as “delegated generator”.If I understood the question correctly, I came to the same issue, and found an answer elsewhere.I wanted to do something like this:I now use this instead:I got the answer from this page: Python 3: Using "yield from" in Generators - Part 1 (simeonvisser.com).
Came here looking for a different form of "nested yield" and finally found the hidden answer. Might not be the best but it works. I was wanting to yield through a registry tree and here is the solution.
Here's another small example for generating the multiplication table from 1 to 10:
I came looking for another use of nested yields..output:
