How can I generate the sequence of numbers "1,2,5,6,9,10......" and so until 100 in Python?I even need the comma (',') included, but this is not the main problem.The sequence: every number from 1..100, divisible by 4 with remainder 1 or 2.
Every number from 1,2,5,6,9,10... is divisible by 4 with remainder 1 or 2.
That was a quick and quite dirty solution.Now, for a solution that is suitable for different kinds of progression problems:And here are similar ideas implemented using itertools:
Includes some guessing on the exact sequence you are expecting:As one-liner:(btw. this is Python 3 compatible)
using numpy and list comprehension you can do the
This works by exploiting the % properties of the list rather than the increments.
Assuming I've guessed the pattern correctly (alternating increments of 1 and 3), this should produce the desired result:
Assuming your sequence alternates increments between 1 and 3This could be easier to modify if your sequence is different but I think poke or BlaXpirit are nicer answers than mine.
Write a function that takes a number as an argument and prints the Fibonacci series till that number
In python 3.1 you can produce a list in a wayIn python 2.7 you can do it as
