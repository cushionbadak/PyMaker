I need to get the query string from this URL https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?next=1&value=3 and I don't want to use request.META. I have figured out that there are two more ways to get the query string:Using urlparseurlparse.urlparse(url).queryUsing url encodeUse urlencode and pass the request.GET params dictionary into it to get the string representation.So which way is better? My colleagues prefer urlencode but have not provided a satisfying explanation. They claim that urlparse calls urlencode internally which is something I'm not sure about since urlencode lives in the urllib module.
You can make Query string using GET parameters like thisThis does not include the  prefix, and it may not return the keys in the same order as in the original request.
Third option:In Python 3+ this is available as:Documentation for urllib.parse
I prefer usingFrom docs:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.METAThis does not include the  prefix.
you can also use request.arg also
