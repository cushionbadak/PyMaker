What Am I missing? I'm having a dict of dicts (which was created on the fly) like this:Now I want to add some data:I'd expect my output to be:But what I get is this:So why is the list  append to all dicts instead of only the one with the current ? 
EDIT:As i guessed. Each element of your goog_dict is the same element. Read a little about relations, as it might be really helpful.Change your code into:And now it should be ok.Also take a look at this example. That's exactly, what happened in your case.This one is quite a common mistake.
Try this:The value of  in the dict pointed to the same list everywhere, hence the effect you saw. Try to paste your dict-building code into this python code visualizer to see what happens.
