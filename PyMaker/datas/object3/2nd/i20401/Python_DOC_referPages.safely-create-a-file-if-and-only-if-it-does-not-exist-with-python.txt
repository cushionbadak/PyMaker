I wish to write to a file based on whether that file already exists or not, only writing if it doesn't already exist (in practice, I wish to keep trying files until I find one that doesn't exist).The following code shows a way in which a potentially attacker could insert a symlink, as suggested in this post in between a test for the file and the file being written. If the code is run with high enough permissions, this could overwrite an arbitrary file.Is there any way to solve this problem?
Edit: See also Dave Jones' answer: from Python 3.3, you can use the  flag to  to provide this function.Original answer belowYes, but not using Python's standard  call. You'll need to use  instead, which allows you to specify flags to the underlying C code.In particular, you want to use . From the man page for  under  on my Unix system:Ensure  that  this  call  creates the file: if this flag is specified in conjunction with , and pathname already exists, then  will fail.  The behavior of  is undefined if  is not specified.When these two flags are specified, symbolic links are not followed: if pathname is a symbolic link, then  fails  regardless of where the symbolic link points to.  is only supported on NFS when using NFSv3 or later on kernel 2.6 or later.  In environments where NFS  support is not provided, programs that rely on it for performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.So it's not perfect, but AFAIK it's the closest you can get to avoiding this race condition.Edit: the other rules of using  instead of  still apply. In particular, if you want use the returned file descriptor for reading or writing, you'll need one of the ,  or  flags as well.All the  flags are in Python's  module, so you'll need to  and use  etc.Example:
For reference, Python 3.3 implements a new  mode in the  function to cover this use-case (create only, fail if file exists). Note that the  mode is specified on its own. Using  results in a  as the  is redundant (the only thing you can do if the call succeeds is write to the file anyway; it can't have existed if the call succeeds):For Python 3.2 and below (including Python 2.x) please refer to the accepted answer.
This code will easily create a FILE if one does not exists.
