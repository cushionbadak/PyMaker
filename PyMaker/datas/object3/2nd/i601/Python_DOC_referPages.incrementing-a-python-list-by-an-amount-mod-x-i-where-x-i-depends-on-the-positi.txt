I have two lists of equal length.I am incrementing list1 by an amount, but each entry has to be modded by the corresponding entry in list2.What I am doing is:Is there a better way (maybe using numpy)? I could not find any. These lists are very long, so performance is an issue.
You can use  and  to reduce the amount of indexing involved:That said, you're probably better off just using a list comprehension to avoid the need for the index entirely, so you can drop  and use only , which makes for cleaner looking code (and faster code to boot):Note that in both examples I renamed your  to , because name shadowing the  constructor is a terrible idea.
It is possible using numpyAll three give the same results. Documentation for first and second is here. The third method was suggested by Shadow Ranger in the comments.
