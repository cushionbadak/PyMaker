Do you enjoy abusing  for not their intended purpose? I would honestly use the other answers here but this is also another way to do this.Using  will return a  which clearly is not the intended purpose here hence why I recommend other answers listed.
In my opinion, Daniel Mesejo's answer nailed it.  That answer is based on , but functionally speaking,  is a form of .   So, for variety, I'll offer here a solution with  (which also uses ):Even though this isn't a dictionary comprehension solution, I hope it will provide more context for someone wanting to understand the computation required to answer the question.
