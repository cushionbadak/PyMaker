I have a class based decorator. The problem is that I need to be able to have access to wraped function args and kwargs but now I can't and I don't understand why. It should be easy but it's not for me.Let's have a look at pdb. That's ****CENSORED**** crazy.The question is how can I get access to args, kwargs and treat args as list and kwargs as dict.P.S. I don't know why it args and kwargs looks like that. Why they do look like that?As mentioned at the answer  is command of pdb. User  to see args.Next question is possible signatures of function: 1) def fn(request, ...) 2) def fn(self, a, b, c, etc, user) 3) def fn(user) Are there a way to deal with all of them with one decorator? 
Your  output is not really relevant,  here acts like interactive pdb command.For the sake of simplicity, either use  or temporary rename  argument
I ended up with this solution:
