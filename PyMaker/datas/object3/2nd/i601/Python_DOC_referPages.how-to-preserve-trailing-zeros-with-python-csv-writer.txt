I am trying to convert a json file with individual json lines to csv. The json data has some elements with trailng zeros that I need to maintain (ex. 1.000000). When writing to csv the value is changed to 1.0, removing all trailing zeros except the first zero following the decimal point. How can I keep all trailing zeros? The number of trailing zeros may not always static.Updated the formatting of the sample data.Here is a sample of the json input:Here is a sample of the output:Here is the code:The desired output would look like:
I've been trying and I think this may solve your problem:Pass the str function to the parse_float argument in json.loads :)This way when json.loads() tries to parse a float it will use the str method so it will be parsed as string and maintain the zeroes. Tried doing that and it worked:More information here: Json DocumentationPS: You could use a boolean instead of i += 1 to get the same behaviour.
The decoder of the  module parses real numbers with  by default, so trailing zeroes are not preserved as they are not in Python. You can use the  parameter of the  method to override the constructor of a real number for the JSON decoder with the  constructor instead:
Use format but here need to give static decimal precision.
