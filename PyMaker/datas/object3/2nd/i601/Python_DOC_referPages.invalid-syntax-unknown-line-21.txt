I get this error message when I try to debug I don't know whats wrongthis is auto Reddit posterline 21  is     except Exception, e:this line of code seems fine I don't know why I'm getting an error.
I'm assuming you're running Python 3. If so, these lines have two problems: syntax is Python 2 only; the Python 3 equivalent is Your  isn't indented, the contents of the  block must be indented.The fixed code would be:or just:which doesn't bother to capture the exception as  since you never use it.Similarly, further on down, you'd need to change:to:to run on Python 3. You might just want to use the  tool to perform these changes (and any other 2/3 related changes I missed) automatically, or just install Python 2.7 to run this script unmodified (though Python 2 goes out of support completely at the beginning of next year, so that's not a long term solution).
Your line 21 is for which there are two problems: is in wrong syntax.  I am clueless on what you are trying to do.  Please refer to https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html for correct syntax.  I suspect you were trying to write  ?the block after the  is not correct indented.
