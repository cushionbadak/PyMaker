I am doing A* search and need to store information in priority queue. But I want the priority queue to compare only one field of my data. So I designed a class for priori queue. However, my program keeps running forever. I wrote some simple test code to reproduce this error:After initialization, my priority queue  is still empty. Manually  add the element  even gives me an error TypeError("'>' not supported between instances of 'PrioritizedItem' and 'int'",). Looks like my type class  is missing some piece. How to add that part?
You're passing  in , but the only argument to  is , which should be an integer. The default is , which means the queue grows with no size limit.
