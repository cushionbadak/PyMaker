Natural Text
I use python 3, and I read files that strart with few lines that contain text and number together, and from a certain line it's only columns of numbers, that originally they are also read as str after splitting, that I later convert them to float.the data look like this . I also add the link to the sample of the numbers https://gist.github.com/Farzadtb/b0457223a26704093524e55d9b46b1a8So the problem is that for reading I have two conditions ( actually I wish to increase these conditions ) using try: except . but this only works for dividing the splitting method. but before I start splitting ,I need to remove the first lines that contain text. what I know is that I should use except ValueErrorbut this does not really work ! the problem is that since the first lines could also start with numbers, it's possible that the first parameter is split and added to "x" and "y" but I get error for zOne idea that comes to my mind is to check if the line could be converted to float with no errors , and then proceed with splitting ,but I don't know how to do it
You should try this. This code use regexp to find the data as a clean way.Tested on your sample data.This is the stdout of the python script:
