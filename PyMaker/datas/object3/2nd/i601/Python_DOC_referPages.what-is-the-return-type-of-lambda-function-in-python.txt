When you create a lambda in Python, what type is returned? E.g.  returns
Lambda is almost as same as defining a regular function.In your case, it is equivalent to:Because of that, and because the dynamic typing nature of Python, the type of the return value depends on what the function does.Calling the function with different values can return different values:When asking about the type of the lambda function itself, the type is just :

It returns the same type that you might expect. If you set:then  will return   will return .  will simply return .
Lambdas are just simple syntactic sugar on top of functions. From the documentation (emphasis mine):Small anonymous functions can be created with the lambda keyword. This function returns the sum of its two arguments: lambda a, b: a+b. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a normal function definition. Like nested function definitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing scope:
