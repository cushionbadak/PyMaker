I have a problem with this the recipes is formatted like this (just ignore the Norwegian gibberish).When I just print it, it comes out with the whitespace preserved, but from  I get this:Im trying to learn by myself and is just getting started, so sorry if this is a dumb question. Thanks.
You're using  which always returns a list of length  or in your case 1. So the object you're printing is a list of a string.You could change the lineto something likeThat will return the first element in the list (which happens to be the only one).A cleaner solution might be instead to use . It always returns a single choice, not a list. It is effectively equivalent as the line above, but it's a little clearer.
 returns a list, which is exactly what you're getting. This output is just how lists are formatted. If you want to extract the string from this list, do it:
The output of  is a list of a certain length, 1 in this instance. When you print this you are seeing the output that is generated when displaying a list, including newline  characters.would print out the string, the first element of the list, which would reinstate the original display across several lines.
