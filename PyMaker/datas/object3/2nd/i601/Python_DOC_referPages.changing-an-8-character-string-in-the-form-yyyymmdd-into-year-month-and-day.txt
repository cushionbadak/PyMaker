I am trying to write a function that converts an 8 character string of the form "yyyymmdd" into integer values of year, month, and day based on the string. The function parses a given string and returns integer year, month and day. I wrote the code for it, but I am having difficulties with returning the correct integer values in the right format. For example: y, m, d = parseDate("19700218") should return the integer values 1970 for y, 2 for m, and 18 for d.My code is not correct, but I think that the start of it is correct:y,m,d = parseDate("19700218")I hope that this is just an easy fix.
I suggest using  and get values from parsed date/datetime object.This is out of the box, flexible and extendable solution.
CodeOutputHope it helps.
Try something like this:Test Code OutputSince we are converting to int, leading 0s will be dropped. Let me know if u want to include a format that includes leadings 0s
