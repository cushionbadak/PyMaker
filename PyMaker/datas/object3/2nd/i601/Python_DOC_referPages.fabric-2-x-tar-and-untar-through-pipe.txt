Natural Text
I want to do the equivalent of this shell script:But using Fabric 2.x.  This is my attempt, but I'm not sure what the problem is.This gives me the error:Along with some other errors.  I understand that it's probably because the stream that I get from  is a bytes stream, not a unicode stream.  But I don't understand why run would need a unicode stream, or what the correct change would be to make it work.
I can't comment on why the task executed via  is assumed to produce a text stream, however, thanks to the existence of the  encoding, an actual binary stream packaged into a text stream object can be reinterpreted as a binary stream without any distortion:
