I am trying to program a module for a class but my main() function does not work I presume the code is right but when I input a number it just goes to the next line, does not stop execution and just allows me to input further numbers, going to the next line afterward - ad infinitum. I tread into the main function of python but I am still confused. I expect the code to return the the last digit of the n-th Fibonacci number entered. 
Instead of , use the built-in  function:
The program is waiting for your input, since you're using . This waits until the input is terminated by (for instance) pressing ctrl-D.Normally you'd use  for this, which reads one line from stdin.
