This question already has an answer here:How can I return two values from a function in Python?                    7 answers                I have something that I dont understand here. I mean, it works, but I would like to understand what is going on behind the scenes:so, what I am trying to understand is here, in line 3, there are 3 variables(training_data, validation_data and test_data). These are being assigned to one function though!? My question is, what happens to them and/or the function? Is the function executed three times? Or are the variables simply a function then that can be called? Or is the loaded data being split in 3 parts, a third of them being distributed to every variable? I am a noob, so this is probably stupid, but please help me!
This is called sequence unpacking. You can find it in Python documentation., where it says:The statement  is an example of tuple  packing: the values ,  and  are packed together in a  tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side.This feature of the language makes it easy to write functions which seem to return multiple results (although they actually just return a tuple), e.g.
 is executed once. The construct you see is called unpacking and is more or less equivalent to(actually unpacking does one more thing: it assures that  has exactly 3 elements) Does this help?
no the function is not performed three times,but returns values at the same time.this question can help you.
