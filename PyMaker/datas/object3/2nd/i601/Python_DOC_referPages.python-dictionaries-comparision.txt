I have a problem in python with dictionary comparison. I have 2 dictionaries and I want to compare these and when the key is the same, the value is upgraded to . Function 'addToInventory()' should have 45 coins instead of 3, but where is the problem? In the loop, it prints 45, but when I print all the dictionaries it shows 3.Here's the problem with function:The code is also available on Pastebin.
In your  loop, take a close look at the  stuite, where you use :You loop over the keys for , and for each key you loop over . And each time  is not true, you set . It doesn't matter that you set  to 45 at some point, you simply replaced that result.However, you don't need to use a double loop. Dictionaries are great at testing if a given key is already there, just use ; that's true if you can get a value for that key from that dictionary. That means you don't need to loop over both dictionaries, just use the key from one to see if there is a number for the item in the other:There is no need to copy  anymore, because you are not looping over it now.Instead of testing for , you could use  to use a default  value instead: is similar to using , but without setting the key in the dictionary to the default value.You don't really need to create  either. Just add the counts directly to your  dictionary. I'm using the same  trick here to start with  if an added item wasn't yet there in the inventory:
