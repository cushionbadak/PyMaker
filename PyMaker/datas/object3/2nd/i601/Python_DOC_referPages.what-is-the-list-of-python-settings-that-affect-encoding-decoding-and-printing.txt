When I run into unicode printing problems, I want to know what I should check.  In my particular case, I'm using an installed module that is printing unicode encoded characters using the wrong codec.There are several disparate places that affect python encoding and decoding under a variety of circumstances.  And specifically how python handles printable data in different circumstances.Some things off the top of mind:general environment variables , Python  module setting What else am I forgetting?I'm only interested in python 3.
things to checkHere is what I found, in order of how I recommend checking them:environment variables , , , Python-specific environment  variables , (the affect of which may be affected by program argument ; can check )Windows-specific console encoding Python  modulefunction  (the corollary function  was removed from Python 3)file system encoding setting Python file header  modulefunction call  (does not appear to work on Windows Python 3.7, worked on Debian Python 3.5)function function  (works differently on some systems) module and it's various facilities (I won't list them all)contents of the directories passed to some functions like  or print the valuesHere is quick script to list the values of most of these:printed values on three systemsWindows 10 with 3.7Debian 9 with 3.5Ubuntu 14 with 3.4On Windows 10 using Python 3.7, this printsOn Debian 9 using Python 3.5, this printsOn Ubuntu 14.04 using Python 3.4, this printsUnfortunately, when I run into unicode print problems with installed modules, it is not immediately obvious which setting is affecting that module. Doubly so, understanding how these different possible parameters and settings interact is all the more confounding. There are many combinations of settings to test.But this little bit might help someone get started.Also see helpful answers at SO Question How to set sys.stdout encoding in Python 3?.Related PEPs to reviewPEP 540 -- Add a new UTF-8 Mode ()PEP 529 -- Change Windows filesystem encoding to UTF-8 (environment variable )Some help from this pymotw article, python how-to unicode, python sys module, python locale module.
