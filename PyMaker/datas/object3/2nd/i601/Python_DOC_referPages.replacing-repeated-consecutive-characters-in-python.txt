Natural Text
I need to make a function that replaces repeated, consecutive characters with a single character, for example:
You can try a regular expression like , i.e. "something, then more of the same something", and replace it with , i.e. "that first something".Make it a function with  (or any other way you like)
A solution can be expressed very compactly using : groups the objects in an iterable by the given key function. Groups are accumulated as long as the keys are equivalent. If no key function is given, the identity of the items are used, in this case the characters.Once you have them grouped by their identity, you can then join the objects into a single string. The grouped objects are returned as tuples containing the object and an internal  object, which for your purposes, you can ignore and extract the character.This can be turned into a function as follows:This results in the expected values:
hi how are you
