This question already has an answer here:Find parent element of a 'title' xml tag containing specific text using Python ElementTree                    1 answer                Need to parse the large XML file with python (xml.etree.ElementTree) to process and generate a report as shown in expected section.I can't figure out how to get down until 4th level for certain details and from there into 5th level for it's respective/associated data. Where to loop and how to reference the children, is my problem. Please give any suggestions that you may have, thank you. 
You're already iterating root's child nodes, having the name ".//FourthLevel". You just have to apply the same principle for each child and its children having the name "FifthLevel" (notice the slashes missing).Translated to code, you just need to replace the line:by:as you need the 5th level child only for current node (4th level), not for the whole tree. Check [Python 3]: xml.etree.ElementTree - The ElementTree XML API for more details.
