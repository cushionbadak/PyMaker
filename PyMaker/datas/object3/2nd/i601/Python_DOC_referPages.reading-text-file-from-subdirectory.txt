Natural Text
In my Python code, I have a text file in a sub-directory of my original python program that I would like to read. I am aware of the os.chdir() function, and it does work to do change the directory to where the file is before I read the file. However, I want this code to work on any machine no matter the directory, so is there a simple way to notate a changepath to a sub-directory so that it would work on any computer?Thank you
Unfortunately what (I think) you are trying to do is not practical. One can scan through subdirectories with a method such as: I implore you to look through https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html for more information on this to see if you can solve your problem.However, I am assuming that your code is intending to perform some operation on a textfile, and you want to be able to use any computer to feed this (or any) file to your program to run. The best way to go about solving this problem is to use argparser. That way you can feed your program a file when running it on the command line and it will execute so long as it exists in the user's directory. It will look something like this:Here is more information on argparse: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.htmlHappy coding.
