I want to write the following code in the trinket interactive shell. I don't know how two write the second statement without having the first one evaluated when I press enter on my keyboard.
You can create a suite of statements on one line by separating them with a semicolon. The REPL will evaluate the entire suite before printing the output:Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html
This is not related to Python, it is all about how the  operates with the server.After pressing "run code interactively", we can see the following requests:First 3 of them are just preparing the environment. The fourth one contains the following body (started at 713.77 ms):And the fifth one is a websocket connection with the following frames (started at 858.40 ms):As you can see, the code is sent in different requests (and even different protocols) and there is a chance (or maybe design choice) that the second code line is sent before the response for the first line has been received.So, this particular case is not related to Python, it is all about how trinket communicates with the server.
