I have wrote a custom hook which works when input string is valid dict in python, but it doesn't works when it is valid list. is a valid json but if I pass this to  with my custom hook, the hook is not being called.
You can't manage   deserialization using , only  s (like  in your example), as it said in docs is an optional function that will be called with the result of any object literal decoded (a ). The return value of  will be used instead of the . This feature can be used to implement custom decoders (e.g. JSON-RPC class hinting).If you really need to handle s, you can write your post-processing function and walk through every node and modify  objects.BTW  is a name of built-in, so I suggest you to rename it to //something else.
