I am trying to send a query to an API every full minute because the API updates its data every minute and I want the updated data ASAP. It is important that the timing is very precise, I want to run everything continuously in the end.this is vaguely what I am trying to do:Can somebody help me with this?Or is there a even smarter way of getting data from a REST Api exactly every full minute?
You could use asyncio.sleepFor Python < 3.7For Python 3.7+editAs per your comment, if you're really worried about making sure this gets called every 60 seconds.You could implement a way to take the time before  is called and subtract that from 60, just need to make sure if  does take over 60 secs to wait 0 secs or not at all.Something like this for your  should work:
Thanks to everyone for helping out.This Answer worked for me pretty well in the end:I let it run over night, there was no shift overtime. The time between the executions is exactly 60, no matter how long the code in the loop takes to execute.
