I want to resize multiple images using 'convert'.This works great from the command line.However, when I try to achieve the same from within Python3 using subprocess.Popen, the flag '\!' specifying that the aspect ratio of the image should be ignored during the resizing, does not work.Starting fromI wantand notFrom the command line this works fine usingIf I run this command from within Python3 usingthe result is not resized:I tried to escape the backslash character using  or  without success.
 needs to be escaped because you're running in a shell. But the command itself doesn't understand , and  doesn't use the shell (unless you use , but avoid like the plague)So you're just overdoing this.Instead, pass arguments without quoting or escaping:now you have a portable command line that will even work on Windows (well, on windows there's a  command which doesn't do the same thing at all so you'll have to specify full path of the  command)
In addition to accepted answer:The problem essentially is:Translate a shell command into a non-shell command.There is a library solving this task.gives
