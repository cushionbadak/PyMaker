I'm writing a program to print the reverse of an integer using Python. I would expect the output of  to be  (i.e.,  reversed), but instead, I get .Here's my code:What am I doing wrong, and how can I fix it?
As said above, you need integer to integer division.Replaceby divides to  and not .
If I may, your problem can be solved without any math at all
Another possible way is to make the number into an array.The output would be as following:Note - The variables that I used can be changed to whatever you like, except .
The problem is that division with , implicitly convert  to . The assumption is that  is an integer.Change,to (prevent implicit convertion to ),n.b. The original problem is that you do have  conversion and then your exit condition  is not satisfied as you expect due to floating point inaccuracy.
