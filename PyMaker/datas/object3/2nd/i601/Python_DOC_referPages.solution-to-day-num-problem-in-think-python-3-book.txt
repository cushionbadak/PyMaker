There is exercise in section 4.17 of the book "How to Think Like a ComputerScientist: Learning with Python 3" 3rd edition"Write a function day_name that converts an integer number 0 to 6 into the name of a day. Assume day 0 is “Sunday”. Once again, return None if the arguments to the function are not valid."I have written the following code which solves the problem for most part, except i am unable to understand how to return "None" for invalid argument. Please assist...if i , it returns python error instead of "None"
Add validation to your function. You can do this explicitly:That is called look before you leap: you check that  exists before you try to select it.Or you can let the selection fail and trap the error:
You are using the list data structure. It works based on the indexes.When we access  then we are trying to access index  which is not available. so, it's throwing the error.Better Approach isDictionary works faster because it uses hashing technique.Speed testing list index vs dict keyOutputFor more derails checkout https://learnbatta.com/course/python/python-working-with-lists/
You can use a for loop but this is the better way to go. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions.As @Derte said,it is also a good practise to catch only the specific exception instead of blanket except statement like:Here's a time testing using timeit library:This means the speed is comparable. So of-course you should use a more pythonic way.
The function/method 'day_name' holds a dict that points from day index to day name.A python dict comes with a function named 'get' which you can read about here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/dictionary_get.htm . It is the 'get' function that takes care of the cases where there is no match between the day_index and the day name.
