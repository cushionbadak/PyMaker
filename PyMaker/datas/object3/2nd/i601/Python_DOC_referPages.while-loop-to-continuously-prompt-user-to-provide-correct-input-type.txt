I have a homework problem and I need to add a while loop to my function that will give the user 3 additional tries to enter another value if the value originally entered is not a number. The original function of the code is to determine the area of a triangle or trapezoid. Though I'm not even sure where to fit the above lines in my code.
You can use a try/except on the input to handle the  when  fails to convert the value to a float or an  "if the argument is outside the range of a Python float".You can check for all the inputs at once inside the  block (if you don't care which one specifically is invalid or you don't need to point it out to the user):To avoid lots of repeated 's, I suggest creating a method for getting a float input (or all of the inputs), and then just calling it from your main method.
