I'm using python and OpenCV to get video from a rtsp stream. I'm getting single frames from the stream and saving them to the file system. I wrote a  which handles frame getting and saving. Additionally there is a  that has all the streaming objects. I thought that as the  would always be running, there should only be one per core, in order to take as much as possible. Then the  would provide the  objects to the available . The problem is that most of the time that the script is running, is blocking: When I thought of this, I didn't take into account that most of the operations will be blocking operations like:The problem with spending too much time blocking is that most of the processing power is wasted. I thought of using futures with a  but I can't seem to reach my goal of using the maximum amount of processing cores possible. Maybe I'm not setting enaugh threads. Is there a standard way of handling blocking operations, in order to make the best use of the cores' processing power? I'm fine having a language-agnostic answer.
I ended up using the  using the  function. I didn't actually want to do anything after the future finished, but if I used  then the  would stop, which whould also defeat all the purpose of using the thread pool.Side note: I had to add a  when calling  because apparently opencv can't handle calls from multiple threads.
