I have a list that looks like  and I want to count how many times million, billion show up.I am using the script below that works but I wonder if it is the most pythonic way.  
 is your best bet for things like this. You'll need to preprocess the list to extract the million/billion.(Note, this is more elegant than your solution, but not more efficient, since it requires two passes over the data.)
You can also join list to string and use :
Whilst all of the other answers are definitely very pythonic and elegant, it's not always the most important thing to strive for. Your original code is actually the only one so far to go over the list once. I'd maybe simplify it just a tad:Otherwise your code is easy to read and performant (counts with a single pass).
You could pick the elements of the list  which contain specificic words (such as  or ) as follows;Now you have 2 lists(million,billion) which contains the targeted elements of the  list. If you want to learn how many elements in the lists, you can use the  function as follows;
