I though that an outermost  /  would always catch an exception (the fact that this is probably not a good idea is outside of the question):In some code I am going though, I faced the case whereraised an exception:Why is it so? Why hasn't the overencompassing / caught the exception?
In the provided second code example, the  message was not in fact an unhandled exception, due to the exception handler calling  method which will print out the specified message along with the complete  message into the logging stream.  If the  is not desired, using  will produce the log message at the same  level without it.
