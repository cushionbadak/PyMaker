I have a list in python for example:my goal is to find where there are five or more zeros in a row and then list the indexes of where this happens, for example the output for this would be:here is what i have tried/seen in other questions asked on here:this gives output:which is basically just listing indexes of all duplicates, how would i go about separating this data into what i need
You could use itertools.groupby, it will identify the contiguous groups in the list:Output
Your current attempt is very close.  It returns all of the runs of consecutive zeros in an array, so all you need to accomplish is adding a check to filter runs of less than 5 consecutive zeros out.
Use the  operator on the array.  Compare the shifted version with the original.  Where they do not match, you have a transition.  You then need only to identify adjacent transitions that are at least 5 positions apart.Can you take it from there?
Another way using  and .First find the zeros and the indices:Now just filter :
