Natural Text
I have a text file with a series of clients.Each line has a different client.Each client has an ID, a username, and a password.I want to create a "Client" class, and generate objects in that class in a loop.Each object would have a username and a password, and would be stored in a variable that contains the client's ID.Client 1 would be stored in "client_1", Client 2 would be stored in "client_2", etc.I created the method "read()" that opens the text file, breaks if there are empty lines, and retrieves the ID, username and password for each client (each line).What I can't figure out, is how to make it so that when the client's ID is "1", I create an object for that client and store it in the variable "client_1".When the client's ID is "2", I store client's 2 object in the variable "client_2", and so on.But I want to do this automatically, instead of having 9000 clients and having to create 9000 variables myself.ThanksMy text file (ID, username, password - from left to right):Also, is there a problem if I'm using the "username" and "password" variables in read(), when I have already used them in the def init?Thanks
AdvicesIn your loop, you are using . Don't do that, what you want to use is  that will skip this iteration instead of get you out of it.You are only using  on your password. You should do it on all items (to make sure they are all uniform). But you were right to use  only on the password case because it's the only one that has . Don't put argument into  and it will take care of all the spaces, tabs, and other ,  and such.You should see the  parameter of a class as a  that lives inside it. It's the "environement" you can basically access everywhere inside your class. And if you create something inside , such as , it will not be the same as a single variable named . What you probably wanted to do here is assign your client list you just read to the , such as .About your programWhat you need to do is not create as many variables as there are users. But you are right in the philosophy, you want to have them stored in one place. And that's what you did. Now, the point of your program is still obscure to us. But what you probably want to do is :Have a database in which you know how items are ordered. You know that in each element of your users_list, you have the first item that is an , the second its  and the third its .Make operations based on this database. You want to "load" a client, check if he exists in your database, and match the password he entered with the one you have linked to it !You want to delete one ?Order an ice cream for someone already logged ?
Don't create variables dynamically! Instead use Python's built-in dictionary object, which allows you to look values up by key.It was somewhat confusing to have the  function as a method of the class, since calling it then required you to create a  instance in order to call it. An alternative was to recast it as a , but that over-complicates things, so it made more sense as a simple function. Instead of returning a list it returns a dictionary of s, each keyed on its respective .I've simplified the processing somewhat (though there is still no error handling), and made the loop more robust to blank lines.I also added a little bit of test code to allow you to verify that the clients have been correctly created from your test data, and to make your class and function able should you choose. Replace  with  to use a real data file instead. 
What is wrong with the list of clients that you already have? You can access the clients as ,  and so forth. The list is the abstraction for arbitrary many variables. The lists are 0-indexed, so the first element has index . This can be confusing, especially since some languages like R, FORTRAN or Wolfram Language are 1-indexed. I do not consider that a fundamental problem, you just have to be clear about it. If it really bothers you, you could use a  with numeric indices and just map whatever index you want to a customer.Also I would make  a free function. It does not use anything except the public API of the  class to function. Therefore it should not be a member function. But if you want to have it in that class, make it a  at least because it is not tied to one particular .What I mean with public API: Every class that you write has public methods and private methods. In Python there are no access specifiers, but the convention is that methods starting with an underscore () are not be used externally. The ones with two underscores (like ) are also not to be called directly but are called by syntactic sugar. You want to have focused methods (SRP), so have the least amount of public functions possible. Also consider this: Say somebody wants to use your  class to read a different file format with usernames and passwords. That person would have to modify your code in order to add another  method. But if the  function was external and just used the  of your  class, that somebody could just add a new free function somewhere. This is the OCP.And  could be just a . So like this:You do not have to define the class  yourself, and all  objects (say ) will have the attributes  and .Using  and  is not a problem because the parameter of  are in a different scope. The members of your class can only be accessed via , so that is not a problem either.If you really wanted to dynamically create variables, there are ways to do so, see here. But again you want to abstract away the actual number of clients and that is what the list is for.
