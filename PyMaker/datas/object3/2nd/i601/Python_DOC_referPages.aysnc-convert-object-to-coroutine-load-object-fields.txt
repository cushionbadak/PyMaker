I have the following functionAlong with the following testWhen my code hits I run into this errorHow do I resolve this so that I can keep accessing my pages fields and keep the async function?
 here means that call of  will returns an  coroutine. To actually execute  and get result you should await for this coroutine.Your test should be altered this way:Note however that if you await for something inside function this function () must be coroutine itself (must be defined with ) and awaited somewhere to be executed.It means you should use pytest-asyncio in addition to plain  as shown here.
