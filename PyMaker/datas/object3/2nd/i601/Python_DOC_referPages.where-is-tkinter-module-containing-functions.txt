Where is the Tkinter module (in python 2.7) containing all the functions such as Tk(), tk.Entry(), tk.Button(), etc? I want to make a list of all the functions in a cheatsheet for quick reference and a sense of overview/control that is not gained by the impenetrable jargon-filled descriptions. There appears to be no file in the source files of python27 that gives this, there is a suggestion online that it is a binary file and therefore not accessible. Is this so? Is there not a file containing the functions within the python27 source?Anyway any idea of where the functions in Tkinter are listed so I can make my own quick reference cheatsheet?
Read the official python documentationStart by reading python's official tkinter documentation at the following address:https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html. From there you will learn that tkinter doesn't implement any of the widgets itself. Rather, it is just a thin object-oriented wrapper around an embedded tcl interpreter. For better or worse, it expects you to get some of the details of the widgets by learning about tcl/tk.  What does "thin object oriented wrapper" mean?The underlying tcl/tk interpreter is not object-oriented (ie: not based on classes and instances). Python, however, is highly class-oriented. To make tkinter more pythonic, the developers decided to make the interface to tcl/tk based on classes. Without this interface, to create a frame might look like this:With the wrapper this becomes:Read the offical tcl/tk documentationThe canonical documentation for the tk library that's part of tcl can be found at the following link:http://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/contents.htmFind the package location on your diskTo see the things that are unique to tkinter such as the classes that wrap the underlying tk widgets, you can look through the files in the tkinter module. The easy way to find them is to import the module and then examine the  attribute to see where it's stored on your disk. If you're on python3 the above will probably show a link to the  file, and on python2 it will probably show a link to . In both cases you can see the containing folder, where you can look around and examine everything that makes up the package on your system.(Of course, the actual file and location depends on your version and your OS)See the official source files on githubThe files are available through github at the following link. The bulk of the definition of tkinter is in the file .https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/tkinter
