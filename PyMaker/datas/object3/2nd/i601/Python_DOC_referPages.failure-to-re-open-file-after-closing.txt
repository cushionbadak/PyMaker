I have been working with some code that is meant to print a poem. The goal of the code is to make borders that will fit the poem's size. But that does not pertain to my issue. I have been trying to get the code to reprint a file, line for line, but  is all that is returned.I've attempted to get around this by reopening the file after it's closed, and reopening it after the  function has completed. But both methods have failed. I don't know where to go from here.Note: quit() is a defined function to stop the code entirely.This is what I should be seeing after asking for the Harlem poem for the second time:Instead, I'm getting:
Your steps are:You open a file in  variableYou call  function with  argument. This  is referenced as  inside of the function.You close the file that  references to (it is  outside of the function)You create a new variable  that exists only inside of the functionAfter the function is done, you have  as a closed fileThis happens because  in the  and the one outside are different objects.Short example:You can read more about this in mgilson's answer on a question that covers similar problem and in the Python documentation.How to fix:Instead of opening the files, keep their names.Then modify the function to get the filename as the argument and to open the file inside of the function.Now it should work.Here's the full code:
