I'm trying to improve the matching expression of this code so that it matches spaces before or after the string and also ignores the case. The goal is to output the shortened state abbreviation.I've figured out the regex to do this (see here):which will match with or without spaces on either side of string and also ignores case. Can anyone help me update my original code to include the new regex?
If I were you I would just strip() the string before passing it in and use something like re.sub() where we can tell it to ignore the case using 'flags=re.IGNORECASE' like below. Additionally I have added in a check for a match before trying to substitute in the value. Otherwise you could output the wrong result. For example:(('Tasmania', 'TAS'){'state': 'new South Wales'})
