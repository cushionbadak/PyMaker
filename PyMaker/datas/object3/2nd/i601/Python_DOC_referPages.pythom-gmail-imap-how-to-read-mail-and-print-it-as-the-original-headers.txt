I have a script that reads mail from the Gmail box and then prints it. The problem is that it prints it as follows:'MIME-Version: 1.0\r\nDate: Wed, 6 Feb 2019 15:22:04  +0200\r\nMessage-ID: CAES-+zqJ-zFh40JBvB3bbkX-Md0dFQ-dc1ECQMynj-yp8C5eg@mail.gmail.com>\r\nSubject:  test\r\nFrom: Ops \r\nTo: test  \r\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;  boundary="000000000000a56dd00581399c31"\r\n\r\n--000000000000a56dd00581399c31\r\nContent-Type:  text/plain;  charset="UTF-8"\r\n\r\ngoogle.com\r\n\r\n56.36.36.36\r\n\r\n--000000000000a56dd00581399c31\r\nContent-Type:  text/html; charset="UTF-8"\r\n\r\ngoogle.com56.36.36.36\r\n\r\n--000000000000a56dd00581399c31--'I'm trying to print the mail as the original headers:MIME-Version: 1.0Date: Wed, 6 Feb 2019 15:17:44 +0200Message-ID:  Subject: testFrom: Test To: Test Content-Type: multipart/alternative;  boundary="00000000000020527b0581398d0e"--00000000000020527b0581398d0eContent-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"156.36.32.32test.com--00000000000020527b0581398d0eContent-Type: text/html; charset="UTF-8"    156.36.32.32test.com    --00000000000020527b0581398d0e--The script:
As you can easily see, the  representation has  to represent a physical carriage return + line feed.  To split it into a sequence of lines,To properly manipulate the resulting MIME message, you will probably want to parse it into an  and take it from there.But the immediate fix is to not use  if you don't like what it does.
You can use  for a better representation of an email message (headers included)
