EDIT 18/02:Since I still don't have a solution, I'm updating with what I know so far.I've installed python 3.7 successfully. I can install modules using pip (or pip3) but those modules are installed in Python 3.6 (Comes with ubuntu). Therefore I can't import those modules in python 3.7 (get a module not found)Python 3.7 doesn't recognize pip/pip3, so I can't install through pip/pip3I need python 3.7--I've installed Python 3.7 on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine.

To install all currently supported python versions (python 3.6 is already pre-installed) including pip for Ubuntu 18.04 do the following:To install python3.5 and python3.7, use the deadsnakes ppa:Install python2.7 via distribution packages:To install pip use:I used it for setting up a CI-chain for a python project with tox and Jenkins.
