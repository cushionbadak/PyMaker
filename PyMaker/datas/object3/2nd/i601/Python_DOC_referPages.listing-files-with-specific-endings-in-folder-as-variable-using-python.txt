Natural Text
I am trying to list files with specific ending ('.txt') in folder which was set as a variable, using python.I tried to use glob.glob('userFolder/*.txt') in order to do it.I got an empty list.
The text  in your  call is just part of the string value, it's not related to the variable with the same name. If it was, you could never use something like  or  or any other variable name directly in a string.You could just use  to concatenate the variable value with the glob pattern:but the better method is to use  to handle path construction:Another option is to use the [ module], which has its own glob support:
