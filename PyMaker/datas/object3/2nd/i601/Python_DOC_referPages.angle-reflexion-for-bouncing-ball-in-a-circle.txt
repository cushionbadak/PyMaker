I am making a game with some bouncing elements IN a circle (I use pygame) ,My elements have 2 attributes  , one for the angle and one for the speedHere is how elements moves :My problem is this : I know the angle at the top (99.6°) , I have the collision point (x and y ) , but I'm unable to find the angle at the bottom(42.27°)Does someones can make a relation between the first angle and the second ? Picture is better ...
I recommend do calculate the reflection vector to the incident vector on the circular surface.In the following formula  is the normal vector of the circle,  is the incident vector (the current direction vector of the bouncing ball) and  is the reflection vector (outgoing direction vector of the bouncing ball):Use the .To calculate the normal vector, you' ve to know the "hit" point (, ) and the center point of the circle (, ): Calculate the reflection:The new angle can be calculated by :Code listing:
The inner angles of a triangle need to sum up to . Also, the angle  is supplementary to the triangle's angle next to it (calling it by ), i.e.  so . Calling of  the bottom angle. And for the last angle , we can use that it is opposed by the vertex with the other angle that is equal to .Then:P.S.: I know that the values are not exactly equal, but it must be because of the decimal places rounding
