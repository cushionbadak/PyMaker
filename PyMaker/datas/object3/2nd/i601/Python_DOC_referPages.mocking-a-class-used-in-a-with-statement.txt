I have a class which has an  and  function so that I can use it in a with statement, e.g.:I am now trying to write a unit test to test this.   Basically, I am trying to test that  has only been called once.   An example (which I called ):And my test:So I would expect this to pass, because the test_method has been called exactly once in the function .   But the actual result that I get is:How do I test whether a function in a class which is created using a  statement has been called (either once or multiple times), and (related) how do I set the results of those calls (using  or )?
The  statement takes whatever  returns to bind to the name in the  part. You bound it to :Note that  is called, so the  statement starts with .  is not  either, it is whatever  returns, so you need to use the return value for that call:Extending on this, if you want to alter what  returns, do so on the return value of .You can always print out the  attribute of your object to see what has happened to it:Note that your actual implementation of  returns , so without mocking your  function fails with an attribute error.
