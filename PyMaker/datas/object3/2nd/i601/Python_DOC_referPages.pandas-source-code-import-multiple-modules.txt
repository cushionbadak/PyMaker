I was looking at the pandas source code here, and I found the following statement a little bit weird: It seems that it imported Nat and groupby, which are two libraries, as multiple modules (libgroupby, iNaT, lib, reduction).I went to the  library here, but I didn't find any model with name . There is indeed a , which I assume is the  library? Can the number of imported libraries be less than the imported modules? How does that work? From my past understanding, we can do , but we cannot do . 
from  it actually imported 5 method/class/module:NaT,grouby as libgroupy (so in your script you will now use libgroupy)iNaTlibreductionNow  and  indeed doesn't exists in the  folder, but it won't give an import error because they are imported from somewhere else in  of _libs. of a package implicitly executes whenever something is imported from that package or it's subpackages.So the  inside  will execute, where  is imported from package  hence making them available for import from  package too.Now if you will look for  or  in the .tslibs folder you will won't find it, but if you will look at the  of  you will see here  and  is imported from , so if you look inside that file this time you will find the definition of  and  in there.You can take a look at the docs for better explanationYou can import it like this and then it might be easier for you to understand whats going on:This import will do exactly the same as what the import statement in your question does.
