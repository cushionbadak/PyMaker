Use datetime to parse datetime strings, then you can easily extract all the parts individuallySee docs for more details:
You could use  to split on either spaces or colons and grab the 4th element:You could unpack it that way, as well:That would allow you more accessOtherwise, I'd go with @liamhawkins suggestion of the datetime moduleEDIT: If you're looking for similar access paradigms to  objects, you can use a  from the  module:
While this could be accomplished with , the use of  in @liamhawkins answer [ https://stackoverflow.com/a/54600322/214150 ] would be preferred, assuming you are always dealing with formatted dates.In addition, you could accomplish your goal by simply using a  () and basic slicing of the resulting list. For example:
Hope this will find the date in string and returns date 
if it is truly just a string and the data you want will always be at the same position you could just do this.This returns,This works the same even if its from datetime or something.If this is some other output from a function you can just convert it to a string and then extract the data the same way.If however you are not sure the data you want will always be in the same place of the string then I would suggest the following.the regex.group() is returning,And then [:2] is extracting the first two items to return,
