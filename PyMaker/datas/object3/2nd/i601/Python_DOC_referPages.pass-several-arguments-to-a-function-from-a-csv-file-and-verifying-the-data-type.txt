I have a function  with several arguments  to  that I want to read from a file.I have a file  that I want to load row-by-row to run a function n times, where n is the number of rows of the file. Each element of the row contains the argument to pass to the function. The function is expects to have arguments as characters, numeric, integer and lists as shown in the example below.This is what the CSV file looks like:  I have tried the code below, but I miss to enforce that the data structure types are enforced correctly.How can I be sure that the data types are converted correctly before passing on the  arguments to ?
This is how to build a .csv file with , ,  and  data types that will load as arguments to a function by row:note that as @Nullman mentioed the outer  and the inner. in csv, commas inside (double) quotation marks are ignored.Then having the .csv file defined one can read the arguments defined inside the .csv file as:Note that the data types are enforced in .
