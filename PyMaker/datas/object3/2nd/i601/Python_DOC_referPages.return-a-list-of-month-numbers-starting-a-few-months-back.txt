Hw would you get a list of 12-month numbers from 3 months back from the current month? For example:The current month is Feb = 2 (month number)So 3 months back is Nov = 11 (month number)so the list should be [11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]I have done:
Can the user specify the current month?If so:Otherwise, replace the first line with the following:That said, it would probably be better to use  for any form of date manipulation.

If you really want to rotate an array, there are generally two ways to do this. The first is more pythonic and involves appending the end of the list to the front. The second way is to utilize the collections library and rotate a list wrapped in a deque object.
