I am trying to write a program to categorize into folders a large amount of files according to their respective groups indicated in the file name. I wrote the followin code, but when I run it it gives me a file not found error, even though the file is in the given path. I'd appreciate any help in figuring out what is wrong.Here's the error:
 does not automatically create new directories (recursively), if the new name happens to be a filename in a directory that does not exist.To create the directories first, you can (in Python 3) use:where dirname can contain subdirectories (existing or not).Alternatively, use , that can handle new and intermediate directories. From the documentation:Recursive directory or file renaming function. Works like rename(), except creation of any intermediate directories needed to make the new pathname good is attempted first
