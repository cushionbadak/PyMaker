This question already has an answer here:Python variable scope error                    11 answers                I am making a Python Discord bot with discord.py. I am relatively new to Python but have about eight years of experience with other languages. My problem is that I get the  even though I have defined  as a global variable. (I am using Python 3.6.8)I have tried defining the variables outside the  function, but I get the same result.I expected the output would be that it runs the code within the if statement, but instead I get the error  and no code is run.The only thing I can think of being the problem is . I tried:But then I got the error:  and the bot didn't start at all. What should I do? 
According to the official docs This is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope,  that variable becomes local to that scope and shadows any similarly  named variable in the outer scope.Short version:You need to declare your global variable outside the scope of your functions such asLong version:Basically, everything in python is an object and collections of those objects are called namespaces.  Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the  global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the  author of a module can use global variables in the module without  worrying about accidental clashes with a userâ€™s global variables.So when you run your bot script, python treats it as a module that is running as the main script, with its own global scope.When you declare a variable in a global scope, to use it in local scopes of certain functions you need to use the keyword  to access that global scope of your module.Also, python does not require semi-colons to terminate statements (such as ). Semicolons can be used to delimit statements if you wish to put multiple statements on the same line.
