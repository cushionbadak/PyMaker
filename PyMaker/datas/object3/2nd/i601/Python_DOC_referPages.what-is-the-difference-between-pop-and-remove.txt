What is the real difference between  and ? I noticed that I can only pop Int objects, but is there anything else? Also, which one is more efficient?
Tuples have no  or  methods, being immutable once created.Lists however do, and  and  have completely different purposes. From the help:pop(...) method of builtins.list instance      L.pop([index]) -> item -- remove and return item at index (default last).      Raises IndexError if list is empty or index is out of range.remove(...) method of builtins.list instance      L.remove(value) -> None -- remove first occurrence of value.      Raises ValueError if the value is not present.So  removes (And returns) an item from a list, by index:Gives you:cat    ["dog", "fish"]Whereas  searches for a given string and removes the first item that matches from the list (but doesn't return it).Gives you:None    ["dog", "fish"]
 and  are not associated tuples but you can use it for lists in python. : It will remove the last from the list if not given any index as an argument but with if a valid index is provided then it will remove the element at the particular index.: It will remove first the specified appearance of the element from the list which is passed as the argument.You can also save your  element but the same can't be done in case of .
