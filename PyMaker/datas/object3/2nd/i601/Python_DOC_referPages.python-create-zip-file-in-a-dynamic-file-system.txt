I'm having trouble creating a zip in my file system which is dynamic depending on what's defined in the  file. Can someone guide me through the correct way of writing the zip file?Here's what I've come up so far which is I know is incorrect.
I'm not sure what the file system package is used for but the appropriate way to write a zipfile is:Bare in mind that "...ZipFile is also a context manager and therefore supports the with statement. In the example, myzip is closed after the with statement’s suite is finished—even if an exception occurs.." (From zipfile — Work with ZIP archives documentation) so you don't have to use zip.close() at the end.Thus applies to all context manager in Python.
