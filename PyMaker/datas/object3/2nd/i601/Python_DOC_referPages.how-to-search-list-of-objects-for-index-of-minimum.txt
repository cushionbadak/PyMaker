I want to search through a list of objects for the lowest number present in an attribute of the objects. This is easy enough using a list comprehension and the  function. The issue comes when I want to find the index of the object.
You can use 's  argument to search by index:A key provides the values that will be compared instead of the actual sequence. Here, my sequence is , which is just the indices of all the elements. But instead of finding the minimum index, I am making it so that we find the minimum of  for each index .
Use  to iterate through lists while keeping track of indices: is a tuple and using  parameter of , we ask Python to find minimum of , which subsequently returns it's index along with it.Read about lambda here.
If you wanted to be able to compare, sort, find the min/ max on the items directly you could use the "dunder" methods. These methods allow you to overload built in functions on classes.For instance if you had a class like thisYou can then create two instances and compare them directly like this,or if you had a list of itemsYou can then get the minimum item by going or the index of it by goingalthough it may be enough to just have a reference to the minimum item.
I think you may be looking for np.argmin function, if you provide a list as an input it will return the index of the minimal element.in this case it would be:
