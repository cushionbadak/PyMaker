I have written some fairly questionable code I'm sure, but it seems to do the job. The issue is that it is printing the data to a spreadsheet and in the column where I am hoping to find the vehicle's year if the first word in the advert isn't the year, then it displays the first word which could be the manufacturer. Essentially i want to set if statements so that if the vehicle year isn't in the first word but is somewhere else in the string that it still finds it and prints it to my .csv. Also, I have been struggling for a while to parse through multiple pages and was hoping that someone here could help with that too. The url has page=2 etc in it but I am not able to get it to parse through all url's and get the data on all pages. At the moment everything I have tried only does the first page. As you may have guessed, I am fairly new to Python. Please could someone help me with this? I realise that the if statements at the bottom may be way off. The code successfully manages to get the first word from the string, it is just a shame that the way the data is structured that it isn't always the vehicle's year of manufacture (yom)
