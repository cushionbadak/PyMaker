Are these the same clock?  and . It seems to be the case on my system, but I cannot find any related documentation except this sentence:Event loop uses monotonic clocks to track time.However that does not imply that those two clocks have the same absolute value.
Yes, that's how it is implemented:See more here: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/fb2c3465f09e1f720cdae7eca87d62125a327fd9/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#L635Note that this holds for the default event loop. And  can be overwritten to return some other implementation.
However that does not imply that those two clocks have the same absolute value.True, and in fact it states the exact opposite, that the event loop may use any monotonic clock whatsoever. The current implementation just calls  - which is not documented - but a future one may switch to, say, a more efficient clock that returns values different from those returned by .Having said that, note that it is not very likely for such a switch to happen, but as far as the  contract is concerned, it is allowed.
