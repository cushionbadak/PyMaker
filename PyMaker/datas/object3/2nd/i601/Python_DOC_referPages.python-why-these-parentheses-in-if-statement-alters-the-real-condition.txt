This question already has an answer here:How to check if one of the following items is in a list?                    14 answers                I was doing a leetcode question while I had the following python code:The expected output when I ran this code should beBut instead this prints nothing, which I assume means  evaluates to .Then I removed the outer parentheses and made itThis gave me the right output.My second guess was this pair of redundant parentheses actually calculates , so I put  in the Python3.7 console directly and that's the outputBut still this won't make sense since (1, 3) is indeed in pairs.Could anybody explain why putting these parentheses invalidates the statement?
The result of a Python  expression is the first operand that is truthy, or  if neither is.The first expression you tried isIt can be evaluated asSince both operands to the  expression in parentheses are non-empty tuples, the expression evaluates toThe result is understandably false.If you strip off the parentheses, you run into the fact that  has lower precedence than . Sois the same asAgain, both operands are truthy, so the expression evaluates to  regardless of whether  contains anything.What you were probably trying to express is
You should use :Or use:You can't use  because  just picks an element which is not indeed that that's the element in , so use the above codes.
