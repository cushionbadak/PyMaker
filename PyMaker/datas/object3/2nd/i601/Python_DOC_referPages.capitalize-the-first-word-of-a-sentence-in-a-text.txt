Natural Text
I want to make sure that each sentence in a text starts with a capital letter. E.g.   "we have good news and bad news about your emissaries to our world," the extraterrestrial ambassador informed the Prime Minister. the good news is they tasted like chicken."   should become"We have good news and bad news about your emissaries to our world," the extraterrestrial ambassador informed the Prime Minister. The good news is they tasted like chicken."I tried using split() to split the sentence. Then, I capitalized the first character of each line. I appended the rest of the string to the capitalized character.I want to obtain "We have good news and bad news about your emissaries to our world," the extraterrestrial ambassador informed the Prime Minister. The good news is they tasted like chicken."I get "We have good news and bad news about your emissaries to our world," the extraterrestrial ambassador informed the Prime MinisterThe good news is they tasted like chicken."
When you split the string by  that removes the s from your string and puts the rest of it into a list. You need to add the lost periods to your sentences to make this work.Also, this can result in the last sentence to have double periods, since it only has  at the end of it, not . We need to remove the period (if it exists) at the beginning to make sure we don't get double periods. We can also make this solution cleaner:By using  you can get a copy of your string with the first character removed. And using  will give you a copy of your string with the last character removed. 
This code should work:The error in your code is that  removes the splitting delimiter  and that's why the period is removed. Sorry for not providing a thorough description as I cannot think of what to say. Please feel free to ask in comments.EDIT: Let me try to explain what I did.Lines 1-2: Accepts the input and splits into a list by . On the sample input, this gives: . Note the period is gone from the first sentence where it was split.Line 4:  is a generator and iterates through an iterator returning the index and item of each item in the iterator in a .Line 5: Replaces the place of  in  with the capital of the first character plus the rest of the line.Line 6: Prints the message.  basically reverses what you did with split.  takes a iterator of strings, , and sticks them together with  between all the items. Without this, you would be missing your periods.
split splits the string AND none of the new strings contain the delimiter -  or the string/character you split by.change your code to this:
The below can handle multiple sentence types (ending in ".", "!", "?", etc...) and will capitalize the first word of each of the sentences. Since you want to keep your existing capital letters, using the capitalize function will not work (since it will make none sentence starting words lowercase). You can throw a lambda function into the list comp to take advantage of upper() on the first letter of each sentence, this keeps the rest of the sentence completely un-changed.  The "new_sentence" list comprehension is the same as saying:
You can use the re.sub function in order to replace all characters following the pattern  with its uppercase equivalent.
