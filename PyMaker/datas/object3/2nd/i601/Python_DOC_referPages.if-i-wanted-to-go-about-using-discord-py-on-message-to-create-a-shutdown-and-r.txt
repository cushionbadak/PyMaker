My Discord Bot runs off discord.py, using the on_message function. If I wanted to use this, to create a command which would shutdown, and another to restart my Discord Bot, how would I do it?I run the bot off a server host on repl.it.I will link some code below so you can see what I mean by on_message:Ideally the commands should work as  and , and should only be able to be used by me.Thanks in advance,H
To exit the script, you would call . To restart the script, take a look at .For example:
You can place your code in a  loop and use  to close the Discord connection. The  command will then only use  without interrupting the  loop, and  will also use  but will call  to cancel the  loop.You can create commands to handle this instead of having everything in the  event, which will become cluttered.
