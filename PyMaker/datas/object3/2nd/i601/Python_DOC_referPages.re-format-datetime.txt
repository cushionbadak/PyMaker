I'm trying to change the datetime format from "2019-02-08 15:00" to "8 feb", but the hour and minute seems to stop me from doing this in an easy way.The variable containing this info is  and if I print it I get "2019-02-08 15:00".Then I run this code:But I am getting the error:TypeError: argument must be sequence of length 9, not 16In PHP, which I'm quite good at, this is easy peasy, but I'm guessing I'm missing some small detail here. Can someone please give me a push in the right direction?
Appears that you are working with datetime strings and not datetime objects, so you will first need to create a datetime object from your string in order to use  to reformat it.Also note that  objects and  objects are not the same despite sharing some common methods.For example:
