You can use the operator module for common operators and make a lookup dictionary to map symbols to functions. If you want operators not in that module, you can simply define custom functions and add look them up the same way:
You might also be interested in knowing about the inbuilt function eval. This reduces the  and  loops to a single statement for this particular example of yoursEDITTo make  slightly safe in this particular case, you can perhaps use something like this

If security is not your concern you could use eval to achieve thisThe problem is that eval literally evaluates everything you write as python code, so don't do this if you mean for this to be used by others
