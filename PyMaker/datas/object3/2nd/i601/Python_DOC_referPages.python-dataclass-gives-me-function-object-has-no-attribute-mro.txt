As in the last question:TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable while no iteration exists?, I find a problem in my program. That is:In Python,actually gives you , but I want actually gives you  , whereas I want So now I',m thinking about designing data classes of my own. Yet in test code I came across an 'function' object has no attribute "mro" problem.Test code 1:Test code 1 error screenshot:Test code 2:Test code 2 error scrrenshot:My Python version is Anaconda 3.6.8
The argument to  has to be an iterable whose elements are the desired set items.  has an iterable as an argument, but its elements are 0 and 0, not a tuple . You need . The same goes for ; you need an iterable containing the tuple , soAs for the error you are seeing,  doesn't have an , because it doesn't need one. It's base class is always , and you cannot inherit from  to create a class whose MRO would need to access 's hypothetical MRO. As to why your data class raises that error, it's because the  decorator has to decorate a class, not a function.
