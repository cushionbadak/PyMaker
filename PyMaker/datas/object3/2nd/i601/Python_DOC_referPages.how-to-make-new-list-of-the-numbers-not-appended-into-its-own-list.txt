If I have a multidimensional list called t and I append some numbers from the list into a new list called TC, how do I take all of the numbers that were not appended into the new list and put them in their own list, called nonTC? For example:And I write some conditions to append only some values from each list to create the new list, TC:How do I append the values not included in TC into its own list? So I would get:
You can use list comprehensions and a list of sets to filter your original list:Output:Readup:list comprehensionssets enumerate(iterable) And: Explanation of how nested list comprehension works?Suggestion for other way to do it, creds to AChampion:See zip() - it essentially bundles the two lists into an iterable of tuples Add-On for multiple occurences - forfeiting list comp and sets:It needs only 1 pass over your items instead of 2 (seperate list comps) which makes it probably more efficient in the long run...
Just out of curiosity, using NumPy:
