While applying some external module method to a class I need to be able to pass different pairs of  to the function, like:How to pass dicts or tuples to the function, so that it recognises  (string) as  (argument) in (tuple) or  (dictionary) ?Basically, I just need to get  out of For your reference, I am trying to use neomodel module for neo4j graph db.
To pass multiple arguments to a function, you use the  operator and  operator as shown below.The  operator pack all ordered argument in it, and the  operator packs all unmatched key argument in it.For example:For key argument it works the same way,(ref.)
You can unfold the positional argument of a function with a single asterisk  and unfold dictionaries as key/value pairs with two asterisks . For exampleThe Python Reference has details on this.A more specific example for OPIf you have a function  with the keyword argument  you can use  to unfold the key/value pairs into keyword arguments. For exampleIf instead you have a function  with the positional argument  you can use  to unfold the values into positional arguments. You can also use  to unfold the key/value pairs as long as the keys exactly match the positional arguments. For example
