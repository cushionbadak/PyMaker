I want to change the name of the object each time a object is created so that there's an accumulator adding everytime an object is created.  In this example i want the first object.name to be B1 and then the second object.name to be B2 and then B3 and so on.  This is what im trying to getthis is what I tried but i am not really getting anywhereI cant think of a way to avoid the issue of trying to set a variable to equal plus one of itself because itself isn't defined yet.
The simplest approach here is a class variable that stores the next value to use, which you increment after use:This isn't thread safe without locking though, so if you want thread-safety,  can do the same job in a thread-safe (at least on CPython) manner:Since 's work is done at the C layer with the GIL held, it operates atomically, both returning the next number and moving the count along as a single atomic operation.
You can have a class level variable maintain how many objects were created, and then use that to determine the nameThis is not thread safe however, as mentioned by @ShadowRanger. It's likly a better idea to use  as they suggest.
