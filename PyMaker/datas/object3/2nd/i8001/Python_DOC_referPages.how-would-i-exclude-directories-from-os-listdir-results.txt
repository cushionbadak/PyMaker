I'm making a script that will encode files within a directory using b64/b16 and I'm using os.listdir to do so, but it also lists directories which causes problems since now it's trying to encode directories as if it were a file. How would I be able to exclude directories from os.listdir results?
You can use  function to check if the current file is a directory.Also, it is much better to use string formatting operations instead of string concatenation: not butSuch code is much easier to understand and modify.
Instead of using  your can use  which will return separate list for files and directoriespython-oswalk-examplepythoncentral os-walk
use filteror list comprehension with os.path.isfile()
