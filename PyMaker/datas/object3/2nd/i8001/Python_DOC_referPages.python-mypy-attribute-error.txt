I have a python3.4 project and I recently decided to use mypy for better understanding.This chunk of code works but checking with mypy pops out an error :The error :   (corresponds to this line : )But when I look inside the ZipFile class, I can clearly see that the attribute exists.Â So why does the error occurs ? and is there a way I can resolve it ?
In short, the reason is because the  attribute is not documented within Typeshed, the collection of type stubs for the stdlib/various 3rd party libraries. You can see this for yourself here.Why is  not included? Well, because it doesn't actually appear to be a documented part of the API. If you search through the document, you'll see  is not mentioned anywhere.Instead, you should call the  method, which returns exactly what you want (see implementation here if you're curious). You'll notice  is indeed listed within typeshed.
