I am having an issue where I'm trying to write a program that combs a config file for 'certain' search terms and if they match, print its there, if not print its not here. Here is what i have so far:So the issue is, if i print an else: statement, then every line (all 1500) prints since the loop runs line by line. Is there a way to search the whole doc and not line by line?
Use the  clause of the  loop along with the  statement. Also note that just iterating over the file itself will do; no need to explicitly read all the lines. (I also added  to make sure the file gets closed.)You can even write it as one of those ever-popular generator expressions:Since the messages being printed are so similar, you can code-golf it even further:
Yes, this is possible, using . But beware that if your file is huge, it may not be a good idea to load the entire file at once in your memory.Also you are looping through the same file multiple times, try to avoid this by only iterating over the file once and searching all the values in the  array at once. Furthermore try to avoid using regexes whenever possible since they can be slow. Something like this can work too:
To read the entire file, you can use  instead of .If what you're looking for in the file is just a string, you don't need :
I guess you can read the file to a string and use a simple , i.e.:
If you really need to read the file line by line (I assume you need the line of the occurrence), then:However, if you just need to check if the term is there, regardless of the line, just use  to read the whole file at once:
