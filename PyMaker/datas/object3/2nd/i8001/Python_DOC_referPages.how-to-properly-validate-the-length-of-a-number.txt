I would like to be able to check weather the user has inputed a 8-digit number, not for example, a 7 digit number, and tell them that the number they inputted is too long or not long enough.For reference here is the input:
I guess you can use  function.Something like .
You can use the usual :Python 3:Python 2:Generally, you can get the number of digits of an integer by using 
In case you want to loop until the user has entered the correct number:
If your are using Python 2, use  instead of , which will always return a :In Python 2,  will return the entered value as , while  will evaluate the entered value as code, et is equivalent to .You can check that with the following code:With Python 3, however, the old  was renamed to , and the old  does not exists, although you can still achieve the same with .Once you have the  representation of the card number, you can use  to get the number of characters.However, I would rather use  to validate the input instead of just checking the length, as you may have letters or other symbols as well. You can wrap the whole thing in a loop to keep asking until a valid value is entered. Assuming you are using Python 3, it will look like this:
