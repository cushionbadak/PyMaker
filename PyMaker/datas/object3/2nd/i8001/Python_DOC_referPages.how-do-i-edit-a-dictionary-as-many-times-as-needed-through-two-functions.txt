I have this code for Python:The objective is to be able to edit "items" as many times as I want while always returning the updated dictionary back to main. But, as it stands, I can only edit the dictionary once inside the function "additems" and then it resets when "main" is run. I don't want the dictionary to reset when main is run, I always want it to print the updated "items" dictionary. So instead of:"What would you like to add?" - G"What value would you like to assign?" - 3"{'G': '3'}""Would you like to continue?" - Y "What would you like to add?" - J"What value would you like to assign?" - 4"{'J': '4'}" (only the most recent addition to the dictionary is printed)... Which is what the code currently does, I want it to be able to do:"What would you like to add?" - G"What value would you like to assign?" - 3"{'G': '3'}""Would you like to continue?" - Y "What would you like to add?" - J"What value would you like to assign?" - 4"{'G': '3', 'J': '4'}" (both additions are printed)... and to be able to do this as long as I provide an input of Y, meaning I am able to continue.If you haven't already guessed, I am new to both Stack and to Python, but help would be appreciated. Thus, when I mean help, I mean help in the context of one who is new to Python and programming in general, not help to one with experience. Just answer as if you were talking to a 5 year old and save us all the trouble.
As @AChampion noted you don't need recursion, just pass  from  function to .Since  objects are mutable we don't need to pass and return them, just mutate in case of need.We can replace recursion with infinite loop likeI've added newline characters  to the end of each question to make it simpler for user to interact, if you don't need them â€“ feel free to remove.
