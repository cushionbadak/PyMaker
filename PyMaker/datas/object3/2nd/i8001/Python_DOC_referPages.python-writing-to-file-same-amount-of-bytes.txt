I was trying to write Pcap generator and I want to write fixed length of bytes to file. Frame length that I sniff is always changeable obviously but I should also define this length in Pcap packet header. I set it as 1500 bytes. Is there any way to put leading zeros to byte object that complete it to 1500 bytes?
Use .This is the documentation for :Return a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII  digits to make a sequence of length . A leading sign prefix (/   is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character rather  than before. For  objects, the original sequence is returned if  width is less than or equal to .
