I have this json:and this list of strings:I would like to know if there is a way to get the result of the json using this list?
As pointed out in another answer, you can use  for this.  There are even tricks to make it a little more difficult for hackers to take control of your system.  This is by far the easiest route, however, there isn't a clear way to make this actually safe.  Any of those tricks that you play will only give you a false sense of security.  Therefore DO NOT use it if you do not trust the source of  completely.  Bad things will happen.The good news is that if you're willing to write (or copy/paste) a little more code, we can use python's AST to do this safely.  The trick will be to parse the string into an AST.  We'll then create a class that can walk the AST and take appropriate (and safe) actions when certain types of nodes are found.  In your example, there are 4 types of nodes that we need to deal with:: Represents a string literal.: Represents a name lookup.  e.g. : Represents a  call.: The object that will get passed to .  In general this could be a slice too -- but that isn't in the inputs that you've shown, so we'll not support it for now.Other types of nodes that you might need (depending on the inputs) are , and .  It should be straight forward to implement them once you've grokked the ast reference (which can be somewhat obscure if you haven't looked at it before).Now writing our class starts to look pretty simple:In action, it looks like:
You can use python's eval function. That being said, this is a really bad idea because eval is a dangerous function. Please check this link for more info on the eval function: https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html
