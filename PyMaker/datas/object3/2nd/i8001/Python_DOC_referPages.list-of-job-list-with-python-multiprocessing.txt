I need to run 100 query in parallel, but I don't have enough resources, so I have created a list with 20 sublists, each sublist contains 5 processes. Now I want to run the job lists successively. I explain more : when the first five queries are finished, the second five will be launched, etc...I did this : But I was running at 100% of CPUWhere I was wrong ? Thank you ! 
you need to join the sublist before starting the next.
