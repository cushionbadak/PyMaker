Well, I have datetime objects with information like 2013-10-01 14:15:00 and time objects like 1900-01-01 00:00:49.2350001900-01-01 00:00:49.4650001900-01-01 00:00:49.695000The time objects are actually progressive increments which I'd like to add to the datetime object. As described here, If date is a datetime object, its time components and tzinfo attributes are ignored.I wrote the code below. How should it be updated to be able to add these time objects to the datetime object as increments?Output:2013-10-01 00:00:49.2350002013-10-01 00:00:49.4650002013-10-01 00:00:49.695000Expected output:2013-10-01 14:15:49.2350002013-10-01 14:15:49.4650002013-10-01 14:15:49.695000
