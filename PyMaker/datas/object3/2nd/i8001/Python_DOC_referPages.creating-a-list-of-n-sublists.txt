I'm working on a script that computes the sum of the elements of a list of lists of integers. I'm struggling with the input. I want the user to define the number of nested lists. The script is letting me input the desired number of lists and their contents but it only handles the last list and ignores the previous ones. I'm trying to use  to get all the lists into , but it isn't working. 
You're close, but this part of your code isn't doing what you want:The first line above iterates over a range of integers, setting  to each of those integers in turn.The second line runs each "turn" through the loop , replacing the  you just set with the result of the list comprehension .The third line runs after the loop is finished, and puts the final  value by itself into a list called .So, you're changing the value of  twice every time through the loop, but each time you replace that value, the previous value is lost, and  ends up as a list containing only the final value of .What you need to do is save each of those values in another list. You can do that with the  method:As you can see, the  list is set up before the loop starts, and each value of  is appended to the end of it inside the loop.In this case, you don't actually need to use different  and  variables, but it's a good idea to avoid reusing variable names to do different things in the same function â€“ and especially, not to replace loop counters inside a loop (which is an easy way to confuse yourself and introduce errors).Your  function (and the  call at the end) can stay the same.
