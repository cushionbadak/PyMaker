I've tried searching and trying suggestions people made for others but its not working for me, here is my code:So its just supposed to run indefinitely for now, but what I want it to do is pass the variables from 'CreateAccount' into 'DisplayAccountInfo'.When I press anything other than n for 'ConfirmAccount' I get that the variables are undefined.If I set it manually in 'DisplayAccountInfo()' then it doesn't throw any errors.This is just me messing about and trying to understand python, if anyone can help that would be great.
Use the unpacking operator, *:What this does is takes the tuple of four strings returned by  and converts them into four arguments to be passed as separate parameters to . Whereas if you omitted the  operator and just called , that would pass a single tuple argument to , resulting in a  exception (because  expects four arguments, not one).Of course if you also need to save the strings returned from  for later use, you'll need to do that in between calling  and .
The variable you declared on  can't be accesed by its name from the outside. To pass the information to another function you need to store its values first:
