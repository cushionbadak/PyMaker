I am using Python 3. I want to optimize a function used for removing the first element in a list with . Instead of moving all the data one index lower, how can I make it just increment the index by 1 for every element?So that the internal storage is still available but just unused. When it removes the first element, the second element becomes the new index to be the first element, the third one to be the second etc.So that I don't have to move all the elements in a list after a pop but just move their index to keep the internal storage as it is.
All you need isThe python lists have exactly the behaviour you describe.
