I'm trying to write a class that inherits from dictionary and overwrote  and  and everything was going so well until I noticed that  and  do not use . Anyone know how to overwrite their look up functions?Example implementation below:
According to the documentation on emulating container types (https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types), you should implement  and  (and a few others) directly.It might help to implement , because that's what a lot of those functions do, but you should really check the docs here.
Well you can overwrite the  and  functions:As far as I know dictionaries are not implemented in Python itself. So they do not use Python code to obtain a key or value. Simply overwriting the  will thus not work since  are implemented at the interpreter level. This is for instance the source code of a Python dictionary of Python 2.6.6.
