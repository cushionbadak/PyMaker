I'm trying to run a nested for loop with a conditional statement. When running it, I expect it to print the statement that I defined if my conditional statement. But it doesn't print anything. (and it doesn't run indefinitely). Pokemons_gyms is a list of strings. Players is a dictionary. I tried adding  but it doesn't work. I'm stuck cause I don't get any error running the code...
 returns a list so  always evaluates to .You should check for membership using :
The problem here is that  is going to be a  while  is a list of strings.  Because of this, they will never be equal.Perhaps you want to check
Your problem is in the line .  checks for equality so this will look if  is equal to the list in  in the dictionary.If you want to check if the any of the items in the list is equal to the string you can use the  keywordNotice that for large lists this can be rather slow so you might want to consider using a set instead if you are going to have players with lots of visited pokemon_gyms.
YUP! All set, it was '==' that was resulting to all results being False because of type(gym) is different from type(players[players_id]['gyms_visited']).I replaced '==' by 'in' and it worked perfectly.Thank you guys!
