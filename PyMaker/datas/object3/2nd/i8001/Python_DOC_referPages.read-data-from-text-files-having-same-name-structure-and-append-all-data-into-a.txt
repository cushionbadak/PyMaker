I have some data files, say , ,... and so on. I want to read all these data files using a single loop structure and append the data values into a single file, say data-all.txt.I am fine with any of the following programming languages: , , 
 module is great for globbing matching files, and for easy read/write:
In windows,  usecopy data*.txt data-all.txtIn Unix, usecat data*.txt >> data-all.txt
Use python zip and the csv module to achieve this. Within a single for loop:For Example:
In python First of all you have to create the list of all file paths you can use the glob library in python.then you can read that data using list comprehension.it will give you the list of data frames depending upon the data files in your folderIt will combine the data in single data frame and you can write it as a single dataframe. now you can write the dataframe in a single file.
It can be done through reading the content of each file, and writing them into an output file handle. The files structure in your description contains numbers, so we might need to call sorted to sort them before start reading. The "files_search_pattern" should point out to the input directory 'PATH/*.txt' and the same for the output file handle "data-all.txt"
