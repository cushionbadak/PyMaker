Natural Text
I use:But instead of appending a new row after the last row, it appends 2 new rows: an empty one and then the required one "one| two". What is the reason for that?
I find it easier to use  when writing to csv files. The documentation can be found here. I can reproduce the problem you had on my machine, but the following code does not produce an empty line after each new line is appended.
