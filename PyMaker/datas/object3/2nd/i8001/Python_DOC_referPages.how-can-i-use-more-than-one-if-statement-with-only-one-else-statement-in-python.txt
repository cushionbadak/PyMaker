I'm trying to create a very simple program but I ran into a problem with my  statement. A very simplified version of the code I was using is as follows:If I enter 'Bob' it prints "Hi Bob." followed by the else statement (which is the problem), but if I enter 'Mary' it doesn't print the else statement. I tried adding the  statement after each  statement, but that didn't work either. What am I doing wrong? How can I use more than one  statement if there is only one  statement?
Use  like this:Python Tutorial on control flow:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.htmlEDIT: Use print() in portable Python 2/3 way.
