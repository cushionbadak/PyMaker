I am trying to plot a seaborn histogram on a Kaggle notebook in this way:but I get this error:Thi is the Kaggle notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/asindico/slice-indices-must-be-integers-or-none/here is the series head:
As @ryankdwyer pointed out, it was an issue in the underlying  implementation which is no longer existent in the  release.Since kaggle won't allow you to access the internet from any kernel/script, upgrading the package is not an option. You basically have the following two alternatives:Use . This will of course not print the kde.Manually patch the  implementation with the code from version . Admittedly, this is a bit hacky, but you will get the kde plot.Here is an example (and a proof on kaggle):Why does it work? Well, it relates to the way Python loads modules. From the Python docs:5.3.1. The module cacheThe first place checked during import search is . This mapping serves as a cache of all modules that have been previously imported, including the intermediate paths. So if  was previously imported,  will contain entries for , , and . Each key will have as its value the corresponding module object.Therefore, the  is inside this module cache. The next time seaborn acquires it, the cached version will be returned by the Python module loader. Since this cached version is the module that we have adapted, our patch of the  function is used. By the way, this practice is very handy when writing unit tests and is called mocking. 
This error appears to be a known issue. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/1092Potential Solution -> update your statsmodels package to 0.8.0 
From the seaborn issue from @ryankdwyer, it sounds like a bug in the kde. Try turning it off with kde=False.
