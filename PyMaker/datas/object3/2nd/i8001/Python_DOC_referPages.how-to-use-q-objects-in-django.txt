I am trying to understand how to make a simple search form for a website in Django. After some google search and few failures to do it on my own I ended up with the following code in views.py where 'q' is value retrieved from the form: I already understand how it works and why there is reduce and operator.and_ (I mean, I think I understand). But I do not understand why a simple   returns and error (even if input is a single word). I also don't understand why reduce needs to get bitwise value? 
why a simple result.filter(Q(somedbfield_icontains=q)) returns and errorThe simplest variant would be  Q isn't needed there, Q is used to extend your filtering with logic operators (and, or, not). Also, notice the double underscore before .why reduce needs to get bitwise value?It dosen't is used to apply any function to an iterable of arguments:  is the same as  is the same as Works roughly like this:
