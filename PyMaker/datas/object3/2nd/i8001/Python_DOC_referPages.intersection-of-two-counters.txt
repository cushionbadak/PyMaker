I'm trying to find the shared elements (and the shared number of occurrences) between two lists. For example, the intersection of these two lists:should return  or something similar, e.g.  or  (order of the list doesn't matter). I already have an approach that works:But perhaps there is an easier (or faster) way?

Instead ofuseas  means the intersection of the  objects.
