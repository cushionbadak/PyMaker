Natural Text
I am writing a program that stores user names and passwords but I want to delete all the data stored on the text file if the user kills the program....is that possible to do in a simple way?
You can use  on a Unix-like OS. It will create a file with no visible directory entry. Even if the process is killed with , the file will be destroyed.
From a net-result standpoint, you can treat your changes as a transaction.Step 4 can happen fairly quickly, although not atomically. Still, certainly way faster than most users can type Ctrl-C. To do this, you would:
UNIX/Linux oriented answer-You can write a handler for the signals, you could catch:SIGTERM (15)SIGINT (2)SIGQUIT (3)SIGABRT (6)SIGSTOP (24)Just to mention some, but if  is used,  is going to give you a hard time (see my comment). Therefore, it would be a better idea storing data encrypted (if that's good for something)
If by "kill" you mean a keyboard interrupt or another type of clean exit from the program you can use the following:If you are asking if the program is receiving a kill signal from the operating system, then there is no way to handle that.
just open the file and close it .
