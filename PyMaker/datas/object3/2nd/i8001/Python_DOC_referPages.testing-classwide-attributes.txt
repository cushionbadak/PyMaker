Let's say I have a module named  with a class .  has a classwide counter attribute that allows me to track the order which instances were created.  looks like this:Now I have a test file where I am testing the various functionalities of . I am unsure of how to test this  attribute, because the other unittests are creating instances of  and so I don't know what the given id of a  instance should be.

I would stub out Bar to bypass the constructor.Now you can test like this:
