I'm developing a simple TCP chat application server-client to learn Python and I'm not sure about data structures to use. Server side I've defined  class and its attributes: socket, username, room and online_status. Every client is added to  list and also, at the same time, its socket is added to  list.  Server runs in an always-true loop listening for incoming messages using the following declarationIs there any way to list every  of every  objects and do like
Unsure that I have really understood what you want, but assuming that you want to build a list of sockets from the list of client instances, you can use a list comprehension:(assuming  is a list of the client instances)
