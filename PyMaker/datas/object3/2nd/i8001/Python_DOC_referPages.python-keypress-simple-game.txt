Natural Text
I would like to see on screen a sign, e.x might be (hash) '#'. Sign will have some starting position, let's say (0, 0). I would like to see sign moving right if I press right arrow, left if I press left arrow, etc.So far my code looks like this, and it works for reading pos, but I want to add some kind of "animation" so I can see sign is moving on the screen:!Update: Just to give u a clue, I created "icon" and now when u press right or left, icon moves in desired direction.
You could create a list of lists that serves as the map and set the cell of the player to . Then just print the map and if the player moves, clear the command-line/terminal with  and print the updated map.
