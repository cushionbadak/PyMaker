You have to specify the compression when making the ZipFile constructorclass zipfile.ZipFile(file, mode='r', compression=ZIP_STORED,  allowZip64=True)ZIP_STORED is uncompressed:The numeric constant for an uncompressed archive member.so you will have to change that to one of thesecompression is the ZIP compression method to use when writing the  archive, and should be ZIP_STORED, ZIP_DEFLATED, ZIP_BZIP2 or  ZIP_LZMA;Context managerAnd it's better to work with a context manager () which automatically opens and closes the file, also when something goes wrongso you can change that portion to something likedepending on the chosen compression algorithm
