Goal: Find the average of the 'budget' column (data from an imported csv file).So far I have gotten my program to open and print the contents of the spreadsheet and have cleaned up the formatting some. I'm not sure how to attach the file to this post, but the columns read ['title,year,length,budget,rating,votes\r\n'] How can I begin to manipulate the data? More specifically target the 'budget' column and begin doing the math.PS: I have been asked to figure this out without using the 'import csv' module. My work so far:
Use  module from standard library https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlAnd now you can manipulate it in any way you want, all of your budgets are in  variable
You can split your csv file like this to get only the required column. Here I am printing a price column from .csv file.   the output is as follows. you can sum them instead of printing
