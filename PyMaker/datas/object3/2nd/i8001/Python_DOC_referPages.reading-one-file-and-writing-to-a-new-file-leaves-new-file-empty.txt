Natural Text
I am trying to read from a file that contains a character "|" that I need removed when copying the data to a new file. For example my data looks something like, where the content of one line transfers to another:I would like the "|" removed and after each time in appears the next set of text would move to the next line, so afterwards it would appear like the following:I constructed the following code to read the old file line by line and then character by character and then checked if the character was a "|" and if it was to not write it. However, when I do so, my print statements do not print anything and the new file is empty. Here is the code I am working with:Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am still trying to get used to Python.
Your code works for me, but when I run it on your example input, I don't get your exact example output. Based on the output, I assume you also want to remove whitespace padding the text. There are a several ways of achieving this, but I like using the substitute  method in the regular expression  library. - match the first bar with adjacent whitespace - match the final bar with adjacent whitespace - match the other bars with adjacent whitespaceYou can achieve this with fewer expressions, but I broke them up for clarity. I recommend investing a couple hours into familiarizing yourself with regex (regular expressions), as it will make your text-manipulation tasks much easier.
