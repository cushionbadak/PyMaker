I've create a file that will create data to a file, print that file, and I am now trying to create a menu procedure which will allow the user to enter a particular colour, in which the file will then print out the data for that colour. My code is as follows:As the def menu() show you, I want the program to ask the user what colour to be looked up. If the user says black, for example, the program should print the details for that dictionary. I was also wondering if there was a way so that in def output(), each data entry would be split by a new line. At the moment, when I print it, it comes out as a long list as follows: 
Edit: An attempt without using :The only part that may unfamiliar or might seem clunky is using str.partition to find the color matching the user's input.
