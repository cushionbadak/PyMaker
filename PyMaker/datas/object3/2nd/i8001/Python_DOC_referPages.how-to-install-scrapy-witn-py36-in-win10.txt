Recently we want to rewrite our project with python3(now it was py2.7).We mainly use scrapy to grab data from website,but I can't install scrapy in py36 now.Seems the problem is twisted.I tried to install twisted also got the same exception.Others told me to install twisted.whl,but I can't find this file in internet.Please help.
From the Installation Requirements of Twisted on GitHub,it looks like it is not yet compatible with Python 3.6:To install Twisted, you need:Python 2.7 (full functionality) or 3.3/3.4/3.5 (subset of functionality).Indeed, in the Python 3.6 changelog, you can see that:PEP 528 and PEP 529, Windows filesystem and console encoding changed to UTF-8.This affects the value returned by , which causes the  you see in the stack trace.So I would suggest you to keep using Python 3.5 until Twisted updates to support Python 3.6. If you really cannot, as a last resort try setting up your project in a non-Windows environment (e.g. a virtual machine), or hack around this issue by setting the PYTHONIOENCODING environment variable to whatever  used to return before the upgrade to 3.6. But it has downsides, it may not work, and there might be other incompatibilities down the road anyway.
