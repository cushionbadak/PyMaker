I'm using this code:Is there more pythonic, less verbose method without 2 castings?Using round is discouraging by the following note from the documentationThe behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for example,  round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. This is not a  bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions can’t be  represented exactly as a float. See Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues  and Limitations for more information.
:Note that you’ll probably still want to use a certain precision of string formatting when producing output due to floating point imprecision.Depending on what you’re trying to achieve, it might be appropriate to use the  type:which does its math in (surprise!) decimal instead of binary and therefore doesn’t suffer any issues with decimal rounding (except initially if you’re trying to create it from a float).
Whats wrong with good old, built in round()?Use it like so:Example output:
This is not as nice, but I'm always a fan of:Far from the best way to do it, but it's one I use often.
I'd go with  but if you don't like its behavior you can always write your own  so, for the sake of completness:Keep in mind that this round, unlike the builtin  rounds down, not up.
