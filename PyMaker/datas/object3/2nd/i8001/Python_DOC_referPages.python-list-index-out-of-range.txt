I have been stuck with this question on finding out the second largest number in a list to be read from the console with:n = size of the list(number of elements) AND arr = The list itselfOne of the constraints is -100<=A[i]<=100 which I am unable to integrate within my code as I am getting a LIST INDEX OUT OF RANGE ERROR. For instance, this code fails for the custom input: 3-10 0 10 but passes for 310 0 10 Error:Traceback (most recent call last):File "solution.py", line 12, in   if sortedlist[i]    IndexError: list index out of range
if sortedlist[i] < sortedlist[i+1]:The problem lies here. In your example  so i can only be 0, 1 or 2. But in your code,  goes 1, 2 and 3 in the above line, which is out of the array bounds.You can print  and see that  goes till 2 which is  and so  will be out of bounds. That is one easy way you could debug.You have to ensure a condition where you do not compare with the next element for the last element.
you can just use  to get the second largest number.In case of repeated numbers you have to use set method call over original/sorted list.
