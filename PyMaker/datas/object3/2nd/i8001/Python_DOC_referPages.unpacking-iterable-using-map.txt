Assuming I have two iterables of numbers of the same lengthI need to count weighted sum. I know that it can be done with list comprehensionI wonder if it can be done using  and  likebut this gives an errorso my question: is there any way of passing unpacked tuples to function using ?
 doesn't need the , just useFrom 's DocumentationIf additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel.Also mentioned in 's documentation is that instead you can use  instead of  for already ped input.As Rahul hinted at, using  is always a good idea when dealing with numerics, actually something likealready should do the trick (though in contrast to  this requires the two arrays to be of same length, while  would map the shortest length).
Try this:Or
You can also attempt with ,As per Tobias Kienzler's Suggestion,
