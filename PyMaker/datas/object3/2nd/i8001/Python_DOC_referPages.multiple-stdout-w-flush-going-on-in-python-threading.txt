I have a small piece of code that I made to test out and hopefully debug the problem without having to modify the code in my main applet in Python. This has let me to build this code:My goal with this code is to be able to have both of these threads displaying output in stdout format (with flushing) at the same time and have then side by side or something. problem is that I assume since it is flushing each one, it flushes the other string by default. I don't quite know how to get this to work if it is even possible. If you just run one of the threads, it works fine. However I want to be able to run both threads with their own string running at the same time in the terminal output. Here is a picture displaying what I'm getting:terminal screenshotlet me know if you need more info. thanks in advance.
Instead of allowing each thread to output to stdout, a better solution is to have one thread control stdout exclusively. Then provide a threadsafe channel for the other threads to dispatch data to be output.One good method to achieve this is to share a Queue between all threads. Ensure that only the output thread is accessing data after it has been added to the queue.The output thread can store the last message from each other thread and use that data to format stdout nicely. This can include clearing output to display something like this, and update it as each thread generates new data.ExampleNote that there are a few gotchas in passing arguments to a thread, as well as my use of a few tricks to ensure a safe exit, such as making the threads daemons. No newlines are used because  carriage returns only restart the current line of output.Example Output:
