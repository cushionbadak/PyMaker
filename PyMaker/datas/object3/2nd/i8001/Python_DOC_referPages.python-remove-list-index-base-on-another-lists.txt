I have a 2 lists as detailed below:What is the best solution to remove list index of a base on the number from  for e.g. for a[0] I need to remove number  
You may use a nested list comprehension expression using  and  to filter the content as:Based on your desired result, in case if you just want to remove zeroes from the  list then you don't need the intermediate  list. You may use a list comprehension expression to skip the zeroes from the new list as:
If I understood correctly the question, this should work:
Python has a language feature called List Comprehensions that is perfectly suited to making this sort of thing extremely easy. The following statement does exactly what you want and stores the result in l3:Hope this helps!
The shortest one-liner is below:To explain, it's using list comprehension to loop through a and use the index:At this point the index is (0, 1, 2...) and original_tuple is each tuple.Then for each tuple, you can access the subtracting tuple (remove_a_index[x]) by checking if it's in it or not.
You can do the following:Create a new list.Modify the all the items that you wish to remove to 'remove' on the original list.Populate the new list with all the items that are not 'remove'.The code:
