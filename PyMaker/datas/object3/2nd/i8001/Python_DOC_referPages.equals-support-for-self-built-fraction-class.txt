As code showed above, how can I print As example:They are all work for calculation every time. And when I try to print fraction(1,3) == fraction(2,6), it come out as . How can I let it calculate as ?How can I do it without using .
Try this:As pointed out in the comments, there is no need to implement the .EDIT: As requested in the comments to this answer, here is a method for simplifying fractions.The simplification of fraction implies dividing both numbers by the greatest common divisor. As posted in here the code is rather simpleI hope it helps.
The data model specifies  as method that implements  checks.A very simple implementation of  would be:It would work for  but it wouldn't work for . You would need modify the contents of the  method so it allows even to compare multiples.
In python to get custom behavior for the == operator you must provide an implementation for the method . If you don't override it the default behavior is to check if the objects are really the same object, which in this case they are not.
