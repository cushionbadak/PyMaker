Considering below example,To print last index,What is the idea behind the preference to ask for forgiveness over taking permission?
I can't speak to whether something is Pythonic but I can speak to why it leads to more concise code.  In general you're doing a lot of things, not just looking at one index.  So consider what happens when I'm looking at several attributes in a dictionary:Each of those assignments would have needed to be an if statement without  using the exception handling.  That is, the more things you can do in an try block, the less percentage of your overall code will need to deal with errors.
