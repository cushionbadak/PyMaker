I'm trying to figure out how to test an item in a list with part of a string. so for example, if a list contains "potatoechips" and i have a string called "potatoe" how can I check if the string is found in an item in the list?
You can use the  method to validate if a substring is in a string:
To just test for presence of a sub string in any of the strings in the list, you can use any:The advantage is  will break on the first  and can be more efficient if the list is long.You can also join the list together into a string separated by a delimiter:The advantage here would be if you have many tests.  for millions of tests is faster than constructing millions of comprehensions for example. If you want to know which string has the positive, you can use a list comprehension with the index of the string in the list:Or, you can use  if you just want the strings as an alternative:
You are checking if  is in the list using , but that will check if a specific item in the list is exactly .Simply iterate over the list and then check:
It can be done using 'any' and list comprehensions to filter list to similar words.
