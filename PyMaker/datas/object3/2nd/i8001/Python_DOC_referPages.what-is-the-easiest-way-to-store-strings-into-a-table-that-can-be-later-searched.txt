I download different links, I do not control which links are downloaded, so I want my program to be able to tell if that link has been downloaded before, if it has, then skip the link and keep going with the loop that it is currently in.Here in this loop I am using an array to handle URL duplicates, but as you already know, as soon as I restart the program everything is erased.
Save it to a csv.  This is what I do when I need to be able to keep information from one code execution to another.  Then you can just load the csv in when the program executes again.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html for more details on using csv.
If performance is an issue, I would hash the normalized URL and save the hash to a database or a list using the bisect module to keep it ordered. Comparing hashes is faster than comparing strings and more space efficient.
