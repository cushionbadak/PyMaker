Why is it not equal to this? ↓How can I do it?
The documentation for  says:Split the argument into words using , capitalize each word using , and join the capitalized words using . If the optional second argument sep is absent or , runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise sep is used to split and join the words.If we do this step by step:So you can see the double quotes are treated as being the part of the words, and so the following s are not capitalised.The  method of strings is what you should use:
It doesn't work because it is naive and is confused by the leading  which makes it think that  does not begin with a letter.Use the built-in string method  instead.This probably is the reason why  remains in the  module but was never made a string method.
