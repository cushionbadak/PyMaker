Using python's argparse library, I would like to process the first few command-line arguments and use them to generate a list of choices for the other command-line arguments.How can I process the first few arguments without argparse complaining about extra arguments that it doesn't expect (which I plan to add later)?For example, I have a script that gets the username and password from the command-line, uses those to access available properties of an API, and then uses that list to restrict the values of a third argument:I know I can just add all the arguments at once, and then validate the third argument myself manually, but I'm wondering if there's a way to natively do what I'm asking in the argparse library?
 is not a complicated test.  I'd recommend parsing all inputs, and then testing for this special case.  Overall I think gives you better control, and better help and error display.The  approach is good to learn and occasionally use, but I don't think it's that great for this case.  You don't get any extra points for embedding all argument testing in the .
