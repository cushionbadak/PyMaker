Natural Text
I have a block of text like this:I want to find the most elegant solution to stripping it down to look like this:i.e. I want to strip out all words that have a prefix of # and @.  (And yes, im inspecting tweets)I am new to python, and I would be ok doing this on single words, but not sure on the best way to achieve this on a string that contains multiple words.My first thoughts would be to use replace, but that would just strip out the actual @ and # symbols.  Looking for the best way to strip out any word that has a prefix of # or @.-EDIT-Not sure if it this invalidates the answers give, but for acceptance, I also need to strip out where multiple words contain a prefix of # or $.  e.g. hello #hiya #ello
You can use regular expressions:
It's as simple as writing an anonymous function and putting it in a filter statementThis will lose the comma on @users or #topics but if you're just processing the tweets you probably won't miss it.
Where  is your tweet.
