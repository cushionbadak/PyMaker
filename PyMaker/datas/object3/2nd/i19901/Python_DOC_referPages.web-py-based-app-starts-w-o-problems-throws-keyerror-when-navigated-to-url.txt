I'm trying to get a troublesome python app of mine to work. I've just overcame a problem via help of @unutbu here.My next problem is happenig to be a bit weird, the stack trace shows nothing related to my code:The only script I call a web.py function is this:This guy is called from a script a directory upper in the filesystem:If you want, I can copy how directory layout look from the question I mentioned above, but I'm not doing it now, as it will cause a lot of mess here (output of tree command). My question is: How can I fix this issue with minimal changes to the directory structure?I thougth adding directory structure of the application should be helpful to those who want to help/who may read this for solving their own problem.This thing has just started, aims to provide a blogging engine, and helps me implement thing I've learnt till today for something complete and useful.
