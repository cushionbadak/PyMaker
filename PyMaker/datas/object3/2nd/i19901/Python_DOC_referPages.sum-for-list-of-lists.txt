I'm looking for method in python to sum a list of list that contain only integers.I saw that the method  works only for list but not for list of list.There is anything fit for me?thank you
You can use  with a generator expression here:or: comparisons:
 flattens one level of iterable (which is all you need here), so  gets the list with the sublists broken out.
This runs sum on every element of the first list, then puts the results from those into sum again.
