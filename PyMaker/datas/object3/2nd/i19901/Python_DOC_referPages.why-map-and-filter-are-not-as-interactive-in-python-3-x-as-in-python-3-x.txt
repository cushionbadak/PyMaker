I used to program interactively in Python 2.7 with IDLE. In 2.7, when I did things like:orI got the result as a collection resulting from applying the function.After upgrading to Python 3.2, when I do the same I just get "Filter object" or "Map object" and have to manually iterate through the collection to see the result.Was this intended and do you know any Python 3.2 IDE that will behave like old IDLE with respect to printing function outputs? I'm basically looking for "REPL for Python".
This has nothing to do with IDLE; the  and  functions have changed in Python 3 and now return an iterator instead of a list:: Construct an iterator...: Return an iterator...Use  and  if you want to see the results as lists.Alternatively, you can use list comprehensions:
