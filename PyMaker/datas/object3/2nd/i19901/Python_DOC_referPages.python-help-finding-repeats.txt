I have these functions below where I am placing the letter "b" at a certain location within a matrix. (I'm making minesweeper and these "b" represents where the bomb is located in the matrix). I must put 'z' bombs into the function, but where the bombs are placed cannot occur more than once. I know how to place them inside the function, but finding if they are repeating is what I can't figure outThanks
