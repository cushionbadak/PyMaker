What is the  way to calculated all the product combinations of two lists. So given two lists of length  I'd liked to return a list of length  containing the products. Like  but the results should use all four elements not only combination pairs like:So more like this:The output can be similar to the  method i.e   I need to calculate the product but I'm interesting in the combination method. Note: When I say  way of doing this I mean a simple one or two lines taking advantage of pythons structures, libraries (itertools ect). 
You can generate all  possibilities by starting with .  This enumerates all possible sequences of s and s of length 4, and then you can translate each 0-1 sequence to a sequence of values from  and , by taking  if the ith element of the 0-1 sequence is , and  otherwise.  In code: To print the products instead of the lists:If you have numpy available and are willing to work with numpy arrays instead of Python lists, then there are some nice tools like numpy.choose available.  For example:Combining with the earlier solutions gives:

Is this what you want:
