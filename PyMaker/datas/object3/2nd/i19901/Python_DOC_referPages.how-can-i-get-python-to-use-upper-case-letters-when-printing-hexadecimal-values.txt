In Python v2.6 I can get hexadecimal for my integers in one of two ways:However, in both cases, the hexadecimal digits are lower case. How can I get these in upper case?
Capital X (Python 2 and 3 using sprintf-style formatting):Or in python 3+ (using  string syntax):Or in python 3.6+ (using formatted string literals):
Just use upper().Output:
By using uppercase :Updating for Python 3.6 era: Just use 'X' in the format part, inside f-strings:(f-strings accept any valid Python expression before the  - including  direct numeric expressions and variable names). 
The more Python 3 idiom using f-strings would be:Notes (and why this is not a duplicate):shows how to avoid capitalizing the '0x' prefix, which was an issue in other answersshows how to get variable interpolation ; nobody actually ever puts hex literals in real code. There are plenty of pitfalls in doing interpolation: it's not  nor  nor  nor even  as I also tried. So many ways to trip up. It still took me 15 minutes of trial-and-error after rereading four tutorials and whatsnew docs to get the syntax. This answer shows how to get f-string variable interpolation right; others don't.
