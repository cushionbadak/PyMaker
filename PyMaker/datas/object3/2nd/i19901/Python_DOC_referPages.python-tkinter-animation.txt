Why is the animation not working? The shape doesn't move when I run the program.
You never called the  method. There were a couple of other naming issues.
Your  method has a  loop in it which never breaks. This is a no-no in a GUI program, because by never returning, it prevents the GUI's event-loop from processing events. So, for example, if you had a Menu, then the user would not be able to select any menu item. The GUI would appear frozen, except for whatever actions you implement in the  method.Here is a slight modification of @Tim's code which fixes this problem by removing the  loop and simply moving the aliens one step before returning.  is called at the end of the  method to have the event loop call animation again after a short pause.
Here's a way of doing it using a loop:An updatable variable is a variable that stays the same when updated and can be updated again.
