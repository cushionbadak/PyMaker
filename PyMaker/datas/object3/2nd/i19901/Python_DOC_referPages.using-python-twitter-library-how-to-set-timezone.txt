I'm trying to list out tweets with their time-stamps. I have this...Which prints out...Which is pretty much what I'm after, but for the time, which seems to be in the wrong timezone. https://twitter.com/ttytter/status/259518502069760000Is there a way I can change this within the python-twitter library? I was looking at  GetTimeZone() and SetTimeZone(), but I haven't been able to figure out how they work.Also looking at how to shift a datetime object by 12 hours in python but not sure if I need to go there.Thanks for any help!
python-twitter returns the status timestamps as a string and as the number of seconds since the epoch. The latter is the simplest to convert to a timezone-aware  instance (see this answer).Unfortunately the user's  attribute is not in the standard tz database format used by , so it is necessary to use the  user attribute instead (we still use the  attribute to name the  created with with the UTC offset). The  package provides a convenience type  that allows the creation of  instances from UTC offsets, which we can then use to convert the  from UTC to the local time zone:which gives the output for the first status:
Combining suggestions from Pedro Romano and J.F. Sebastian, I have this...Output:  which is the correct time zone and also accounts for DST.Thank you!
