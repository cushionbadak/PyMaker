I want to chunk an input stream for batch processing. Given an input list or generator,I want a function that will return chunks of that input. Say, if , then,This is something I do over and over, and was wondering if there is a more standard way than writing it myself. Am I missing something in ? (One could solve the problem with  and , but that feels clunky.) In case anyone wants to see an implementation, here it is,EditInspired by kreativitea's answer, here's a solution with , which is straightforward & doesn't require post-filtering,
[Updated version thanks to the OP: I've been throwing  at everything in sight since I upgraded and it didn't even occur to me that I didn't need it here.]Oh, what the heck:which gives:Warning: the above suffers the same problem as the OP's  if the input is a list.  You could get around this with an extra  wrap but that's less pretty.  Conceptually, using  or  might make more sense than  but I was character-counting for some reason.  :^)[FTR: no, I'm still not entirely serious about this, but hey-- it's a Monday.]
The recipe from :
Is there any reason you're not using something like this?:edit:Since people are making generators....edit 2:I was thinking, if you have the input stream in memory as a deque, you can  very efficiently to yield n number of objects.
