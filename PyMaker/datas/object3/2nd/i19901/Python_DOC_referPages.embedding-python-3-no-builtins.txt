After much hair loss, I'm looking for help.I'm embedding Python 3.3 into a simple app.  One unusual aspect is Python isn't on the path, but it all seems to load OK.  But for some reason, nothing can be executed.Below is a small example program that shows the error:EDIT: I know the reference counting is horrible -- this is just a simple example.I have tried a variety of ways to import and define builtins, including various attempts shown below:None of them work -- the error is identical with each.What am I doing wrong?  Is it path related?  Something about builtins that I'm doing wrong?
