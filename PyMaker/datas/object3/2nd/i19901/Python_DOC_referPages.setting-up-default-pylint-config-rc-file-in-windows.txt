I'm using Pylint under Windows, and it's not reading my pylint-config.rc file.Is there a way to set up a default .rc file for Python within windows so that I don't have to keep typing it into the command line?Thanks.
I don't have a windows box at hand to test, but the code uses  to find the current user's home directory, and looks for a file calle  in that directory. According to the python documentation, on Windows,  uses HOME and USERPROFILE if set, otherwise a combination of HOMEPATH and HOMEDRIVE. So my advice is to check in a Python interactive session what the following script outputs:and put the configuration file as  in that folder.Alternatively, if you want to use different configuration files on a per project basis, you should know that if there is a file called  (without a leading dot) in the current working directory, then Pylint will use this one. If there is a file called  in the current working directory, Pylint will look in the parent directory until there is no such file and then look for a  configuration file. This is done so that you can maintain a per project config file together with you source code, and lauch Pylint from any directory in your source tree. 
Since creating a file beginning with a dot is not allowed from Windows file explorer, you can create a template using:
There are two possible ways to do this.  One way is to edit the file  changing the linetoAnother way is to go to add an environment variable.  Do this by going to  then going to the  tab and clicking .  Then click  and create a variable named PYLINTRC with the value of .
