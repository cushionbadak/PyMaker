If you just need a random integer, you can use  from the random module.If you need it for crypto purposes, use , which makes use of .Example
Might not exactly be on topic, but I want to help those coming here from a search engine. To convert  to an integer I'm using this:Note: The range of the index here is up to that of a 4-byte integer. If you want more, change the  to a greater value.The idea was taken from here: https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/generate-a-192-bit-random-number/
