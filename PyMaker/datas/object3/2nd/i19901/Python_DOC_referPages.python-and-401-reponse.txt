(Often, code that takes a dozen lines to write with  or  is a two-liner with .)Finally, since you already know how to use php's low-level libcurl wrappers, there are a few different third-party alternatives for Python that are nearly identical. See this search, and look through , , and  to see which one feels most familiar.
