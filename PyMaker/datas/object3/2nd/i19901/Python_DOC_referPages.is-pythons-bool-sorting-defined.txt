Is the ordering of True and False well defined in Python, or is it left as an implementation detail?From the console, I'm seeing False sort before True...but I don't know if that's a behavior I should rely on or not.(I'm sure there's some Python doc about this, but I can't find it...)
http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchyBooleans: These represent the truth values False and True. The two objects representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects. The Boolean type is a subtype of plain integers, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts, the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings "False" or "True" are returned, respectively.This reads to me that the python language requires , , , .The same wording is retained in Python 3 as well.
