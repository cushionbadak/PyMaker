I need to read a certain path from three different possible places in two config files:A global one, A local one, The local one has a  section and may or may not have a per case specific section, say . I'd like toRead the path given by the case-specific section of the local configAbsent that, read the path given by the default section of the local configAbsent that, read the path given by the global configAbsent that (!), provide a default pathI'm using  in Python. This is actually not a difficult problem, but the solution I've come up with strikes me as inelegant and clunky. As this is, I think, a fairly common situation, I thought I'd ask more experienced programmers for better solutions. The code I have is this:How may I improve this? What's the usual way of sourcing different config files?
 seems to provide support for what you're trying to implement, specifically multiple config files and a  section.Does this do what you want?The only difference I see is that will allow (and consult) a  section in the global config file (which seems desirable).
