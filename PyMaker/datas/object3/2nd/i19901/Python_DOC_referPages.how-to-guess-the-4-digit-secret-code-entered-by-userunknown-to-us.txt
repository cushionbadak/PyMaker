can someone explain how to do this in python? the idea is to figure out the 4 digit code(ex: 3968) entered by the user. how would one design an algorithm to go about finding this?here is what i got..:this works perfectly....Except when the code starts with 0... Ex: 0387it prints " Your code was 387" as appose to 0387whats a quick fix for this?
The % means that here comes a variable.The 04 means zero-pad it to four characters.The i means it's an integer. Docs here.Alternative version, using the new, more flexible  formatting:

Here's a way of doing it purely using strings:
