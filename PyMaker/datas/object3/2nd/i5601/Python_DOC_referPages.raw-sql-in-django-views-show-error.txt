For some special reasons we had to perform raw query in view.py file. (There is some page that user types an SQL query and sends it so our system and we should perform it and show the result of tat query)if we run something like SELECT * FROM table1, the try part would successfully run and if some queries that do not return some rows like UPDATE, the except part  works.My question is that if we perform some meaningless queries like sakufhskghks, we want to see the error from DB, or any type of error from DB.Is that possible? tnx
If you are not sure about the exception raised, you can call for generic exception information from system.Example:  Database errors too have named exceptions.Relevant errors can be assumed expected and raised.Refer to documentation:  Errors and Exceptions
I think you need to check for various exceptions.Currently, you are just checking some exception happened or not and then printing . When you pass junk,  will contain nothing.Good way to handle various error conditions is to check various database exceptions.Various Database Exceptions in Django!!!Demo Code :
