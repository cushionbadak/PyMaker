been trying to work out how to port this PHP code into Python 3 code but I can't for the life of me understand how it functions, let alone port it. The code I'm trying to port is:Which sorts an associative array based on the values of each key. However, what I don't understand is how the sorting actually works - I've googled around and I cannot seem to find what the return values refer to.Hopefully someone can help me with some pointers in regards to writing a Python port of this PHP function or at least point me along the right lines.Of course I'd use the collection module's ordered dicts but I have no idea how I'd actually create a sorting function to emulate what is going on in the PHP code.Edit: to clarify I need to sort an ordered dict based on the values of another ordered dict. For example here  Ineed to sort data by the values of codes. At least I think I do to my current understanding.
I think you want to pass a function to the  argument to the  function. Something like this:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sortedEdit: To sort an  as described in the question you'll need to use the list of keys returned by  to build a new one -  is an existing :
