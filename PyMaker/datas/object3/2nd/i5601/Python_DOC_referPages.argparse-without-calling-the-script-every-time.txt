So at the moment when I want to use a program with argparse, in the terminal I have to doI was wondering if there is any way of making so that all I have to type is:It would make using it easier and look neater. Thanks.
What you ask is not possible, because you have to specify which program to run, before you can give it any arguments.However, if your goal is to reduce the number of keystrokes:you could give your script a short name if you're interested in reducing the number of keystrokes.you could add the following line to the start of your scriptmake it executable, run the following from the command line,and then call the script like this:if you have only 1 argument, you could also omit the .But there's no way for the system to know which script you want to call based on the argument you pass to it.
