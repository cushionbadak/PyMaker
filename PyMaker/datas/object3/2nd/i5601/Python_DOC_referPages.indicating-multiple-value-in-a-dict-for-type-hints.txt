How do I express the type of a  which has two keys that take two different types of values? For example:The following is just to give you an idea of what I am looking for.Dict[(str, List), (str, Set)]
The feature you are asking about is called "Heterogeneous dictionaries" where you need to define specific types of values for the specific keys. The issue is being discussed at Type for heterogeneous dictionaries with string keys and is not yet implemented and is still open. The current idea is to use so-called  which would allow a syntax like:Note that  project has this type already available through the "mypy extensions" (marked as experimental) - :At the very least though, we can ask for values to be either  or  using :This is, of course, not ideal as we lose a lot of information about what keys need to have values of which types.
