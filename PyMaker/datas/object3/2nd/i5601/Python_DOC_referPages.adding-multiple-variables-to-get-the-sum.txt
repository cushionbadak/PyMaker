Natural Text
I'm working on a small project regarding a game using Python and Discord webhooks. I'm wondering how to get the total ( sum ) of the variables that are put together? These variables have numbers listed that are grabbed from the page of the game site. Here's what I'm working with:The variable I want to add the sum of are classed as  and .
Ilja Everilä comment is correct. Assuming you split the text properly (i.e., the result of the split is a string of numbers) then you can cast the string into either an int or float to add them together. Below is a sample showing some strings being cast into numbers and then added together. Before casting you should verify the that you split the text properly by printing the variables: print(robux) and print(robux2). Lastly, if you are planning on adding more variable to this code then you should also follow Ilja Everilä advice about using a list structure. Lists will let you do so much more with less code.
