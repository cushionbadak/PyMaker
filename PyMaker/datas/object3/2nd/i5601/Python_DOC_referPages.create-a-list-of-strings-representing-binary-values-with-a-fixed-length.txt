I need a list of strings representing binary values, with a fixed length, thus with leading zeros. for example:I want to be able to generate the list given the number of bits. I've come up with a code, but I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it and wonder if it's possible to do the same with a one-liner?
All you need to do for a list comprehension is bring up the last line and make it a list:So isAlternatively, you could use , and map  to make them into the right format:
You can use  to accomplish this
You could use :You could also specify the total string length directly in :
You can do this without using any imports and can use list comprehension to make it one line. I suggest using  instead of  because it's much faster when dealing with binary numbers since it deals with the number in binary and then shifts it (1 << n is the same as 2**n) by .will return ['00', '01', '10', '11']
