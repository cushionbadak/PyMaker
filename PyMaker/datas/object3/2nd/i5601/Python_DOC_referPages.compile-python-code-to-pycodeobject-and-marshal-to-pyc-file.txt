I try to compile python code to PyCodeObject and marshal to pyc file.But when I import my pyc file, it fails and the traceback is "ValueError: bad marshal data (unknown type code)"Here is my code
I guess the  raised is because of the mismatched type of timestamp. You should make sure the  parameter ( used, which standard size is 4 bytes) in  has the same length with your python executable.Since the value of timestamp do not effect on the final result, making the type suitable is enough here. Try to use  instead of  to ensure 8 bytes if you are using 64bit version of CPython.=== UPDATED BEGIN ===Sorry, I made a serious mistake in the previous description.  without any prefix, means native, and the size and byte order is the same to the machineâ€™s native format and byte order (In 64bit CPython, it would be 8 bytes). However the timestamp written to  file is always be 4 bytes (little endian) in both Python 2 and 3. If the used is Python2, we should use  instead of , which has standard size, 4 bytes.If the used is Python3, in additional to , we should add another 4 bytes field, , as the following code shown (importlib/_bootstrap_external.py, Python3.6.4)At last, you could refer to , which is the reverse order of writing code.=== UPDATED END ===By the way, there are some defects in your code: Have not use the  and  parameters in  function
