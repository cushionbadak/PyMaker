numbers.txt:I want to create a list from a numbers.txt, my list should be [[5,6],[3,8],[9,10]But I keep getting \t(between numbers) and \n(at the end, ex. 10\n etc.) in the output. How can I fix that? I should be getting [[5,6], [3,8], [9,10]]My code is:thanks(note: tab is used between two numbers in every line)
Looks like you got tab  separated values. This is my fav:With open... makes sure that the file is closed after.Other alternatives would include importing libraries. Numpy and pandas are the two leading packages to deal with arrays/data/tables/matrixes. Both of them will evaluate your input (and in this case it would be stored as integers). Numpy was suggested by Joran Beasley.If you need it to be integers or float, change code below to one of these:
I would use: without arguments will split your line by whitespaces, include tab or newline characters.
Is probably how i would do it ...
You can try this :output:P.S: you can read this too if you have doubt what happend if you don't close the file.
