this is an algorithm that is meant to write down some of the permutations of the list P and it does it well, but...when i want it to add the permutations  to a global list (necessary for the rest of the program) there is a problem. It still prints all the permutationsbut when i check the list it's filled with the default setcould you please help me at least with what's the actual issue?
Try using built-in itertools link . 
Use to copy the list. You are appending a reference to a list and thats always the same data. Your  contains the same reference over and over.Comment-remark of cdarke:Slicing a list is calles a shallow copy - if you have lists that contain other refs (f.e. inner lists) it will only copy the ref and you have the same problem for the inner lists  - you would have to resort to copy.deepcopy in that case.Example:Output:
It may be more convenient for you to use built-in permutations:
