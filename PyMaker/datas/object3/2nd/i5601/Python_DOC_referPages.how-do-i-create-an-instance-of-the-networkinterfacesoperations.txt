I want to access an Azure VM Scale Set via the Python SDK, to get a list of all the NICs inside it. To do that, I'm guessing I need to use the  link, but I don't know what each parameter should be for the NetworkInterfacesOperations classNetworkInterfacesOperations(client, config, serializer, deserializer)
You don't create directly an instance of this class, this class will be an attribute on the Network client. Example on how to create a Network client:https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/networkSome info about authentication:https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/python-sdk-azure-authenticateOnce you have a client, you can access VMSS NICs:List operations returns an Iterator like subclass. In this case, content are NetworkInterface instance.All Iterators syntax are allowed (, list-comprehension, , etc.)
