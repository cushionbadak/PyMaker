I have created simple class to keep escape seqs:to use them in console outputs like so:now get message from linter that class has no  method.Is it OK and I can simply ignore this warning or what would be pythonic way here?
 method is used while creating an object from class. If you do not want to create any objects you do not have to define it. However, if you only want to it use to separate namespaces you could also simply move it to separate module.
This would be the pythonic way to assign variables inside the class and access them outside.
