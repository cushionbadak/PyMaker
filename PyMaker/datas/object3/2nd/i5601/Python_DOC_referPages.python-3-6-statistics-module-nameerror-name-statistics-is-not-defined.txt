While learning to use "statistics module" in python 3.6 I am facing the following error: NameError: name 'statistics' is not definedI am just testing statistics basic functions which should return mean, median, mode, stdev, variance.I am new to Python and I can't find where the error is.Code: What am I doing wrong?
If I do this in IDLE, all works as expected.So I don't get the error you report at .You haven't reported your stack trace (why not?) so it's not possible for me to tell, but I suspect you have named your test program , and that is hiding the real  module.
 brings in all the names defined in  if that exists and all names except for those starting with an underscore if  doesn't exist.You don't need to qualify the names imported (that is, prefix them with ). Just used them directly, , , , .
