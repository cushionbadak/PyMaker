So I need to call an  function for all items in a list. This could be a list of URLs and an async function using  that gets a response back from every URL. Now obviously I cannot do the following:I can use a normal for loop but then my code will act synchronously and I lose the benefits and speed of having an  response fetching function.Is there any way I can convert a list such that the above works? I just need to change the list's  to a  method right? Can this be achieved by subclassing a list? Maybe encapsulating it in a class?
Use asyncio.as_completed:Or asyncio.gather:EDIT: If you don't mind having an external dependency, you can use aiostream.stream.map:You can control the amount of  coroutine running concurrently using the  argument, and choose whether to get the results in order, or as soon as possible.See more examples in this demonstration and the documentation.
