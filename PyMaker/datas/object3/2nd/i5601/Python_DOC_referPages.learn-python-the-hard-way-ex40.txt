I'm learning python from the book called "Learn python the hard way" and i came across this block of code in exercise401.Is it necessary to add "find_city" function to the dictionary?2.Can i remove "themap" argument in the function "find_city"?Here is my new code and it can still run without any error:
no, it is not.yes you can.And as a side note, many of the top python answerers here on Stack Overflow do not recommend using Learn Python the Hard Way - quite contrary. As a newcomer, in 2017, your time would be more well-spent learning Python 3 and using some other resource.
Yes, it's strange, to put a function in a dictionary with cities. I wouldn't do that, but I don't know, what the author want to demonstrate with.It is not a good idea, to rely on the global variable  in .Usually, you would use :
You can do this, but the first 'codepiece' example stores a "functionpointer" for the find-function inside the dictionary itself so you can use the function by using a key of  and supply the parameters to the found value (the FP) for this key.I do not know the book, but probably this is done on a purpose, like f.e. to teach you that "values" in a dictionary can be of different types - maybe even an introduction to study functions as objects and how to use them....In a real world example I would not do this, I might wrap the whole dictionary in a class and supply class methods IF (and thats a big if) there are other concerns that leads me to wrap stuff for this class...All in all it is a very contreived example (in germany we would say "An den Haaren herbeigezogen" wich roughly translates to "pulled by it's hairs" (word by word) or "pulled out of the a..")I think you are better of using the python3 website and its examples to learn - there are plenty of things to gain there - and study the documentation.
