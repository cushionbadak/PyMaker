So I want to count up in binary but keep the leading zeros in example to count to 6 it'd look like this:0000000100100011010001010110I have this code but it only goes up to a certain amount specified by repeat=4 and i need it to go until it finds a specific number.
Without leading zerosThe above example would display from 0 to 5. And  gives you 4 characters as the result (with leading zeros).Output:With leading zerosThe above code would go from  to  and display the binary with leading zeros.
Nevermind guys, I found the answer! I simply put it in a while loop like this:
