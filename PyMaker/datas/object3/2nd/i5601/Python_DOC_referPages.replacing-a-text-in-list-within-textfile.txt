I'm currently doing an assignment where I have to make an Apartment Registering program. I saved the apartment info like this in a textfile:Now, whenever a new student register to the apartment, I would like to add 1 to the number of occupants, which is the second value in the list. I would also like to replace the TP with student ID number.The whole code works... just the fact that I couldn't replace the values/text that I want to replace... Instead it adds a new line in the text file instead.
