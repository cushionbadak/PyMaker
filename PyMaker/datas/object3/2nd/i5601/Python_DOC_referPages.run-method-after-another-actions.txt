This is a simple programming concept called FLAGS. Google it a bit and you will see is quite simple.
The problem appears to be that you need to call  at the end of the program if there were any failures.  If that is the case, you can use a variable, say , initialized to  (because you haven't found any yet) and set to  whenever you find a failure.  Then, at the end of the program, if  is true, call .
