Natural Text
I am getting this :I am assuming this error is because the  file is somehow still somewhere in the cache? The new file name is . But I do not understand this error, especially that if I try to update , it tells me that it is up to date.
It was rather another newbie moment. The file I was working with was formatted wrong. I solved the issue by creating a new file into a new directory.
