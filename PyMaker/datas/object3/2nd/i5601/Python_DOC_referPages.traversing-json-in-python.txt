I have this json and I was wondering if someone can help me figure out to just get the '1. open' values for the following json. Using python. Thanks
Use  module to convert JSON into python's dictionary. And then it is easy.Result:If you have problem with structure then you can alwasy use  and  to display item and its type, and  to see keys if it is dictionary.
