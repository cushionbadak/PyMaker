Natural Text
I know that this question will be maybe marked as a duplicate, but I already read the other ones and they didnÂ´t help me. I have files that looks like this. I want to delete every character before the The example text.I tried to do it with:But the result cuts away my delimiter.The resulting text.Any suggestions of how to avoid that so that the final result looks like this.
You don't really need to use  for this.  Just find the substring, then use the result to index into the string:
Just append it before the result of split e.g.prints 
Refer some ways below:1. Just concate seperator with split result2. get index an print rest of content3. Using regex
Try this,We will add custom unique delimiter with our usual delimiter, and then split with this custom delimiter in this case , keeping our original delimiter intact.
Unless there is a particular requirement to split the string and use regex then I would perform simple string manipulation. Find where  begins and get the characters to the left of this position:
unless you have use  for some reason you can find the  of  and start the  from there:
i can think of 2 ways to keep the after the split:add sep to the start of the string manually or maybe a more elegant solution would be to find the  and slice the string just before it (assuming you know that it is actually there)
You could find the start of  with str.find(), then slice the string at this index:
Just search for your sep in text with  method:
