Natural Text
I am just playing along with python to understand the things in more depth.I learned that One of the easier ways is to use , but how about this:well, I was expecting the answer to be because that is what Transpose would be ? I swapped the elements, right??Also, this way was more natural to me. I read the documentation for zip here and it does not say anything about such "tricks". How to learn these more pythonic ways of doing the things? I am aware that asking for resources to learn goes into subjective choices and SO does not encourage such questions. But IMO, it is clearly not a matter of choice in this case, but finding any and every resource where such information is available. 
You swap  with ... and then when you get to , you swap  with . Every pair of elements gets swapped twice, except for the diagonal elements, but those get swapped with themselves anyway. Everything ends up back where it started.If you want to perform a transpose by element swaps, you need to avoid swapping pairs twice:Also, your transpose implicitly assumes square input. If you get a 3x5 input, you can't swap  with , because there is no .
You could also just use a basic list comprehension here:
The problem is that you are overwriting  during your loop, such that after the first transpose operation, the second just undoes the first.You could either make a copy of  (and not overwrite ), or do it by a list comprehension.
