I created a (rather complicated) Monty Hall simulation in Python, but, when run, returns equal odds of 33% for both Switching and not, when I know that, in reality, this cannot be the case and is not the case. What is wrong?I know that switching should return 66% odds, while not should return 33% odds. THe odds I recieve tend to not even add up to 100% , but about two thirds, which is a probabilistic impossibility. 
The problem is here:This is evaluated as a chained comparison and will always result as false.Use parenthesis to create the right operator order:Or better use the explicit "not in" operator:
Well for one thing,For another, collecting function results via a global variable is kind of evil.Here's how I would do it:which produces output likeNote: you could speed it up by arbitrarily replacing  with  (without loss of generality).
