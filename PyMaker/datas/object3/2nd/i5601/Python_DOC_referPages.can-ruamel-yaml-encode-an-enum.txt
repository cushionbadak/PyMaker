The following is not working for me, with Python 3.4.7, ruamel.yaml version 0.15.35:I get a totally reasonable :but the  raises:If 's are not supported, is there something I can do to extend the  class I am using (or the subclass  I have created), e.g. a dunder method?
 is not supported out-of-the-box, essentially because the default  method is safe and therefore doesn't support arbitrary Python objects. That safety excludes types as  from the standard library as well. What you should do is add a   to your  class as described in the ruamel.yaml documentation:which gives:You can of course adapt the string representation to your liking (and add a  to be able to load the output back in).Please note that you cannot add  as in the documentation example, as this would interfere with the  values.
I think you'll need to pass the enum by value.https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#programmatic-access-to-enumeration-members-and-their-attributesExtended answer to add a @classmethod which calls .value as it's being passedhttp://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dumpcls.html
