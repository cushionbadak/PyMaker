I've read some switch MAC address table into a file and for some reason the MAC address if formatted as such:'aabb.eeff.hhii'This is not what a MAC address should be, it should follow: 'aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff'I've had a look at the top rated suggestions while writing this and found an answer that may fit my needs but it doesn't worksatomacoto's answerThe MACs are in a list, so when I run for loop I can see them all as such:Current OutputI just want to append ':' at every 2nd nth character, I can just remove the '.' with a simple replace so don't worry about thatDesired outputMy code
Borrowing from the solution that you linked, you can achieve this as follows:Which yields:
If you like regular expressions:The template string looks for two arbitrary characters '(..)' and assigns them to group 1. It then allows for 0 or 1 dots to follow '\.?' and makes sure that at the very end there is no match '(?!$)'. Every match is then replaced with its group 1 plus a colon.This uses the fact that  operates on nonoverlapping matches.
Just iterate through the string once you've cleaned it, and grab 2 string each time you loop through the string. Using  third optional argument you can loop through every second elements. Using  to add the  in between the two elements you are iterating.
You can use  module to achieve your desired output. Regex Explanation: Match any alphabets or number: Match at most 2 characters.This way you can get groups of two and then join them on  to achieve your desired mac address format
