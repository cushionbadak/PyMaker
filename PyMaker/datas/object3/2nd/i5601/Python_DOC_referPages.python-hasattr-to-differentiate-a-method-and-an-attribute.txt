As some good people showed me that  can be used to solve this problem, I still found it to be a different question, because anyone that has this question in mind will not found the answer because he won't connect this directly to . Plus I found a possible way to go around without using , which is to use  as showed in one of the answers from myself.Assume I create a simple class as From what I learned, an attribute is a variable inside a class, and a method is a function inside a class. They are not the same.Apparently, there is no  to be called by python. And it seems that  really gives all  to my test on , , . It does not differentiate from an attribute or a method.And if I use , the attributes and methods will all show up in the output, and you can't really tell which one is what type either.Can someone please explain me why?
No matter it's a variable or a method, they are all considered "attributes". So  returns .The way in which methods are different is that they are callable. This can be checked by calling . So if you want to figure out whether an attribute is callable, you can
You can define  as below
Something interesting that I found is that if I call  on the attributes, a method will shows up as a method, while attributes will be a string or an int or any other types.maybe this can tell whether it is a method or not?
