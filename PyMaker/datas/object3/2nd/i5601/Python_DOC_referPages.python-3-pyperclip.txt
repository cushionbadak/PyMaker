I am very new to Python and I am going through the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter6/). I am working on the Password Locker project and having difficulties with the pyperclip module. I am running Python 3.6.2 on Mac OS X Yosemite. When I try to run my program through terminal I receive this message:However, I have already installed pyperclip and receive this message when I try using "pip3 install pyperclip":and it works fine for me in Shell:I believe my program is identical to that in the book aside from the actual passwords:I've been trying to find out why this happens, but cannot figure it out. Again, I am very new to Python and any helpful insight would be much appreciated! Thanks!
You mentioned that pyperclip is installed in/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packagesIn your script,  and verify that directory is available to your program for imports. If interpreter and library are still mismatched, consider creating an environment using conda or virtualenv.BTW, please delete the  line, and put two new  lines right after the shebang, so they appear before the PASSWORDS assignment. It's just a flake8 style thing.Also, consider using argparse or click rather than reading . For one thing, you get "--help" for free.
Change the shebang in  an run it using python2 instead.
