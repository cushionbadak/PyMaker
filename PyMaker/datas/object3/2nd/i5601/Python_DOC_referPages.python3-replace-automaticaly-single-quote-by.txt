I am doing a python3 software that use google_speech and and os.system command.  Everything work fine but when a user enter a string with the ' character I have this error :  Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string  This is my code :
If you insist on , you want :Return a shell-escaped version of the string s. The returned value is a string that can safely be used as one token in a shell command line, for cases where you cannot use a list.That said, I'd strongly recommend moving to the  module ( would be the simplest replacement for  here, though there are other options), and passing your arguments in list form, allowing  to do the work of escaping (when necessary on Windows), removing the need to manually add quotes, and avoiding string processing entirely on other OSes (where it can  an argument vector directly, with no escapes needed).
It seems as if you're trying to escape your string input by the user.You can use  for this, or .
I finally found an answer who works fine :
