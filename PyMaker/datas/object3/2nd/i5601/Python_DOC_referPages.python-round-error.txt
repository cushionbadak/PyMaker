This question already has an answer here:Python 3.x rounding behavior                    9 answers                What is wrong with the  function in Python 3.6.3? I tested the code below:..and get result asSo rounding  ->  but  -> . Should both variables get value of ?
It's described in docs:If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to  its input.For the built-in types supporting round(), values are rounded to the  closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples  are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for  example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2).
 Both variable will not get value 1.because the value between range from 0.0000000 to 0.5000000  will round off to 0 ,but when you increase any decimal bit after 0.5 it will round off to 1.
