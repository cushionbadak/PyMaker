I just got a book on kids coding in Python for Christmas.  I was really excited to use it and downloaded the app immediately.  The book said to use this code to import Turtle:Then it said this to create a canvas:This error message appeared.What does this mean?  How do I get Turtle's canvas up?
Use ( the  ) can do many more things, this page holds informations about the turtle, its methods and some exampels:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
After import turtle, you want to enter a variable name which is to call the turtle via that variable.Syntax:After that, you want to accessed into the turtle.
What you did is in fact correct, despite the comments and other answers:for example:The question is, why didn't it work for you?  My initial guess is you've created a file called  on your working directory -- if so rename it or delete it and try again.  Otherwise Python finds your turtle.py file instead of the Python library turtle.py file when you .  If that's not the case:My second guess is you're using a limited Python environment that implements it's own subset of turtle.  For example online coding with turtle on https://trinket.io/turtle uses such a subset where  won't work but  (it's alias in the standard turtle library) works just fine. So try  instead of
