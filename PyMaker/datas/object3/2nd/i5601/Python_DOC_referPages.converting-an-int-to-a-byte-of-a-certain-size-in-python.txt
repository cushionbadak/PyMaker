Natural Text
I'm trying to create an array of bits in python that are two binary numbers into a fixed width.For eg.What I've tried/ Problems I've encountered: => 0b1010 (which is not the fixed width I need)String manipulation using format  (this works but I'd like to avoid converting to strings and back if I can. It seems like a lot of overhead to do essentially a shift and add)
