Say you have a function , one should be able to lift this function to act on sets of integers. I.e. , by How can one do this succinctly in python? That is, not involving iterables (loops), potentially something more native and order-independent.I would expect  to be the syntax, but it's not. Maybe something like ?
Python 2.7.10What you described is mapping; it does involve loops in the background, but it achieves your succinctness. Here's an example. applies the function  to every element of . also works on sets; however, map returns back a list of values e.g. , in an arbitrary order. You can turn the returned list back into a set by wrapping it as a . Python 3.6In Python 3.6,  returns back a map object, and you will need to convert it to your desired typed. This example shows the map object converted to a list. Alternatively, you can reduce the amount of code further using lambda functions, making it more succinct. Where the lambda expression has the functionality  but used only there and non-existent afterwards. 
The tools you want are map, and in itertools.For example, to apply  on a collection  of elements, you can useNote that the application is lazy in Python 3, and eager in Python 2.7. Alternatively, you can also use a lazy comprehension:
You can pass multiple arguments as well , like this:It'll return like:
In Python currying is not a native feature but you can emulate it using . For instance, you can use  to lift a function  to a function .
