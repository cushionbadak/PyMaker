This is what I have in mind because I find myself typing the name twice whenever I want to inspect the value of a variable:Is this possible in Python?
If you are in control of the calling function, you can hack this to work reasonably well like:Code:Results:How does this work?The inspect module can be used to inspect the caller, and get the line of code used by the caller.  With a bit of string hacking the variable name (assuming it is a simple variable and not a more complex expression) can be gathered from the source code.
I would say "no", and any other magic doable is just... too much magic.However there's something you can do, and that's looking at the stack trace using the inspect module.But this is not reliable and I'd use it more as a curiosity, since there are plenty of "special cases". For instance: the first 255 integers (I think) in Python occupy a specific memory address so, if you have two variables that are  I don't think you're gonna really be guaranteed which one is it.
