I have an Employee class with a Manager class, and each employee created will get the attributes of the Employee class and even the Manager too.My question is that I want to create an input option that will ask the manager to input the employee that he would like to add to its supervision (to add it to its list of employees) and it will add the employees attributes as well(I know the last 3 lines are at fault, I just can't figure it out).
If you're not familiar with dictionaries, I'll give you a quick run down, but you should really read up on PyDocs, and the general Wikipedia entry on Hash Tables.Now to answer your actual question. I constructed a dictionary of employees and just added the employee's key to the manager from the dictionary. I also showed two ways of constructing the dictionary: one where you add values when you're creating the , and the other with adding values later.
