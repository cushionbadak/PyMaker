Given a list, how can I find sums of part of the list? For example:I want to find out if a part of the list sums up to a certain number.The list part should have a certain length. This is my goal:Each element in 'dif_list' is given by taking 3 numbers out of 'ex_list' and summing them up, i.e. 2+5+4 = 11, 2+5+6 = 13, 2+5+8 = 15, 2+4+6 = 12, etc.Also for reference:Because 2+5+4+6 = 17, 2+5+4+8 = 19, etc.Basically, partsum(thing, num) will take 'num' items of 'thing', sum them up, and append it to a new list. All help is appreciated, thanks!
