I'm developing in a python environment and I want to call an sql query using Lets say I have the following UNLOAD command in an .sql file:In the sql file the  should be explicit like: . But I want the python program to set this  in runtime. which means that the .sql file containts something like  and will be set only in runtime.Any idea of how to do it?
You simply specify a replacement field in your SQL file, and the use a format command. Create your file like thisAnd use this file in python like
Implementing it this way will give you a tough time. The best way to do is to dump the file at a static location:and then use (via a shellscript / or opt for a suitable command for any other script)Here, you may pass any value for   which can be easily populated during run-time.In short, you've dumped the file in s3 at a fixed location (using  UNLOAD) and moved it to the location of your choice or a location  populated at run time (using aws s3 mv...)
You would not be able to set up the UNLOAD path dynamically at runtime, however you could put your SQL statement in a something like a shell/python script where you can create variables with the path you'd like and then pass them into the query.This UNLOAD utility by AWS will get you started if you decide to go with a python script.
