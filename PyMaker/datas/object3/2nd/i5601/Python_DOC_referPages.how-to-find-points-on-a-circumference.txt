How do I find a user defined amount of points on a circumference of a circle. Then when it has been found, place it in a 2 dimensional array for later use. For a slightly better view of it:Thanks for all the help :)
You could also use pygame's  class. Just rotate a vector with the length of the radius and add it to the center of the circle to get a point on the circumference.
You want to find points (x,y) which are points which are solutions to the equation x^2 + y^2 = R^2.First note that both x and y must be in [-R,R], and when you pick x (or y), the other can be found by solving y = sqrt(R^2 - x^2).An alternative is to use the angle, theta, and x = R * cos(theta), y = R * sin(theta). You need only solve for theta in [0,2*PI) radians (sin, cos typically use radians, PI radians is 180 degrees). Which depends upon whether you want to use trignometry (sin/cos are transcedental functions).You can translate these points (x,y) to a new center (xc,yc) simply by adding (x1,y1) to (x,y) to get translated points (xt,yt) = (x+xc,y+yc).
Im assuming you want the points evenly spaced.A circle has 360 degrees about the center, or 2pi radians.you need to divide 2pi by the number of points that you want. say 4 -> 2pi/4that is the number of radians from one point to the next. to compute x and y coordinates use these two equations r = sqrt( x2 + y2 ), and θ = tan-1 ( y / x ) where θ1 = 0*2*pi/4, θ2 = 1*2*pi/4, θ3 = 2*2*pi/4, and θ4 = 3*2*pi/4some code would look like this:
