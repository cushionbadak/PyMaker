Use a negative lookbehind:and then follow it by the thing you actually want to match. This will ensure that the thing you actually want to match is not preceded by a  (i.e. not preceded by a match for ):Matches if the current position in the string is not preceded  by a match for . This is called a negative lookbehind assertion.  Similar to positive lookbehind assertions, the contained pattern must  only match strings of some fixed length and shouldnâ€™t contain group  references. Patterns which start with negative lookbehind assertions  may match at the beginning of the string being searched.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
You can use a negative lookbehind  to say "not preceded by ":I have simplified the part between the brackets a bit to focus on the "one and only one  part".Here is a regex101 link.

The only one that succeed almost perfectly is:I still had to add a check to remove the last non-dollar character. at the end of the sample below. For history I kept a few of the iterations I made since I posted this question:
