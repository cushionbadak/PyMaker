This question already has an answer here:Absolute value for column in Python                    1 answer                In my dataframe I have a column containing numbers, some positive, some negative. ExampleI want to turn all numbers Df['Amount'] into positive numbers. I thought about multiplying all numbers with *-1. But though this turns negative numbers positive, and also does the reverse. Is there a better way to do this?
