I want to upload a pandas dataframe to a server as csv file without saving it on the disc. Is there a way to create a more or less "fake csv" file which pretends to be a real file?Here is some example code:First I get my data from a sql query and storing it as a dataframe.In the upload_ga_data function I want to have something with this logicFull example:
The required behavior is possible using stream:to create a more or less "fake csv" file which pretends to be a real filePython makes File Descriptor (with ) and Stream (with ) behave similarly. Then anywhere you can use a file descriptor can also use a String Stream.The easiest way to create a text stream is with open(), optionally  specifying an encoding:In-memory text streams are also available as StringIO objects:The text stream API is described in detail in the documentation of  TextIOBase.In Pandas you can do it with any function having  argument in its signature, such as :Following code exports a dummy DataFrame in CSV format into a String Stream (not physical file, in-memory octet-stream):When you want to get access to the stream content, just issue:It returns the content without having the need to use a real file.
