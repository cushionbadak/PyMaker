I'm parsing some HTML with Beautiful Soup 3, but it contains HTML entities which Beautiful Soup 3 doesn't automatically decode for me:How can I decode the HTML entities in  to get  instead of .
Python 3.4+ is deprecated, and was supposed to be removed in 3.5, although it was left in by mistake. It will be removed from the language soon. Instead, use :see https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.unescapePython 2.6-3.3You can use the HTML parser from the standard library:See http://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.htmlYou can also use the  compatibility library to simplify the import:
Beautiful Soup handles entity conversion. In Beautiful Soup 3, you'll need to specify the  argument to the  constructor (see the 'Entity Conversion' section of the archived docs). In Beautiful Soup 4, entities get decoded automatically.Beautiful Soup 3Beautiful Soup 4
You can use replace_entities from w3lib.html library
Beautiful Soup 4 allows you to set a formatter to your outputIf you pass in , Beautiful Soup will not modify strings  at all on output. This is the fastest option, but it may lead to  Beautiful Soup generating invalid HTML/XML, as in these examples:
This probably isnt relevant here.  But to eliminate these html entites from an entire document, you can do something like this:  (Assume document = page and please forgive the sloppy code, but if you have ideas as to how to make it better, Im all ears - Im new to this).
