I have a generic class definition, something like this -  I wish to create a large number of classes, each of which has a different value of , and store these classes in a list. The classes in this list will be subsequently used to create several objects.What is the best way to do this?
While I doubt that there isn't a better solution to whatever your underlying problem might be, you can create classes dynamically using :
But this has a bunch of drawbacks.  I also think that the comment given below the question is remarkable.  Very likely you strive for a solution which is not the best for your original problem.
If you really want to do it, then sure you can create classes dynamically using However, you probably need to think about your design. I don't know about the problem you want to solve, but perhaps keeping the property variable as instance one would make more sense.
I think the best way would just be to iterate i=0 to n-1, appending a new object to the end of the list. You can then use i to index into the list and change the value of  that way.
