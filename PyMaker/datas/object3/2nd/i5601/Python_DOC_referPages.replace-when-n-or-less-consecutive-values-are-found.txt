this is perhaps a very simple questionI have a list that looks like this:I am struggling to find a simple python code that replaces when n or less consecutive 1s are found to 0s and creates a new list with the new valuesSo ifb = [0,0,0,2,3,2,0,2,0,3,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,1,1,3,2,0,2,0,0,3,4,0]ifn = 3b = [0,0,0,2,3,2,0,2,0,3,4,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,3,2,0,2,0,0,3,4,0] I have highlighted the new replaces values in each example
"One"-liner, using some : groups the initial list into groups of identical objects. Its output is an iterator of pairs  where  is the element that is the grouping key and  is an iterator producing the actual elements in the group.Since you cannot call  on an iterator, this listifies the groups and chains the resulting lists except lists of  of the appropriate lengthes. Those are replaced by lists of  of the same length.In single steps (using intermediate lists instead of generators):
You can try this:Output:
Non-oneliner using :
Try this:
Longer than others, but arguably straightforward:
