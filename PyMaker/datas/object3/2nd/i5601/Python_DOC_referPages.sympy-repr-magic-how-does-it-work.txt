I noticed that after calling  method of sympy, variable's representation have a better visual appealing. I know that is usually done inheriting repr method. But when I call  method, result is different. Why? Before  being called, this is the result:After  being called, this is the result:Why the repr method doesn't return the same as evaluating the representation of the variable?
That function installs a custom  function, which is used in the interactive interpreter to echo the result of expressions: is called on the result of evaluating an expression entered in an interactive Python session. The display of these values can be customized by assigning another one-argument function to .The implementation is found in the  module:In other words, this has nothing to do with how the objects implement .
