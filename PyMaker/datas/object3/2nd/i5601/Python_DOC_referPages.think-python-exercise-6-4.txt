A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b. Note: you will have to think about the base case.I found this peace of code as it's solution:But I guess some lines are not necessary. Here is my own code:What is the reason of existence of extra lines?Both codes don't work for float numbers such as is_power(2.25, 1.5). Both, return False.
your second code is not correct, take the example of 6 and two your function will return true, but 6 is not a power of two .for the second example, comparing if two doubles are equal is usually done to a given magnitude like given eps = 0.0000001a == b => abs(a - b) < eps . 
@mehdi maick thanks for your correct answer. Here's recursive version, by help of your answer, which I was looking for.
What is the reason of existence of extra lines?The question asks you to think about "Edge Cases". This part of the code "if (a/b == 1)" is handling an edge case. Also, the question says "True if a is a power of b". By removing the else part of the loop, you are avoiding this from happening.
