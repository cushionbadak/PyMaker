Natural Text
Today I was hit with strange error in my script:I'm reading data from socket  and result is  where buff is the returned data. But today I found pretty much "unicorn" where one of the characters returned "▒" <-- this is what throw decode utf-8 into exception. Is there some pre process that would either remove or replace such a strange character?
There is a second parameter for   named . You can set it to  to ignore all non-utf8 characters, or set it to  to replace them with the diamond question mark (�).
