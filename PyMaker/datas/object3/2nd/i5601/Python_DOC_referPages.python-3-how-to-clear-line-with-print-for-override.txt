Natural Text
I'm trying override my last print with a new line but I can't clear the last line. I thought that flush would clear the line, but I can't see it has any effect.Here in my example, I end up with the output:But wanted the output to be "q" only. If the next print is smaller than the first line I can still see the end of the last line.I could just override the first line with spaces, but I don't like that because if I then resize the console, it will shift everything around.Is there anyway to really clear the last line and only the last line?a solution that works both in linux and windows would be great. Thanks.
You can use  to pad the string with whitespace, which will overwrite the old text.You can read more about the Format Specification Mini-Language here
A more reusable solution could be:Tested only in python 3.5+But does fail, if the last printed line was larger than the terminal width.I don't know if there is some way to get the last printed line to stdout? If there is then it would be possible to count the length of that line instead of get_terminal_size.
