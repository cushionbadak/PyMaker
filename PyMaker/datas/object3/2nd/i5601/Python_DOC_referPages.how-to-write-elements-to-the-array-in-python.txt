I read elements from a txt file and I want to write elements to the array, I know I must use substring method but I don't know how to generate an array while I am using substring method.example.txt file includesMy python code:I need to generate 30 elements multi dimensional(5x6) array, I can read elements of this file using this code but I wonder that how to write them to the array.
To get multidimensional array you need to read file line by line, and split every line by commas, like in my previous answer
You can do like this, Using flattening list with different method, 
All you need is  along with  as:which will return you  list as:
Lots of decent comprehension based solutions around. Here is one to use  and :
You need to read the data as a string, and when split it by a comma and newline character:
if you want to keep the formatting of the CSV file and have a two dimensional array then maybe setting up the 2d array first then iterating through the file and adding in the values might be the way to go.Then to add your vales in instead of the spaces, import the file, iterate through each row and for each value add it to the corresponding space in your 2d array
