I need to regularly scrape a site for coupon codes, validate them, and send out notifications. Validation in slow, however, so I don't want that process to bog down the flow of my app. Ideally, the scraper shouldn't have to wait for validation to finish to pump out more results.I imagine the flow of data looking like this:In-between each stage is a queue containing intermediate results. Is this feasible to implement? Does it even make sense to do? Thanks!
Yes, check out asyncio, Python's asynchronous library.
