Natural Text
I know python does a lot of stuff automatically. So if we don't close the file manually then it can automatically close the file. But I have observed that just closing the file (close()) does not flush the buffer (flush()).So is this the particular case where python does not do automatically?
Here, I have an example:Running this script will create the text file with the line "Hello, world" in it. It tells me that flush() was called on . Now, comment out the  line, delete the text file and try again--same result.The only case where this does not work is when you have an exeption (error) raised, then the file will not be flushed. To deal with that situation, use the context manager form of  (AKA the  statement):The context manager ensures that the file is properly flushed and closed, so it is a good practice to use it.
