By calling  when an exception is handled a 3-tuple is returned containing the exception class, the exception object and the traceback.This is also evident by the documentation of :This function returns a tuple of three values that give information about the exception that is currently being handled. ... the values returned are . ... traceback gets a traceback object (see the Reference Manual) which encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred.I want to use the type traceback which is used to create the third variable in the aforementioned  return value but can't find where it's defined.My question is, therefore, where is the  type available for python scripts?EDIT:I would like to use the  type to define a PyQt signal. PyQt Signals are defined by specifying the signal name together with the types of parameters passed. I do not need to create an object of that type, only use it in a manner similar to an  call. 
bad news, even if you can get the class of the traceback object like this:result:when you try:you get:so the traceback type cannot be instanciated externally, probably because you'd need to access python internals to do so (and attributes are read-only even  so not possible to "reuse" an instance either)
You can use  or  like :
That should be defined in C code:Include/traceback.hHm.. in fact, I am not very sure what you want to do, so cannot help more..
