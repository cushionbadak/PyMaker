How can I parse filenames with spaces, parentheses etc. into a variable?Ex.toI get the right format with . However if I store the print from  into a variable it gets reversed to the initial naming. I know that I could use the  method. But it does not appeal safe to me.Does anybody know how I can fix this or work around this problem?Using Python 3.5.3 btw.EDIT example code:
The underlying problem sounds like passing file names that may contain characters that would need to be escaped as arguments to another program. I suggest looking at .Specifically, see frequently used arguments: is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence of program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments.For example:
Your variable is ok. Try using  not  alone.
