I'm attempting to create a 3-d graphics engine using Python 3.6, Tkinter, and specifically NOT pygame (or any other 3d graphics engines) as part of a university assignment.Within this project, I have had to create a "matrix" class, which allows me to easily create and manipulate mxn matrices. I believe this to be crucial for transforming vectors in order to display items on a 2d display.One method I would like my Matrix class to contain is matrix multiplication. I figured the first (and most important) thing to check when performing this method is to ensure that the width of the first matrix is equal to the height of the second matrix, as that is necessary for multiplying two matrices together.If the two matrices cannot be multiplied together, I raise an TypeError, in which I want to say "Matrix multiplication not possible. Width of {first matrix's name}: ({value}) is not equal to height of {second matrix's name}: ({value})".egThis should, when all is working, attempt to perform {apple x pear} mathematical operation, specifically with apple first and pear secondIn this case, multiplication is obviously not possible: apple is 2 high and 3 wide, and pear is 5 high and 3 wide. I would like to raise an error like:Instead, I get this:I believe I need to define the __name__ attribute within my matrix class, such that when apple.__name__ is called, it returns a string that contains the name "apple". Is this possible? Is this even a good idea? Is there a better coding practise I should follow instead?Thanks
I wanted to mark this question as answered: jonrsharpe's answer in the comments explained it well, and Bryan Oakley added some helpful extra information. Thanks to you both.
