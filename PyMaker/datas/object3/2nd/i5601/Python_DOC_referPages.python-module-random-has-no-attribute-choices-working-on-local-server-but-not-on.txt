I have a script which selects a random number form available list at random.I have been testing it on django's local server and it worked fine but when I moved it to a live server I keep getting this error:Here's my code:How come I keep getting this error? What could be wrong here?
 is added in version 3.6. Presumably the live server uses an older version while you locally use 3.6.See random.choices documentation: "New in version 3.6"
