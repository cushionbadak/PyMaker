Natural Text
Sometimes I need search some thing inside some python library docs that I have installed  and I always use help() built-in function but I would like to know if there are some way to search inside this content or even better, without need to open a python terminal. I really would like to know some clean way to do this (linux based), avoiding pipes or something like this that I already know.  There are some library or external useful to share with us?
