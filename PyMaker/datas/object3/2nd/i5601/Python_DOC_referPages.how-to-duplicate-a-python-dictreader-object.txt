I'm currently trying to modify a  object to strip all the spaces for every cell in the csv. I have this function:However, the issue with this function is that the reader that is returned has already been iterated through, so I can't re-iterate through it (as I would be able to if I just called . I want to be able to create a new object that is exactly like the  (i.e., has the fieldnames attribute too), but with all fields stripped of white space. Any tips on how I can accomplish this?
Two things: firstly, the reader is a lazy iterator object which is exhausted after one full run (meaning it will be empty once you return it at the end of your function!), so you  have to either collect the modified rows in a list and return that list in the end or make the function a generator producing the modified rows. Secondly,  does not modify strings in-place (strings are immutable), but returns a new stripped string, so you have to rebind that new value to the old key:Now you can use that generator function like you did the :
I prefer using inheritance, make a subclass of DictReader as follows:Usage, just as DictReader:
