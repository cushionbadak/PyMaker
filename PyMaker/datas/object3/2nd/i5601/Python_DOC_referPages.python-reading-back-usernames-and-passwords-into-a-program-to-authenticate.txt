Natural Text
I am currently writing a program in Python that asks if you have a log in. If no, they proceed to create a username and password. If yes, they log in and their details are checked against a text file. The text file looks like this (Username then password):I am trying to figure out a way of programming this as simply as possible. It seems to work, but isn't nearly as simple and doesn't really work how I thought it would. Here is the code snippet:Also, how would I go about authenticating the username and password to check it's correct.Many thanks,James Duxbury
Assuming that variables  and  have the username and password provided by the user, then just read the file in two lines:Please read this for the with keyword and this for how to read a file nicelly. Also this about the  syntax.
You could create a dictionary with the user names and passwords like this:after you've done it you can save this dict in a json file, and load its content when the user asks for login.the docs for handling json files with python: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlobs.: it will look simpler, but its not the best way of doing this king of thing
