I have a huge string that looks like this:Furthermore,  is a dynamic value. In the original string, there are 60 occurrences of . How do I format the string so that I can pass the parameter only once?I am currently doing the following:Is there any way to pass the value  only once so that it will take the same value for all other parameters?
Try string formatting (see also PEP):
I suggest using .If you have 60 occurrences of , that also means that you have 60 words in your string. Most likely you got those words from somewhere, for instance from a file, or from a database or from user input.Assuming that you can get all of those words into a list, why not just join the elements of the list, instead of going to the trouble of typing all the words out?For this to work, your dynamic value  must be a string, so if it's stored as a number, you'll need to convert it first:
Basically, you create a temp list containing the values you need (), multiply that by how many times you need it () and prepend that with  so that you unpack the list
This might work for you, if you are using python version 3.X"{100} wants to eat {100}".format(100="result you expect") 
Just a suggestionFirst create a template string in which you put some special character in place where the dynamic value should be. Example : ##hello##string##formattingThen make a function that replace the ## in the string with given parameter using regex.Code
