I am using python 3.5. I am trying to define an array with set of characters. I tried the below.When I run, I get the following error:ValueError: bad typecode (must be b, B, u, h, H, i, I, l, L, q, Q, f  or d)Isn't 'c' a valid typecode for characters? Please enlighten me.
According to the docs,  is not anymore available in python 3.5. It was available in python 2.6 as documented here. You may use signed or unsigned types:: signed char: unsigned charUsing :
You could do  in your Python Shell.Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except  the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified  at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.  The following type codes are defined:
It's not valid in Python 3, but you can use  (signed character) or  (unsigned character). You have to pass numbers instead of strings though. You can convert characters to numerical values using . There is a  code for unicode characters, but it is deprecated.https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.htmlExplanation:All strings in Python 3 are unicode. That means that unlike in C, a single character does not fit into one byte. If you want an array of single bytes, you can use type code  or , but you can't pass characters in to initialise the array (since characters don't fit into bytes).It's easy enough to convert characters to integers on the fly like this:
