I need to evaluate the string before assigning it, so I am using eval. But I read eval is not good to use and instead use ast.literal_eval. But when using ast.literal_eval, I am getting malformed string error.Result:Code with AstResult:Malformed String
 document clearly says:Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and None.
