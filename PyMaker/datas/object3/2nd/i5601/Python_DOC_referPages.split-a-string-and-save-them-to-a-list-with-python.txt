I have a string that I inserted a space into it in all different positions and saved them to a list. Now this list of strings with space in them, I want to split those strings and put the output in one list, when am doing this, it happens that am having multiple list inside:This is the code am working on:And this is the output am getting:What am expecting:Am new to python, I don't know what am missing. Thanks
An alternative approach:Output:Explanation will join the individual strings in  with a space in between them. Then calling  will split this string on whitespace back into a list.EDIT: A second approach that doesn't involve the intermediate variable , although this one isn't quite as easy on the eyes:Basically you flip between building substrings from the front and the back.
First of all, youris a complicated unpythonic way to do the same as this:Now... the problem is that you treat  as your end result. You should instead use it as a source to treat it further:
If you have a list And you want to flatten it, you can use the following:The output will be:You can also make that directly with the  variable:
You coud always use  to split each string in :Which gives:Then you can use  to flatten the list:Which Outputs:
You could do something like this in one line without importing any module :output:
