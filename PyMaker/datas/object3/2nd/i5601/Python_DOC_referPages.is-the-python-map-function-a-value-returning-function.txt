I've been trying to work with the  function in Python, and I've been having a little bit of trouble with it. I can't tell which of these is the proper way to map function foo to the list bar:orI'm getting varied results from different websites. Which of these is the correct usage?
In Python 2,  returns a list of return values of . If you don't care about the results and just want to run the elements of  through , either of your examples will work.In Python 3,  returns an iterator that is evaluated lazily. Neither of your examples will actually run any elements of  through  yet. You will need to iterate over that iterator. The simplest way would be to convert it to a list:
 returns a new list, and does not change the one you enter into the function. So, the usage is:In the interpreter:Note: This is python 2.x
In Python 2  returns a new list. In Python 3 it returns an iterator. You can convert it into a list with:As the name suggests, a common use of an iterator is to iterate over it:This produces one value at a time without putting all values in memory as creating a list would.Furthermore, you can do single steps through an iterator:Now work with the rest:This is very common in Python 3.  and  also return iterators. Often this is called lazy evaluation, because values are only produce when really need.
