I have designed a website using Flask (Python 2.7). I have sent a Python script () to the client using the  function.Now I want to run  on the client system from the server side maybe by using my website itself or my system. Is there a possible way to do that?Note: Client and server are on the same network.Is it possible to write a python script which can run another python script on another system?
exec("input the content of your py file"), which supports dynamic execution of Python code.A demo here: Suppose that you could run Python script on client side=== Server Side ====== Client Side ===
