Given a python function with nested if-else statements, how can we get the path we have taken to arrive to a line.In this case, when the function  runs,  should return something like I dont' want to build the path myself, I thought about using the module  and seeing what is being stored in the stack frame, but I think it will require some treatment to get the path. Is there any easier way ?
This simple method ,convenient for small paths only and user-defined, requires no library .You can create a list and append to that list the corresponding tags for if-conditions( which would append only if the condition satisfies).So any time you feel you can print the list in the order the events happened!
You basically want to trace what happened throughout execution of the function; you can simply use  (read more here) as shown below:Output:The above will produce a  file with the tracing results; or you'll have to play around with strings and/or a list of actions and use that as the path taken.Easiest way of doing it:This is an example; its not scale-able but will satisfy a tiny need.
