I want to understand how to  a function from an imported module.This is where I am so far.app/mocking.py:app/my_module/__init__.py:test/mock-test.py:This does not work as I would expect. The "patched" module simply returns the unmocked value of . How do I mock methods from other packages that I am importing into a namespace under test?
When you are using the  decorator from the  package you are not patching the namespace the module is imported from (in this case ) you are patching it in the namespace under test .To do the above with  try something like the below: The standard library documentation includes a useful section describing this.
While Matti John's answer solves your issue (and helped me too, thanks!), I would, however, suggest localizing the replacement of the original 'get_user_name' function with the mocked one. This will allow you to control when the function is replaced and when it isn't. Also, this will allow you to make several replacements in the same test. In order to do so, use the 'with' statment in a pretty simillar manner:
