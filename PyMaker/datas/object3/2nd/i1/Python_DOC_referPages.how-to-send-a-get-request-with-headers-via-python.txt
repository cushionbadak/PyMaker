I got fiddler to capture a GET request, I want to re send the exact request with python. This is the request I captured: 
You may open SSL socket (https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html) to , write your captured request into this socket as raw bytes, and then read HTTP response from the socket.You may also try to use  class to read and parse HTTP response from your socket, but this class is not supposed to be instantiated directly, so some unexpected obstacles could emerge.
This is an example of how to send a get request to this page with headers.
You can use the requests module.The  module automatically supplies most of the headers for you so you most likely do not need to manually include all of them.Since you are sending a GET request, you can use the  parameter to neatly form the query string.Example:
