So I am writing up a project that checks for errors in email characters. I have searched here without something that was helpful, as well as on duckduckgo. It runs okay, but I am seeing the following on shell:Notice the  function () is kind of taking over space where other errors should be shown such as unallowed special chars?I think there is an issue with my  function that is allowing the  function to take over. Could it be an issue with the unallowable list?Any ideas are greatly appreciated.
In this function the  the code loops over the email address to count "@" characters, and performs checks on the count inside the loop.  Consequently, unless the first character in the address is "@" the function will always return  because the count of "@" is not equal to one.Fix this by moving the checks outside the loop; in fact, the loop can be removed altogether by using Python strings' count method to get the number of "@" characters in each address.The fixed function would look like this:
You are checking for testAtsign() first. Inside the function, if any error is detected you are changing the value of foundError to 'True'. Since the value of foundError is updated to True, all other 'if' conditions (for testDot() and testSpecialChars()) fail and don't execute at all. It is the same with the if statement . The moment this is true, and foundError is updated to True inside it, even testAtSign() will not execute.
