As with regards to python, when it comes to a for loop, will it re-evaluate the upper bound before re-iteration?Say I have the following scenario:Will the  condition be re-evaluated before executing the next iteration of the  loop? (As done in some languages such as Objective-C I believe) As otherwise if a number of elements is popped, an out of bounds error would arise if say 1 element was removed, and the last iteration would try to access .I've tried to investigate this myself however the results are muddled each time. Edit: I believe that my question is different to the one flagged as a duplicate, as my question is regarding the condition for the loop to continue to the next iteration, it could easily ba adding an element instead of removing an element.For clarification, my question asks whether or not the for loop condition will recheck the conditions posed before the next iteration.
The documentation about The for statement is clear about this:The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other  iterable object:for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite                ["else" ":" suite]The expression list is evaluated once; it should yield an iterable object. An iterator is created for  the result of the expression_list. The suite is then executed once for  each item provided by the iterator, in the order returned by the  iterator.[emphasis mine]So, in your case,  will only be evaluated once.
Yes, you can see an  error if you try the following:(You should also avoid using a variable name like  as it will shadow Python's built in .)
Consider the following code:Every time itest()` were evaluated on each iteration.  The output however is :Clearly therefore  is evaluated once.
