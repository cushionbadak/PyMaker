I packaged a class Logger.Then i create logger instance in main function.Then i used this logger in another class file file1.But this log written in log file is "Tue, 19 Mar 2019 05:41:15 DEBUG logger debug 14 Entering with parameter dc_path: /disks". What i expected is "Tue, 19 Mar 2019 05:41:15 DEBUG file1 is_path_valid #line_number Entering with parameter dc_path: /disks"How should i do?
You could eventually use the traceback module:You could achieve that by transforming your debug() method by something like that:NB: you don't need to call the  method each time you call the debug() method, just call it when your logger in instanciated; See more about good practices with logging there: https://realpython.com/python-logging/
According to logging Python official module in the section LogRecord attributes and in order to get the expected log output:Tue, 19 Mar 2019 05:41:15 DEBUG file1 is_path_valid #line_number  Entering with parameter dc_path: /disksYour format log record attributes should looks like this:Notice the change from  to  because what you are looking for is the file name and also you'll obtain: Filename portion of pathname.
Have fixed this problem and don't need to write own logger class.
