I'm trying to mock out the return value of a dependent method but the return value is different between using the  and adding an additional argument to the . Please help me figure out why. I tried searching online but couldn't find an answer to this.library/abc.py:tools/operating_system.py:library/test_abc.py:Note: This example is somewhat contrived because I could mock the  method. That is not the main concern. I'm trying to learn python test mocking and I want to be able to mock . Thanks! This is for Python 3.7.2 but I have the same problem with Python 2.7.15
See the documentation for mock.patch: when you call thisyou're doing this:You're replacing  with the string , so that works as you'd expect.When you call thisyou're doing this:You're leaving  as  so  is set to  object (as the documentation says). Setting  does not work, because you're not calling the function  anywhere in your code, and of course you should not be, because  is a string and not a function.Like you said, in real code you would want to be patching  function instead of :This test is not depending on the internal implementation of  function. If the correct behaviour of  class depended on  always returning  (which is what the tests are asserting), then the class could just as well use  itself and not depend on  at all.A little personal preference for the end: I prefer injecting dependencies instead of patching whenever possible, see, for example, the article "Every mock.patch() is a little smell".
