I have a dictionary in python with several lists, and what I try to do is get a list of tuples (or lists) where the lists are grouped with the same elements regardless of whether they are ordered. For example:I wish to obtain the following result:How do I solve this problem?
The final list comprehension grabs all the key/value pairs from the dictionary and sorts them by the value. It then passes that in to the  function from itertools and tells it to group by the value of the dictionary. The output of this is then fed in to a map function which grabs the first item from each pair in the group which would be the corresponding key.
From what I can tell, you want a tuple of keys where each value is the same.
