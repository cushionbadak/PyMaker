Natural Text
this function is suppose to take each word in the string list and print them as lowercase, (I am doing this by modifying the original list) but I am getting the error:builtins.TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
When you write a  loop with:you iterate on the elements of , which are your words. On each loop,  becomes one of your words, not its index.If you need both the word and its index (and you need it here, as you want to update the list in place), you can use enumerate which will give you on each iteration both the word and the index:
The culprit:The reason:where word is an element in the list, You cannot iterate over a list by its element. Furthermore, there is no such method as  but The fix:Alternative:You can achieve the same using :OUTPUT:
When you write , it expects  to be the index rather than the actual value you are looking for. A better way to achieve this result would be using a list comprehension as follows:
