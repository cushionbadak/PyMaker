I need to return the date format from a string. Currently I am using parser to parse a string as a date, then replacing the year with a yyyy or yy. Similarly for other dates items. Is there some function I could use that would return mm-dd-yyyy when I send 12-05-2018?
Technically, it is an impossible question. If you send in 12-05-2018, there is no way for me to know whether you are sending in a mm-dd-yyyy (Dec 5, 2018) or dd-mm-yyyy (May 12, 2018). 
One approach might be to do a regex replacement of anything which matches your expected date pattern, e.g.Of course, the above script makes no effort to check whether the dates are actually valid.  If you require that, you may use one of the date libraries available in Python.
I don't really understand what you plan to do with the format. There are two reasons I can think of why you might want it. (1) You want at some future point to convert a normalized  back into the original string. If that is what you want you would be better off just storing the normalized  and the original string. Or (2) you want to draw (dodgy) conclusions about person sending the data, because different nationalities will tend to use different formats. But, whatever you want it for, you can do it this way:You mention in a comment you are prepared to make assumptions about ambiguous dates like 12-05-2018 (could be May or December) and 05-12-18 (could be 2018 or 2005). You can pass those assumptions to . It accepts boolean keyword parameters  and  which it will use in ambiguous cases.
Take a look at the datetime library. There you will find the function strptime(), which is exactly what you are looking for.Here is the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
