I am plotting curves using Getdist inside the . For labeling the parameters I have a problem.I write , , , ,  and I have no problem in them and the symbolic shape of them appear without no problem, but as I want to write  and  I get some errorsthis is part of the too long errorThis is part of the related code:I really do not understand the issue, and I am confused.
it's because  is a string literal for ascii character 7 ascii table just like  is for tab and  is for newline.we can check this using the built-in function  which returns the corresponding ASCII table index for the supplied character - docon the other hand,  doesn't correspond to any character.to get around this, just prepend (as in ) before the string like this
