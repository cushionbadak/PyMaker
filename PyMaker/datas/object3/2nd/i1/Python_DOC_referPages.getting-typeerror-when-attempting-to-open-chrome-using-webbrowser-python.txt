I came across another question asking how to open Chrome using , and I wanted to do it for myself.Python webbrowser.open() to open Chrome browserI have a variable saved in the module called I did this so I could perform this code:When I run this code, I get the following error:Why isn't this working? I'm running Python 3.7.
You're using  in two different ways:andSince you can't have two things named  in the same namespace, one is clobbering the other. In this case,  from the  module is clobbering the string pointing to your local Chrome browser.Use different names for each thing, e.g.Alternatively, something like this will probably work since Python already knows about a bunch of browsers (I don't have a Windows machine to test on right now):
I tried and it worked. The differences here are my url and my path. I work on MacOS and so the path my browser is different. Maybe you could check if your browser path is correct? Can you try this path?
