Does anyone know why the output of the bellow calculations returns different results, as it should be the same. returns and returns 
Ok, so let's assemble the partial answers that are elsewhere, and also provide more complete context.First of all, the premise that these should be equivalent expressions is incorrect.   is not  but rather is .Admittedly this is odd.  If you write  on paper, you likely think of the  as part of the number, rather than as an operator whose precedence could be questioned.  And yet if you write -22 it is standard to say this is -4, while (-2)2 is of course 4.Here is an article on the subject: http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/61633.htmlAnyway, that's the short answer as to why they're not the same expression.  Given that, it's just a matter of understanding each expression.could be writtenThe denominator can then be read "the hundredth root of .99 to the 99th power", and then it's just a matter of running through a pain-in-the-arse calculation.On the other hand,can also be simplified, but eventually we're going to take an even root of a negative number; so the answer must be a complex number.
