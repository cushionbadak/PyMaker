What i'm trying to learn is how to allow a user to create a list of names then attach a number to each of the names for the user to look up afterwards. I'm not even sure if Database is the right term for this.I'm able to allow the user to create a list of numbers, but I dont know how to, let the user make a list of names, and attach the two so the user can just look up a name and find their score after they create the lists.
you should start by studying pickle: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.htmlOnce you get the general idea, master the use of sqlite. The raw sqlite please, in order to get yourself exposed to the SQL language. This is not ansi sql but is popular and close enough.Then use some query builder to help you to get able to master your next database.Finally, regarding your problem with numbers, names and scores, try either to use the same loop to ask all the needed information or use more loops.I have a feeling that you're learning python, so you could take the codecademy.com python course. It could save you from a lot of trouble.
If you only want to save temporary this inputs in the list you should do this:EDIT:But if you want to pair values, its better to use dictionaries:Here is run example:
