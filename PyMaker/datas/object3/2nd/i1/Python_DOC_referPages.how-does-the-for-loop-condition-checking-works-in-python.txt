Consider this script in Python :As you can see we will get index out of range error, so I conclude that Python does not check the condition after each iteration because otherwise if it does, when  becomes  the length of list is  too so it should not enter the loop body at the first place since  is not lesser than . So I conclude that Python saves  at first iteration and it checks whether  after each iteration and does not call the  function each time. Am I right ?
range() is a generator function that is evaluated once at the beginning of the for loop giving an iterable:  The for loop then runs once for each item in the iterable. To achieve what you are trying to do it would be better to use  ie.This will work (in python 2 and 3), however, it is generally considered to be bad practice to edit a list that you are iterating over - you might get some strange behaviour if you try to do other operations by index in the same loop so you might also consider storing the indexes of items you wish to delete and then doing the deletions all at once afterwards to make your code more robust. ie.
