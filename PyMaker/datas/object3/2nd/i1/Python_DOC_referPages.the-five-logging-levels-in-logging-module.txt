You'll notice that the  module lets you define additional levels if you need to, and that the missing ones are rather specific to the domains of the tools whose documentation you are referring to."Quiet" is identical to disabling  entirely and a "fatal" error would presumably be one where your Python program has to terminate. If you want additional debugging levels in a particular application of yours, go ahead and define them - though a better approach might be to just use  for everything, and instead selectively enable or disable debug-level  for individual submodules in your system.
