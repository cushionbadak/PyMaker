I have made a program where the user enter's a target number and 4 other numbers to make that target number. Right now I am having trouble to intergrate my tkinter interface to my code. So I am hoping that some one can help meTkinter interface:This is the code that needs to be linked with the tkinter interface:All suggestions will be grealty appriciated
You can store the values for each number in seperate  variables, then get the values of these variables inside the  function and perform all the operations that are in your second code. The code should be modularised with the use of a class containing functions that create the widgets and run the  code. To read more about class-based declarations in Tkinter, read this.
A few things that you can change/try:Keep the "Entry" variables unique. Then extract each number using .get() command.Use lambda in the command options of the Button as follows:command = lambda: solver(num1, num2, num3, num4)And if you want to display your returned number from 'solver', grid a Label in your tkinter window. Then use  to show it in your tkinter window
