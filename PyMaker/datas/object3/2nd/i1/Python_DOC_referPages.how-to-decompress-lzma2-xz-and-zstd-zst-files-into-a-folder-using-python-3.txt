I have been working for a long time with  files. To unpack/decompress  files into a specific folder I have been using the following function: Recently I obtained a list of files with the  (not ) and  extensions. My poor research skills told me that the former is  compression and the latter is . However, I couldn't find of an easy way to unpack the contents of these archives into a folder (like I do with the  files). How can I: Unpack the contents of an  () file into a folder usingPython 3? Unpack the contents of a  () file into a folder using Python 3?Important Note: I'm unpacking very large files, so it would be great if the solution takes into consideration any potential Memory Errors. 
The LZMA data can be decompressed using the  module, simply open the file with that module, then use  to efficiently copy the decompressed data to an output file without running into memory issues:The Python standard library doesn't have any support for Zstandard compression yet, you can use either the  (by IndyGreg from Mozilla and the Mercurial project) or ; the latter is perhaps too basic for your needs, while  offers a streaming API specifically suited for reading files.I'm using the  library here to benefit from the copying API it implements, which lets you decompress and copy at the same time, similar to how  works:
