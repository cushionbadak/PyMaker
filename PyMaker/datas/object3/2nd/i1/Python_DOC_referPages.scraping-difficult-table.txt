I have been trying to scrape a table from here for quite some time but have been unsuccessful. The table I am trying to scrape is titled "Team Per Game Stats". I am confident that once I am able to scrape one element of that table that I can iterate through the columns I want from the list and eventually end up with a pandas data frame.Here is my code so far:Any help would be greatly appreciated.
That webpage employs a trick to try to stop search engines and other automated web clients (including scrapers) from finding the table data: the tables are stored in HTML comments:I note that the opening  has  and  classes. Javascript code included in the page is then executed by your browser that then loads the text from those comments and replaces the  div with the contents as new HTML for the browser to display.You can extract the comment text here:then continue to parse the table HTML.This specific site has published both terms of use, and a page on data use you should probably read if you are going to use their data. Specifically, their terms state, under section 6. Site Content:You may not frame, capture, harvest, or collect any part of the Site or Content without SRL's advance written consent.Scraping the data would fall under that heading.
