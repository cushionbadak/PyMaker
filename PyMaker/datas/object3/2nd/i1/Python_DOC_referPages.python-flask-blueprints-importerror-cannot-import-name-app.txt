I am working through a tutorial on flask blueprints, and the first step is to just to download flask and get initial "Hello World" printed. However when I try to run the initial run.py file I get the following error: My file structure is:run.py__init__.pyI am confused why I am getting this error since from what I understand if app is declared in the init file I should be able to import it. 
This is happening because site is a module within the Python standard library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html). Your module name is clashing with it and the interpreter is loading from the library first, hence not finding the app variable. There are a few ways around this but I suspect you're not very attached to the name so I'd just change it. If you rename your site folder to web (or any other name not used by the Python std library), it'll work.
