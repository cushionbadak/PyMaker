I'm trying to grab specific values as I iterate through a list of dictionaries that contain nested dictionaries and lists.This is roughly what my imported json data looks like(simplified). It's a list of dictionaries with nested dictionaries and nested lists.This is the code I originally had which only iterates through the list of dictionaries. The print statements in my original code above were there to simply show me what was being pulled from the list of dictionaries. What I wanted to be able to do is declare which values I am looking to grab from the top level and second level dictionaries and lists. Here is what I am looking for as output as an example.The value of the first key for each top level dictionary in the list.All the values for the level 2 dictionaries.Or specific values. In this case the value for the first key in each nested dictionaryvalue for the second key in the nested listHopefully this is clear. I'll do my best to clarify if you need me too.
For a specific implementation of Python 3.6 dictionaries happen to be ordered, but it is not good to rely on this behavior. It's meaningless to ask about the "first element" of something unless it's ordered, so the first step is to read the JSON into an .Then it's just a matter of careful bookkeeping. e.g.Output:(This is probably not the most idiomatic Python 3 code. I'll edit in something better when I'm less tired.)
