I have a routine that I run every morning, where I want a sequence of programs to run. It looks something like this. (content of programCaller.py)Everything was working great until a week or so ago. It communicated in real time (perk that I struggled to obtain on Windows, as I am running this on Mac), and if a program fails, it goes to the next one. Now it won't just run from IDLE. However, it works just fine from the Terminal "./programCaller.py". All the programs have shebang lines and permission of course. I have tried all variations of shell=True, executable, stdout and the other arguments, but it won't work. What it does is that it instantly finishes the execution, giving me the ">>>" prompt, as if it was done. And it is not working in the background, as I have tested a very simple program that sends me a mail, and it doesn't do it. Something must have changed and maybe it uses another executable, but it is a silent crash. 
If it's a startup call you should ensure that  is correctly called with the python you want so  I don't know how this works for Mac but on windows I would suggest you use https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/ to create an exe based on .Also if you want to sort of debug this add a  or a  after the  just to ensure the subprocess was created correctly. I am suggesting this because if you have different version of Python you might be missing some external libraries.Something a bit more elaborate would be:if the subprocess doesn't need an input:
