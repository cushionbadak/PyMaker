I am writing a small command line utility for my script and I can't figure out how to properly get the full path from the argument.Here's what I mean.If the user pass the full path, e.g. , everything is fine. But if the user runs the script from let's say  folder and pass the relative path  I get exactly the same string  while parsing the arguments instead of the full path .So, I have been wondering if there is some kind of inbuilt functionality in  that allows to get the full path from the relative path?
To add onto Tryph's answer, you can specify the  parameter in the argument declaration. It can take any callable that takes a single string argument and returns the converted value:This returns a string with the absolute path, you could specify your own function as well:
EDIT: The Alex's answer shows how to make  manage relative-to-absolute path conversion by simply filling the 's  parameter.I do not think argparse provides such feature but you can achieve it using os.path.abspath:Keep in mind that this will make an absolute path by concatenating the working directory with the relative path. Thus the path is considered relative to working directory.If you want to make the path relative to the script directory, you can use os.path.dirname on the  variable and os.path.join to build an absolute path from a path relative to your Python script:Finally, since joined path can contain tokens such as  and , you can "prettify" your built path with os.path.normpath:
