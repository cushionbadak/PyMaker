I have a function in dll file that takes float pointer as one of argument(argument 9: float *result). Here is the python code where I am facing issue:While calling generate_codebook function I am facing argument error in last argument where LP_c_float instance is expected. Below is the error:I went through this question's solution but not able to resolve error.Thank you in advance!
Your nofentry value is a pointer to an array of floats, while generate_codebook expects a pointer to float. ctypes can't do such a conversion automatically, so it has to be performed manually (using [Python 3]: ctypes.cast(obj, type)).Example:Translated to your code:Change nofentry definition to:When invoking , replacewithso at the end it will look like:
