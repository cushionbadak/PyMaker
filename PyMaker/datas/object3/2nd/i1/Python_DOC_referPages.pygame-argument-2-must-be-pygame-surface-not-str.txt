My code so far, the problem I have is that when I enter the sprite from the selection, I get an error stating that the argument must be surface not string. I am wondering how to fix this. What I am trying to do is have the user select a sprite from the following, SP1R, SP1O etcetera. But after I input one of the sprites, the program does not accept it and it gives the following error:
After the inputthe content of the variable  is a string. You have to find the variable with the name, which is stored in the variable .You can get the dictionary with the local variables by the built in function , when you call it without any parameter. This means  will return the object .
