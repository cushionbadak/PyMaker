In the type hint system,  is said to be equivalent to Does this work for multiple type arguments? ie, does  break out to , or do I need to write it as 
You may think of the  library as a specification on how to declare certain types. If something is not defined in that specification then it's always better assume it to be an undefined behavior.However in the particular case of python and typing we have a kind-of-reference static type checker which is mypy. So in order to get an answer for your question, or just programmatically check types, we may use it and see if it shows any warnings.Here's an example:So no,  is not possible in terms of mypy even if there's no trouble declaring it within the  library.Besides from "functional programming" perspective both  and  are two distinct but well-known and well defined monads. A combination of two monads () is another monad, which however behaves differently than  and thus should not be named so.
