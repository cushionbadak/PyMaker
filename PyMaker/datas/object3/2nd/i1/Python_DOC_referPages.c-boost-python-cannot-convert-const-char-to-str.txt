I want to calculate something in C++ and return result to python. This is part of the C++ code:The error when running python script is: After debugging, I found that the error comes from this line:I'm not good at C++. Could anyone tell me how to fix the error? Thanks in advance!
You can't because  is not UTF-8. You probably want  for a copy of the raw data:Using . Or you can use  for a  with the same arguments.In this case, you can get rid of the vector and use  and  directly.Or a  to not copy the data, but just access the s dataUsing (If the vector was const, you would  and only use )You have to make sure the vector stays alive in this case though, but it won't create an unnecessary copy.
