I am new to this field, this script is used to get 80% of data randomly into training list, and the rest 20% in testing list. This script works, but I have a few questions about why it works.If len(data) is 1000, then randn(1000) will generate 1000 random number with normal distribution. What I do not understand are:1)I test myself such as [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]<5 I got an error,because the left operator is a list.But why check=a<0.8 legal, a should be a list of 1000 elements?
NumPy arrays overload the comparison operators to perform the operation per-element, not per container.In other words,will create a new NumPy array  of the same length as  such that:
Well check variable works as a boolean object and in the code the line for that is only an assignation. In other hand, the comparison with two objects have to be the same type.type([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) --> 'list' objecttype(5) --> 'int' object
In contrast with the built-in types such as ,  arrays take advantage of the Python rich comparison system by overriding the comparison operators. This is in order to allow comparison with atomic types, numpy-array-like types, etc. The rich comparison operators return new arrays (rather than just a  or ).Anyone can write a class that does custom comparisons like  arrays. Helpful tip: if you use , you only have to provide two methods, such as,  and : The remaining methods are sort-of automatically intuited when you provide correct behavior for these two. However in practice, to get a class working the way you want, one will often find it is needed to customize the behaviors of the other rich comparison methods: , , , and .
