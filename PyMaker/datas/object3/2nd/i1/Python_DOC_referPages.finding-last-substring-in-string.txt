I'm trying to code a function to find the last substring in a string. I don't want a solution in any other code, I need to do it using my own procedure for course homework.Most tests work, although when testing  in  it fails. I understand why because its starting from a position with only  left, but how can I fix this?
If you are allowed to use built-in functions, you could do this:
Your problem is this line:This is skipping potential matches.  As it is, your code considers only the first, third, and fifth positions for matches.  As you say, the right answer comes from checking the fourth position (index == 3).  But you're skipping that because you move the length of the test string each time, rather than moving forward by only one character.I think you want:
It's because you're increasing next_position with length of found substring thus missing last match.You could also use built-in python function  which will return first index counting from end of string
