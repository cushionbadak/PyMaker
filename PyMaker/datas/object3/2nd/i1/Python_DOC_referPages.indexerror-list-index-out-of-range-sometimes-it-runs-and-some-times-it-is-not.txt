Python list are zeroed indexed. That means the first index of a list starts from . So the indexes for  are . However,  is inclusive, so  will sometimes randomly be assigned .It should start to become clear what the problem is. Since the maximum index of  is , and  is sometimes , then sometimes you will be indexing  out of range. The simple solution would be to use  rather than . However, a cleaner solution would be to use  to choose a random option from :
 produces a random integer in the range  inclusive, those sometimes when it doesn't work it's producing , and  is beyond the list. Change it to , because in Python (and many other languages), a list with  elements' indices start from  and end at . Thus:
Change tag = randint(1,3) to tag = randint(0,2)
