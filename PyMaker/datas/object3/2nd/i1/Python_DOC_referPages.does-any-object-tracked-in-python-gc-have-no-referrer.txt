I planned to validate if my Python 3.6 code has any cyclic reference.Given an object, get_referrers https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html#gc.get_referrers returns all objects that refer to the object. However, the following returns []which means all objects have at least one referrer.I also found https://mg.pov.lt/objgraph/objgraph.html#objgraph.is_proper_module that uses modules as roots.although the modules can still refer to each other... Is this the correct way to find roots?
It's pretty easy to have a GC-tracked object with no referrers known to the GC. For example,No referrers returned. The GC doesn't know about references on a frame object's value stack (except for frames of suspended generators and coroutines), which is where the reference to the  list comes from.Other cases include objects whose only references live in C global or local variables.
