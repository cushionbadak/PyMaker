i have two dictionaries but not the same length. i want to make the length of the bigger dictionary the same as the small one.i use this but it gives me error, i think, because i can't do it to a dictionary like that.it gives me this error: TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'
As already pointed out the dictionary data structure doesn't provide slicing. But you can slice the  in the dictionary and convert it back to a dictionary.
You are getting a Type Error that means you are doing an unsupported operation for dictionaries.Dictionaries are unordered lists. That means they have no order. You cannot say which is the first object of the dictionary, instead this is a set of  and .But slicing () can only be done with a ordered list (i.e. , , ).If you want to do the above operation with your data, you have to make it a 2D list. This can be done very easily with following code (or you can find your own way)Now you can slice your list and do above operation. If you need to make it a dictionary again,  will do the job.
