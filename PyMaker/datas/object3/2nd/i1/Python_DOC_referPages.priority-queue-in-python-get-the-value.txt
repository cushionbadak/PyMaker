I'm new here.I use a priority'queue 'that is instantiated randomly with two types of arrival and departure events, as you can see in the code. I need to check the lowest generated value and check if it is associated with an 'A' or a 'D', using'queue.get 'is not giving.I should at the end print with the help of a'if 'the value of A and D in ascending order.
I do not quite understand your question.Why would you make it necessary to import random and from random import randint?Since you just use 2 functions from random module you couldAs notedthrows an error so I ignored it, as it doesn't seem to matter in this context.An example result is:The first line excluded the list is obviously sorted by the highest value in a pair.If you want to match A and D I recommendI also recommend having a look at the list.sort() functions and other useful list operations here.
