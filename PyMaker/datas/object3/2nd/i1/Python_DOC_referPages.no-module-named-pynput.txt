I am completely new to Python and and still in my babysteps at coding and can't get this thing to work.I am trying to build an auto-clicker as a learning experience, so I use pynput:But I get the error:As troubleshooting I again typed in the cmd "pip install pynput" and got:Just to be sure, I also tried "pip3 install pynput" with the same result. When I am in the IDLE and type in "import pynput", I get no errors. I only have one python version installed.Do you have any ideas what I am still doing wrong?If you need any more information, just let me know.Thank you in advance.JM
You should check the Interpreter the PyCharm uses for your project here:File -> Settings -> Project: %Project_name% -> Project Interpreter.It should be same as where you installed pynput.
There might be one of these possibilities to this problem:The package was not correctly installed. Uninstall it and install it again and see if issue persists.There could be permission issue on the path where the package is installed. Does it have full rw permissions so python can access it? If you are using linux, use  "sudo pip install"If you have installed the package inside a virtualenv and running the program outside the virtualenv, the package will not be available.
You probably have multiple python installations and the one used by pycharm is not the one linked with the pip binary.To solve this issue is it enough to install the library using pip as a module.Step 1: understand what python interpreter you are actually usingthe output is your  (something like )Sept 2: run pip with that interpreterfrom terminal: That's it.
