I have a question regarding installing a python package like pathlib2 for the python interpreter that comes with a software called Nuke for example.In this case the python executeable is located in the following directory Because it is shipped by a piece of software, it looks a little different to your default python installation, at least for my knowledge. For example, I believe the modules are located inside  and I cannot find the typical "Scripts" folder in which pip.py should be. The closest thing I found is  with pip-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl and setuptools....... but so far nothing elseWhat I tried: I cd'ed into the Nuke folder and ran  which returned with the error No module named pip, as predicted. I am sure it is bad practice to change the python interpreter of a software but I have no other option. Therefore I would like to modify the python version as less as possible (like using the pip it comes with if possible, instead of installing a new pip).Second question: does a pip install always install with the compiler for the current python version in mind? For example, this article explained that the module numpy uses c compiled code, which has to be compiled against the same compiler of the python installation.Thanks for the help.
You have , good. First tryto install . Now doYou better remove the second question and ask it in a separate topic.
