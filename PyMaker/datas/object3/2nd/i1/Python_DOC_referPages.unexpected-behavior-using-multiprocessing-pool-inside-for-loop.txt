Here's my code:The console prints out the array [3, 6, 9,...,300] three times with the integers 1,2,3 in-between each array printout.  So i is correctly iterating between lower & upper (not inclusive), but I expected it to print out the array [1, 2, 3,...,100] first followed by [2, 4, 6,...,200] and finally [3, 6, 9,...,300]. I don't understand why it's only passing the final value of i to foo and then mapping that thrice.  
When you run the new process, this is what it sees:And after executing that, it is told to run  (It has to run the whole script again to find out what  is, just because of how pickling it works)So, after it runs that,  will be , and it will return  always.You want to make  a parameter given to , or some multiprocessing specific memory sharing object, as descibed here
Make i local and using functools.partial may solve your problem:
