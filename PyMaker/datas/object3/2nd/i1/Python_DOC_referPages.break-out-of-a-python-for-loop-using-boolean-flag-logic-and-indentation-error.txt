I have the following code that seeks to search the list of usernames, and simply return the output "Found in index i" or "Sorry username not found", on first output. The current code seems to work if the username is right but if erroneous data is used e.g 23234, then it repeats the question and does not jump to the if statement at the bottom of the code (that's what I want).Could someone please correct this code with an explanation on the most efficient way to solve this problem. It is likely something to do with the boolean flag 'found', and I do not understand why it is not breaking out and going to the bottom if statement. Thanks in advance
Do you really need the  block?
You do not need those boolean flags, range based loops or extra if conditions:EDIT:But if you must continue with your current approach of using for-loop, put an else block on the outer for loop and break if found:EDIT 2: (without boolean flags)OUTPUT (in all cases):
Your code will simply never reach the second if because it is designed to only reach the second  if a correct username is entered.You have to decide to either keep asking for a username until a correct one is entered (that's what you are doing in the  bit).Or you ask only once and see if it is found, for that you need to remove the  part.I see that what you meant was probably what DirtyBit did: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55183057
 makes it loop until  becomes .So if it doesn't find the username you are looking for, it loops around and asks you again.Also, if you want to see if a string exists in a list, just use  method:
A better version is this oneEdit on request:
