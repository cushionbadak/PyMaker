Natural Text
I am wanting to output a simple word list from any text document. I want every word listed but no duplicates. This is what I have but it doesn't do anything. I am fairly new to python. Thanks!
 loop basically iterates over , which is string, so your  loop variable gets a single character in each iteration. You would want to use something like  to loop over the list of words.
You can't iterate over the data you read like this, because they are a string so as a result you get consecutive characters, however you can split the string on spaces, which will give you a list of words
