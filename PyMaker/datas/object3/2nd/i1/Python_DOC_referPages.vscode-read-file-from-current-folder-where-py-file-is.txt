I'm very new to programming, and to vscode.I'm learning Python and currently I am learning about working with files.The path looks like this: . The problem: completely basic "read file in python" lesson does not work in vscode because  error raises when running my .py file, located in . But vscode wants that my .txt file I am supposed to open in python, to be in  directory, then it works. I don't like this behaviour.All I want is to be able to read file placed in the directory where the .py file is. How to do this?
Because in your case  is the default cwd (current working directory), VSCode looks for  in that location. If you put  beside  (which is located at ), you'll have to specify the path (by prepending  to the  file). So you should do this: If you want to change the default current working directory (for example you want to change it to ), you'll have to do the following: ~/learning/chapter10/file_reader.pyWith  you've set  as the default cwd, in which VSCode now will look for . For detailed information about  you can read through the official documentation or take a look at this post on stackoverflow.
