Natural Text
I've just started using the subprocess module on Python 3 and I can't figure out exactly how it works.This is a function I wrote to power the USB ports on and off. It works, but then it runs indefinitely and I can't do anything else until forcing it to stop with Ctrl+C. The print statements also never get called:Does anyone understand what the problem is? Could you please tell me how to close the process after it does what it's supposed to?
just use popen
I finally got it to work after trying some different things.I must admit that I don't understand why this worked, or why I had this problem before in the first place. If somebody knows that and is willing to clarify I'd be grateful.
