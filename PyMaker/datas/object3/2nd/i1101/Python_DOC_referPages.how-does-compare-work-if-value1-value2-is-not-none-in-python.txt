I have found that  compared  and if it is True than executed .  andWhere can I find more information about such behavior?It is quite simple, but I expected  to be executed
This is documented in the language reference, 6.10. Comparisons:Unlike C, all comparison operations in Python have the same priority, which is lower than that of any arithmetic, shifting or bitwise operation. Also unlike C, expressions like  have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:Comparisons yield boolean values:  or .Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g.,  is equivalent to , except that  is evaluated only once (but in both cases  is not evaluated at all when  is found to be false).Formally, if a, b, c, …, y, z are expressions and op1, op2, …, opN are comparison operators, then  is equivalent to , except that each expression is evaluated at most once.Note that  doesn’t imply any kind of comparison between  and , so that, e.g.,  is perfectly legal (though perhaps not pretty).Both  and  are comparison operators, so they chain as described above.
