I have a file containing words and another "dictionary" file containing definitions. I want to find the definition for each word in the dictionary and write it out to a file.I looked here and saw an answer that uses Unix/Linux commands but I am on windows and decided to solve in python instead and have come up with a working solution but am wondering if there is a better approach.word_file is not sorted alphabetically, dict_file is.Sample from word_fileSample from dict_file
Have you tried using dictionnaries to find a definition? Sure you could have some memory problems if your definition file is too big but in your case it could be sufficient. That could give a simple solution:You could have a more compact way of defining your definitions. That would give:If your definition file is indeed too big, then you can consider, for example using a database like the  module.
