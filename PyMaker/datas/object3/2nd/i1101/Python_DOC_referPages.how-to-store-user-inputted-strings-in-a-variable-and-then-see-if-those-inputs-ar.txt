Natural Text
I'm trying to make a hangman game. At the moment I'm still trying to figure out how to store users inputted strings in a variable. I need this because if a user guesses the word before the ten guesses it keeps asking them for another letter. I've tried creating a variable and then updating the variable as the user entered more letters. However that doesn't work in cases the user doesn't enter all the letters in the correct order the program is obviously not going to recognize this as the correct word. Basically I need a way to store the inputted strings (one letter at a time) and to be able to check if all of those letters are contained in the five letter word.
With the help of an auxiliar list, this little guy will do the trick (I put some comments to better explain what I did):
It seems like a set is what you need.You start with an empty  and add the letter every time. To check if the letters are enough, use .
All you need is to replace:by:
