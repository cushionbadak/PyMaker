Dear Stackoverflow community,i have the following problem. I am using Python 3.5and SQLite3 package and I'm trying to insert 20 cities into the city table of my database. The problem ist that after executing the code there is no error message but the entries won't show up in the database.My Code looks like thisDatabase.py: this file encapsulates the database and provides the functionality to easily execute queries.DatabaseCreator.py: if you want to try to run my code you can usethis class that creates the database for youDatabaseSeeder.py: this class uses the Database class within its static methods and tries to insertthe 20 cities into the database.My template for createing the final sql statement looks like thisIt gets formatted into the final sql statement hereWhen I print the sql statement before it is executed it looks like thisApplication.py: in my main class I create a new database connection at first and hand this connection over to the DatabaseSeeder class.When I execute my code I don't get any error messagebut the entries just won't show up in the database.When I copy the SQL statement from my code and directly execute it on the sqlite cli it works perfectly fine.I hope someone of you knows what I am missing. Thanks a lot :)
Okay I found a solution thanks to @stovfl. I really was missing the commit statement. Now my execute_query method looks like this with a commit at the end.Thanks a lot for your help and always remember to commit your changes :DGreetings
