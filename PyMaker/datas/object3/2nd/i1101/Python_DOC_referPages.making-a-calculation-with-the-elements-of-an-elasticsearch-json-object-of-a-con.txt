The data is here:The Python code, incorporating recent changes, is as follows. There is no attempt to loop through different boards as my intermediate attempt. This data is just produced by a search all query. which produces, as before, the correct dictionary where the scoring is correct but there are duplication of results and too many lines. Also, there are two instances of "None" and I don't know where that comes from. :The scoring is correct but there are, again, multiple cases of duplication of the same pairs' results. 
This code will calculate the scores.  The code is fairly straightforward.  Rather than iterate over the input dictionary to compute the scores for each pair, the the North-South scores are stored in a collections.Counter instance that keeps a count of the number of pairs that made each score.  This makes it easier to compute the match point score for each pair - we just double the number of lower scores made and add the number of equal scores made, minus one to account for the score of the current partnership. Running the code:Produces this output:
This NOT my work, it is the work of "rvs" but as this is the answer I am looking for I will post it here so that may help others. Thank you.
