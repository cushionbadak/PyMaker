The intent is to show the result of several observations withoutunnecessary digits i.e., to display a value with thenumber of significant digits that is consistent with a givenuncertainty.For example, if computed  and  then theexpected output may look like 123450 ± 1.2 (× 10-3) wherethe following rules are used:the error always has one or two significant digits. Two if the firstdigit is  (ignoring the leading zeros)the mean value is rounded to drop uncertain digits except for thelast one ("stop the mean at the same decade as that of the first significant (non-zero) digit in the SEM"). Trailing zeros are added to display the precision corresponding to the error if necessary.How it might be used in Python:The question is how to implement the  function expressing the rules 1 and 2 above.Note: the terms error, uncertainty are used loosely in thequestion. See the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). Here's a related question for R.
 module could be used to manipulate the decimal representation of the numbers conveniently:Example:The input ,  is reported as 123450 ± 1.2  (×10-3).  And ,   translates to 82 ± 3 (×102) according to the rules from the current question.
