I need to decide on a schema for including binary elements into a message object so that it can be decoded again on the receiving end (In my situation a consumer on an Rabbit MQ / AMQP queue).I decided against multipart MIME encoding over JSON mostly because it seems like using Thor's hammer to push in a thumb tack.  I decided against manually joining parts (binary and JSON concatenated together) mostly because every time a new requirement arises it is a whole re-design.  JSON with the binary encoded in one of the fields seems like an elegant solution.My seemingly working (confirmed by comparing MD5-sum of sent and received data) solution is doing the following:On the receiving end I simply do:My google-fu left me unable to confirm whether what I am doing is in fact valid.  In particular I am concerned whether the line that produces the string from the binary data for inclusion into JSON is correct, eg the lineAnd it seems that I am able to take a shortcut with the decoding back to binary data as the  method handles the UTF-8 data as if it is ASCII - As one would expect it to be coming from the output of  ... But is this a valid assumption in all cases?Mostly I'm surprised at not being able to find any examples online of doing this.  Perhaps my google patience are still on holiday!
The docs confirm that your approach is ok. is correct - base64.b64encode requires bytes as input:Encode the bytes-like object s using Base64 and return the encoded bytes.However  accepts bytes or an ascii string:Decode the Base64 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string s and return the decoded bytes.
