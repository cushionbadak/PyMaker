Why can't I put  in  into a ?Here my code works when using  and can get  instance attributes.When I try to use  not python  to store processes, this won't work. My code:Error msg:I go see the multiprocessing doc:  Returns a process shared queue implemented using a pipe and a few locks/semaphores. When a process first puts an item on the queue a feeder thread is started which transfers objects from a buffer into the pipe.The usual  and  exceptions from the standard libraryâ€™s queue module are raised to signal timeouts.Queue implements all the methods of  except for  and .Here it says "puts an item", this item can't be anything (python object)? In my case I try to put  in  into . 
There are at least two problems with your -based code.  method returns an  object, not a process. You can call  on this object to obtain the result of the corresponding process. With this difference in mind let's look at your code:The second line will always fail in your case. Anything that you put in a queue must be picklable, because  uses serialization. This is not well documented and there is an open issue in Python's issue tracker to update the documentation. The problem is that  is not picklable. You can try yourself: contains some lock objects internally and they are not serializable. Let' move to the next problem:If I'm not wrong, in the code above you want to call  and not . In this case you have to first get your object from the queue and then call the corresponding method on your object. However this is not the case in your code, since  is not serializable.
As @Mehdi Sadeghi explained,  objects can't be pickled, which s requires. However you don't need one here because the queue isn't being shared among the processes. This mean you can just use a regular .Output:
