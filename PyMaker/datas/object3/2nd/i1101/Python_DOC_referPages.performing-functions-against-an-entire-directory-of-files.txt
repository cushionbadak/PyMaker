How do I best run a function (eventually multiple functions) against a directory of files?  In this specific example, I am trying to run the function against each file individually, so it only needs to run on one file at a time.  Long term I want to have scripts that will check for things more holistically, but for now one at a time suffices.In my current case, it will be outputs of network devices.  For instance, below takes an output from "show cdp neighbor detail" on a switch and cleans up the output slightly.The variable "thefile" is used to run against a single file, but I need to run against any different number of files in a directory.  Multiple scripts?  Some kind of os.walk() code in this script?
(or whatever files you want to perform this on, you could replace  by  or  etc.)For more info see the docs on the  module.
