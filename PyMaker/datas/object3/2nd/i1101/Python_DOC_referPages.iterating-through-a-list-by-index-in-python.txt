How do I get the an integer out of the following code so that I can compare it with other integers?I tried using len as following as a replacement:But that's when I get the erorr in this title. I'm very used to Java code so I'm expecting i to always be an integer but it doesn't seem to be the case in Python as it returns the actual word when i try purely try printing out the 'i'?So when i print unseenWords i get it formatted like this:whilst printing out the index i get it formatted like this instead:though i'm expecting it to be more like:123456But how do I get the current index Number?
I think it solves your problem.
I'm very used to Java code so I'm expecting i to always be an integer but it doesn't seem to be the case in Python as it returns the actual word when i try purely try printing out the 'i'?Well, python is not java indeed, so why would you expect it to work the same way ? The behaviour of python's  loop is documented, and you're supposed to read the doc, aren't you ?I tried using len as following as a replacement: Slightly OT : You're not supposed to call "magicmethods" directly (they only are the support for operators - and operators-like functions - overloading). The proper way is . But that's when I get the erorr in this titleYou didn't bother posting the relevant code (which you should have), but obviously you did something like:which of course raises this error - what would be the sense of iterating over an integer ? Here again, doing at least the official tutorial would have solved your problem (notice that it's the very next part after the explanation of the  loop...).though i'm expecting it to be more like: 1 2 3 4 5 6Like the vast majority of languages - including Java FWIW -, python uses zero-based indexes - but  can take a 'start' argument too so it's not really an issue.
You are performing a  loop instead of iterating by index.This is the same as  in Java (as stated by @ChatterOne in the comments).If you wanted to print each word you would need to do the following:If what you want is to print the index of each word then there are some different ways to do it, one of which is the following:
some modification in your code, will give you your desire output. please compare below code with yourswill give you : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6just like in java we doas because the indexing begins with zero
