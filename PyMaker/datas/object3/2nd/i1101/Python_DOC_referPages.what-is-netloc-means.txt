I'm learning to make login function with Flask-login, and I'm facing with this code in my tutorial that I'm following:But I'm not sure what's the code above that I commented means..?, especially in netloc word, what is that..?, I know that is stand for network locality, but what is the purpose on that line..?
From , every URL should follow a specific format:The netloc is what the first level domain (FLD) represents, which comes before the path, and after the scheme. For example you have the following URL:Here,  is your netloc, while  is the path,  is the query parameter, and  is the value being passed along the parameter .Now coming to your code, the  statement checks whether or not the  exists and whether the  has a netloc so that the user could be redirected to  (default) page of your site.
