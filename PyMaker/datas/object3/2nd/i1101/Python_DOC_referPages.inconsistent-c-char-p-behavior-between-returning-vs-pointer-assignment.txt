Consider the following C functions:Now consider the following code in Python:Now the following works:However the following gives  :In the first case the debugger shows  as . In the second case the debugger shows  as .So is this a bug in Python/ctypes or am I doing something wrong?
ctypes automatically converts  return values to bytes objects.Fundamental data types, when returned as foreign function call results, or, for example, by retrieving structure field members or array items, are transparently converted to native Python types. In other words, if a foreign function has a restype of c_char_p, you will always receive a Python bytes object, not a c_char_p instance.If you want the actual pointer value, use  as the .
Finally here is a workaround for this problem:To avoid automatic conversions of  to , set C function's  as :Then  to  before passing to a function that expects  as the common case:
