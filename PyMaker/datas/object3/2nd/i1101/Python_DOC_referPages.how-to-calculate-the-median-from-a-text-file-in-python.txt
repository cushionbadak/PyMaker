Natural Text
I have this text file:There is in the actual file no whitspaces, but otherwise it would display wrong. I want to calculate the median from each categorie. So for example I want to calculate the median from sellerRating. I have this so far (because I also needed to calculate the averages but I managed to do that):I tried to do this:    import statistics    print (statistics.median(averages)But that does not work.Can anyone help me because I have no clue where to go from here?Many thanks in advance!!
to expand on what Guarav recommended, use pandas:  to explain what happening in the comprehension:we go column by column, converting comma delimited floats into dot delimited floats if needed(the apply function), then we get the median of the entire column
Use pandas library for manipulation, because all the code will be reduce to few lines code and it will let you access the content in data frame. For more you need to read documentation, if you want to do by this way only let me knowEdit:Here is the Code
After running your code, I get the following results:Which looks correct for averages, but I believe you want medians, which is very different. The median is the middle value, not the total / sum. The median should always already exist in the dataset. You can instead collect your values in some sort of data structure and find the middle value. An easy way is to use  to store all your data beforehand. The idea is parse your file, add the data to the defaultdict and get the medians with  at the end.Demo:Output:Which now makes sense to be medians, since all those values exist in the dataset.You can also format the above results to be more accurate with the original dataset, but I'll leave that up to you.
