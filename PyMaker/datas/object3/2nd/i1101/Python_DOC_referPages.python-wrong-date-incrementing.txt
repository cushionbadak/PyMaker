When i'm incrementing from 1.1.2012 to 31.12.2012, the incrementing goes well to 31.9.2012, but from 1.10 to 31.12 it is wrong. Here is the code:and output for 29.12.2012 is 29.09.2012, but the desired output is 29.12.2012:http://www.ljse.si/cgi-bin/jve.cgi?doc=2561&subtab=0_2&date1=29.09.2012Desired output:29.12.2012
