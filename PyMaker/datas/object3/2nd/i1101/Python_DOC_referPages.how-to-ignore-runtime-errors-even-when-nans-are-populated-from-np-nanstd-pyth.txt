From the code below, I am trying to slice three columns of dataframe. Put that in a numpy array in an horizontal line then reshape by (no of data/15 and 15) --> Here i attempted to group every 15 data into a row and calculate its standard deviation. I would try to ignore the NaNs in the dataframe even if there are any. Thus I have used np.nanstd.The code is shown as below:An error occurred after executing the code:  I have browse through the Numpy document and I found out that one of the 15x array has got all NAs and returned to this error. I acknologed that and still I want to ignore that issue. Or is there a way that I can replace that NaNs with 0 immediately and then replace that with NaN afterwards to  get rid of the warning?
Consider a 1D-array of all nan elements,np.isfinite() -> Test element-wise for finitenessOutput:any -> will return True if there's any truth value in the iterable.Output:This shows that all values in array are nan.Now, we can replace all nan with zeros like this,Output:To convert back 0's to nan, do this,Output:Now, Consider an example of a dataframe like below,To get std of each row, do this,Output: each value of dataframe is  of a row.
