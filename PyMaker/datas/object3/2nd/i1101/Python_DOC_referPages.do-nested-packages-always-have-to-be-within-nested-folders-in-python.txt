Can someone give an example on when you write the following in Python,  are not folders but files. I am trying to understand the sparsely documented import system with (confusing ?) docs and (less) examples.
Packages and importing are well documented in the Python docs.Packages can be composed in a hierarchy that does not necessarily reflect a directory structure. In your case, package  is importing  which in turn imports . All these packages can be in the same directory.With this import hierarchy, I can import  and walk the hierarchy like thisOr I can import a sub-package from within the hierarchyDirectory structures can be used to organize packages more cleanly. A directory can be turned into an importable module by adding an  file into it. You can do similar importing strategies inside these init files.
