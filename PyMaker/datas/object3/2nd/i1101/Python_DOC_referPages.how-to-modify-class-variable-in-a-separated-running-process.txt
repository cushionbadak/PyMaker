I am trying to write a Python class method that execute for a fixed amount of time and modify a class instance variable during execution if needed.For my project, I need  method in the following code to run exactly 5 seconds (no more no less). During this 5 seconds, I use  to try reading one character from the keyboard and assign it to instance variable . Because  will block the execution of its process until a keystroke is detected. If the user doesn't press any key in this 5 seconds window, let  be .So far, I can only think of using  and its  to realize this 5 seconds "timer" effect. Running the above code, it does take 5 seconds to finish. If user presses a key after program is launched, I expect the print out to be:What I actually see:Apparently, even though   is executed, the actual instance variable . Any idea why and how to modify  if the user presses the a key?
I managed to come up with the following solution using 's shared variable. Using a shared variable , I am able to detect whether user has pressed any of the special keys I would like to detect. Then I manually set the class instance variable at the end of the method to achieve the effect of having  attribute set in exactly 5 seconds. https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Value
