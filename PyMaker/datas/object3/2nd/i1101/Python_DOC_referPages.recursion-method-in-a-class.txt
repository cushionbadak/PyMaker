We started studying OOP and we've got some problem to solve:'all_illnesses' is a method of a Diagnoser class. The variable of the class is a Node which a root of a tree. This tree has leafs which have data of string. We know that every node in this tree has 0 or 2 children. Now, we have to implement the method of 'all_illnesses' such that it returns a list of the string which have represented by the leafs of that tree. The same string can be shown more than one time, so the list have to be sorted from the string which was shown most often.Here is my implementation, I think there are some problems with it:I am not sure about the recursion as I am really bad in recursion.Secondly, I don't know how I can transfer this dict into a list in a sorted way.So,What is the problem with my recursion?And how can I transfer this dict into a list in a sorted way? We must not use modules to solve the problems.
Except for the  typo @Barmar noted, your recursion does seem fine.  Sorting isn't difficult but you need to use a  function that uses occurance counts in  to sort the diseases, and get that back in reverse order:I know you can't use Python modules.  The  class from collections would simplify this code slightly if/when you can use modules.
