Steps to solve this:create an empty listcreate a int  that tells you how many things you already sliced from your dataloop over all elements of your "how to cut the other list in parts"-listslice from  to  + whatever the current element of your "how to cut the other list in parts" is and append it to the empty listincrement  by whatever you just slicedadd the (if needed) remainder of your dataprint it.Doku:Understanding Python's slice notation How to "properly" print a list? and infos about looping here: looping techniques PyTutYou can read about why we do not solve your homework for you here: open letter to students with homework problems
DescriptionThe out is the final output list. The loop iterates through each element in list a (say 'number') and appends a list of that many elements from the start of list b to our output list. Then it proceeds to update list b so that those elements are removed.
