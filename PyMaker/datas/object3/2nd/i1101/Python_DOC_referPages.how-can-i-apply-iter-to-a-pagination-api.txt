I watched Raymond Hettinger's Idiomatic Python talk, and learned about  the sentinel argument to . I'd like to try to apply it to a piece of code I'm working on iterating over an API that uses pagination (it's Twilio, but not relevant to my question).I have an API that returns: a list of data, and a next page URL.  When the pagination is exhausted, the next page URL returns as an empty string.  I wrote the fetching function as a generator and looks roughly like this:This code works fine, but I'd like to try to remove the  loop and replace it with a call to  using the  value as the sentinel argument.Alternately, could this be written with a ?
I think this might be what you meanâ€¦ but as stated in the comments, it doesn't help much:(I've taken the opportunity to put in a call to  which will  for non-successful, i.e. , responses)not sure if it's any "better", but possibly if you're going to be reusing the  functionality a lotNote: lots of other APIs put this  into the response headers in standard ways which the  library knows how to deal with and exposes via the  attribute
