I need to compare two Different IP subnet and show result if it is full match, partial match or no match.I need to use Python.Can break IP into list but it becomes tricky when there is a subnet involved.For example:I need to compare a and b where a = 10.10.1.2/25 and b = 10.10.1.6/24 and show the result. I am new to python and not sure how to achieve this task.
You can use ipaddress module of python (in-built)
in the spirit of helping you figure out things instead of providing the solution, try using (see description here) to break down the IP-addresses into substrings,then  statements to compare them and,  to proceed further.I hope this helps you. :)
Use Python 3 ipaddress library. I guess you need to check if networks of  and  IP addresses overlap. If we construct Interface Objects, each one will have it's own network attribute accessible through .Output:
