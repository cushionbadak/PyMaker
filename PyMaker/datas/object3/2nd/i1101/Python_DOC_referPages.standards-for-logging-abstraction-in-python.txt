I'm a python newbie, and writing a small app which will require logging. I want the app to be portable, allowing other admins to configure its behaviour - particularly logging. The characteristics of the logging lib seem to be controlled by the application code rather than the deployment/environment.Java has log4j, PHP has PSR-3. Is there something equivalent for Python which would allow the system owner to inject their own logging capability?
The best way, in my opinion, to achieve good flexibility, allowing admins to configure your logging settings is to use this config in a  file:After that you can read this configuration in your app:You can check more here.
