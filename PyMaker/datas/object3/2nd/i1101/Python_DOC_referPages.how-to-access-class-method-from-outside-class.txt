This is the simplest example:As you can see, I would like to call  from , but the problem is class methods take  as an argument.I have solved this by feeding the instance of Foo all the way through bar, shown below:This solution works as I can feed an instance of  into my call to . The problem is that need to call  before I instantiate , because the  object is the target of a thread.Here is a more complicated example that demonstrates the problem:The above throws this error:This really surprises me, as GUI does have an attribute called root.
All you need to do is mark the function as a classmethod:
First off, the simple solution, since you rely on neither class nor instance, is to make your method a static method:A class method also works, but it's pointless unless there is some class specific behavior that you expect to change based on possible subclasses (where you'd derive information from knowing the subclass it was invoked with); in practice,  is really only for alternate constructors, and doesn't apply here.Secondly,  does not have an attribute named  in your code example, because you never constructed an instance of , so  was never invoked to assign the class attribute. If you want to do something like that to make a singleton instance to work off of, don't do it in ; do it immediately after the class is defined, e.g.:Again, not particularly useful, so I'd avoid it if possible.
