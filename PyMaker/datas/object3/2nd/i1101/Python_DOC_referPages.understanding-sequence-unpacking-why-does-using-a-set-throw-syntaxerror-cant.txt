I am a python beginner. I recently learned that list and tuple allow value assignment.I am unable to understand this behavior. Why similar operation with set gives error. Also, similar operation is possible with dictionary as well ?Kindly help and explain.
The behaviour you see with lists and tuples is called iterable unpacking, and is used to unpack values from any sequence into variables (as long as there are as many variables on the left as there are on the rightâ€”unless you're using extended iterable unpacking).GivenThe following are all valid operations:The syntax is not supported for sets, however, because they do not have any inherent ordering (at least, not until python3.6). So,Is invalid syntax () because python's grammar specification does not support it.
