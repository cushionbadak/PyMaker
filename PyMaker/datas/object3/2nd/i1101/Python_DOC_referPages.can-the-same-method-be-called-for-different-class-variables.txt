I'm trying to call the same method for a different variable as shown in the code.In the example, I'm trying to get the double of a value by sending the name of the variable.I've tried different approaches and none seems to work:I expect the output to be 6 and 18
You can't do it like this. When you call , the name  refers to nothing, you'll get an error.Even the  and  you used as parameters in  stop existing as soon as  exits, and can only be accessed from inside .What exists, though, is  and . You can access them dynamically using getattr, like this (note that we pass the name of the attribute as a string to getattr):
There are several problems in the codeit's , not as defined  and  are instance variables, not class variableslast three lines are not part of the class definition, so they need to be unindented is poor choice for property name (i.e. it imply that type is float, yet this is not enforced) is not property of the class, but argument to  method. Thus you don't need  when reference it.Although I am not sure what the purpose is, you can achieve  what you want withNote the difference between  and
