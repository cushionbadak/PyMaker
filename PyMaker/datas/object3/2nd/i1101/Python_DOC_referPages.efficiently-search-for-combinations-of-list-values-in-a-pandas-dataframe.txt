I'm iterating over multiple pandas data frames where on each iteration I extract 2 lists.Then, for each 2 lists combination, I need to find the row in another Data Frame where each combination of all values in the 2 lists appears. Simplified example:  The df looks like this (any D_val P_val may appear only once):For a single iteration with the following lists -   I expect to get the following list:    [25, 3, 312, 32]Explanation:   etc.  I implemented it using nested loops, but with multiple iterations, large data frame and long lists it takes far too long.  Any suggestions how to efficiently implement it? I'm happy to use other data structures if needed.
We just using  twice
You can use itertools.product to generate all possible values, then use isin:OutputOr just use isin directly on both columns, for instance:Output
This is a  problem, and is best solved with .If you want a dictionary of the matches, use  + :If you only want the rows that exist, use  for performantly computating the index of the intersection:
