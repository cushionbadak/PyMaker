In Java, it's necessary to strip with , e.g. split( "\r\n") is not splitting my string in javaBut is  necessary in Python? Is the following true?From the docs:Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters  removed. The chars argument is a string specifying the set of  characters to be removed. If omitted or None, the chars argument  defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a prefix or  suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are strippedFrom this CPython test,  seems to be stripping:Anyone can point me to the code in CPython that does the string stripping? 
Are you looking for these lines?https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/e42b705188271da108de42b55d9344642170aa2b/Objects/unicodeobject.c#L12222-L12247
Essentially:Unless you are explicitly trying to remove ONLY newline characters,  and  are different.This all seems fine, but note that if there is whitespace (or any other character) between a newline and the start or end of a string,  won't remove the newline.
