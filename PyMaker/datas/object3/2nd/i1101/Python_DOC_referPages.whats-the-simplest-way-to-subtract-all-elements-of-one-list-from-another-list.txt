Given  = ,  = , what's the simplest way to subtract all element of list2 from list1 to get list  =  It seems sum work well for two lists but subtraction doesn't. To clarify: Order doesn't matter. L2 is a subset of L1. Duplicates need to be kept. Therefore can't use . 
You can try using :Output:Update without list comprehension, using standard for loops.Output:
You could use collections.Counter and a list comprehension:OutputThe list comprehension is equivalent to:The tricky part here is the statement . The  means subtract 1 from the count of  and the return value of the expression is , the fact that  is a boolean-like value (that evals to ) allows to use it a single  expression. So the above or will only be  when .  
This is how I would do it:
