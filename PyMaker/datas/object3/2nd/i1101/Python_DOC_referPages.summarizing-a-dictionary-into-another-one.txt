The  solutiongives you(You can omit  if you wish to perform no rounding.)
Try building a  and adding the percentages as you iterate the original dictionary:Which gives:Note:  is a subclass of , so you can treat it the same as a normal dictionary. If you really want to, you can wrap  to convert it to a regular dictionary. Another way, slightly slower, is to use :
You are going to need to nest in some way to go through your dictionary. Here's with dictionary comprehension:with output:
You could use a nested dictionary comprehension:
