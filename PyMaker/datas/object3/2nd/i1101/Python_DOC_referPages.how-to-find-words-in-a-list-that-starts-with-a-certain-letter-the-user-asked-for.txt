use list comprehension with It is similar to what you are doing but you are not checking the condition like belowTo play safe use  on strings present in list as well
Something on that line. It grabs the word from the list then tests the user input against that word.

You can use List Comprehensions:You can learn more about the power of List Comprehensions in the docsEDIT (inspired by other answers):Using  instead of indexing  avoids problems with empty strings.
