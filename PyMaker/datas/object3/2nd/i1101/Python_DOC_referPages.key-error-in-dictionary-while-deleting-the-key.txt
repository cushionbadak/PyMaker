I am trying to count the string and I want to delete the key with value 1 and 2. I am successfully able to count the strings with below script. If I am adding if loop to the dictionary its throwing Key error 'd' when I try to print it.        Error is belowExpected output{'a': 3, 'b': 3}
If you delete the key, how can you print it? Because the key is deleted, it raises a KeyError as the key is no longer present. Just add a continue when you delete it.
You could try this: Output:{'a': 3, 'b': 3}Actually you don't need to sort the dictionary. You just need to iterate through its elements and check whether the key is equal to one. Then delete this key-value pair from the dictionary.
The  is happening because when you writefor , . So, you are deleting  but in the next line, you are trying to print  which doesn't exist.You could avoid this by using an  clause.Output:
By deleting the entry from the  dictionary you cannot print it anymore; it doesn't exist. You could add an else clausule to prevent this:
Instead of deleting keys, you could always rebuild a new dictionary with only keep keys with values greater than 2:Which also uses  to construct the counts. Using  is very inefficient since it scans the whole string each time to count a character. This ends up being quadratic O(N^2), since it has to visit every character for each character.  simply counts all the characters in one traversal, which is O(N). If you want to delete from the same dictionary, you can iterate over a copy and delete from the original with :Note:  is a subclass of , so you can treat them the same. Having said this, one of the differences is that  doesn't raise  when a key doesn't exist, it returns 0 instead. This can be demonstrated here:
