I need to modify numbers in a file that begins from any number (7 in this case) to begin from 1 and goes consecutively. But if the number in next line is same, it should not print new consecutive number, instead it should give same new number. I will be able to access all these numbers based on column position. The numbers in which I am interested are only in 5th and 6th column.To be more clear My input file has:YYY 7YYY 7YYY 7YYY 8YYY 8YYY 9YYY 9YYY 9YYY 11YYY 11I want output like:YYY 1YYY 1YYY 1YYY 2YYY 2YYY 3YYY 3YYY 3YYY 4YYY 4
This should do the trick! there might be a better way to do this.Hope this helps! cheers!
