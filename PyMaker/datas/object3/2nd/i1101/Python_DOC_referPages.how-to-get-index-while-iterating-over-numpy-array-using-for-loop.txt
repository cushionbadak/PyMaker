This question already has an answer here:Iterate over numpy with index (numpy equivalent of python enumerate)                    3 answers                For python , I could use  to loop through key and value at the same time. But I cannot find such functionality for NumPy array. I have to manually track  like this:Is there a better way to do this?
There are a few alternatives. The below assumes you are iterating over a 1d NumPy array.Iterate with Note this is the only of the 3 solutions which will work with . This is noteworthy since iterating over a NumPy array explicitly is usually only efficient when combined with  or another means of pre-compilation.Iterate with The most efficient of the 3 solutions for 1d arrays. See benchmarking below.Iterate with Notice the additional indexing step in . This is necessary since the index (like ) of a 1d NumPy array is given as a singleton tuple. For a 1d array,  is inefficient; its benefits only show for multi-dimensional arrays.Performance benchmarking
