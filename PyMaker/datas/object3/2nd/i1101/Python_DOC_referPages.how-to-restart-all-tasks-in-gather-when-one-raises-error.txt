I have two tasks. When one task raises an error, I wish to restart them both. Is the following the appropriate way to catch an exception propagated by one task, and restart the gather for the two tasks?Basically  intentionally doesn't cancel the other tasks in a gather when one task raises an error. So, since I can't think of anything better, I manually cancel the other task(s) with  and handle the  myself.I'm just not convinced this is the intended use of the api, insights appreciated.Edit:-In the asyncio-3.7 docs it reads If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.But the behaviour I observe when I replace  with  is that for every iteration of the while loop, an additional  is awaited, i.e. the  appears not to be cancelled by cancelling the gather. The output looks something like this:
The standard idiom to ensure that the tasks have processed their cancelation is to add a  following the cancellation. For example:Note that you might want to do that for all exceptions, not just , because otherwise a task completing with a non- exception will still cause other tasks to continue running.
When exceptions happens  is not cancelled because as you can read in doc:If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is  immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other  awaitables in the aws sequence wonâ€™t be cancelled and will continue to  run.So we should manually cancel  and await it was cancelled:Upd:I wrote  that acts like , but has additional kawrg  to cancel every task on exception in one of them.
