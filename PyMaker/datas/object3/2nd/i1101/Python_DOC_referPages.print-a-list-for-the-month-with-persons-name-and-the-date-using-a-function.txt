Hi I'm learning to code in python and thought it would be cool to automate a task I usually do for my room mates. I write out a list of names and the date for each month so that everyone knows whos turn it is for dishes. Here's my code:The problem is that it repeats everyone's name for each and every day, obviously not what I want. I need it to print only one name per day. Not this:Please let me know how I could correct this function to work properly.
You used a nested for loop, therefore for every day - each of the names is printed along with that day. Use only the outer loop, and calculate who's turn it is. should be something like:assuming your roomates & you split the dishing equally.
The problem is that you're iterating over the days and then for over the list of names. Imagine running line by line because a for loop only repeats after it has gotten to the end of an item. So you've said in your function, for each day each person has to do the dishes which is why you have all this repetition.Much easier would be to only have one for loop, and add 1 to day and to dish_list inside that loop as such Also just to point out, there should be an indent after defining your function otherwise it will throw off an error. Hope this helps
You can loop through both lists together and repeating the shorter with :Update: will pair elements in the two iterables-- object of days and --to create a new list of tuple pairs from the two iterables. However,  only creates a list up to the shortest iterable.  circumvents this problem so  cycles back to through . The for loop will now cycle through these two together, rather than in a nested fashion in your original code.Documentation will probably explain better than I just did: ,
