Natural Text
In trying to prune a preceding and trailing bracket - [ and ] - I encountered something unexpected. In the python 3.7 interpreter:This feels to me like an inconsistency. I am new to Python, so, am I interpreting this correctly, is this odd?
No, this isn't odd:So, an element of  is an integer. Obviously, an integer cannot equal a  object because it's meaningless (how do you compare  and , for example?).Quote from the docs:Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object ,  will be an integer, while  will be a bytes object of length 1.
