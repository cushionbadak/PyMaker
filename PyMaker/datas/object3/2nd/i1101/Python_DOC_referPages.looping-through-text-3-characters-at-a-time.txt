Natural Text
I have this text in a PDF: "John is a french person that likes pancakes, he also likes to play soccer"I want to iterate through the characters in the PDF text three at a time. I tried the below, but I got the error that can only concatenate str (not "int") to str. I understand what this error means, but not sure how to solve this within the code.I was expecting to get a result, such as:Any suggestions, with explanation, will be appreciated. Please let me know if you need more information. Thanks.Edit: I was able to resolve this question utilizing the comment from @slider.For educational purposes:
The code you provided is a misunderstanding of your problem. You have a  which is a , , and you say (in other words):Here you can clearly see what's wrong --  is not a valid index, because it is a  itself ( in the first iteration). Instead, you want to take the indices from the text, and because there are exactly as many indices as characters in the text,  does the trick.You say you want to skip every 3 characters. Well,  accepts a  argument (see docs), so should you provide any , it will skip through the amount of indices that the argument indicates:Now you just have to account for the error you assume when you add a number to the index of a list with a fixed set of elements, as in ...(Note that explicitly saying  is the same as saying )Edit:You say you need text overlapping, so instead of skipping characters you simply need to iterate through every index of your text, again, accounting for the last indices that don't exist:which is the same asAlso relevant.
