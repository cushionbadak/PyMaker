I have a list, and in that list, I have a lot of duplicated values. This is the format of the list: https://imgur.com/a/tj2ZwxGSo I have some fields, in this order: "User_ID" "Movie_ID" "Rating" "Time"What I want to do is, remove, from the 5th occurrence of "User_ID" untill I find a differente "User_ID". For example:Let's suppose that I have a list with only "User_ID" (from 1 - 196) like this:1, 1, 1 ,1 ,1, 1, 2 ,2 , 2, 2, 2, 2, 2...In this case, I have six occurrences of number 1 and seven occurrences of number 2.So, I will remove, from 1, after the fifth occurrence, until I find the first "2". And the same thing for 2: I will start removing after its fifth occurrence, untill I find a new number, which will be "3", and so on.So, I will get a new list, like this: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2containing only 5 instances of each different element.I know I can acess all the "User_ID" field like this: is there a function that does that? Or if there isn't, could someone help me to create one?Thanks for the help!What I was trying to do was something like this:
Your input seems to be a  of  instances. You can use various  to only keep 5 dicts with same  key in a space and time efficient manner:This groups the list into chunks with the same  and then takes the first  from each chunk into the new list.

I am mostly confused by your list of  etc, it looks like you have a list of dicts or objects.If you care about every field you can probably just make it a set then back into a list: if they are objects, you can override  and  and I think you will be able to use the same list/set/list transform to remove duplicates.
