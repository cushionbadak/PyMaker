i have a few tuples containing strings and i want to remove some of the tuples that have 3 or more of the same elements in it. so i need to check if any of the tuples have 3 or more 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D' inside them. how do i go about it? thanks
You could use collections.Counter to count the occurrences of the elements:OutputAs mentioned by @coldspeed you don't need to test all the values only the largest one:
EDIT: This solution involves extra computation, and is less efficient than a  on values. Avoid. Refer to comments for an excellent discussion.You could use a collections.Counter but use the  method of the counter to avoid checking all values in the Counter. (EDIT: However, most common requires a heapsort when passed an argument, making it computationally expensive. Thanks for pointing it out in comments.)
You no need to test all the values. You can test only the largest one.   Output
