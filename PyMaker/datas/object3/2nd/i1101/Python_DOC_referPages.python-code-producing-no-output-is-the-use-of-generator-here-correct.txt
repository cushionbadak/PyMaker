So I recreated the sieve of eratosthenes but the result (prime numbers) is not output as i expected.The first function is the sieve which returns a dictionary with all integers up to a given range as keys and True or False as their values (prime or not). The generator afterwards is supposed to get all the keys with a value of True (prime numbers). I think the problem is that I haven't used the generator correctly (I just learnt about generators), but I can't spot the mistake. I expect all prime numbers (keys in the dictionary with a value of True) to be printed. But there is no output whatsoever.
Here is the corrected version where you directly access the dictionary keys and values by iterating over them using . I have done some changes to the code:Store the user input in a variable called Directly access the keys and the values by iterating over The point 2 simplifies the expression of  in your original code. can be simply replaced by  
Iterating over a dictionary with  yields the keys, not the values.Therefore  is never true.
 iterates over the keys of the dictionary, and the comparison  expects a value. You can fix that, for example, by iterating over both keys and values using :A couple of unrelated notes:you probably want to use a list (or even an ) of Booleans to store sieve data. Using a dict whose keys are consecutive numbers is wasteful.when testing a Boolean value, use  rather than . The latter will give incorrect answer for truthy values other than , such as 1 or a non-empty container. (To test whether  is false, use .)
