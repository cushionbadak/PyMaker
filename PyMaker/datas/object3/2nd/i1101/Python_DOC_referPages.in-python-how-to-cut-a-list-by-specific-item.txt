You can iterate your original and assemble the sublists in a second list:I think that is much clearer then what your code tries to do - your "what I want " is not valid python.A slightly less performant code would be:But you need far mor searches into your list via  and  so it has a worse performace then simply iterating the list once.
 does not return the new list, just modifies the original. That's the reason for your error.To correct your code without changing the approach:
You can construct a list of indices, then use a list comprehension:The ternary statement  is used to avoid an empty final list if the last value in  is . This is a two-pass solution, but uses list slicing as opposed to explicitly appending items one at a time.
What would a question like this be without an  answer?You can use  in this case, with a custom key that counts past occurrences of :
