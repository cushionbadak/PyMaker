I have an OrderedDict that I'm passing to a function. Somewhere in the function it changes the ordering, though I'm not sure why and am trying to debug it. Here is an example of the function and the function and output:Then, if I call it:I get an OrderedDict that doesn't match the ordering of my original one:OrderedDict([('Item[@ID]', '288917'), ('Item.Genres.Genre[@FacebookID]', ['6003172932634', '6003161475030']), ('Item.Genres.Genre.Value', ['TV-Show', 'Comedy']), ('Item.Main.Platform', 'iTunes'), ('Item.Main.PlatformID', '353736518')])Notice how it has "Genre" before "PlatformID", which is not the way it was sorted in the original dict. What seems to be my error here and how would I fix it?
It’s hard to say exactly what’s wrong without a complete working example.  But based on the code you’ve shown, I suspect your problem isn’t with  at all, but rather that you’re modifying  while iterating through it, which will result in items being unexpectedly skipped.Given your use, consider a  instead of a list.
