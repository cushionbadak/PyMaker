I have a list of strings:  and I'm trying to generate a list of all permutations of the elements of the given list as follows:I have managed to write the following code to generate all the forward permutations of the elements of a list:However, this code only manages to generate all the forward permutations:Could anyone help me figure out a way to generate all the permutations of the elements from a list of strings?
You can use the second parameter to ,  to get the iterator you want:To combine the result:OrThis will give you an order different from the one in the question. You can impose the order you want by sorting according to the index in your original list:
The following solution may meet your needs. Your solution is using , and the key difference between permutations and combinations is that order does not matter in combinations, such that  and  would not be unique.Result:
