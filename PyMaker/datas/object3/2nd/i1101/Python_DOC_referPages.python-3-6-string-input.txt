I'm using the Raspberry Pi 3 and controlling three LEDs with Python.I could say I'm good with Python. Here's my code:I have a function called  that takes two arguments,  (g, y or r) and  (on or off). In the while loop,  asks for the color in the console and  for the status.Now what I'm trying to achieve is rather than asking for the colour in a different line and the status of the led in another line, is to combine them two. So for example I'd write on the console:And it would turn on the green LED.I know i can just use an if statement like:But I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
Use string.split():If invalid input is given, this will  to ask until inputs are valid.See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response for more ideas on input validation.Unrelated - but you can optimize your -function:by using a lookup dictionary: see dict()
This approach might help. By taking two inputs with a space in between. You can split the input based on a space or any other character. It will then place the color and state into two different variables.Alternatively, you can also use comma or any other character as a separator between the color and state.
 will be able to split your single line input into two (or more) variables:
