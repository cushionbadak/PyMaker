I am trying to remove an item from a listbox that is connected to a function from my checkbutton. I would like the item to be removed when I unselect it.In another post, it was suggested to do something like this:but it says that Listbox has no attribute in ItemsIn addition, I do not know the index number, since it changes due to the order in which I select the different checkbuttons.Thanks for any help!
Question: Remove Item from Listbox Python, if I do not know the index numberDocumentationsPython Documentation - Common Sequence Operations Note: (8)  index raises ValueError when x is not found in s. Not all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using s[i:j].index(x), only without copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice.The Tkinter Listbox Widget - get(first, last=None) This function returns the string corresponding to the given index (or the strings in the given index range). Use get(0, END) to get a list of all items in the list.Get the index of a  Item using it's label stringDelete the  Item at this indexTested with Python: 3.5 - TkVersion: 8.6
