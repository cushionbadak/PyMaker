I guys, im a noob on the programming world and im putting my best to learn Python. Im stuck with this problem right now:"Make an algorithm that verifies if a certain value is an integer."Now the problem is that the INPUT function returns the type in string. If I cast the variable to FLOAT it stops me from reading the integer numbers. What should i do?
You can try to covert the string input into an integer or float:Output: Doku:ExceptionsException handling
You can use  and  for this (you can give it a look at Errors and Exceptions. Try turning the  into an , and write the corresponding print statements depending on the result:
If you want also input like  to be recognized as integers (so all whole numbers, instead of all values of type ), just calling  on it is not enough, since  cannot parse that string.Another way to determine if a value is a whole number is to see if there is a rest if divided by one, so you can use the modulo operator :
If you donâ€™t want casting and error handling. You can use ast.literal_eval that transform string to Python objects and isinstance, which comes with Python, to solve your issue.
