Using Below given python script, I am trying to copy a text file and trying to create 10 copies of the same file as shown below:Basically i need to increment only the number present in destination text file name.I have tried using "for loop" with range command. But I dont know how to increment a number inside a cp command.
Since the  command-argument contains a string, you can just change this string in a while-loop.
It should be as simple asThere's no need to create a class to carry out such simple functionality. Also, copying files can be done using the  module directly rather than creating a subprocess to do so.More information about : How do I copy a file in Python? Edit:alternate code as per Bruno's suggestions:
The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided which support file copying and removal.
You should use string formattingoutput
The other answers are good, but you can also do this the old fashioned way:You can simply iterate over  to get the numbers 1 - 10, excluding 11. You can have a look at  for behavior specifics. Addtionally, as pointed out in the other answers, the good thing about  is that it avoids the need to open files, as shown above, and you can copy the content over directly with no issues. Having said this, the source code does still open files under the hood, so I guess that's something to consider.
