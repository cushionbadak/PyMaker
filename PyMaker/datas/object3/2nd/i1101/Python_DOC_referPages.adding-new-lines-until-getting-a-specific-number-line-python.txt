I have large number of files with different line numbers and same column numbers(17 columns) in a directory. I want to loop through all the files and perform the following operation. If number of lines in file is smaller than 100 Add new lines with value(0.00 0.00 ...) with same column number (17) until file has 100 linesIf line number between 100 and 200, then repeat step 2 but upto 200 linesthe code below but I don't know what I have to write in the if statements to get actual resultsthanks.
If you care for a bash implemented solution, you can look into this  scriptThis fills up the file with zeros if #of lines is less than 100 or the number of lines is in between 200 and 100. Put this into a file ( say script.sh ). Don't forget to  this
