i just wrote this dungeon and dragon mini game, It's not completed yet , i didn't write the dragon function or the function to show an error when the user hits the wall. I just want to move the player " X " how many times i want , but i can't.this is the code : as you can see, i just can move the X one time , but i want to be able to move it as many times as i want and i don't know how , i should write a while loop i guess? i tried but i failed and I really need your help . thanks 
When you run the lines:It asks for the user input only once as Patrick Artner commented you need to use loops within your script.If you surround that script with  it should let you continue to move:You should use  rather than  because it updates with the previous movement.Although this is unrelated to the question I feel these changes will help your code for the future. Firstly, I would recommend adding  as a temporary way to exit your game. Secondly, rather than writing out the dungeon variable use list comprehension to create it .The Full Updated CodeHope this helped.Here is a simple explanation of the table for future reference:
