These two functions seem to return the same values when it's called. But, I was wondering if number 2 can raise errors in some cases? Is it bad practice to do it?Number 1:Number 2:Thanks for sharing your knowledge!
You don't need the  statement either, just return the result of the  operator: Regarding the original question, the two functions are equivalent. However, the second form is more concise and slightly more efficient since it doesn't require the interpreter to load the default return value for a function, which is . You can disassemble the function objects using  and check the bytecode:vs
These 2 functions do exactly the same thing. Actually it is a good practice not to use elif if it is not needed.
What you are in the second approach is actually more read-able and (arguably) more pythonic. This approach is very helpful when writing functions that can make decisions pretty early like:This makes it pretty easy to understand over adding another . Read more about early returns.
