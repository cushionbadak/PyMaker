Natural Text
I was wondering how I can have a changing variable from a function.I attempted:before realising that I needed to run the  variable again which I'm not sure how to do.I intend to call this text by running something along the lines of  which doesn't update after running I then tried:What I didn't know was that the return function preserves its value so when I ran   it displayed the same text twice.
I think you want something like:This makes  a dynamic property that will be re-computed each time  is retreived.
