Natural Text
I have this following line of code for which I'm not quite sure the output would be. I have found out that  has the first index as an empty string. I think this means add  to the  but not sure why do I need  for? I'm using python 2.7. Thanks!
 finds all the occurrences of  in .The string is in this case built by using  and result in one big string with all list entries from  joined by a space.You need this space because otherwise all paths in  would be joined together into one big path string...
the  part joins the paths into one string delimited by  then the  parts in your regular expression in  matches this whitespace delimiter as well. so you can do this instead:in case your paths also have whitespaces (this is better):
Should actually rather than concatenating the pathnames and then matching should match on each pathname seperately:If you want strings and the locations of the matches in each string that has a match one could useBoth of these are safer as they don't assume an in-band delimiter.
