I'm trying to send a dictionary into a function that caculated the average, I believe my function is good but I'm having trouble with sending the dictionaryThe output should be 100 that goes into "result"

Drop the asterisks and use  on the dict
Pass your dictionary directly, not via the  dictionary unpacking operator. Do the unpacking within your function instead: iterating  gives key-value pairs, but here you can use .Also, never shadow built-ins. So don't use , , etc as variable names.This would work:You can also use the built-ins  and :Or use :
You cannot use the following statement with a dictionary:instead there is a way to receive a list of the keys or the values of the dictionary using the methods keys() or values() respectively. these methods return a list of the dictionary keys or the dictionary values and then you can iterate over them. Also there is a method which returns a list of tuples of key and value - items().So any of these should work for you:or:
Just try:
Dont use keywords as variable names, such as  or . You can send your whole dictionary, and iterate over the items:Note that the avg is 100.
