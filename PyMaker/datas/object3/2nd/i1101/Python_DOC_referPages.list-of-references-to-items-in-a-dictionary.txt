Is there a way, in python, for me to create a list where each element is a reference to an element in a dictionary? This way, I can maintain a sorted list, while also being able to change the value by indexing into the dictionary.
You mentioned Python in general. You could use a dataframe:Outputs:
Try this:Note that you would have to call  each time...Also, it returns a tuple of pairs (key, value) sorted with their keys. If you wanted to access say the 3rd value, do . The  for the third pair, the  for the value.
The dictionary keys are references to particular entries in a dictionary. A function to generate a list of dictionary keys in the order of the dictionary entry values is:so to access the smallest price in your example:The problem is that you have to recalculate your ordering on any insert, change or delete of the dictionary. These would be hard to intercept so better to keep control and recalculate the ordering just when you want to use it.You could bury all this in a  that overrides the get function of a dictionary.
