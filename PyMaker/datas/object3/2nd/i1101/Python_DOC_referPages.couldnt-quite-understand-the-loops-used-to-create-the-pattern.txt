Can someone explain the loops used here?
 will run the loop 5 time ( being 5), with  being 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.  will also run the loop 5 times, but now backwards ( being the step argument, meaning 'minus 1' every step. So  wil be 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. The function is defined as . Start is the startnumber of the range (if not specified, it will be 0). Stop is the end of the range, but is not included itself. The 'step' is the size of the steps (default is 1).  will for example give you 2, 4, 6 and 8.
