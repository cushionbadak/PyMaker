I am using python for more than 1 year. One question strike in my mind, how the random values are generated, there is some specific mechanism through which particular value should be selected by system that appears to be random to user. In all programming language how it is generated? Does all have the same mechanism? 
Usually the OS provides a source of (pseudo) random data. For example on Linux there are  and .Some random functions in programming languages use that, other are based on a seed value and generate more or less reproducible values from it.The  module in Python used a seeded approach. For use-cases that require more randomness use the  module. I uses the OS random sources.
