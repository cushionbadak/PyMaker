I am reading a csv file using  to form a dataset, and then I use the command  to form another dataset with just one element, but still it returns all elments.What is wrong here? I brought the code below:
Based on this answer we can split Dataset with  and :How to fix your code?Instead of creating the iterator multiple times in the loop, use one iterator:What happens in your code that causes such behavior?1) Built-in python  function gets an iterator from an object or  the object itself must supply its own iterator. So when you call , it is equavalent to call .2) By default, in  the shuffle argument is True (). As a result, each time you call  it creates new Iterator that contains different data. 3) Finally, when looping through by  it is similar that you create 10 different Iterator with the size of 1 that each one has its own data because they are shuffled.Suggestion: If you want to avoid such things initialize (create) iterator outside of loop:
