Natural Text
Currently, in Visual Studio Code (under Windows 10 64bits), at a Python file called , if one clicks with mouse right-button for context menu and then chooses 'Run Python File in Terminal', an integrated CMD terminal is open and file is automatically run there with:After the file stops running, one is naturally left at the integrated CMD cursor.This behavior is quite different, for instance, from what one has with an IDE like Spyder. There, when you run code (e.g. with ), at the end one is left still at the Python cursor and can access content of variables created when code was run.Is there a way to achieve a similar behavior in Visual Studio Code?
Yes. Open a terminal window and it's like a terminal window on your computer. You can type  and the python script will execute like it does from the command line. 
The closest you can come is to run the code under the debugger and set a breakpoint at the end to pause the exiting of the execution. Otherwise feel free to file a feature request at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python.
