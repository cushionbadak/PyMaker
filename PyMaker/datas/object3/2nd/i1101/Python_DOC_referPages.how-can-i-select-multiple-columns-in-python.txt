This question already has an answer here:How to select dataframe columns with lists and ranges combined                    1 answer                I'm working on a dataset (Rows:5000 and Columns: 60).I want to read some of the columns which are related to my analysis but the code doesn't work.Column 1, column 5, columns 22 to 28 and columns 47 to 54.I've read the manual and it seems just I can select the number of columns one by one or range not both of them. Could you please let me know how can I solve this problem?
