This question already has an answer here:What does Python's eval() do?                     10 answers                I am a newbie developer. I have used the code below but I would like to understand how the last line works, can someone please explain to me the last line  of the code?
eval evaluates python code or lets Python program run Python code within itself.example: when you return the followingwhat you basically doing is this( for example if you are computing power(2,5)):But as you can see there is an extra "*" at the end. To remove this one we use [:-1]. what this basically doing is select all except the last one. ":" basically means all.so the final expression to be evaluated is . which is 2^5.
is equivalent toit'is equivalent to (really better ;-) !) :
A terrible idea, as others have said - if you're a newbie, consider finding a better guide! reads a string and evaluates it as if it were not (as if it is not in quotes). So we construct a string of  (ie a^b), and ask Python to read it, then return all but the last character. Pretty pointless but there you go.
 is never a good idea to use. Read about its dangerous behaviour here.You just need  operator which is equivalent to  (raise to) operator you see in other languages:
The best way is to use  for computing power. However, if you want to use eval then consider joining the string in this way: . In this, str(a) will convert integer  to string  then  will repeat the   and finally the  will join all the 's together with  in between and create a string something like .  will then evaluate the string as if it is an expression.
