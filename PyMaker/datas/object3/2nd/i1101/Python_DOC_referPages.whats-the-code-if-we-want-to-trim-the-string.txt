I am kind of noob in python and struck in middle of code. I want to trim my string.For example- my string is "bangalore store 1321" and i want to trim it to "banglore"  
Looks like you want to keep the first word (which is not "trimming" though). So you do two thingsbreak the string into a list of words (where "word" is something separated by spaces)take the first element of that list
For a slicing answer:You can also use , by definition, this splits by spaces, if any other delimiter needed, you can identity it inside the split arguments This function will return an array of strings.  Choose whichever you want from this array
Output
You can use str's partition method to avoid creating a list like str.split takes one argument - the separator - and returns the parts of the string before and after the first occurrence of the separator.
