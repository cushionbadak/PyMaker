How can I read the properties/metadata like Title, Author, Subject, Last modified and Keywords stored in a xlsx file using Python? I've used xlrd library however, there are no such properties to extract theses entities. Any Help is appreciated

You should be looking at  library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html because the metadata are stored above the contents of your file level.Example:  gets you the last modified time.
