For some silly reason, the below works on creating the non-existing directory stored in , but not the non_existing directory stored in . The latter results in a FileNotFound Error with description "[WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'runpackage1\calculated\logs'"Am I missing something really stupid here? I also tried inserting an os.path.abspath around the path to get from relative to full paths, but that didn't help either.Edit: changed directory from path as some people rightfully pointed out. I actually copied code from two separate functions into one self-contained block here, hence introducing the error. It's not the issue that caused my problem.
Not able to confirm your bug (https://pyfiddle.io - 3.6):Output:Creating the mcve fixed your problem.You also do not need the guard  - it is not needed because if the directory already exists - using  won't change that provided you give .Fix:
The given code has no errors, you fixed it.
