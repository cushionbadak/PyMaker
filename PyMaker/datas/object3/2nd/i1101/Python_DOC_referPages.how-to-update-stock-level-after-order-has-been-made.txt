I am practicing using databases in python with sqlite3. I am creating a stock management system for a shop and I have a product table with fields: ProductID, Name, StockLevel.I am struggling to update the stock level when a purchase is made. So the stock level for a specific product should be subtracted by the number ordered.My code:sqlite3.OperationalError: near "%": syntax errorWhy is it giving this error? 
Use  as your placeholder based on the documentation for sqlite3.
You need to use two placeholders for both of your variables and properly parameterize your query (beware of SQL injections!):Notice how query parameters are passed to  separately and how we have 2 placeholders in the query itself.
