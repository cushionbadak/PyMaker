I'm trying to create a function that creates a dictionary, given a list that will be inputted.I thought by using a for loop, i could take the list, create the key, and then use the loop to input the values for each item of the list.Using this list as an input:This is only returning one key, value pair.It looks like dictionaries don't create multiple values, and so that is why it only returns one and doesn't go through the rest of the list.When I change , it will create all the key, values, but key and value are both the name.When I change , I get the key, value reversed, but it returns all 4 items in the list.
For the answer you want (based on my understanding of your question), I am not sure why you were using for loop. You don't need for loops in your function. Just a simple assignment will do the job. You unnecessarily complicated it.
You may set the default value as an empty list  for a key For the given example, it is okay not to use the  loop(as answered by @Bazingaa) if you want to assign all the names to the key . On the other hand, if you want to selectively assign the names then use  loop.Output
