Natural Text
For a class, I need to extract everything that comes between the element  ...  and I'm trying to do this via Python instead of wasting hours doing this by hand (it's well over 400 lines). What I have right now in ways of code is this (a code that I found online and changed a little so that it doesn't print the line number): The only problem I have with this is that it prints the  and  in the results, which I don't want to happen. I've tried to create groups (which you can see in my usage of parentheses in the pattern variable) but I have no idea how to manipulate the code to return just group 1 (I've tried many different ways). 
Here's something that will print all the tagged text in each line without the tags:The important modification was changing your regex from  to â€”note the added  after the . This is called making it "non-greedy" so it doesn't match as much of the remaining text as possible (the default "greedy" mode). This is discussed in greater detail in the Regular Expression HOWTO section of Python's online documentation.Another significant change, regex-wise, was to use  instead of .I also removed all the parts of the code dealing with line numbers since you mentioned you weren't interest in that information.
You need to use  and a . The  and  in your regex consumes some text so you see them in your results, but the lookahead and lookbehind just checks if  and  are there respectively without consuming any characters. It only matches those strings.Tl;dr:  lookahead and lookbehind matches string in  and not the tags.So your regex should be like , this should be fine.There is some documantation here
You can use BeautifulSoup for this.Also the regex can be:http://tpcg.io/B6h2So
