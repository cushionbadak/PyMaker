I'm trying to solve Leetcode 104 in python: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/ The code comment suggest the input type is TreeNode.The test case:  root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]I'm confused about the type of the input. Is the input type a list or "TreeNode"? Is TreeNode even a type? How does it differ from list? How do I get the len(root)? Because there is null there, I couldn't get use len(root). Of course i could turn null into a string "null", but that feel very hacky. (I wanted to use geometric progression to solve the problem. that's why I need the length)This is the code I wrote. Using Geometric progression. S = (a1*(q**n) - a1)/(q-1) when q != 1. The result is using my hacky way which is turned the null into the string "null" and treat root as a list type.  
Yes  is a valid type. And it is entirely different from a list. You get the definition of the  type in a comment on the top of the page. It has a value (self.val) and a left and a right cildren, which are also  (altough it is not explicitly stated, this is the definition of a binary tree).The  function calls the  method of the argument. It is probably not implemented on the . PS. You are mistaken when you try to solve the exercise uing the list as the input. You are expected to use the given  type.
If you activate the  code type for the answer, you get this comment: is just a linear description of that tree, where  is the first node, with the leaves  and , then  has the leaves  and again  (so, no leaves) and  has the leaves  and . But it makes no sense to give you the definition of the  and to let you take the parameter , if they would want you to parse the linear tree description into the  form.So your task is, to travel down your  and  recursively and record the maximum depth.PS: The question does not change if you select a different programming language so I infer, that they mean  in a symbolic way where it is implemented as  in Python (especially since  and  are by default  for the  implementation).PPS: The said linear tree description works like this:You first name the root element of the tree After that, you make a snapshot of the current tree and name all yet unnamed leaves from left to right. If one leaf is empty, you just call it  (Python specific: ).You repeat 2 until there is no unnamed leaf left
