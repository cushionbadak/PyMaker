I am trying to run multiple Yolos in parallel in Python.I have a function that I am trying to use as the worker. something like this:You can find darknet file here.Let's don't talk about the way I convert the array to a ctype array. it has been discussed here.If I run this function as a normal function works like a charm. But if I run it as a worker like this:it goes all the way down to the last line then it gives me this error:I couldn't figure out why exactly this error happens.can anyone help?  what's the difference between these two way of using this function that cause this problem?
Thanks to this I found the problem is that you can't share the context in CUDA between processes with different PIDs which makes sense. So I found that if I run related things (in my case, ) in the same process then it works okay. before this I was loading weights before I start the worker.
