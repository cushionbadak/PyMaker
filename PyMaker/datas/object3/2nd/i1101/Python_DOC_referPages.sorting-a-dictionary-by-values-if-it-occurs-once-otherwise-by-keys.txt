I have this dictionary and I need to sort the words by value. But when two or more words have the same value, I need to sort those words by alphabet but I don't know how to do that. Can u help me?Thank you in advance
Using , you can construct an ordered mapping which still has the benefits of a dictionary, such as O(1) lookup.Since you are using both key and value for ordering, it's good practice to sort using tuples from . In addition, use  for case-insensitive ordering.Finally, never shadow built-ins such as . Use  or  instead for variable names.
Utilize the fact that  compares its lements one-by-one.Also fixed that  shouldn't be used as a variable name - it's a built-in type.
Use : Note: this assumes that everything should be lowercase, as python sorts uppercase words before lowercase words.Also I renamed your variable to  because  is a builtin.To breakdown what’s happening: on a dictionary returns the keys sorted by a function  supplied (default is direct comparison of the keys)To sort by value, use :Then we have to sort by the key in case of a tie. Because python compares its tuples one-by-one, we can construct a tuple of  and it will compare the items, then if they’re the same it will compare the items.
You can try this:
