I'm writing a mathematical model in python, the model has ~20 input parameters that i'm storing in a separate file. I Have multiple cases that I would like to evaluate/modify.Each case is a ".py" file that holds variables and a few simple functions. What is the bast way to import them into my main Code?So far i've been using "from CaseName import *" to import all the variables and functions from the case. However this does not lend itself to allowing for looping over the cases. I've looked at using importlib but some sections of my code require that the imported variables are global. Are there any other alternatives?Here is a simplified example.Case1.py:Case2.py:MainCode.py:
Use classes:If you start littering your environment with globals, it's probably an indication you should be using a class. If any of your models share a significant number of attributes (input parameters) or methods (functions) then look into extending your classes with inheritance. For instance, if your  function is always the same, it might be more efficient to create a parent class that contains it as a method and then inherit from that to make your individual cases, like so:
