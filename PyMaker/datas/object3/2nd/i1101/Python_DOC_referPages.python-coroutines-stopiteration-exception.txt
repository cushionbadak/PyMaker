Your coroutine exits after first send/yield. That generates a  and you cannot handle it in the coroutine itself, but only when invoking . From the docs:The send() method returns the next value yielded by the generator, or  raises StopIteration if the generator exits without yielding another  value.I guess you want to keep the coroutine alive accepting as many sends as you want until an explicit close:Please note that now the  exception is caught.
