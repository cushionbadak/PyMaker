I'm writing a program and I need to import a method first.But when I type what I did in above it sends an error and says can't "".I tried 2 other different codes but they didn't work either.I know that  is a name and can't be imported but what can I do to solve this problem and have it worked?
You need to use  to get the module in a dynamic way (using a variable content as name)Then, you need to use  to get the function within the module.Thx to Patrick Haugh and his comment
