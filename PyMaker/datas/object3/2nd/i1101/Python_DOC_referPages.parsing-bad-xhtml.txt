Natural Text
My new project is to extract data from the Naxos Glossary of Musical Terms, a great resource whose text data I want to process and extract to a database to use on another, simpler website I'll create.My only problem is awful XHTML formatting. The W3C XHTML validation raises 318 errors and 54 warnings. Even a HTML Tidier I found can't fix it all.I'm using Python 3.67 and the page I'm parsing was ASP. I've tested LXML and Python XML modules, but both fail.Can anyone suggest any other tidiers or modules? Or will I have to use some sort of raw text manipulation (yuck!)? My code:LXML:Error:Python XML (using the tidied XHTML):Error:
Lxml likely thinks you're giving it xml that way.Try it like this:Also instead of "HTML Tidiers" just open it in chrome and copy the html in the elements panel.
