I have written the following python code using a scipy function. The particular form of function  is irrelevant. What kind of object is ? I would like to store it in a file and evaluate it later as for example below. What is a good way to store the object  in a file? 
Your object  is an instance of the class . If you want to store the complete object to file, then you could use the  module from python's standard library.Pickling an object and writing it to a (binary) file is quite straightforward:Later loading the object again from file is equally straightforward:Pickling does have a few disadvantages that are worth mentioning. Firstly, the pickle file that you write is not human-readable. Secondly, pickle files received from an untrusted source should never be loaded because of security risks.
Given that you know  and have access to , I would posit that the simplest thing to do would be to just store  and . This would avoid many of the pitfalls of a binary dump and allow you to store in a text format.To store, you could use  to store the data:You can then have a simple loading procedure based on :This solution produces a very human readable text file with two columns of data, corresponding to the matching entries of  and . The file is completely portable and editable. It is language independent, all at the cost of one extra line in the loader.
You can consider pickle for Python specific object serialization. Otherwise, you have to consider a  or  format. Visit the link to understand more
