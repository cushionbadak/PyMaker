I'm using Python in Jupyter Notebooks to work with a CSV file. I'm writing the same code in two different versions of Jupyter Notebook--one that's running directly on my computer and another that's running off a kind of emulator within an online lesson from Dataquest. When I open the CSV file and read it into a string on my computer's Jupyter Notebook, the EOL character is  but when I do the same on Dataquest's emulator, the EOL character is . I have two questions:Why does this happen?How can I write a Python code that tests for the EOL character without opening the file to find out visually?This code in in a Jupyter notebook on my own Mac.This code is on Dataquest's Jupyter notebook browser emulator.This is a few lines of output from my computer when I run  (note the EOL character is ).This is a few lines of output from the Dataquest emulator when I run  (note the EOL character is ).
Without any indication of how you downloaded or otherwise made the file available to Python and Jupyter, we can't really tell why this is happening.  Line endings are platform-specific but Python 3 should generally neutralize differences between platforms unless you specifically request opening a file as "binary".You can discover the line-ending conventions by simply opening the file and reading enough of it.  What's "enough" depends on the file type.  Perhaps something like this in your case:This doesn't attempt to do any statistical analysis, but might work well enough for your limited case.  The file will be closed again after the end of the  block so you can then just open it a second time with the parameters you actually need.
