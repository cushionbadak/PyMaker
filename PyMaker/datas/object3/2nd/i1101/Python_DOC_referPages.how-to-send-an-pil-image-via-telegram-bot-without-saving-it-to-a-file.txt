For my telegram bot (python-telegram-bot) i generated a PIL.Image.Image and i want to send it directly to a user.What works is to send an image as bufferedReader from a file, but i don't want to safe the image. I don't need it again afterwards and i might generate a lot of different images at the same time, so saving is kind of messy.Because i generated it myself, i cant use an URL or file_id. I thought it might be possible to convert the image to a bufferedReader, but i only managed to get a bytes object from it, which didn't work.The image is generated like:Thanks in advance :) merry x-mas
Have a lock at this code snippet from the packages github wikiPost an image from memoryIn this example, image is a PIL (or Pillow) Image object, but it works the same with all media types.
