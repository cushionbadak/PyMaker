You can use a dictionary (ideal: ) to collect your data and then use the  to create your format:Output:Using  is preferable over  or using  or testing if  because it is overall faster (builtin optimizations) then any of the other methods.Doku:defaultdictzip()You could also leverage itertools.groupby() wich operates on sorted data (yours is sorted) to get to the same results:Using  on this list creates the same partitioning because it is sorted - if it was not sorted you'd get different results.
Since dictionary comprehension is not good for aggregation, just use a linear time loop:I understand you wanted a format of  but I think a dictionary is a better choice.
