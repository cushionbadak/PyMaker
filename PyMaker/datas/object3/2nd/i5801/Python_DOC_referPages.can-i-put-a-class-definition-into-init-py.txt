I have a package with a class structure similar to this. class is a typical, simple parent class for a few separate hierarchies.My package layout looks like this:Is this a good idea or good practice to put  class into  instead of creating separate module just for one class? In this way I wouldn't need to import it each time in modules.
It is perfectly fine and a more flexible approach to leave it in . Also note that the primary use of __init__.py is to initialize Python packages and not to hold content.To avoid having to import the module each time you can write something like into the  such that you can directly import  from my_package:This is a common approach to make objects available at the package level.For more info about the  file check out the documentation.
