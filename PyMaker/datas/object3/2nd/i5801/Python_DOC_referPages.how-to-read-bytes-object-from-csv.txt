Natural Text
I have used tweepy to store the text of tweets in a csv file using Python ), but I had to encode the text in utf-8 before storing, otherwise tweepy throws a weird error.Now, the text data is stored like this:I tried to decode this using this code (there is more data in other columns, text is in 3rd column):But, it doesn't decode the text. I cannot use  as the csv reader reads data as strings i.e.  is  and I can't seem to convert it into , the data gets encoded once more!How can I decode the text data? Edit: Here's a sample line from the csv file:Note: If the solution is in the encoding process, please note that I cannot afford to download the entire data again.
If your input file really contains strings with Python syntax  prefixes on them, one way to workaround it (even though it's not really a valid format for csv data to contain) would be to use Python's  function @Ryan mentioned although I would use it in a slightly different way, as shown below. This will provide a safe way to parse any strings that are in the file that have had the  byte-string prefix added to them. The rest of the fields will be passed through unchanged.
You can use  to convert the incorrect fields back to bytes safely:
