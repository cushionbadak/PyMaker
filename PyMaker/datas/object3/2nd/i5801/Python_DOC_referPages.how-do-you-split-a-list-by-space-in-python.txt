How do you split a list by space? With the code below, it reads a file with 4 lines of 7 numbers separated by spaces. When it takes the file and then splits it, it splits it by number so if i print item[0], 5 will print instead of 50. here is the codethe file looks like this 50 60 15 100 60 15 40 /n100 145 20 150 145 20 45 /n50 245 25 120 245 25 50 /n100 360 30 180 360 30 55 /n
Split takes as argument the character you want to split your string with.I invite you to read the documentation of methods you are using. :)EDIT : By the way, readline returns a string, not a **list **.However, split does return a list. 
Try this once you have opened that file.TextInTheFile is a variable
There's not a lot wrong with what you are doing, except that you are printing the wrong thing.Instead ofuse is the first character of the string you read from file. You split this string into a variable called  so that's what you should print.
