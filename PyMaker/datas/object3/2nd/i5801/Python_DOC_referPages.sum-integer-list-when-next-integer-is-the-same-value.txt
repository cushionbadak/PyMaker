So I need to have a code that checks one integer, and checks if the integer after it is the same value. If so, it will add the value to .So my code currently gives the result . I want it to give the result of .I do not know any way to do that.
The following will work. Zip together adjacent pairs and only take the first elements if they are the same as the second ones:While this should be a little less [space-]efficent in theory (as the slice creates an extra list), it still has  complexity in time and space and is well more readable than most solutions based on indexed access. A tricky way to avoid the slice while still being concise and avoiding any imports would be:This makes use of the fact that  will be cast to  or  appropriately.
Another way using 
You can try this:Output:
No need for that list. You can remove the "non-repeated" digits from the string already:
You are simply iterating on string and converting character to integer. You need to iterate and compare to next character.Output
Try this one too:Output:
Here's a slightly more space efficient version of @schwobaseggl's answer.Alernatively, using an  from the  module is equivalent but looks a bit nicer.
