Let's say I have a string like this:and I want to turn it into then - in this particular case - I could simply dowhich gives the desired output.However, in my actual data there might be not only  but also other prefixes, so the above  statement does not work.What I would need instead is a replacement of a capital letter followed by an underscore and an arbitrary sequence of letters and numbersbyeverything after the first underscore. So, to extract the desired elements I could use:which printshow can I now replace those elements so that I obtain?
If you need to remove an uppercase ASCII letter with an underscore after it, only when not preceded with a word char and when followed with an alphanumeric char, you may useSee the Python demo and a regex demo.Pattern details - a leading word boundary  - an ASCII uppercase letter and  - Group 1 (later referenced to with  from the replacement pattern): 1 alphanumeric char.
If you just need to replace a capital letter followed by an underscore, you can use the regular expression .You may need to add to it if you have other criteria not mentioned. (For example, some of your target values follow a word boundary and some follow parentheses.) The above might give you the wrong output if you have input like . It depends on what you expect the output to be.
Another  approach:The output: -  positive lookahead assertion, ensures that substituted  substring is followed by alphanumeric sequence 
You could use  with a lookahead assertion:from the docs:      Matches if  matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the string. This is called a lookahead assertion. For example,  will match  only if it’s followed by .
