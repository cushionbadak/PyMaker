I am coding a game for a project and am trying to figure out how to draw a circle that I can use as a button. I have used the pygame.draw.circle function. here is my current code:according to the pygame function documentation, this should work, but all I get is:
You are using  instead of . Try the following instead:  Draws a circular shape on the Surface. The pos argument is the center of the circle, and radius is the size. The width argument is the thickness to draw the outer edge. If width is zero then the circle will be filled.
You can calculate the distance to the center of the circle with the  function. If the distance is below the radius, the circle was clicked.You could also use s for the collision detection, but the  solution is simpler.
