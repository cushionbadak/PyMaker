I have the following code and I would like it to jump back to a line if a certain eventuality were to occur:What I would like to happen is: if  would end up being negative, then I would like the program to return to the top () and allow the user to enter more "money".How can I do that?
Use a  loop and a  statement:
What you can do is put all your code in an extra  loop that would keep running until  becomes positive (so you would need to initialise  to a negative value before the loop).With this, you will enter your  loop after change has been set to the good value. Once  becomes negative, then you get out of this loop and go back at the top, where the user can add coins.Then, if the customer decides to buy nothing before using all their change, then  is still positive, and you get out of the main  loop.
