I have this  (Small Example) that i import into a script.This is the scriptOutput:The Purpose of this is to see what Team Mate played with each other. From the  we can see that  from  is Paired up with  from . I only want like team  to combine. The  is how that can be identified. The other stipulation is that the  will change game by game depending on what teams are playing that night. Open to any and all suggestions, Thanks!Edit: If an  is easier than a  for  I can scrape the  instead which is a number. 
Add after your ʼfor row in dataʼ...
Your question is not easy to answer but I will try. I made a few assumptions:I supposed that the overlap will happen only if they play in the same periodIf the times recorded in the files is not in a format with one or two digits, it will consider it being zero (you may want to treat this case differently)I supposed that a player may play more than one time in a periodI supposed that the period is a single digit and that I can compare the string value instead of the numerical value.Now the two files:2017020397.csvsolution.pyHere's some comment about how I did it:I have used a  so that I don't have to skip the first line and the be able to get each part of a row by its column name.I have used a nested dictionary data structure to be able to recall the data. It a list of dictionary of recorded times inside a dictionary of players inside a dictionary of periods inside a dictionary of teams.If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask.
