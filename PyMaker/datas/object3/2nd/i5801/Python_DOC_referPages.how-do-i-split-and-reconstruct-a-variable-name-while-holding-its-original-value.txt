Is it possible to split variables that have already been assigned values, and re-piece them back together to hold those same previous values?For Example:Outputs as: 'URLs.QA.Signin'but I would like it to:Output as: 'https://qa.test.com'The purpose is so I can plug in any value to my 'TestEnvironment' variable and thus access any of my massive list of URL's with ease =PI am green with Python. Your time and efforts are greatly appreciated! =)Based upon evanrelf's answer, I tried and loved the following code!:This is exactly what i'm looking for, I might be over complicating it, any suggestions to clean up the code?Output is: https://qa.pleasanthill.test.com
I would recommend you look into Python's dictionaries.
I believe to my comprehension that you are trying to input a string and get a new string (the url) back. The simplest answer that I can understand is to use a dictionary. An example of this is by simply doingeither this or by using two arrays and referencing a common index, but who wants to do that :p
