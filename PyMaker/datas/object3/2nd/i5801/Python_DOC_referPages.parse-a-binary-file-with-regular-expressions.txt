I've got two bytes-type variable that I've concatenated (separated by a space) so I can send it as one variable to a server (socket programming). What I'm trying to figure out is how to then separate them and assign them to their original variables using regular expressions. I've consulted regular expressions parsing a binary file but it wouldn't work for me. Here is my output after trying the expression as so just to get the cipher variableIt generally only matches the first couple characters and returns an object, which isn't what I'm wanting. What am I doing wrong? edit: I'm probably doing it the hard way. Honestly, any recommendation on how to send 2 bytes objects over a socket using UDP. Its proving really difficult 
Why are you using regex to do this?. You should take a look at the struct module:Also, you can use this recipe for decoding binary files
Ended up using str.rpartition to solve my problems. Wasn't the most obvious answer, but it worked.
