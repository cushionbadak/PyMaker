I have 10 functions which has to be called in a loop...But if the user gives input 5, first 5 functions should be called.If user gives 11 , after calling the 10 functions , it should start calling the rest 1 from the BeginningI wrote the all the 10 functions, but I don't know how to achieve this.
Put your functions into a list:And loop over them:Now what comes to your requirement:If user gives 11 , after calling the 10 functions , it should start calling the rest 1 from the BeginningThere are many ways to do this, but if we want to stick to the above code, we can just use the modulo operator () to allow "going past" the end:You could also change the approach completely and use  instead of looping over the list's indexes, and use the built-in  to get the functions:
Put your functions in a list, then cycle through the list using the modulus operator, where N is the number of functions you are supposed to call: will ensure that you start with the first function and wrap around to the first function again once you've hit the last function in the list.
