I'm just getting started with dictionaries in python and I got stumbled at the following code snippet:I suppose the  is returned maybe due to the incompatibility of types like  is a string and  in the loop is a  maybe.But when I inspect the types I can see both are  type only !!How do I convert the string key I provide like "draw" to be acceptable as a key and it returns True? I guess this is a simple oversight but I need to know what the problem here is !
I think you are kinda lost here. - iterates over  keys return value for key Will return all values of your , since you iteration over all of its keys. - checks if value of  in list of  keys, so  just print / if key exist in your .And i would strongly advise you to read docs on dictionaries. 
Are you sure "draw" is one of the key of word_dict? check your dictionary.
Thank you all for your time into this.I actually split the words in a file to keys in the dictionary and while doing so the keys also had a trailing . That's the reason I get False when I give a string without newline. I found this out when I inspected by looping through keys of Thanks to schwobaseggl for leading me into the solution.
