Is it possible to extent the Template strings so I can add methods to the identifier:By default I can replace simple variables:But I wish to extend the identifier with a custom method (e.g. ):I know I can easily do something similar with Formatted string literals but is it possible using the Template strings, like above?I cannot use Formatted string literals because it will not work inside a script, a JSON file or whatever text that contain curly braces.Essentially I'm looking for something that can offer the Template strings syntax within the Formatted string literals flexibility.
Not a direct answer, but I'd recommend not using Template strings.If you're using Python 3.6 or newer, use f-strings:when run:If you'd rather a more powerful template mechanism, I highly recommend Jinja2.
Genshi does exactly that but it doesn't seem to use the built-in  module.Other useful references are Chameleon and Mako.
