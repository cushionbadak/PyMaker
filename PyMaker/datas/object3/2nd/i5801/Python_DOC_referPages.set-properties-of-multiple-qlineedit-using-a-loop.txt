Natural Text
I was wondering if it is possible to set multiple  properties using a for loop:currently I have twelve QLineEdit boxesLineEdit1, LineEdit2, ... , LineEdit12 and I'm hoping to do this with less code. I tried the above method, and it did not iterate through the LineEdit boxes as I had expected. Would  only work for a list?
for this task you can use :
You may use  function.e.g.Please note this will call  on all Line Edits.
