I'm trying the module ElementTree of Python 3 to parse XML but I can't make it work.I have a XML file:And I want to check, given a name, if it exist on the XML and get the number. So when I write the code, I do:I get empty name and number. Debugging, when I do  it has 2 objects but they are empty.I'm reading the documentation and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Someone can tell me where it's my mistake?Regards
Thanks to @RomanPerekhrest, I was doing everything right but I was checking the wrong variable.Replacing  with  was the solution.
