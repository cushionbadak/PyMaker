Hi, I want to merge two lists into one dictionary. Suppose I have two lists such as belowlist_one = ['a', 'a', 'c', 'd']list_two = [1,2,3,4]and I want my dictionary to be like thisAs of right now, I have this following codeBut the output from above code is thisHow can I make it to this output?Thanks
A defining characteristic of s is that each key is unique. Thus, you can't have two  keys. Otherwise, what would  return?
Dictionaries must have unique keys, so you would have to change your requirement. How about a list of tuples as a workaround?With the resulting being:You can easily iterate over and unpack like so:which produces:If you want it hashable, you can create a tuple of tuples like so:
Since keys in dictionaries are unique, getting  is impossible here for regular python dictionaries, since the key  can only occur once. You can however have a key mapped to multiple values stored in a list, such as . One option is to create a  to do this easily for you:Which outputs:
From the documentation for dictionaries:It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.
Dictionary has unique keys. If you need the value of 'a' separately store the zipped data in a list or you can use list in values part of the dict and store the values as:{'a': [1,2],'c': [3], 'd': [4]}
As other answers have pointed out, dictionaries have unique keys, however, it is possible to create a structure to mimic the behavior you are looking for:Output:
You have two options :either you use tuple :output:Second option is use this pattern:output:
The keys in dictionary should be unique.According to python documentation:It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).linkto the documentation
