I can convert a numpy ndarray to bytes using  Now how can I get it back to an ndarray? Using the example from the  method docs: 
After your edit it seems you are going into the wrong direction!You can't use  to store a complete array containing all informations like shapes and types when reconstruction from these bytes only is needed! It will only save the raw data (cell-values) and flatten these in C or Fortran-order.Now we don't know your task. But you will need something based on serialization. There are tons of approaches, the easiest being the following based on python's pickle (example here: python3!):Output:The better alternative would be joblib's pickle with specialized pickling for large arrays. joblib's functions are file-object based and can be used in-memory with byte-strings too using python's BytesIO.
