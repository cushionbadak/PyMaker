I have been using sys.argv to provide parameters in the command line.For example, I have a method:Now when I run this code the command will be something like this:The param can be anything, from paths to filenames set as and when required.My question is how to set a parameter in which you can set a destination to store a file, say a pickle file for example. I would like to know how to do something like this:where param3 is basically the destination of the file to be saved. If there is something like sys where we can provide a destination for a file to be saved using param1 and param2.Please help. Thanks.
Unless your just trying to setup a quick-and-dirty script, it's rarely good idea to use  directly to get script arguments. Instead, use a command line argument parser. There are plenty out there for Python that are robust and fairly easy to use.Here's a simple example using the default argument parser that comes with Python; . The script expects a single argument - a file path.
