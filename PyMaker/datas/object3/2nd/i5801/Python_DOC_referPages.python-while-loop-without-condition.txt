I just came to know there are Truthy and Falsy values in python which are different from the normal  and ?Can someone please explain in depth what truthy and falsy values are? Where should I use them?What is the difference between truthy and  values and falsy and  values ?
As the comments described, it just refers to values which are evaluated to True or False.For instance, to see if a list is not empty, instead of checking like this:You can simply do this:This is because some values, such as empty lists, are considered False when evaluated for a boolean value. Non-empty lists are True.Similarly for the integer 0, the empty string "", and so on, for False, and non-zero integers, non-empty strings, and so on, for True.The idea of terms like "truthy" and "falsy" simply refer to those values which are considered True in cases like those described above, and those which are considered False.For example, an empty list () is considered "falsy", and a non-empty list (for example, ) is considered "truthy".See also this section of the documentation.
All values are considered "truthy" except for the following, which are "falsy": - an empty  - an empty  - an empty  - an empty  - an empty  - an empty an empty , like objects for which  returns  returns  A "truthy" value will satisfy the check performed by  or  statements.  We use "truthy" and "falsy" to differentiate from the  values  and .Truth Value Testing
Python determines the truthiness by applying  to the type, which returns  or  which is used in an expression like  or . Here is an example for a custom class and it's instance returning  when the magnitude (lenght of a vector) is 0, otherwise .Note: If we wouldn't have defined  it would always return True, as instances of a user-defined class are considered truthy by default.Example from the book: "Fluent in Python, clear, concise and effective programming"
Truthy values refer to the objects used in a boolean context and not so much the boolean value that returns true or false.Take these as an example:
