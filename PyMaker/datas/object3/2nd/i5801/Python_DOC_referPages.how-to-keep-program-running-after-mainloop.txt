I'm trying to create a program which displays images using tkinter. The code I've written so far displays the image perfectly, however the program does not continue until the tkinter window is closed. I was wondering if there was any function instead of .mainloop() to keep the program running alongside the tkinter window? Any help much appreciated
The  needs to be the last logical line of code. The mainloop should also be called on the  object, in your case .In order for your code to run, you either need to move the  and  statements before the , or move them to a function and instead call that function, before the mainloop.It is also worth noting that in Tkinter, you can use  for timings instead of .
Tkinter is event driven.  This means that there must be an action (from the script or user) given to tkinter to change things.The  function executes the window so there is no alternative to it.  Fortunately there are solutions:If you want to perform actions alongside tkinter window(s) you have two options:You can perform them all before  is called.  Or make them execute when a user performs an action in form of a button ect. Or you can run functions in the background with threading or multiprocessing.If you go for this option I would suggest threading because:It's easy to useYou can communicate between different parts of the script.  You can struggle to do this in multithreadingHowever this depends entirely on the specific task.In the example code you have given your best option is to call it before  is executed.  For example:Although you could put it anywhere before .
