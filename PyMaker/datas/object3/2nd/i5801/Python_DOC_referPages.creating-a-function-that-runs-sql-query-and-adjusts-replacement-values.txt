I'm having trouble getting a multi-line sql query to format correctly using replacement values (%s). Any help in getting the function to iterate through a list of , and  would be helpful!My goal would be to have the code run the query for , save the results to a dataframe, then run the query for  and save the results to  another dataframe.
Haven't tried myself but maybe you should use f strings
