I am confused about the following:The  operator should return only a bool (or at least I thought so).I would have expected to have,  assuming that the line would have been processed like  but performing comparison instead of assignment. Or, to have an error. But definitely not .Can anyone explain what is going on here?
This:is evaluated as a three element tuple that contains ,  and  respectively. You need to use a couple of parentheses here:This is stated in the Language Reference:Except when part of a list or set display, an expression list  containing at least one comma yields a tuple. The length of the tuple  is the number of expressions in the list. The expressions are  evaluated from left to right.
@alec_djinncomparison operator work If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.you are trying to compare wrong data type 1,2 is not valid.try '1,2' == '1,2' will give you correct results.1,2 is not single argument.
