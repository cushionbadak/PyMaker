I have a list that looks like:How do I solve this to find all combinations for 3 digits.  The same letter cannot be used in same row.E.g something like...:This does not give desired input:
The Python Standard Library itertools already has the functionality you are trying to implement. Also you are using it in your code (funnily).  returns all 3-combinations of the a. To convert that to "list of list" you should use  as follows;Additionally, I suggest you to search on "Combination, Permutation Difference". As I understood from your question; permutation is what you want. (If you run the code I shared, you will understand the difference easliy.)
To understand how the solution process works, try the following:
combinations works on strings not lists, so you should first turn it into a string using: OUTPUTOr as a one-liner:
