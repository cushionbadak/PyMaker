I'm trying to parse a given string of custom format date into epoch time with the following code:The given date format is as shown in the code. The problem I'm facing is when the code is compile I keep getting error saying:From what I can see, the format seems to be exactly as specified according to: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlWhat seem's to be wrong?Edit: I have tried using datetime instead of time as well, but didn't workBased on the comments below, it seems like the timezone field(%Z) is causing the problem. It seems like that field is based on the timezone the code is ran, and not the timezone the input string gives.
