I'm not sure that it's possible, I would like to unpack dictionary into function but I haven't similar parameters. Is it possible to easily restrict a dictionary to a subset?OutputAnd I want to obtainresult where 'd' is automatically rejected.It's just an example. In my case the function is not mine, I cannot redefined her parameters, foo is unmodifiable.I have many functions in similar case as foo() and these functions are object's methods.Any ideas?
Inspecting the function signature will help:
Here is a (hopefully) correct solution using . Since the parameter list returned by  may contain star args and also positional only args, it is not enough to just compare the names.Output:Note that the function in the first example omits the name of the star arg, and in the second example detects the presence of a double star arg and therefore does no filtering
