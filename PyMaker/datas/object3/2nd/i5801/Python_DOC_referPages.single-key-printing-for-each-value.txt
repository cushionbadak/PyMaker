I am using python to run a for loop to print out every value in a specific URL, but each value is printing to a new dictionary with the same key instead of inserting multiple values into one dictionary.How can I get the all the values for a specific key to be inserted into a single unique key?current output:{'https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners': 'check_output'}{'https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners': 'data'}{'https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners': 'decode'}.....desired output: {'https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners': 'check_output', 'data', 'decode}
I think the relevant part of your question is:How can I get the all the values for a specific key to be inserted into a single unique key?You may want to use another data-structure to hold the different values.For example a set if you're only interested what different values there are, but not in duplicates. (If you want to keep track all the values, switch to a list and use append instead of add.) This answer demonstrates how you could keep track of css classes assigned to different html elements on a page you want to parse. It assumes you somehow already obtained the elements and their classes.This speculative answer may get you going. Apart from that please have a look at the comments above, especially at https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve, as already mentioned by @peter-wood in his comment.
