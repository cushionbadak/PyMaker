The dictionary generated is based on user input, so in another scenario all the 2 's may need to be replaced with 35 instead of 70. I need a way of replacing the numbers without specifically saying something like if there is a 2 replace it with 70. This list of lists is generated using this answer (Recursive tree terminates function prematurely)
