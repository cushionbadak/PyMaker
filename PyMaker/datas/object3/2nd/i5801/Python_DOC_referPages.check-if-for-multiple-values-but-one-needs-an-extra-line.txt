My first question..!Hi all, as a guy trying to learn programming/Python to be exact I have an issue that I would like to address. I have written some code that works as expected. Yet I don't think this part is the pythonic way to go:There should be a way for me to say if i == 80 then do the standard 'if' conditions AFTER this extra code.I hope I explained the issue properly. Thanks!PS: This is an example code. I'm trying to find the proper logic only. Dont get stuck with the results.Edit: I forgot to enter this line when posting my question (that's why some didn't understand the code):Also For extra points  :)  I'd love it if there was a way that this line doesn't have to be written twice!
You could move the  bit above the other  to avoid any nesting or duplication, but not sure if that's is what makes you think this isn't Pythonic enough:
Why don't you do two statements in the for loop? Like :
