I have a list of objects, and for each object, I need to do some async work on it. I am not sure if I construct it right:I think the for loop is sync and will totally block the progress, am I right? If I am, how to construct it?
Usually it's not how people write async programs: event loop should be global and be started as main entry point of whole script. Doing like you do (running event loop inside single function ) makes unable for upper code to run other coroutines in same event loop.If you understand this and all you want is blocking  function that can't be used alongside with other async stuff, read further.Problem with your  is that it awaits next  coroutine only after previous one been done. For loop is not what we call "blocking", but it's just not concurrent - it doesn't use benefits provided by asynchronous paradigm.To achieve benefits of using asyncio you should run multiple coroutines concurrently. Common way to do it is to use asyncio.gather():If you want you can also read this little answer about asyncio in general.
