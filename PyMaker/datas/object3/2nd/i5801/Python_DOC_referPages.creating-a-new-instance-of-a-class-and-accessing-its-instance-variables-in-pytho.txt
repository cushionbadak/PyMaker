So, I'm building a turing machine in Python, and I've gotten to a point where I need to instantiate my Turing Machine class inside of my parser, but I can't seem to get the syntax right. Here is the way I'm  defining my TM:So I need to create an instance in my Parser class:for example: 
Very quick example to show you the effect of required positional arguments:In the first class,  allows me to instantiate and pass any keyword arguments I want. This is a week example, but gets the point across that you can do some initialization checks for existance and then subchecks for key names.In the second class, by using  I default the parameter if it isnt supplied. So again, the interpreter is happy because all the parameters received a value!In the last class, we see the error. Notice that  is not defined with a default value. Thus the interpreter demands it receive one to instantiate it. When I dont supply it, you get the  telling you so. In short, without properly instantiating a class, you wont be able to access any of its attributes or use its member functions!Edit: Wanted to explain it in more detailFurther, in OOP/D, try to find ways to steer clear of long  function headers. Try something like this instead:Again, using the  to determine when I want to supply values to the object at initialization, but I default it using a pre-defined listing! Breaking it down some: is a ready made dictionary (just like . Dont let the  scare you, its just the dictionaries unpacking operator. Lists have one as well, its literally one . iterates over our pre-defined arguments container, and then creates a  attribute with the value from . It looks for  and if it doesnt find it, uses  which we already have!So later when you want to do you single attribute accessing in your  class:
