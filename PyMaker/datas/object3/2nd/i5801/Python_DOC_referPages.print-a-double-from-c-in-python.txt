I am sending a double value from C through TCP using lwIP. To accomplish that, I am using an union between a double and one string of 8 bytes (because the lwIP's function to send data is of type 'char *'). Here te code:I am trying to read from a Python script, but I fail on get the double value. The code:It fails with the message I know, is because the string is not a literal representation of a real value. Any idea? I need the real (double) value.For more information, the lwIP echo server is running in a Zynq 7000 FPGA+SoC. I am running the Python code from a Debian 8. The double value is a 64 bit temperature for a sensor.-- EDIT --The final working code is:
you're recieving the binary representation of the double, not the string one.You have to unpack it using  module and the  specifier which is .  returns a tuple, so take first & only value to get your note that you can even fix the endianness with  or , not necessary if you're on the same machine or CPU type for both programs.
