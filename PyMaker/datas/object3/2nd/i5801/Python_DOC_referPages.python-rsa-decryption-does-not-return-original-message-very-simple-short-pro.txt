So I am trying to create a very simple RSA encryption/decryption program where I only encrypt/decrypt int numbers. All works fine except for one problem. Sometimes my decrypted number (message) does not match my original number (the message I needed to encrypt and decrypt). This seems to happen whenever my inputted number (message) is close to my the number in my 'n' variable (n=p*q where p and q are prime numbers). I have browsed Stackoverflow a bit now and have found out that RSA algoritms cannot properly decrypt messages that are greater than 'n'. But in my case it fails to decrypt messages that are close to 'n'. If n=35 and my input number (the number to encrypt/decrypt) is 32, the program does not properly decrypt it back to 32 despite 32 being lower than 35 (works for 31, 30 ... though). Why?Code:
Solved it! I made two little mistakes in my code. First one was that I assumed that the "^" symbol meant "to the power of" in Python (the correct symbol is "**") and the second one was that I forgot to add "mod n" to the line in my decrypt() function (so  instead of ).
