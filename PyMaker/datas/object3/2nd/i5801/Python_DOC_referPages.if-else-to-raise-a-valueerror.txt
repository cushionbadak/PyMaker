I am following this:if else in a list comprehensionbut the following small program is generating a syntax error:The else clause is generating the error.If I remove the else clause it runs, however, I want to raise a ValueError for any inputthat is NOT a key in my dictionary 'xlate'.NOTE I am working on the rna-transcription problem from exercism.io.I pass 5 unit tests but I fail the three unit tests requiring a ValueError for invalid input.
You cannot do this in a comprehension. The conditional expression has the form:(and, sub-note, it should be used in the beginning of the comprehension)while  is a statement, not an expression. As such, a  is raised. In short, if you do want to use , you'll have to resort to a  loop. Alternately, if you're just very passionate about comprehensions, you could define a function which you can then call in the  clause:This is because function calls are expressions. Of course, this is quite ugly.
