The problem is that  doesn't allow you to specify that you only want to match whole words (or phrases). The  module allows you to use regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching. With regex, you can specify word boundaries using the  escape. Place the  escape before and after your phrases to cause the match to only occur at word boundaries. The  function works like the  method and you can use it in your code like:
Part of the trick of your problem is that you don't want to match partial words. That's why the  method does not do what you want it to do.  You can achieve what you want through regular expressions.  One of the nice thing about REs is that you can match on word boundaries using the  flag.
