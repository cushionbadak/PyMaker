This question already has an answer here:Comparing boolean and int using isinstance                    4 answers                Python considers a boolean as an integer. Why?Reverse the condition and ask Python if an integer is a boolean (obviously no), you get this:
It is in the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=boolean#numeric-types-int-float-complexThere are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. and  are numerically equal to  and  in Python, respectively.Because bool is a subclass of int, as established above, the builtin function "isinstance" returns true, as documented in https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstanceisinstance(object, classinfo)Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns false. If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised.
