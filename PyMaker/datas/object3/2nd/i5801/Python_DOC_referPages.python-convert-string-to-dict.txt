I have a string : and would like to convert it to Any ideas ?
This has been settled in 988251 In short; use the python  library's  function.
What u have is a JSON formatted string which u want to convert to python dictionary.Using the JSON library :Now dictionary contains the data structure which ur looking for. 
The problem with your input string is that it's actually not a valid JSON because your keys are not declared as strings, otherwise you could just use the  module to load it and be done with it. A simple and dirty way to get what you want is to first turn it into a valid JSON by adding quotation marks around everything that's not a whitespace or a syntax character:This gives you a valid JSON so now you can easily parse it to a Python  using the  module:
Here is my answer:My strategy is to convert the dictionary  to a  by . However, I first have to deal with the fact that your dictionary keys are not enclosed in quotes. I do that by evaluating it anyway and catching the error. From the error message, I extract the key that was interpreted as an unknown variable, and enclose it with quotes.
