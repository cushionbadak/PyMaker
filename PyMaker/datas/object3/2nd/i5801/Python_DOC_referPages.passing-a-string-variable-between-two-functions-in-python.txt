I am having trouble passing a variable from one function to another:I want the last command to print the inputed first_name from  and last name from I always get the error that first_name is not defined and I do not know how to import it from the first function. The error I get is:What am I doing wrong?
You need to pass the information in the function call:
You can see how they are used if you look at the examples in the documentation, f.e. here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.htmlMaybe you should read up on some of the tutorials for basics, you can find lots of them on the python main page: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide
You can also use while loop to ask the names constantly until there is a valid input.
