I am using Python 3.5 and PyCharm 2017.3My code appears as following:I get the following for qryPqr:So, I have two questions:(1) Why are there backslashes everywhere?(2) How do I get rid of them or make my join statement better?Edit:I want to remove the backslashes from the print statement as when I do the database query using  it tries to run the query with backslashes and hence errors out.
There are no backslashes in the variable, they are just in the printed output.The shell does not print the variable directly, but calls  on it. This function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval()Usually, repr just wraps strings in quotes:If your string contains one kind of quotes, it uses the other kind:But your string contains both kinds of quotes. If you would want to specify that in your code, you could either join string literals which each only have one kind (like you did), or escape one kind:This escaping is exactly what  does when you output a string representation of the variable to the command line.One side note: You are building a SQL query by concatenating fixed parts and (user supplied?) variables. Please don't do that. Please use at least prepared statements, or better a wrapper library like SQLAlchemy. This does not only make it easier to handle database connections, but also much more secure.
The backslashes are in the displayed output, but not in the variable itself, if you  your qryPwr you will see thisYou will get this if your actual  contains both  and  characters. For a simpler example:
