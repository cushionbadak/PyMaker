Natural Text
I'm trying to make a program that translates morse code from a text file. In theory it should be pretty easy but the problem is that I find the formatting of the text file a bit silly (its school work so can't change that). What I meant by that is that in the file one space separates two characters (like this ) but two spaces equal end of a word (so space in the translated text). Like this: This is what I have, but it gives me translated text without the spaces.I also dont know how to intercept the line change (\n).
Why don't you split on two spaces to get the words, then on space to get the characters? Something like:Of course, all this assuming your  dict has proper mapping.
Split on double-space first to get a list of words in each line then you can split the words on a single space to get characters to feed your translator
