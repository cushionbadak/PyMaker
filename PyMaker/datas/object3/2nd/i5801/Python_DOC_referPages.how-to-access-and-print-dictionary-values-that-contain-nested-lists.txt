I'm learning Python and am a bit stuck with the concept of dictionaries and nested lists.The lab I'm currently working on calls for us to create a dict with some keys having just a single list of values and other keys having two or more lists associated. The code below properly prints the list elements for the key that has multiple lists, but if I change the get statement to a key with a single list I just get the first two digits of the string.Would someone explain how to access list values from the dictionary regardless of whether the key has a single list, or multiple lists?Ultimately the output if key 1 or 3 is used would beIf key 2 is selected the output would be
Based on the updated information you added and comments under your question, this seems to work for the specific case you're dealing with:Output:To handle single dictionary values as shown in the code in your question, you could do something very similar to the above like this:Output:Comment: Although it may be obvious, this would much easier if you could make the dictionary more consistent, where the values in it were always lists-of-lists as shown below:
Evaluation of  is equivalent to . For a string, this will be the xth character in the string (you could think of it as a list of characters). For a list, it will be the xth item in the list.You can use  to determine if each item in the higher level list is a string or list:You could also think about how you could use a recursive function to accomplish this task.
I'm not exactly sure if this is what you mean but the code below prints out each text value:So loop through your dictionary and create a sub-loop through each element (x) of each value in your dictionary. If x is not itself a list, print x. If x is a list, then loop through x, printing each element (y) contained within x.
