I was advised to take advantage of the pathlib module in Python 3.6, as I am designing a script on Linux that'll be used in production on Windows machines. does seem promising, but while my code with the  module works great:If I change to the pathlib equivalent:80% I'll get this error in Pycharm:Process finished with exit code 133 (interrupted by signal 5: SIGTRAP)or the script will run, but my triggers won't fire at all.  Confusing.
Ok. I've found the solution:returns an , while:returns a I ended up casting the latter as a string by using , although this looks ugly to me. I'm keeping the question open for better answers.
