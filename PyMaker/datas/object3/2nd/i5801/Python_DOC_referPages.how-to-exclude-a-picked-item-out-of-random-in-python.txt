Thanks for the kind responses that you have given us. I really appreciate it lad. I really love you stackoverflow. We have reached a pretty good grade thanks to everyone. I really appreciate it.
The solutions using  suggested in the comments will force you to find the index of the randomly picked object.Instead, you can simply keep a reference to the picked item and use  (that accepts the object itself and not its index in the list) to delete it from the list:You just need to make sure that  is larger than the length of the shortest list, otherwise you will get a  exception.
Add the chosen item to a  and resample if the thing is already there. This way you don't have to delete anything, just grow the list of already seen items.You can also modify it to a dictionary in case you need to keep a count of how many of each item has been chosen already.
Another approach: shuffle the list and use  instead of randomly picking one name.What does this code ?  shuffles the list inplace, so instead of randomly iterating through the list, you just have to iterate through a shuffled list.   creates a iterator that jointly iterates on both list, and stop whenever one list is over, so you don't have to care about the length difference between  and .
