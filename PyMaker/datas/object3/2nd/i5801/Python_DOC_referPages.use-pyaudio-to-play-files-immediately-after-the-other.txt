Natural Text
I'm trying to modify my first Python program. I'm trying to use this repository to do some rudimentary text-to-speech. It does fine, but I want to improve it.From the looks of it, there is a 0.145 second delay between samples played. Not all the samples of my voice will be 0.145 seconds, however, and I want to have each sample play one after the other with no delays or skips.I've tried getting rid of the threading and delay, but there is some delay still between samples. I'm thinking that I should, instead of incrementing delay by 0.145, increment it by the length of the sample in seconds, but I've looked at the pyaudio documentation, and I have no idea how to do that.Can someone help?
Here is a modified code that plays wav files continuously.
