This question already has an answer here:How can I sort a dictionary by key?                    25 answers                I practice python recently. for a few days my script has stopped, because I'm struggling on a problem.I want to sort the items by both values which has in common. like an chain. as you can see lower.what I have:what I want:to see clearly:there is a simple method to sort them ? if the topic already exists, can you send me the link. i haven't found it.thank you in advance.nb. in all case, I know the first and the last value of the chain (17 and 57)
Given what others have said about the order of a dictionary and violating the posters desire to have a dictionary, I return a sorted list.I used the accepted answer at In Python, how do I index a list with another list?
in fact i don't need a new dictionary. but a ordered list by the common value of the item.it must be look like that:list=[17,62,32,60,3,58,57]
