I also learned that there is a patch available to fix this issue. https://bugs.python.org/file10253/strftime-pre-1900.patchI tried to install the patch in Pycharm by copying the patch to a text file,  but I am getting the following error message. Any ideas on what I need to do to run the patch successfully to get dates before 1900 ?Pycharm Patch Error ScreenshotMy Code:
I realize this isn't what you asked, but I'll put it out there anyway since I'm assuming that if the answers to the linked question are too complicated to follow, the idea to patch your problem away successfully is probably unrealistic.The limitation you are seeing is present in Python2:It is somewhat rectified in Python3.2, and fully rectified in Python3.3 and onward:Parsing works too:So if that is an acceptable option, you could switch over to Python3.3+ and you won't have this issue.
