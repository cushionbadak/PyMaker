I tried using OMPC converter but so far am finding it hard to use without the built in functions compared with Matlab. Some of my code is as follows:Also I'm using the Spyder version of Python 3.6 which I downloaded from Anaconda, is this a good place to start my python learning?
The code you displayed is not really python.Matlab and python are totally different animals. Numpy and Matplotlib, which are python extensions used frequently in the scientific realm, share a lot of concepts with matlab, but the underlying syntax is distintly pythonic.I would start with https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/index.html for a quick and dirty introduction to Python (Its free as of the time of my writing: you can ignore the solicitations for a purchase, although if you did buy, i believe its money well spent). In addition, these official documentation pages should always be handy when coding in pythonPython Language Reference:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-indexPython Standard Library:https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index
