I'm working on a function that should continue after a response has been given through a websocket. In order to achieve this I use an asyncio event which will be set after the response has been given.Three functions are involved:Returns: In this example, the print('continue') function is never called and I do not why because the .set() function is actually called and .set() does seem to work fine if I use it before I call await event.wait().Is there something I'm missing?
