I was reading this link about using getters in Python, quote:The Pythonic way is to not use them. If you must have them then hide  them behind a property.That same page includes various examples, but my question is, if getters are not the Python way, how would I indicate to someone reading my code that a variable should be read-only after construction. Suppose I have the following class:If I wanted to indicate to another developer that  is read-only after being set in the , how would I do so? In orders words, if clients violate the rule, and attempt to set it, it's there problem if the implementation of  changes(for example, from object of the class  to ).
You can use the  decorator and not define a setter to communicate that  should not be modified:Note that the user can still go around the property and set  directly. Note that the  decorator only works with new style classes.
