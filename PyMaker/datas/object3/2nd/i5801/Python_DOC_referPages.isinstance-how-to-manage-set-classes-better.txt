While writing some debugging python, I seem to have created a bit of ugly code that I would like to clean up.Here is the function in its entirety:I specifically despise my try-except statement, because not only am I repeating code, but if I run into another dictionary class (like CaseInsensitiveDict from requests' headers) that I would like to print nicely during debugging output I would have to nest try-except statements.  Is there a way that I could check if  is like  or  then add it when creating the tuple for use in isinstance?
You want to look at the  construct; this lets you delegate to specific functions to handle your debugging, keyed on types: knows how to delegate for subclasses that don't have specific handlers; so  is handled by the  handler because it is a subclass of .
