Use Some additional advice:Your code is very strange. I'm not sure why you expect  to evaluate as  when that clearly doens't happen elsewhere in python There is no need to iterate over , especially in python 2.  works just fine. If you want both keys and values use  (or  in python 2). just makes the string . You need to be able to tell the difference between a string and a variable name. I think you mean  but  is never defined. Don't use  to concatenate strings like that anyway, use .
