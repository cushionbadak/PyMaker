I'm currently using Python 3 and would like to load a pickle file out of HDFS. I get a type error at the pickle loading stage. I found an option to open the file using  and then unpickle it. But unfortunately, I can't use Python 2.7. Any similar options?
Per BluBb,  requires a Python FileHandler.  returns bytes in this case and using  read the model properly.
