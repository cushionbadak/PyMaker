Lets say I am given the following listWhat would be the best and most efficient way to generate the following outputWe may assume that the list is all strings. Any ideas?
The following will work, making use of  and :While this will probably not be bested for single calls, you would be better off building an intermediate data structure that collects counts for groups of all different elements in a single go-around so that subsequent calls for individual elements won't have to iterate the entire list again:
This should work:whether it is the best is totally opinion based. IMO it is the best because I wrote it and, in my own opinion, I am the best.On a more objective note: @schwobaseggl 's solution is more concise but a quick  experiment tells me mine is 5x faster on your example and possibly a lot more on other examples... So 'best' really depends on what you value most. (even 'efficient' is rather vague: are you considering processing time, memory usage, .. ?)
