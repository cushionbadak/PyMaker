I am very new to Python and am working on a simple project that part of which is supposed to search for a user defined variable, and if found, return a string based on the row it was found.I've read many posts that lead me to the code that I have, but when ran, while I don't get an error, the code continues onto the next part. In this case I omitted the following parts, but if run by itself, breaks after the input variable.Part of the code was omitted for clarity, but that is why I have it setup as it is, though I am sure there are simpler ways of going about it. I have tried a few different things but am really not sure where to begin as I am getting very few errors with this one but no output. Thanks!
I think you are experiencing the following problem.  in Python 3 would evaluate the user input effectively converting a user input 1 to an integer  which then you are trying to compare with a string .In other words, here is what is happening:In your case, if the user types , the  comparison would be falsy.
