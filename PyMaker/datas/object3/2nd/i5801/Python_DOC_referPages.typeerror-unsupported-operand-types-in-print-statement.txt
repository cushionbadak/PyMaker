When I try to run this code under Python 3.6:I get this :The code works fine in Python 2. What's going on?
In Python 2, this:means "print the string  to the file-like object ".In Python 3,  becomes a function rather than a statement, and the syntax to redirect its output looks like this:You get a  (rather than, say, a ) in Python 3 because, now that  is a function (and therefore an object), it can be part of an expression … and since  is an operator, the expression fragmentis interpreted as "shift the  function right by  bits" – which is syntactically valid, but doesn't make any sense for those objects.If you need to write code which runs under both Python 2 and Python 3, you can import Python 3's behaviour into Python 2:Note that this will disable the ability to treat  as a statement, so you'll have to update any code which uses that behaviour.
