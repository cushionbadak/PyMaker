I've the following scriptThat "name" in the last line is what I need to match the matched name in the line. I tried to check the any() documentation but couldn't find a solution.Thanks in advance.
Change this:To this: goes though the iterator trying to find any value that returns  but does not tell you which one it was. will only return the next value that returns . The catch here is that there might be multiple that do so. Do not use  if you want to get them all.Finally, note that  can also take a default argument in case nothing is found. You might wanna use that. If you do, you do not need the  part. It is handled internally.
In  is only valid in the brackets. Afterwards name is no longer defined. You must go through the list manually:
Just change the any to a loop over a list from a list comprehension:
