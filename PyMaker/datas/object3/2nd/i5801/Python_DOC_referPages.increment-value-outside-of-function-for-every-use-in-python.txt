You are incrementing a temporary variable  in the function namespace, therefore  is not modified. If you want to change  you can:use a  with a  and a class attributeuse a decorator as in Paul Panzer's answerreturn the value of  and affect it to use a  statement.If you are unfamiliar with namespace check this linkFirst using a  with a  and a class attribute:This would be my preferred option as the namespaces are not polluted and the code is cleaner than with returning a value.Now returning a value:Or with a :
You could create a function attribute to hold the counter. Here is a decorator that does this:Please note that the purpose of the decorator here is twofold: (1) it adds convenience; but more importantly (2) it protects the namespace where the function or rather its wrapper finds itself. Without that the following accident can happen:
Two options, pure functions which don't modify anything outside their scope, Most recommendedas our friend Jacques Gaudin has added: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47680265/7579116the other one, less fancy, and not recommended but is what you asked for is to declare x as global
