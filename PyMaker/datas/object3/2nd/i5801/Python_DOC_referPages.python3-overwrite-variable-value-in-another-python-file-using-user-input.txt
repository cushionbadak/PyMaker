Natural Text
I am currently trying to write to another python file to replace a variable using user input.Suppose I have file_a.py and file_b.pyI want to execute file b to grab a variable from file a. Then save that userinput value to var1 in file_a.py. Example:file_a.py contents:file_b.py contents:
If both files are in the same folder you can:file_b.pyOrBut, Do you know that you can't modify the another file itself?  will be changed in the memory, but if you open ,  will be "/path/to/file".P.S: A little suggestion  --> .Edit: I think this will be good by your level (you are doing this like homework, if I make something more efficient or with some modules the teacher would notice it).A better code (faster, with less memory usage and maybe better in general) could be find in this question.
Are you trying to edit the text of ? If so then you could look into the package . If you are importing file_a as a module, you can edit its global variables as such: This is called "monkey patching" and the effect will be inplace until the program exits. Executing it next time will have no effect. However, I feel like this question is likely misguided. Can I ask what you are trying to accomplish?
