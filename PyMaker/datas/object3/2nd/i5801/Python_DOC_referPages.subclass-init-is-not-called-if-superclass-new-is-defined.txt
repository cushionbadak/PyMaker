See the following ipython session:What is going on here? Why does defining  in  prevent the  from running in ?
You are returning an invalid value from .  Quoting the documentation:If  returns an instance of cls, then the new instance’s  method will be invoked ... If  does not return an instance of cls, then the new instance’s  method will not be invoked.Note that the first argument to  is a class, not an object. 's job is to allocate the object, often by calling .Try this:
From the datamodel documentation:If  does not return an instance of , then the new instance’s  method will not be invoked.So, try again like this:
Your  function signature implies you don't quite understand what is going on. The first argument to  will be the class, calling it  which is conventionally used for the instance should be a warning:  is a constructor, the instance doesn't exist yet. So what happens is you are returning an object that isn't the same type as the class, (it is the class in fact, so it is of type ) thus,  is skipped! You want something like this:
