Natural Text
Here I'm using  and  to retrieve a certain email message based on certain criteria (i.e. who it's from and the subject).In the email, using gmail on my desktop, there is a link that appears like this (please note, the # character represents sensitive information):When printing the email text as python has retrieved it, I get this bad link:Python is somehow adding an  character between  and  and it is also adding several  characters.What is python doing?  Ideas on how to fix this?
What you're seeing is quoted-printable encoding. It's one way of encoding arbitrary bytes into ASCII text for transmission through e.g. email. Among the consequences of this encoding are the following:Each  character in your message gets encoded into  (because 0x3d is the character code for ).Lines are wrapped at 76 characters by inserting the sequence  (basically an escaped newline which the decoder will strip out). I bet one of these newlines got inserted in the middle of your link.You can convert the encoded text back to the original bytes using the  module from the standard library. Some parts of Python's email handling library may also do this for you.
