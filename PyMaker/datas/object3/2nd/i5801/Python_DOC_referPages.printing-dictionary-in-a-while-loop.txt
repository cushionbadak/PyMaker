I have been looking around to see if anyone has actually done it but couldn't find it so hoping I can get some help here.I created this dict and I want to use a  loop to output it this way: I am able to do it with a  loop, just curious how it can be done with a  loop. 
You can make your dictionary an  calling  (Python 2.x), or  on the  (Python 3.x)Note: We're importing  on Python 2.x because  would be a statement instead of a function, and hence the line  would actually fail
Here's another option, using the  method.typical outputThis code doesn't modify the contents of , since in Python 2  creates a list of the (key, value) pairs of the dictionary. In Python 3 it returns a dynamic View object, which doesn't have a  method, so this code won't work there.Bear in mind that a  is an unordered collection, so the output order may not be what you expect.
Use following code:
You can do this with  loop.
This is an absurd requirement, but here is one way to do it:CAUTION:After the  has finished executing,  will be empty.
You can use Python 2.7Python 3
