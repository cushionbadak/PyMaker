I'm running a Flask project. I was trying to logging all logs from debug level to console. Here is my code:Here is the result (one of the weird thing is there are two 'crazy' printed):I cannot find anything on console. There is even no 'test' displayed on the console. So where is my logs?My Python is v2.7.13 on CentOS 6.9.Update the logging with basicConfig:
I just found the root reason. I was trying to use Ansible in my project but seems any import will cause the logging not working. I didn't peep into the source code of Ansible yet but I used a test code then discovered it.Any import from Ansible module causes the logging disappearing. I'll try to find why. My Ansible version is 2.4.2.0
