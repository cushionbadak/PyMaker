I'm newbie in python. Now I'm working with python related project. I saw following code while I am searching in google related to project.What does  do inside  function? Also, When and where should I use it?
It's hard to answer, without knowing more of how this method  works.  But here are 2 educated guesses which might be accurate: would be an empty dictionary.  Dictionaries are very important and useful in Python and work with key:value pairs.  For instance, the following would be a more useful dictionary than the empty one given: would create a dictionary that has 2 keys ( and ), which are associated with the 2 phone numbers.  For instance,  would yield . would be a JSON representation of an empty "Python dictionary". I put Python dictionary in quotes because a key aspect of the JSON representation is that it can "talk" across different languages.  You can write an object to a JSON structure in Python, then open it up in Javascript, or many other languages.  (I mention Javascript because that is where JSON originally comes from.)But back to your question of what it's doing in that method.  If I were to guess, I'd say that the method:Looks for a string that is in a JSON representation.Looks for some relevant key name in that representation, such as something like .If it cannot find the  keyword, then it uses a default path.In this case, that's what's happening, and what the author of that snippet of code wanted.  However, s/he couldn't simply pass  or an empty string, if indeed there was some requirement of a JSON representation of an object/dictionary.  That's all entirely conjecture, though.
According to documentation:https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/face_recognition.html#face_recognition.api.load_image_fileSo you need to pas image path or object.  sims incomplete code to me.
