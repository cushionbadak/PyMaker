I started with python a few months ago and I have several projects in mind, but what has been stopping me a lot is the fact of using libraries, because It seems to me like I'm just learning to use a library instead of improving my skills. So... should I worry about that as a beginner?
I would recommend using libraries, even though it may feel like "cheating" at first. Thousands of hours of work have gone into developing high-quality libraries for Python that allow you to finish more sophisticated projects with greater ease. As some commenters have noted, there's no use in "re-inventing the wheel". At first, when you work on small simple programs, a few well-placed library function calls may compose the bulk of your code. It will take some time to learn which functions are readily available and how to use them, but this will assist you in future projects as well. On the other hand, if there is a concept that you wish to better understand, it could be worth implementing yourself. For example, in almost all contexts, implementing matrix multiplication from scratch in Python is definitely a waste of your time, since the  library provides this functionality and will perform faster than any code you write. If you're interested in how matrix multiplication is performed, and want to investigate more efficient algorithms for doing so, only then is it worth implementing yourself (why you would be doing this in Python is besides the point).In short, for educational purposes, when you want to know how something works, you can try building it yourself. Otherwise, please, use the libraries! They are there for a reason.
