I have an if/then statement that is not behaving as such. My level of expertise is about 1/10. I'm trying to take a user input value and give a variable outputdepending on the value.  My script gives me 10, which is each function returning 5, which is wrongI want it to spit out the correct values, like 3 and 4, totaling 7.But, it always prints out 5 and 5, totaling 10 and I don't know why...  
I guess you are not using Python 3, cause raw_input is just renamed input() in Python 3. When I tried running your code with input(), it had a bunch of problems because you are comparing a string value (input() returns a string) to an integer value (120 for example). Try fixing this for the time being and keep us posted with your new results. :)
raw_input() and input() handle things differently, so when I used raw_input() instead of input() It changed the code enough to fail me out. Why it did that I do not know, but it did.
