Natural Text
I would love to check if the letters from a text appear in another text in the same order.I would like that the order is checked too so that the elements appear in the same order in the other string : True else False.At the moment my code only checks if the letters also appear in the string but not if they are in the same order.
i assume your "in order" means the character match in order. In your example text "Ce" name Arsenic should return False and should return True if text is "eC" instead.first we check if all the character are inside the matching text, if yes, we further check if the matching index are in order, else we just return False
Essentially, you want to check if  is contained in . So instead of doing it at the character by character level (i.e. if all characters in text appears in name, the way that you are doing now), use the  operator on the two strings to check if  is  .i.e.see https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-see-if-a-string-contains-another-string-in-python/
One way to do it would be to avoid iterating through each letter of the word. This would check the whole string of  against a string in . This is assuming that text_collection has more than one entry. Otherwise just use  See the official documentation of any here.
Its simple
