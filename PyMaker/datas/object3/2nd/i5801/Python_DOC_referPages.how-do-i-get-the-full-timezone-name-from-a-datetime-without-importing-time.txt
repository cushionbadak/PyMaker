I'm trying to display my full time zone along with my current local time.And the result would look something like:The problem is I have to import the Time library (sorry if I call it wrong, I'm coming from C#) along with the Datetime library.I've looked into the  and  states of time, but still can't seem to get the desired result.Is there a way to get the full timezone name (i.e.: Pacific Standard Time) from Datetime without having to import Time? 
The example for writing your own local timezone  class uses (scroll down one page from here) pulls the  from , so Python doesn't have a better built-in solution to suggest.You could copy that example  implementation, which would allow the use of the  format code for  on an aware  instance using the , but that's the best you can do with the built-ins. On a naive  the  is the empty string, so you need an aware  for this to work.
