I have been read pickle source code recently.The following code in  make me confused:So what does  using for?I found it is defined in  object:I was tried to search it in the official doc, but nothing was found.But interesting thing is that  is always  when the  is python internal type. And the result will be  when  is a subclass of python internal type.Can anyone help me to solve this puzzle?
 is a wrapper, to access CPython type object structure member , constants used to compose this flag defined in object.h, following is quoted from the source:Type flags (tp_flags)  These flags are used to extend the type structure in a backwards-compatible  fashion. Extensions can use the flags to indicate (and test) when a given  type structure contains a new feature. The Python core will use these when  introducing new functionality between major revisions (to avoid mid-version  changes in the PYTHON_API_VERSION).See more detail on python document on .But interesting thing is that class.flags & _HEAPTYPE is always 0 when the class is a python internal type. And the result will be 1 when class is a subclass of python internal type.Subclass of python built-in type, like other user defined type, allocated on heap with .to break down :yields:
 is to be viewed as binary, if you want to see the flags.These type flags are defined here in Python's source code.
