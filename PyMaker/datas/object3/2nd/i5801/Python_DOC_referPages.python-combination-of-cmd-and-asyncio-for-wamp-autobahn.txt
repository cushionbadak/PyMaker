OverviewI am trying to implement a simple command-line interface for a WAMP application.For the WAMP implementation, the  python package is used.I would like to have an interactive shell so I decided to use the  module to parse the input. Unfortunately, I have not been able to combine the  nature of  with the  loop.CodeSo in general what I would like to have is something similar to this:This obviously can not work since the result is not ready when  is called on the future, but I can not use await since the Shell is not  itself.Solution AttemptsI have found  but I could not work out how to use it with  and I am in general still a bit overwhelmed by the internals of .Using a simple loopinside the  function works perfectly fine, so I feel like there has to be a simple and lean solution for my problem as well.Any suggestions would be much appreciated!
It turns out that there already is a solution for this problem. has two versions, one using  and one using asynchronous callbacks from .The package  allows the usage of -callbacks from a synchronous context and therefore offers a solution.Simple SolutionThe package  is a -wrapper for autobahn and makes calling an RCP from within  (or anywhere else) trivial:
