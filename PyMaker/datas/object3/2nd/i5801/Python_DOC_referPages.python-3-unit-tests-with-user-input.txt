I'm absolutely brand new to Python unit test. I need to use it for a project I have to submit. I sort of have an idea of where to begin, it looks like we basically put in test parameters to functions we have defined in our program and we enter the expected result. If the expected result is output, we get OK, otherwise we will get Failure, or an error.So my problem is that I have multiple user inputs stored into variables that are within for loops or while loops. I don't know where to even begin with this to set test values in for them.Here is all of my code:
You can use mocking, where you replace a function or class with a test-supplied version. You can do this with the  module.In this case, you can patch the  name in your module; instead of the built-in function, the mock object will be called:Because  doesn't exist in your module (it is a built-in function), I told the  decorator to create the name; now this  will be used instead of the built-in function.The  attribute lets you state multiple results; each time the mock is called, it'll return the next value in that list. So the first time  is returned, the next time , etc. Together, this lets you simulate actual user inputs.If you do your test right, you'll notice that there is a bug in your function; the  call will throw a  exception when anything other than  or a valid numeric value is entered. You need to rework your code to account for that. Try with  to trigger the bug.
