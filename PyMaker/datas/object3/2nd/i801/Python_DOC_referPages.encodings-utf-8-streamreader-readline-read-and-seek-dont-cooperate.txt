Natural Text
Consider this very simple example. I am trying to read line by line from StreamReader and if the line starts with  I skip it otherwise I store it in a list. But there is some strange behaviour when I use  method. It seems like  and  don't cooperate and move cursor somewhere far away. The result list is empty. Of course I could do it in different way. But as I wrote above this is a very simple example and it helps me understand how things work together.I use Python 3.5.
You don't want to use  stream readers. They are an older, outdated attempt at implementing layered I/O to handled encoding and decoding of text, since superseded by the  module, a much more robust and faster implementation. There have been serious calls for the stream readers to be deprecated.You really want to replace your use of  with the  object:at which point the  loop works and  ends up as .You also don't need to use seeking or  here. You could just loop directly over a file object (including a  object):or even:If you are concerned about the  wrapper object closing the underlying stream when you no longer need the wrapper, just detach the wrapper first:
Your code will work if you simply swap withEDIT: If you want to use StreamReader, you can get rid of the repositioning with , as  and  are sufficient for repositioning. In other words, with your current code you are repositioning twice.The changed code in the loop:Note the change to
