Although I can run commands fine in the PyCharm management console, when I try and run the same commands in a terminal, I get errors complaining taht I don't have Django installed.  For instancePerhaps I defined my PYTHONPATH incorrectly, but I set it to my Python executableWhat should be the value of PYTHONPATH?  I'm able to run the command fine within PyCharm, it's only in the terminal that things start throwing errors.
