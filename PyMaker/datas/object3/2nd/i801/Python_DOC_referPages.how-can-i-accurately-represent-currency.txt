You're on the right track with the decimal data type. You can integrate it into your program by using decimal in replacement of integers and floats.First, import the moduleThen you can use it like so:You should define your multiplication factors and initial 0's as decimal as well. Then you can preform arithmetic (between two decimal values) just like the native python types.Note that you should pass a string to the decimal initialization (ex. ) for exact representation  When you want to print the value, you can use the  to round to #0's decimal places
