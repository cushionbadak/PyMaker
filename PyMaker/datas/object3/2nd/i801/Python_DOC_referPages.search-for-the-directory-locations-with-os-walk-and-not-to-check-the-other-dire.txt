I'm going to fetch all the filenames and locations in the particular sub directory (if fit the pattern). These sub directories are located in the different locations with different depth (as it was discussed: how to get all the files from multiple folders with the same names). My problem: asap I find 'xyz' in the directory , I don't want to check if 'xyz' is a sub directory for any other directories on the same level (for an example, I don't want to check if 'D:/qwer/lkj' may contain 'xyz'.The code:
You can remove all directory names other than  from  in-place so that they will not be traversed:Excerpt from 's documentation:When  is , the caller can modify the  list in-place  (perhaps using  or slice assignment), and  will only recurse  into the subdirectories whose names remain in ; this can be  used to prune the search, impose a specific order of visiting, or even  to inform  about directories the caller creates or renames  before it resumes  again.
