I try to install Auto-SelfControl and got stuck when executing this command:It shows the error:AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'has_key'I'm searching for solutions and end up with replacing has_key for in operator but as I only know the basics of python, the code is quite complex for me.There're 3 places where has_key have been used, can you help me change it so I can run with python3?1.2-4.
While the piecemeal solutions in the other answers will work, that approach is flawed simply because it's too easy to make a small mistake, miss a place that needs fixing, etc. The better solution is to just use the  converter. You could fix all of your files in one fell swoop with:That only runs the  fixer which converts from  to . Sure you could make the fix yourself, but this is a case where simple programmatic fixers work just fine. You might just want to run it without  so it applies all the fixers at once, in case there are any other breaking changes that apply between Py2 and Py3. handles just about everything automatically, with the exception of Py2  type changes (where it's a code logic decision on whether a given  literal should be  or  in Py3) and integer division (where  might need to change to , based on whether the computation is logically floating point division or floor division). But for , it's pretty reliable.
Replace as follows1.2-4.
A formal source for the solution is here: https://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dicts.htmlThe TL;DR is this:Is now:So, in your code:Becomes:Similarly, lines like:Become like:Note that you could also write  but the example given above is considered more Pythonic and should be preferred.
