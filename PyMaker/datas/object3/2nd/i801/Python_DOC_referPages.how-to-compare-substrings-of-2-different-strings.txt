I'm trying to compare 2 last names and see which comes first in alphabetical orderGrace HopperKatherine JohnsonHow would I extract the second word in any string with [firstword: secondword] format?
It seems you want to get the last names from the full names.If a person "1" has name "ABC DEF";Another person "2" has name "PQR STU";You can tokenize the string by using split() command.Now the results will be,
To extract the last name, you can use  to split the name. It will, by default, split on whitespace:Then, to compare alphabetically, simply compare the lastnames:Or, use  to sort all names in a list of names:
Try this:Output:Note that it's case sensitive ( < ). For a case insensitive version:
Use the  function to split string into words.
The most appropriate way to do this is to use split() function:Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter  string.If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is  applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single  separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start  or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.For instance:If you want to compare by alphabetical order several strings, just use one of the comparison operators:You're getting this result because of ,  ord() built-in function returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character.
