I have a set of python classes that represent network data structures (and are also used for disk storage). I'd like to be able to call  on the class and get its standard binary representation.The classes can struct.pack themselves into a binary representation via a  method. I can overwrite the  method to call  so that  will work, but not write (myobject):Is there something I can override to make  work without the explicit  cast? Possibly my class would have to be a subclass of Bytes but ... I presume I'd still have to hook up the  method call somehow?
You can make the class a subclass of  and make any methods that can alter the object's value update the bytearray's value via the  method (that is, using square brackets):
