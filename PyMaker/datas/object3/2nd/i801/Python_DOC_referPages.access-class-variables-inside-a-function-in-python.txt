You need to add :Same for  and .On the flip side, you don't need  for  or  if you're not going to use those variables outside of that method.As bruno says, using ConfigParser:This requires adding a line  to the top of the config file. Any title will do, but a section header is required.Then you can you  and access the values as .
Here:You are creating local variables, not instance attributes. You have to assign to , self.userself.user_api` instead.Also, with your current code, there's no garantee that those attributes will be set (if the "user", "user_api" or "instance" words are not found in the file), so you want to first set those attributes to default values, ie:Also, python has a  class that knows how to deal with ini files, so you'd probably be better using this instead.
