The  prefix is only needed when defining a string with a lot of backslashes, because both regex and Python string syntax attach meaning to backslashes.  is just an alternative syntax that makes it easier to work with regex patterns. You don't have to use  raw string literals. See The backslash plague in the Python regex howto for more information.All that means that you certainly don't need to use the  prefix when already have a string value. A regex pattern is just a string value, and you can just use normal string formatting or concatenation techniques:I didn't use  in the string literal above, because there are no  backslashes in the expression there to cause issues.You may need to use the  function on your  value, if there is a possibility of that value containing regular expression meta-characters such as  or  or , etc.  escapes such metacharacters so that only literal text is matched:
