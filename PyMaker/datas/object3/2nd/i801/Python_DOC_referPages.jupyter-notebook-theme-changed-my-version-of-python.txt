I just changed my theme in jupyter notebook. However even though it's showing python 3. I input() does not work. Only raw_input().Has anyone come across this before? It does say Python 3 in the top right.I changed the theme back and still the same problem...
You should install ipykernel to manage multiple version of Python in Jupyter Notebook. Alternatively you can use venv
