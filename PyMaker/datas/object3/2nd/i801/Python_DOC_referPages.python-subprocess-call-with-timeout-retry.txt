I want to re-run subprocess.call if it's timeout somehow.How do i do something like this?
 raises [Python 3]: exception subprocess.TimeoutExpired when timeout is (given and) reached (just like ).Here's a piece of code that keeps launching notepad with a timeout of 3 seconds, until it runs 2 times, or user manually closes it:Although this technically answers the question, I don't think it's a good idea to re-launch a process that didn't end, since there's a great chance that the consecutive runs will have the same outcome (will timeout). In that case, you'd have to use Popen and communicate, and if the process times out , kill it via .
You can use basic error handling to do catch the timeout exception:The  block is only run if the specified error is raised. See Python docs tutorial on exceptions, specifically error handling for more information.
