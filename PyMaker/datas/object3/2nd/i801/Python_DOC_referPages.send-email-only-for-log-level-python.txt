There are several similar questions asked, but none I could find that specifically address this scenario.In python, I have a class that uses a library that throws exceptions when there are errors or data it cant handle.My class wraps the library, catches the exceptions and logs them using logger.I want to email any exception that is raised to myself, but I do not want to get an email for every log entry.  That is to say, I only want to get email when something is logged with logger.exception("The Exception"), but not if logged with logger.info("Great things are happening")As I understand it the SMTP handler would email all log entries to me.
You can create your own logging filter, like so:which results inJust replace the message in  with the one you want to match and attach it to your SMTPHandler.
