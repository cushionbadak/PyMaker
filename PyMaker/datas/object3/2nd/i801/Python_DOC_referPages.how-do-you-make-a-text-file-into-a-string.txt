I use the following code segment to read a file in python:Input file is:and when I print data I getAs I see data is in  form. How do I make it string? And also how do I remove the , , and  characters from it?
You could use:
use read(), not readline()
You can read from a file in one line:Please note that this does not close the file explicitly.CPython will close the file when it exits as part of the garbage collection.But other python implementations won't. To write portable code, it is better to use  or close the file explicitly. Short is not always better. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/7396043/362951
The simple way:Using  (recommended):Note: no need to close the file,  does automagically.
join() will join a list of strings, and rstrip() with no arguments will trim whitespace, including newlines, from the end of strings.
In Python 3.5 or later, using pathlib you can copy text file contents into a variable and close the file in one line:and then you can use str.replace to remove the newlines:
I have fiddled around with this for a while and have prefer to use use  in combination with . Without , Python adds a newline to the end of the string, which in most cases is not very useful.
This can be done using the read() method :Or as the default mode itself is 'r' (read) so simply use,
It's hard to tell exactly what you're after, but something like this should get you started:
This is a one line, copy-pasteable solution that also closes the file object:
You can also strip each line and concatenate into a final string.This would also work out just fine.

I'm surprised nobody mentioned  yet.Variable  is now a list that looks like this when printed:Note there are no newlines ().At that point, it sounds like you want to print back the lines to console, which you can achieve with a for loop:
you can compress this into one into two lines of code!!!if your file reads:python output
I don't feel that anyone addressed the [ ] part of your question. When you read each line into your variable, because there were multiple lines before you replaced the \n with '' you ended up creating a list. If you have a variable of x and print it out just byx or print(x)or str(x)You will see the entire list with the brackets. If you call each element of the (array of sorts)x[0]then it omits the brackets. If you use the str() function you will see just the data and not the '' either.str(x[0])
python3: Google "list comphrension" if the square bracket syntax is new to you.
Have you tried this?
This works:Change your file to:Then:This creates a list named  that equals:That got rid of the "\n". To answer the part about the brackets getting in your way, just do this:Or:This returns:
This code will help you to read the first line and then using the list and split option you can convert the first line word separated by space to be stored in a list.Than you can easily access any word, or even store it in a string.You can also do the same thing with using a for loop.
