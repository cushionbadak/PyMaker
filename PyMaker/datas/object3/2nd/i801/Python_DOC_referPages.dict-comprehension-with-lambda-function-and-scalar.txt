I have dict comprehension with lambda function and scalar:If want both scalars it working nice:Expected output - combination of scalars and lambda function:What is happening? Why it is not working? What is the correct approach?
Your syntax is parsed as follows (note the location of the parentheses):You want:This is because  has lower precedence than -.A simpler example also illustrates this:
