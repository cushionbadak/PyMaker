I am using the following code based on this blogpost (last section): where  is a selenium webdriver object.This context manager can then be used in a  block:The way I understood it is that the old page is stored and in case the new page hasn't loaded yet it, a WebDriverWait object is created, which waits for the site to be loaded before continuing. Then the actions on the new page are executed, e.g. clicking a link.However, the code doesn't make sense to me. According to the documentation:At the point where the generator yields, the block nested in the with statement is executed. The generator is then resumed after the block is exited.Assuming the code in the blogpost is correct, how can the method possibly wait for the site to be loaded if the code inside the  statement is executed first?
Because it uses an explicit wait.This will wait until the contition  succeeds or throws an exception if the timeout is reached. Since this code is executed after the , any operation with the driver will be caught by this.UPDATEIf you just want your driver to wait for the element  you can use  directly
