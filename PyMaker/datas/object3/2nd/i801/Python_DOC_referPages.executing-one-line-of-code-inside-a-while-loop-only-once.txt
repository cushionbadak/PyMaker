How do I make a specific line of code execute only once inside a while loop?I want the line:  to run only once and not every time the player guesses wrong. Is there are command or function I can use or do I have to structure the whole game differently? Is there a simple fix to the program in this form?
You have to ask for a new  on every iteration - else the code will loop either endlessly (after first wrong guess) or finish immediately.To change up the message you can use a ternary (aka: inline  statement) inside your print to make it conditional:See Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?The ternary checks the  variable that you increment and prints one message if it is  and on consecutive runs the other text (because  is no longer ).You might want to switch to more modern forms of string formatting as well:  - works for 2.7 as well
You can create a flag variable, e. g. before the while loop. Inside the loop uncheck it after loop's first iteration:
A way to execute an instruction only x times in a while loop could be to implement a counter, and add an if condition that checks if the counter < x before executing the instruction. 
You should ask for the username outside of the loop and request input at the beginning of the loop. Inside the loop you create output at the end and request input on the next iteration. The same would work for the first iteration: create output (outside of the loop) and then request input (first thing inside the loop)
