I am new to Selenium. The web interface of our product pops up a EULA agreement which the user has to scroll down and accept before proceeding. This happens ONLY on initial login using that browser for that user. I looked at the Selenium API but I am unable to figure out which one to use and how to use it.Would much appreciate any suggestions in this regard.I have played around with the IDE for Chrome but even over there I don't see anything that I can use for this. I am aware there is an 'if' command but I don't know how to use it to do something like:if EULA-pops-up:   Scroll down and click 'accept'proceed with rest of test.
You may disable the EULA if that is an option for you, I am sure there is a way to do it in registries as well :C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application there should be a file called master_preferences.Open the file and setting:require_eula to false
This happens ONLY on initial login using that browser for that user.  I have played around with the IDE for Chrome but even over there I don't see anything that I can use for this. If you use the  selenium ide you have the very useful variable !errorignoreWith this, your test case can look like this:store | true | !errorignorenow the code to close the EULA (if the eula is not found, the script just continues because it ignores this issue)store | false | !errorignoremain test case script starts here
