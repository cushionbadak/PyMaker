 is a shell logical operator for running a command if the preceding one succeeds. So, you need to run it inside shell; use  and pass it as string not as a list:Running commands directly in shell, unless sanitized might have catastrophic impact as one can imagine.As a side note, you should look at doing things directly in Python by using  and some web client e.g. .Also, if you don't want to use the  option of , you can use the shell redirection operator () to save the STDOUT of  to some file: silences  so that we don't get progress status on STDERR.
As suggested in a comment, you can use the  keyword argument to the  functions to run in a different directory. Another simple option is to  a suitable file and pass it as  to the  call.Tangentially, you probably want to use  or the modern replacement  instead of the very basic .This also does away with , partly because you say in a comment you had to get rid of it, partly because it doesn't really offer any significant value over splitting a simple static command line into tokens manually once (though you have to understand how to do it, obviously).If you want to keep the  option,
