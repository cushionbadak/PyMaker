Natural Text
If each line of a text file looks something like thisHow would I read all the data into a data structure without using a loop? I'm thinking of having the name (Carlos) be an instance variable and store only the values after the name into the data structure, namely a dictionary of tuples (with the class name as the key value)
You can use the csv library:Data becomes a list of lists, with each list being a row in your file.Edit:To get this into a dict of tuples you can further process it with a dict comprehension:If you're trying to get rid of the first row just slice data ()
Why can't you use a loop? If you can use a dictionary comprehension, you can do:You could also use a class instance instead of a dictionary.Instead of calling  explicitly, you can use the  library as in @Primusa's answer to read each line into a list, then use the above dictionary comprehension to rearrange it into more structured form.
You code use  which would return a  of strings.E.G.Sample output:
