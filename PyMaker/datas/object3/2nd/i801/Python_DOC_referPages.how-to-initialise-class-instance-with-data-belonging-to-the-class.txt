I'm trying to make a class who's instances are choices from a set of choices. E.g. the instance is a game piece chosen from a set of game pieces.I thought a good way to go about this is to store the game pieces in the class and when a class instance is initialised, it is set to a certain piece.The below code doesn't work as I've found out, what's the best way to go about this?
You can just do:Hope this helps! :)
