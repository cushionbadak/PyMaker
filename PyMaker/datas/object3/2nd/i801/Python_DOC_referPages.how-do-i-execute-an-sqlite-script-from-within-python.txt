My SQLite script works fine, when I type:.read 'dummy.sql'from within the SQLite shell.However, the following Python code is not doing it properly. I'm getting a syntax error in line 5.I know I'm doing something wrong with the quotes. How do I make this work?
You cannot. The program  can be seen as splitted in 2 parts:externally, it parses lines of input into SQL commandsinternally, it passes those SQL commands to the engineexternally again, it displays the result of the SQL commands. is kind of a meta command: the parser opens the file and read lines from it. AFAIK, nothing in the sqlite3 library can emulate that parser part, so you would have to the line parsing into SQL statements by hand, and then execute the SQL statements one at a time.
Try this. you can read query from file using the 'open' function - this will replace .readfunctionality; SQL scripts are text files with query. and then run read_sql_query.
The workaround I would recommend is to read the contents of the .sql file into a Python string variable, as you would read any other text file, and then call . Unlike ,  can execute many statements in one call. For example, it will work correctly if your .sql contains the following:Here's the full Python snippet that you'll need:
