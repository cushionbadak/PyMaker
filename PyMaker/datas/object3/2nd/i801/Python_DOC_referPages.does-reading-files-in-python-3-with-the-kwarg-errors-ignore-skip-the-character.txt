Natural Text
It to me there should be some sort of consequence for errors when reading a file that may or may not be in an particular encoding...for instance here I was advised to use the kwarg  to ignore errors when reading a file:But I'm uncertain if the entire file is skipped or just that character in the file when being read...
It only ignores the encoding errors in the file, not the entire file (Ignore errors handler)
