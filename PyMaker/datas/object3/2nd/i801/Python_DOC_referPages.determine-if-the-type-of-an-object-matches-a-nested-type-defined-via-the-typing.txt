With the typing module, it's possible to specify arbitrary nested types, like  or . Is there a way to determine whether the type of an object matches such a type? Something along the lines ofI didn't really expect  to work for this, but I'm wondering if there is some other accepted way of doing this.
Generics appeared in python as a part of type hinting. So convenient way to use List[str] is a type hint for variable or function parameter:orMost modern IDEs like PyCharm or Athom has plugins which are support static type check for python code, also look at mypy. If strict run time type check is necessary, it's possible to iterate over list and check each item type, but it is not a good design.
