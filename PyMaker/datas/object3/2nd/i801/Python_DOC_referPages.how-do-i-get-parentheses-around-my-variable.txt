This question already has an answer here:Print Combining Strings and Numbers                    9 answers                I'm doing one of my first assignments and I can't find out how to put parentheses around a variable when I go to print it.I've tried(xs){xs}[xs}But none get parentheses around itprint(z)For the 2nd to last line of code I want it to say Did you know that half of your number (5) is 2?5 is just an example number but I want it in parentheses!
Do it like so:
you just need to add the pharentesis in the right place, something like this:z = ("Did you know that half of your favorite number" + ' (' + xs + ') ' + 'is' + ' ' + ys + '?')
I am not exactly sure if that is what you need but you just have to concat  and  around your variable.
