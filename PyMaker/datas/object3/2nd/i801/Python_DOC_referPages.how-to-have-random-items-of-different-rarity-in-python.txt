I'm making a code in which there is suppose, a box, and when you open the box you will either get a weapon that is common, uncommon, rare or legendary. But the problem is all the weapons have the same chance of occurring so how do I change the code so that it's more difficult for rarer weapons to spawn?
python 3.x:You can use random.choices and supply a distribution for the randomness:Output:Distributions can be absolute or cumulative - absolute ones are internally converted into cumulativ ones. See the dokuI use collections.Counter to count the resulting 1000 random draws.python 2.x:You can create a list with the correct amount of things in it and draw via  in a loop (no random.choices for you, sorry):There are several not-quite dupes for this:Python Random choice with 'percentage'Generate random numbers with a given (numerical) distributionHow can I generate random numbers in Python? (some specific distributions)
Numpy can help you with that, the p value is the probability and the sum must be 1. In the example I added Counter to show the occurrence of each item.
