I'm wondering why I can't terminate a batch file raised from one function by using another function.What I'm trying to do is to manage the batch file on my dedicated computer by Telebot.My  file:I've written a separated module  with functions to start and kill this batch file:And when I'm starting the batch file using the  command it works fine and the batch file is launching properly:But when I'm trying to terminate this batch with the  command the batch file ignores that and continues to work:How can I kill it?
I am calling the batch through a new  process. In some cases, it feels that the commands in the batch are running in the 'background':Now you are having the batch running isolated in a new CMD process, that can be easily killed using  via Popen. Note: You might need to provide full paths to , depending on how your 'main script' is started.
