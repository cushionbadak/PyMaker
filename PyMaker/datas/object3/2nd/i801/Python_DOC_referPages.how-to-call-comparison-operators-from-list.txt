Hi I want to install some kind of adjustable comparer where an element from a list a is compared to an element of a list Values with an operator which is read from a list Operators
Using  even in some situation it is unstable, but if only consider your case , it work as expected and better solution is  
Instead of comparison symbols, use the function from operators.May be this can help!

use
