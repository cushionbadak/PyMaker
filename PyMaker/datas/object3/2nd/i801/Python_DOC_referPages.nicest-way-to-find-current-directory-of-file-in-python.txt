This question already has an answer here:How to properly determine current script directory?                    13 answers                I'm looking for a replacement ofMy working path isnâ€™t the path of the file. So when I want to load a file, I need a way to generate the relative path compared to my working directory.I want to update to pathlib (or whatever else is out there). But what is the nicest way to do the same?I found https://stackoverflow.com/a/44188489, but I don't think this solution looks better than my current way. Remark:It's not a duplicate of How to properly determine current script directory?, since I explicitly asked about the nicest way. Most of the solutions in the other post don't look nice, or are already mentioned in the my question. The solutiongiven here is much better than the solutions given in the other question, since it's easy to understand, and a really pythonic way to solve it. If this question was a dublicate, on the other post an equally good answer would exist.
If you're looking to do the same with , it could look like this:Unless you're changing current working directory, you may not really need/want to use .If you actually do not need to know what  would be, you can also just get the  directly:Which gives you new  replacing the file name.
