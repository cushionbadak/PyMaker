I'm just learning a Python, and as everyone knows, the best way is practice ;)And now I have a job, and I want to try to do it in python, but I need some advice. Well... I have a few CSV files. The structure looks like:1st CVS    workerID, workerName, workerPhoneNumber2th and the other CSVs contains a subset of this first set.I mean, in the first file there are, for example, 10,000 employees, and in each of them, there is a section of the same employees.For example:in the first file, I have in second file:and 3th file: I have to check the validity of all users in all files. I mean: check than Anna form all files have the same ID and phone in other filers and same for all results (that's huge file 100k rows). Then I will return all mismatches.An addition problem is some "NA" in rows.I've just finished a numpy tutorial, but i don't know how to bite it. I don't even know that a good practice to use a numpy. So I need your advice... how I can handle with this problem?EDIT: Workes have unique names :) Its random string actually not a name :D just example :D in single file IDs is unique too
The use of standard functions and data structures will be enough.Let's represents your files by a list of dictionaries using list comprehensions:Then, if you want to check your records based on the user name, use a dictionary with the name as key and the record as value:and check for each name if you have duplicated ids. If so, save it to output:Note we could deduce the list of permutations using permutations from itertools:https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.htmlHope this helps!
