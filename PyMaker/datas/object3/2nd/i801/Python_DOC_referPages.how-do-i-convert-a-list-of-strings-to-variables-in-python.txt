This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                For example, if I have S=['a','b','c'], I want to have 3 variables a_value=0, b_value=0, c_value=0. Maybe I am approaching it a wrong way, but at the moment that is what I am trying to do!
You can assign the list items with commas
Python allows you to dynamically create global (not local) variables by setting them in the dictionary returned by the  function. Using your list would look like this:which printsas expected. Note that the scope of a "global variable" in Python is the module in which the  function is called - this may be different than what you would expect coming from other languages.As mentioned in comments, there is almost always a better approach that leads to nicer code that is easier to debug.
