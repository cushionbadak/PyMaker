I'm working through someone else's poorly documented code (it uses tf-idf to find clusters of documents), and I came across this:It's supposed to unpickle doc_cluster.pkl, but when I run it, I get a DepreciationWarning that says that the file was generated with a joblib version less than 0.10, and it requests that I regenerate the file. However, I can't do that, because I didn't create doc_cluster.pkl. So is it ok to just move forward and ignore the warning, or will that mess things up down the line?
A deprecation warning is just a warning, and loading succeeds. The pickle file is still being loaded and supported, at least in this version of sklearn (which bundles the 3rd party  project). A future version of  may stop supporting that specific format, but that hasn't happened yet.You can re-create the pickle file with the current version, simply by dumping the same object back to disk:Also see the  persistence documentation.Alternatively, you could suppress the warning, by using a warning filter. You can set filters in the  environment variable, with the  command-lne switch (I'd use the string ), or by using the  module directly:
Deprecation Warnings are only warnings that tell you that the code your using has been updated in the package and that there is a better / more efficient way of writing your program. The package still supports it, just know that in a future update of the package the old functions might now be supported.
