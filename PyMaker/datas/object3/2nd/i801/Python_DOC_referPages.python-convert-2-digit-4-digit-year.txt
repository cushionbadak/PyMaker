I am trying to convert the date format '31-Dec-09' to '2009-12-31' in Python with the following code:   Getting the following error: I have read somewhere that matching a two-digit year '00' would require a lowercase y instead of an upper case one. Either way, I am getting the same error so I guess something else is wrong. Any help?
Your  and  patterns are fine, the issue is that you used  here. The  method patterns are all single letter patterns, and  is seen as the  pattern followed by two literal  characters.  matches a numeric month (1 or 2 digits, zero-padding optional). So  would match, but  does not because the month is not numeric and the two literal  characters are missing.The correct pattern to use is  here, where  matches an abbreviated month name.Demo:
Since you're specifying month in short hand notation, you should use %b instead of %mmm (That is not a valid format in datetime)
