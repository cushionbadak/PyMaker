Consider the code:How can I say that I want the return type of  to be the same as the return type of ?In C++ I could use , something along the lines of:I couldn't find Python's equivalent. Is there any?
If  is defined, you can access its signatureThat being said, I'm not sure you need that if you do this for static  type checking, because 's return type can be inferred from 's (at least PyCharm's static analyser tends to do that).
Python's built-in typing library enables creating custom types, you can describe a new type class and couple both functions with this class as a return value.
