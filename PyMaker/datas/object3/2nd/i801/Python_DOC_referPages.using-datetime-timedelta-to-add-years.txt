I am doing some time calculations in Python.Goal:Part of this is trying to :Given a date, add time interval (X years, X months, X weeks), return dateie input args: input_time (datetime.date), interval (datetime.timedelta)return: datetime.dateI looked at the datetime and datetime.timedelta docsclass datetime.timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0)Â¶. These seem to work well if I want to add a certain number of hours or weeks. However, Problem:I am trying to implement an operation such as date + 1 year and can't figure it out E.g. QuestionIs this year-based operation possible with the basic tools of datetime - if so, how would I go about it?I realize that for the year example, I could just do , but that approach will fail if I have months or weeks as input. From my understanding, the dateutil library has more advanced features, but I was not clear how well it interacts with the in-built datetime objects. I have reviewed this similar question  but it did not help me with this. Any help is much appreciated!Running Python 3.6.5 on MacOs.
 does not support years, because the duration of a year depends on which year (for example, leap years have Feb 29).You could use a  instead, which does support  and takes into account the baseline date for additions:
You can hard code a new year value of the datetime using replace instead :)This avoids leap years etc.
