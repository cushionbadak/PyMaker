I need to merge some data with some generated by a coworker. This reminds me of a JOIN in an SQL database, but we are not using databases, just an Excel file or .csv file for a couple of dozen entries, with a few columns each.Is there a Python library I can use to view these data structures in an ad-hoc in-memory database and use an OUTER JOIN to merge?example of my data:his data:
If you have Pandas, using  is the most convenient method:yieldsOr you could use sqlite3, which is part of Python's standard library.  does not currently support FULL OUTER JOINs, however, so you would have to construct the OUTER JOIN yourself by using LEFT JOINs and UNIONs:yields
You may load it as in-memory SQL, or use pandas.Assume we have two CSV files as you defined above:and Pandas:→In-memory sql:→Note: SQLite did not support outer join.You may emulate it: http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-full-outer-join/
