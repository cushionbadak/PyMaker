I want to hash a password with the crypt module using blowfish encryption.On Fedora 29 I get the correct result:On Ubuntu 18.04 it returns nothing:Python 3.7.1 on Fedora comes from the default repos, while on Ubuntu the problem can be seen with both the python 3.7.1 from the official repos and the one I found on an external PPA.Is there any environment variable or underlying program/library that could change the behavior of Python?
Your salt string is invalid on Ubuntu. Try dropping all those dollar signs.From the Python documentation of  module you linked:This module implements an interface to the crypt(3) routinesalt (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with  to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the encryption algorithm. The characters in salt must be in the set , with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which prefixes a .From :ERRORSEINVAL: salt has the wrong format.I wrote a test program to confirm this:The output on Ubuntu 18.04 isI don't have Fedora in hand, so I didn't test it. You can copy the test program and compile & run it yourself.
