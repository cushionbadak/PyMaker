Hi I have a generator object.I want to count how many of each element there are in it. Without destroying the generator/changing (i want to use it again later).Here is an example. output
Unless I am fundamentally misunderstanding how Python generators work, this isn't possible and you should return in your create method rather than yield a generator.The above list comprehension will create a list rather than use a generator. For a better understanding of generators I'd suggest reading through this excellent post.EDIT: Out of curiosity I timed the list(create(n)) method suggested by Tomothy32 against mine which returns a list. As expected, it's marginally slower to return the generator then store the list via comprehension (averaged 130 microseconds vs 125 microseconds). However you may prefer to leave the original method untouched and have the simple option of saving specific generator calls as lists rather than redefining it and always returning a list object.
There is no need to change the  generator. Just do:You can reuse this as much as you want.
