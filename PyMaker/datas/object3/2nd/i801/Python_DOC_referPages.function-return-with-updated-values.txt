This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between `sorted(list)` vs `list.sort()`?                    6 answers                I was trying to sort list elements inside a function without return when I try to print the list by its name it does not get sorted, but it is sorted inside a function.I have to update the list inside the function without returningExpected : actual: 
I'm sorry, I made a series of mistakes myself. It's a lesson for me too.  output: is an existed fuction in python, need to change it to other name. I changed to .  We have to call the function  to let it do its work.We need to update the elements in the list to make the list update.  Slice notation here.It's better to use different name between function argument and the call. ( and  here).Many thanks to DYZ, Primusa, and Tomothy32 :)
