i have this structure in my code.app srcscript.pydatadata.ptki need to open the file "data.ptk" from "scrip.py", using os.path  i'm able  to extract the script path. But flowing the structure i need to go back 2 directories and then enter the "data" directory to open the file.The easy way would be to decompose the string my_path with a split("/"), remove the last 2 words and add "data" ...But I do not think it's the right wayThe script.py need to be independent of the OS, that is the reason i'm not able to "hard code" the directory where de pkl file is placedAny suggestions? thanks.
