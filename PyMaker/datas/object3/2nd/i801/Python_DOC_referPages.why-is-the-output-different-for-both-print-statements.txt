This question already has an answer here:String replace doesn't appear to be working                    2 answers                I expect the output for both print statements to be swapped as:"tHIS IS A cASE" but the output for first print is "tHIS IS A cASE" and second print is the original . 
 doesn't change the string that you call it on, it returns a new string. If you want to change the original string, you have to reassign it with the returned value.
