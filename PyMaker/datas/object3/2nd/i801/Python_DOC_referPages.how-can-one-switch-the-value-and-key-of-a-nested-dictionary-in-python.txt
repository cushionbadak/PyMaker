I am writing a deferred acceptance algorithm for doctors and hospitals, but before getting there I need my dictionaries to be presented in a correct manner.Currently, I have a dictionary of doctors containing a nested dictionary with their rankings of hospitals:Here 'Hospital_6' indicates the hospital and 4.0 indicates its ranking by this specific doctor (4 out of 10 in this case)Due to the DataFrame from which I made this dictionary it is represented in its current form. However, I want the placement of 'Hospital_6' and 4.0 to switch. Hence, I want 4.0 to be a key and hospital_6 to be its value (of the nested dictionary).However, I do not quite know how to switch these two. If anyone could help me, that would be extremely appreciated!
You can user dict Comprehension to achieve this:To learn more about Dict Comprehension: Follow thisNOTE: It will override duplicate keys, which were values in the previous dict. If you have Two hospitals with the same rating, you will get only one.Output:

Since the two solutions so far neglect taking care of duplicate keys (the same rating given to multiple hospitals), here is a solution that does.It has the disadvantage that every rating points to a list of hospitals with that rating, instead of to the name directly, even if that list has a length of one.But since you mention a dataframe, if this is a  that looked like this:You can do something like this:
