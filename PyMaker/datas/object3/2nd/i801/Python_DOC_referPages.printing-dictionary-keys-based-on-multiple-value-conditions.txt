This question already has an answer here:How to filter a dictionary according to an arbitrary condition function?                    7 answers                I have a dictionary with two values for each key, that looks like this for example:What I would like to do is return the dictionaries key if both values meet a specific requirement. So let's say I wanted every key who's first value is OVER 30, and who's second value is UNDER 0.6. Both these conditions would need to be fulfilled to return the key. So in this case I would expect Stock A and Stock D to be returned. I am happy to just print the keys off individually, but if there's a way to append a new dictionary with the key and the two values that would be great. As my knowledge of dictionaries is hopelessly incomplete my values don't have a title, they are just values, just to make things even harder.The sort of code I envisage using is something like:I'm embarrassed at how completely inaccurate that attempt is, but I just don't know how to tackle this one. 
Try this codeHope it helps
You need to iterate over the dict using .items(), then you can unpack the tuple into 2 variables (, ):Prints:
You can create a new dict by using dict comprehension.Result:
