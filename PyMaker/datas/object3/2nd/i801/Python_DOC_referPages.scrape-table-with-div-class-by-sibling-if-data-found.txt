I would like to scrape a html table which contains elements in  format. To scrape it I think I'll need to use: This is just one table. The site I'm scraping has a lot of tables and some tables don't have all the data (that's why "if found")I would like to use python 3 for that.I hope I explained it well. The HTML code for one table:Any help is appreciated.
This runs for me. I am using jupyter and running this line by line. You might encounter errors when the elements aren't loaded yet so please make adjustments if an error occurs for you.
One solution using python3 is html.parser module!There is a simple example to get you started :)
