I have a bit of code that is currently set to run a set of equations. I would like to allow the input of a custom numerical sequence. Instead of entering 100, I'd like to enter 1+00 but I'd like the code to interpret it as 100. After the equations are ran, I'd like the code to return results in the X+XX format.I am new to coding (this is my first bit of code) and have looked around trying to find a way to format this. I know in excel I can specify custom number format of "#+##.00" to get it to output a cell in the format I require. I have been unable to find the python equivalent.Omitted sections are entry fields. The math and everything comes out exactly as needed. The entry of X+XX is the format that is used for the specific application this is intended. I looked in the str.format() under docs but did not see how I could do this.EDIT:So if I enter 2+66, it will be interpreted as 266. It will conduct the calculations based on the other inputs and the result will be shown in the same format. For numbers less than 100 or 1+00, it will output with a leading 0 i.e. 0+57 for 57. Entries and results will be in floating point. All results will be loaded to 2 decimal places.
For strings, split on  and , construct a number with an f-string; turn it into a float and round it.  For a float, round to required precision, turn into a string, split on  then construct with an f-string.Python 3.6 required for f-stringsFor Python 3.5- use string formatting:UsageStrings to numbers:Numbers to strings
