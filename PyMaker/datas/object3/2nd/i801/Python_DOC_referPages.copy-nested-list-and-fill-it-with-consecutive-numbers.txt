Given this nested list:I want to keep the structure and replace all items by consecutive numbers. My desired output is:I was hoping for a simple one-liner, but the shortest working solution I came up with was:Usually these manual iterators indicate that there is a more pythonic way to achieve the same thing. If this is to be done with list comprehension, I couldn't see how to make up a "shared counter" for both loops, so it wouldn't start from zero for every .
You can use  with a nested list comprehension:
You could use a list comprehension, instead of the inner loop:OutputIn general list comprehensions are faster than loops for list creation. As an alternative you could convert the range object to a list, like this:
Comparing these solutions:Gives us this:It seems the original version is faster (by a factor of 2).
Use below given solution if you really do not want to import anything:                    Outputs:
