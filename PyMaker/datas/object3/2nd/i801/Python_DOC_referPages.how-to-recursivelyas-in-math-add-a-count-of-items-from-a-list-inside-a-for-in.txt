Natural Text
If I am to count the number of times vowels are used in a given text, how do I make a code skim through the text to identify all the vowels as items from a list and yet add the counts of each vowel to get a total vowel count, where the given text might incluse repeated vowels? (said recursive because I need to add new nth y to (n-1)th y.)I'm a beginner as is obvious from the below code, I do not have any knowledge of a library of functions but the purpose of the exercise(a challenge in a mobile app), I believe, is to  come up with an answer just with a basic knowledge of lists, strings, loops etc. I cannot find a way to recursively add y values (tried y=0 outside the loop and then y=y+eL.count(x) and some other ideas to no avail.)Then I searched about it and bumped into apparently a rule of thumb that "dynamic naming" is never good for languages, HLL, I guess?I had some other ideas but I think I bump into this same problem everytime. I am not even sure these have to do with the same thing. Seems like I created my own paradox by this code. Any help would be appreciated.
If you just want to count how many times every letter in the  list appear in a string :This will print the following:Meaning 'e' appears twice and so on, and the total number of vowels present
