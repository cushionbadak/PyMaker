Why is it that python's os.walk is returning fewer files than using C# Directory.GetFiles? I would expect the same results when using the same starting directory.My Python code is:The C# is simply:But, Python returns 653231 files in the array and C# returns 653271 (difference of 40).I've checked the C# array for duplicates and found none. I've compared the two arrays and found the files in the C# array that are missing from the Python array; the C# files are all valid.I admit that I seem to be getting valid results from my C# code and perhaps should be happy, but I'd like to understand why the discrepancy exists between the two results.
Not enough reputation to comment, but chances are that there is an issue with the files when using os.walk which prevent the method from actually reading the file. From the documentation"By default, errors from the scandir() call are ignored. If optional argument onerror is specified, it should be a function; it will be called with one argument, an OSError instance. It can report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception to abort the walk. Note that the filename is available as the filename attribute of the exception object."Try using something like this:
