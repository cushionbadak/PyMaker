When I debug a loop, the debugger quits when it encounters an error. Is it possible to stay inside the debugger so that I can investigate the program's state right before the error?For example,I would like to hit  so that the debugger keeps running through the loop until the last iteration. Then, instead of quitting, the debugger stays active so that I can look at what is the value of  that is causing the error.
What you are looking for is .  The code that may fail should be encapsulated in a try/except block, with the handler invoking that function, for example:Execution:The pdb shell is now at the point of failure.
