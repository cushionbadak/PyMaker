I do have hundreds of other files that also need to be joined so I need to iterate through this json.I've tried iterating top down but that failed
You're on to something. It's a shame that you didn't exactly specify what your problem is. First, let me correct that JSON data (it's corrupt):Then, you can combine  and  to join and make sure the path is correct by doing something along the lines of:This assume that there's only one file under  tho. If there are multiple, just do:But I'm assuming this blob is per-file.Lastly, beware of os.path.abspath - if passed a windows path on a Linux machine - it will generate a wonky path. If the paths are mixed, just skip  and hope that paths aren't mixed or correct for it when they are.
After changing your sample json input file into valid JSON:Here's probably the simplest way to do what you want:Which prints this processing the sample input file:Since there could be more than one  file, you may want/need to nest another  loop inside of the  loop to process each of them individually. Here's what I mean:
