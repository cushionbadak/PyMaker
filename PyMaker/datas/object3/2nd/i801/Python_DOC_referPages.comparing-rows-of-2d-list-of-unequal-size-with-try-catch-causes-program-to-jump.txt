I have a 2D list called Matrix. Each column can have an unequal number of rows. I need to compare the rows. If a row doesnt exist for a column then my try catch skips it and leaves the variable the row is set to as an empty string.The problem is that the code will jump around to different exception blocks when an index doesn't exist. For example, if z is out of range then the code might jump to the exception rule immediately after y and execute z again. Sometimes this loop exits with values of K like 5 when it should never go past 3.How can i stop the code from jumping around like this and proceed to the exception rule immediately after try. Is there a better way to compare the rows of a 2D list with different numbers of rows without erratic try catch behavior?
