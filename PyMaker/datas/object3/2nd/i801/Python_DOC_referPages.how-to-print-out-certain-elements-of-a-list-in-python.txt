So I have a list  and I only want to print out elements that are a part of an arithmetic sequence  (1st, 7th and 13th). How can I do that if I have a list with n elements?
You could simply sayor, alternatively, if you just want the sequence and don't want to bother about creating  in the first place,
Use the code:I tried to make it as easy as possible.Hope it helps :)
Hope this helpsThanksMichael
From what I understand, you want the elements whose positions are generated by the sequence. Hence, you want elements from an array of length  whose index is from the sequence function . NOTE: I am assuming you are using 1-based indexing, which means, when you say 1st element in your list, you intend to get  and not .Below is a more generic and efficient way for above code:Output for both snippets:Hope the answer helps, and remove confusion for others as well ;)
You can simply generate the sequence for any n.for example:output:But if you just want to filter your existing list li:output:
 is 2,  is 8 and the element with the index 13 is out of range.If you want to start with the index 1 add  to the  function.
