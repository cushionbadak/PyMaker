[Python 2.6.5] Simple question but can't seem to find any documentation or previous questions answering my problem. I'm trying to delete 2 files within a ZIP Folder (Its 2 Folders deep in the ZIP Folder if that matters). I want to use subprocess to call 7Zip to delete the files but have no clue how to even start that process. As of now I can only open the application. Ideally, I'd like to run the python script, have the file names hard coded into the script, and have 7zip just automatically delete those files without the application ever opening if possible.What I have so far:This successfully opens the application, but I'd like to run and have it automatically delete files without even opening up if possible.Note: Thanks for the help everyone. The customer's requirements ended up changing so I don't need to use this logic anymore. 
You need to use the command line version of 7zip. And then according to this documentation, you should be able to delete files like so.Note: for anyone who might think that Python's zipfile module would be a good solution, I looked through the module, and it doesn't look like it supports deleting files from an archive.
something like this :
