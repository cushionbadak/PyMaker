I am successfully generating UML reports from Python modules using  and . I can see that  is smart enough to say for some properties what is the output data type, but not for all and none for the methods.The source code:The output pdfI have looked into pylint docstyle checker but it looked irrelevant for my problem.Is it possible to explicitly specify using either a type hint through comment, docstring or somehow else what data type will be returned by each method and attribute so that they will be shown in the pdf report?
In Python 3.5 or later, you could use the built-in  module; in Python 2 or older versions of Python 3, mypy is your only option. A good IDE (PyCharm, for example), will actually tell you if you're making errors if all of your classes are well-annotated.Extracting type information is pretty painful, but starts with reading the  attribute on classes that have type hints (see PEP-0484).Your example, fully type-hinted using Python 3.5 or later:
