I have the following Python 3 script:When we use the built in function  we open the file and return a corresponding file object. I understand that  is not a built-in function, but a method of file object. As stated here in the Python docs about file objects https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object:There are actually three categories of file objects: raw binary files,  buffered binary files and text files. Their interfaces are defined in  the io module.I'm really struggling to understand a few key areas.1) How do I know which file object type I will be working with of raw binary, buffered binary and text files? In this example I am using a simple .txt file, so I would assume the file object would be a text file.2) How do I know which specific  method I am calling when I use the io module? Which class is it part of, as multiple classes have the read method availablePlease keep answers as simple as possible as I'm fairly new to Python. I just don't understand the documentation for the io module very well. I quickly become lost from step 3 onwards and need this explaining to me in simple steps. I'm making a real effort to understand the logical steps to navigate the documentation, so please amend these steps as appropriate.My understanding is as follows:We call the built in  function This opens a file and returns a corresponding file object. We then use the  module to work with the file object.Establish what category of file object we are using, in this case I believe it is Text I/OText IO states 'The text stream API is described in detail in the documentation of.'The class  is used which has various methods such as  available.
There are certain things which are identical between any file object, and you can see that in the class hierarchy. All of the file objects have  as their base class, which defines things which are common to all file objects. It then specialises into ,  and  classes, which then further specialise into  and  and whatnot. It's a typical OOP class hierarchy.What they all have in common is that they all define a  method. What that method does differs slightly in the details, but the overall function is the same: it reads from whatever the underlying data is and returns that data. That's typical OOP abstraction/encapsulation/polymorphism: you don't need to care how it does it or what exactly it does, you just need to know that you call  to get data.You could instantiate those classes individually, but you typically use  to simplify that potentially complex task.  decides which class to return to you based on what exactly you requested:Text I/OText I/O expects and produces  objects. This means that whenever  the backing store is natively made of bytes (such as in the case of a  file), encoding and decoding of data is made transparently as well as  optional translation of platform-specific newline characters.The easiest way to create a text stream is with , optionally  specifying an encoding:Binary I/OBinary I/O (also called buffered I/O) expects -like objects and  produces  objects. No encoding, decoding, or newline  translation is performed. [...]The easiest way to create a binary stream is with  with   in the  string:Raw I/ORaw I/O (also called unbuffered I/O) is generally used as a low-level  building-block for binary and text streams; it is rarely useful to  directly manipulate a raw stream from user code. Nevertheless, you can  create a raw stream by opening a file in binary mode with   disabled:
It is all about how you open the file.If you call , you will open  as a text file object. If you call , you will open as a buffered binary. If you call , you will open as a unbuffered binary. Simple as that =)Please refer to https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html for more information.
How do I know which file object type I will be working with of raw binary, buffered binary and text files? In this example I am using a simple .txt file, so I would assume the file object would be a text file.You donâ€™t. But there are ways to identify/guess a fileâ€™s content type quite similar to Linuxâ€™s  command. For example, take a look at the python-magic package:This would give you the MIME type of a file, e.g.  and then youâ€™d know whether to read it as a text or binary file.Whether youâ€™re reading the text or binary file buffered or not, depends on how you open it, see also the io module.The other answers provide more details on the IO, so Iâ€™m not going into this hereâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
In this example I am using a simple .txt file, so I would assume the file object would be a text file." This is totally unrelated. The extension is only a naming convention. It has absolutely nothing to do with the effective content - which from a purely technical POV is always made of bytes anyway (the difference is about how you interpret those bytes) -, and it has nothing to do with which IO class  will use either, cf deceze's complete and excellent answer.
