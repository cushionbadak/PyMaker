How can i apply a script for file modification in all subfolder (in python)?I created a little script for rename some pictures but my program only change pictures in the script folder and not in subfolder.The image are renamed in the main directory but not in directory tree (but they are read)Thank you for your help.
It looks like you've already got a lot of ideas for how to do it in your script. Let's use  since that's probably the most straightforward.  will iterate over all of our directories recursively and give us the list of filenames contained in each one. To filter the files to only  we can use .Some more that might help:If you want to take arguments to your script check out the  module.Try to catch exceptions more specifically, for example using  instead of  when you know that  may not be in the exif data - also try putting your  block only around the lines that might actually fail.Check out the  module instead of using  to show information about what your script is doing.
