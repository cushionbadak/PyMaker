I use a simple, yet powerful class that acts like a database table, complete with a built-in filter method. Here is a small subset of it.PyCharm does not show a type hint for #3.Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug in PyCharm?
The problem appears to be that  subclasses . If we implement the required container methods on  instead of subclassing  then the autocomplete works as expected, for example:I tested on PyCharm Professional 2018.3.2.You may see the documentation here for additional info on emulating container types.
