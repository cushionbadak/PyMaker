is there a way to turn a string to an module object? i want to to do a function call after doing an API request but I cant convert the string I got from the request to a module objectI have seen some code that could actually do it however it is done by importing the module.is there anyway to convert the string to a module object or anything I can do to the string so I could call my function
 may be is your answer:Refer at: https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html
I assume req['PaymentMethod'] is the module and req['PaymentEndpoint'] is the method. What you can do is use importlib.
