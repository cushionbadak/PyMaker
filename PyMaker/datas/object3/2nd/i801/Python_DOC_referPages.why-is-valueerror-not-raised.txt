The Python documentation states : so my code is: this code should raise ValueError, as -2 and 2 are finite, -2 is negative, and 2.1 is not an integer - hence pow(-2,2.1) is undefined.
You're mixing up the built-in  function with the documentation for See here for the built-in  function:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#powReturn x to the power y; if z is present, return x to the power y,  modulo z (computed more efficiently than pow(x, y) % z). The  two-argument form pow(x, y) is equivalent to using the power operator:  x**y.The arguments must have numeric types. With mixed operand types, the  coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For int  operands, the result has the same type as the operands (after  coercion) unless the second argument is negative; in that case, all  arguments are converted to float and a float result is delivered. For  example, 102 returns 100, but 10-2 returns 0.01. If the second  argument is negative, the third argument must be omitted. If z is  present, x and y must be of integer types, and y must be non-negative.It's also worth noting that the result from the built-in  function is the same as using  ie  is equivalent to
