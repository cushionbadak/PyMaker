The file  currently contains nothing. What does it need to contain, so the last statement, , prints ? I do want this method to be available to anything that might be defined by means of .
Both the  and  methods allow you to specify  argument to replace the normal connection or cursor class with your own subclass. You can use these paths to provide your own  method.So you'd subclass the  class to add your custom method:You can then use that class as the  argument to the  call:You can also use a connection factory (subclassing ) to always use your cursor class:then use  to use the new connection class:I strongly recommend against patching the  function to make the above factory the default, but if you must have this be transparent, you can put your own  function on the  module. The base package is pure Python so you can monkey-patch an alternative  function into it.So in your  module, you'd place the above classes, then use:Now importing  is enough to make calls to  use your alternate connection factory:The reason you would not want to do the above is that it makes  calls deviate from the norm, act in ways that clash with what the documenation states. That makes your code harder to maintain in the long run. I'd stick with explicit  calls instead.
