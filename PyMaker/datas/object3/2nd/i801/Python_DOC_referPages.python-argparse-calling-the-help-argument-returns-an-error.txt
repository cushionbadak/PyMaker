Here's the code: https://github.com/zSucrilhos/programming/blob/master/Python/psw-generator-ASCII-1.9.5-CLI-t7.pyAnd on Repl.it: https://repl.it/@ErickCesar/PushyFabulousTaskThis is a password generator that i'm doing for fun and mostly to learn Python.It works fine, as expected, i set the following arguments:The problem is the default "help" argument (-h, --help). It shows an big error message when i try to run the program:Tried adding the  and  argument by my own and it didn't helped. The error would show the same way.Tried both in Linux (Arch) and Windows 10, same thing.I don't know exactly what to try next, because i don't understood the error well to solve it by my own. So i'm asking for help.I also went to the library file (argparse.py) to see if i could understand better what was going on (didn't edited anything), but i couldn't (beginner here). Thanks in advance.
The problem was this character () in your string .4 - !@#$%¨&* onlyIf you want to print  use  instead of .like this.This could be  seems to use  formatting in   params, otherwise  does not have to be escaped.This is a similar relevant question Python string formatting when string contains “%s” without escaping
