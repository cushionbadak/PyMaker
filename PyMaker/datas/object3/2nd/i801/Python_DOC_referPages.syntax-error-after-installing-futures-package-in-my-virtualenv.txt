Can anyone please help me solve this issue?Thanks so much
futures package at PyPI is a backport of the concurrent.futures standard library module to Python 2.To use  in Python 3 you don't need to install anything, it's a standard library module.Now your virtualenv contains a broken Python 2 module. I recommend to remove the virtualenv and recreate it.
