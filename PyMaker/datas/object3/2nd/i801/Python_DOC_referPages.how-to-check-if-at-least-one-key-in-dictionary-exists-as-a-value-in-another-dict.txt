I am creating a function that accepts a dictionary1 and checks if any of the keys exists as a value dictionary2.I have tried using the  but this is effective for only checking keys-keys.How can I check key to value in Python?
If the below statement returns  (it will return common values) then:Explanation: will give the list of keys in dictionary1 will give the list of values in dictionary2Convert these two to  and if they have common values, you will endup with the common values between the two.Output:
Not sure if this is really a big enough task to put into a separate function, but anyway, here's an example using the any() keyword:

This isn't an operation that is built-in.  You would need to write logic to do it yourself.  You seem to be using python 3, so something like the below might work
Your solution is almost right. You have to add  to proof the opposite (not disjoint == have common elements) and use the method  to get values from the dictionary. In your case you check only keys of two dictionaries.Output:
