As mentioned in the title - how can the default  prompt be changed to something else? There doesn't appear to be a built-in way of setting the prompt per the docs or source.
One workaround could be to set it dynamically in , likewhich results in the prompt "". This also avoids polluting the local scope.Alternatively, use another debugger like pdb++ for which the prompt and other attributes can be configured (per here).
