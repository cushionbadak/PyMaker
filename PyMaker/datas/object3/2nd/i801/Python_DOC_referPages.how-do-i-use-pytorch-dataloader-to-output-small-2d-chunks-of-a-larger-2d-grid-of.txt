I'm trying to output "chunks" of x and y values that are smaller parts of a larger grid.So for example, I want a first batch to have x values from 0-250 and y values from 0-250. Then the next batch would be x = 0-250 and y = 250-500. The another batch would be x = 250-500 and y = 250-500. And lastly, x = 250-500 and y = 0-250.So every call to grab a batch with the DataLoader class would grab a small 2D chunk of a larger 2D grid.This is what I have so far..Right now I can get x and y to output but they are the same numbers and not chunks.
I let myself remove most of the extraneous parts of your code, such as  and . A minimal data loader which returns consecutive areas of a 2d grid, as you defined it, is belowNote that I do not exactly understand the purpose of the concatenation in your  - I just return two tensors with the chunks from  and . Please let me know if that approach solves your problem.
Here's what I've come up with so far...If I display one value it outputs:
