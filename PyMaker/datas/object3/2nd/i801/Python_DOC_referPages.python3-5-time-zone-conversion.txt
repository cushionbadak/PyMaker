I have tried a number of posts/suggestions on here on converting time zone objects and have failed.  I hope someone can point me to an easy way to do this.I have a string/datetime of I can parse it a number of ways, dateutil, etc, into a datetime object.when printed i getso it gets a tzoffset.Trying any conversion doesn't seem to update the actual time portion, just the zone information.How do I convert this string to my local time zone (EST, or offset -5hrs).edit: trying astimezone() gets me this:Thanks!
