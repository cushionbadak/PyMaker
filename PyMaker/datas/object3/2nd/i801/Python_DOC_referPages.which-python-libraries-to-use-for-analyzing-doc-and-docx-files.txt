Natural Text
I am writing a doc and docx parser. It is necessary to obtain various metadata about the document of these formats. For example, for docx, I need to get the XML code and continue to work with the tags. Tell me the solutions that will help solve my problem? Solutions like python-docx are not suitable, because they work only with text.
If you need raw  data, you'll probably work with it low-level, i.e. open file with  and read meta with xml etree
