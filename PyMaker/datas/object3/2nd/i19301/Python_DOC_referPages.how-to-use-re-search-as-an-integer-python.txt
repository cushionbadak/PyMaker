So I have a stringand I want to include everything up to but not including the first instance of '|'so what I did wasbut i got this errorI understand why it isn't working . . because that value is not an integer but is there any way I can use that value where the search found that element ?

That error is because re.search returns a MatchObject, which you attempt to slice and cannot do. See the re.search documentation.I would do the following:See these two links for more info about slicing strings.
