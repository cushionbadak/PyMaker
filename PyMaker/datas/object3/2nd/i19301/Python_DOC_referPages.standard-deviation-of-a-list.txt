I want to find mean and standard deviation of 1st, 2nd,... digits of several (Z) lists. For example, I haveNow I want to take the mean and std of , the mean and std of , etc.(ie: mean and std of the 1st digit from all the (A..Z)_rank lists;the mean and std of the 2nd digit from all the (A..Z)_rank lists;the mean and std of the 3rd digit...; etc). 
Since Python 3.4 / PEP450 there is a  in the standard library, which has a method  for calculating the standard deviation of iterables like yours:
I would put  et al into a 2D NumPy array, and then use  and  to compute the means and the standard deviations:
Here's some pure-Python code you can use to calculate the mean and standard deviation.All code below is based on the  module in Python 3.4+.Note: for improved accuracy when summing floats, the  module uses a custom function  rather than the built-in  which I've used in its place.Now we have for example:
In Python 2.7.1, you may calculate standard deviation using  for:Population std: Just use  with no additional arguments besides to your data list.Sample std: You need to pass ddof (i.e. Delta Degrees of Freedom) set to 1, as in the following example: numpy.std(< your-list >, ddof=1) The divisor used in calculations is N - ddof, where N represents the number of elements. By default ddof is zero.It calculates sample std rather than population std.
In python 2.7 you can use NumPy's  gives the population standard deviation.In Python 3.4  returns the sample standard deviation. The  function is the same as .
pure python code:
The other answers cover how to do std dev in python sufficiently, but no one explains how to do the bizarre traversal you've described.I'm going to assume A-Z is the entire population. If not see Ome's answer on how to inference from a sample.So to get the standard deviation/mean of the first digit of every list you would need something like this:To shorten the code and generalize this to any nth digit use the following function I generated for you:Now you can simply get the stdd and mean of all the nth places from A-Z like this:
