I'm working on improving Python 3.X support for PyFilesystem. It's an abstraction for filesystems. Each filesystem object has an open method that returns a file-like object.The problem I'm facing is that the open method works  on Python 2.X, but I would like it to work like  which returns one of a number of binary or text mode streams.What I could use, is a way of taking a Python 2.X file-like object, and returning an appropriate io stream object that reads/writes to the underlaying file-like object (but handles buffering/unicode etc if required).I was thinking something like the following:I can't see any straight forward way of doing that with the stdlib. But it strikes me as something the io module must be doing under the hood, since its a software layer that provides the buffering/unicode functionality.
Python 2 includes the same  library too.Use  to work the same across Python versions.Your API should then offer a  equivalent (called  or ) that uses the  class library to provide the same functionality.All that you need to do is create a class that implements the  ABC, then use the other classes provided by the library to add buffering and text handling as needed:The above code is mostly adapted from the   function, but with the raw file object replaced by the  subclass of the  ABC.
