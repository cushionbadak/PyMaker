Recently I am using Python module os, when I tried to change the permission of a file, I did not get the expected result. For example, I intended to change the permission to rw-rw-r--,The ownership permission is actually -w--wx--- (230)However, if I change 664 to 0664 in the code, the result is just what I need, e.g.The result is:Could anybody help explaining why does that leading 0 is so important to get the correct result?
Found this on a different forumIf you're wondering why that leading zero is important, it's because  permissions are set as an octal integer, and Python automagically  treats any integer with a leading zero as octal. So os.chmod("file",  484) (in decimal) would give the same result.What you are doing is passing  which in octal is In your case you would need [Update]  Note, for Python 3 you have prefix with 0o (zero oh). E.G, 
So for people who want semantics similar to:In python 2:In python 3:
leading "0" means this is octal constant, not the decimal one. and you need an octal to change file mode.permissions are a bit mask, for example, rwxrwx--- is 111111000 in binary, and it's very easy to group bits by 3 to convert to the octal, than calculate the decimal representation.0644 (octal) is 0.110.100.100 in binary (i've added dots for readability), or, as you may calculate, 420 in decimal.
