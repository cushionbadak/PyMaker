Huh...  what's going on here then?   doesn't seem to have the same problem.  
The final number is a  (Python's name for an arbitrary precision integer), which NumPy apparently can't deal with:The  occurs because NumPy, seeing a type that it doesn't know how to handle, defaults to calling the  method on the object; but that doesn't exist. So it's not  that's missing, but .By contrast,  knows about . If you're going to deal with very large numbers in NumPy, use floats whenever feasible.EDIT: Alright, you're using Python 3. While the distinction between  and  has disappeared in that version, NumPy is still sensitive to the difference between a  that can be successfully converted to a C  using  and one that can't.
