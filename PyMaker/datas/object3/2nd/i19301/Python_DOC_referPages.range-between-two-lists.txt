Can anyone help me one this one?I am trying to find a way to count the range between 2 list on integers; and to get each step necessary to get from one list to then next                                                                           using these 2 arrays:                            I'd like to arrive to a sequence of in-between values:                                                                          Thanksa
A variation of Lattywares Answer that works in python 2.5 and below where izip_longest is not available:
This is quite simple to do with  and a list comprehension:Note that in 2.x  doesn't exist - it's called  instead.This works by ing the values together so we get the bounds, then we generate the range we need (adding one to the lower bound as you seem to not want to include it), then we separate them out into parts, using  (which also introduces the  values).
