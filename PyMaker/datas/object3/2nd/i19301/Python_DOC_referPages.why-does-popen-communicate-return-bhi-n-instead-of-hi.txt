Can someone explain why the result I want, "hi", is preceded with a letter 'b' and followed with a newline?  I am using Python 3.3This extra 'b' does not appear if I run it with python 2.7
The echo command by default returns a newline characterCompare with this:As for the b preceding the string it indicates that it is a byte sequence which is equivilent to a normal string in Python 2.6+http://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
The  indicates that what you have is , which is a binary sequence of bytes rather than a string of Unicode characters.  Subprocesses output bytes, not characters, so that's what  is returning.The  type is not directly able, so you're being shown the  of the  you have.  If you know the encoding of the bytes you received from the subprocess, you can use  to convert them into a printable :Of course, this specific example only works if you actually are receiving ASCII from the subprocess.  If it's not ASCII, you'll get an exception:The newline is part of what  has output.  's job is to output the parameters you pass it, followed by a newline.  If you're not interested in whitespace surrounding the process output, you can use  like so:
As mentioned before,  actually does return , which it is an expected behavior.But you probably want to just get the data in a "right" format and not deal with encoding. All you need to do is pass  option to  like so:This way  will replace these unwanted symbols by itself.
b is the byte representation and \n is the result of echo output.Following will print only the result data
