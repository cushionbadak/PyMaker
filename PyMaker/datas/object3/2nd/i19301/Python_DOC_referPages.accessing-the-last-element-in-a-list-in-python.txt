I have a list for example: list_a = [0,1,3,1]and I am trying to iterate through each number this loop, and if it hits the last "1" in the list, print "this is the last number in the list"since there are two 1's, what is a way to access the last 1 in the list?I tried:This does not work since the second element is also a 1.Tried:also did not work, since there are two 1's
You can use enumerate to iterate through both the items in the list, and the indices of those items.Result:
 is the way to access the last element
Tested on Python 2.7.3
The output is 4, the index in array a of the last integer. If you want to include types other than integers, you can change the type(2) to type(2.2) or something.
To be absolutely sure you find the last instance of "1" you have to look at all the items in the list.  There is a possibility that the last "1" will not be the last item in the list.  So, you have to look through the list, and remember the index of the last one found, then you can use this index.output:
