This question already has an answer here:Why does x,y = zip(*zip(a,b)) work in Python?                    7 answers                A Python 3 learner here:The question had the following accepted answer:which returns two tuples. I'd be grateful if someone could break down the answer and explain what it is doing with Python 3 in mind ( I know the  returns an iterator in Python 3). I understand list comprehensions but I'm confused about unpacking (I thought you could only used a starred expression as part of an assignment target).I'm equally confused by the code below. I understand the outcome and zipping (or think I do) but again the asterisk expression has got me beat.from this:
 applies argument unpacking to the function call. It takes the  part, which has to resolve to a sequence, and makes each element in that sequence a separate parameter to the function.So,  returns a sequence, and each element in that sequence is made an argument to the outer  function.For  it is perhaps a little clearer; there are several elements here: (should be  in python 3) creates a list with 4 tuples, The  part then takes each of those 4 tuples and passes those as arguments to the  function. takes each tuple and pairs their elements; two elements per tuple means the result is 2 lists of 4 values each.Because the  function return two sequences, they can be assigned to the two variables.I would have found the following a far more readable version of the same expression:
