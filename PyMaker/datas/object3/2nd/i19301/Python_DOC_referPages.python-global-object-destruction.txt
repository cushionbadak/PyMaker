This question already has an answer here:Python how to ensure that __del__() method of an object is called before the module dies?                    2 answers                I have a global instance, which I expect to be destroyed (function  called) when the Python interpreter exits. Am I expecting too much of the Python interpreter?My method of testing this is to put a print in the  function, run  from a command line, and then pressing Ctrl/Break. At this point, I would expect to see the print in the command-line window. However, I do not.
Yes, you're expecting too much. Python doesn't make any guarantees about calling :It is not guaranteed that  methods are called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exits.Edit:Generally, you should avoid using . For most cases context managers are better. For the rare case when you need to make sure that some external (i.e. allocated from C code) resource gets cleaned up when the interpreter exits you can use the  module.
You could add a handler for the  signal.  That would let you intercept  + .  Form the documentation:
