I am writing a Python script that will take an IP address in CIDR format (ie. 1.1.1.0/32 or 10.0.0.1/24) and split the IP into three parts: the first three octets (1.1.1), the last octet (0) and the Subnet mask (32). The IP will be of variable length so I don't know if I can use some sort of string character counter.Any ideas?Thanks
Parse the IP into an int, and use bitwise operators to get it.Another way would be to use a library like ipaddr-py. I'd personally prefer the library.
Use Regex : 
Regular expressions can be cumbersome. You can also use the split() function
I would use regular expressions. You can split all the octets into a list using r'.' and then recombine them in whatever order you like. You could write a more complicated re to do it in one stroke, but i think that'd be a bit harder.
Using a regular expression would be simple in this situation.Using the  method in conjunction would yield your result.
