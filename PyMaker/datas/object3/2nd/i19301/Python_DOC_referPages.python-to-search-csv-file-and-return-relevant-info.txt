I have a csv file with information about some computers on our network.  I'd like to be able to type from the command line a quick line to bring me back the relevant items from the csv.  In the format:The csv has about 50 columns with information ranging from MAC address to last time seen on the network.  I only want to output a selection of these columns when I search.  I've written the necessary code and it works.  However I want the search to be more flexible.  As it stands, the search term needs to be exactly the same as the value I'm searching for.  akaSo now for the code I have.I would like the code to be able to ignore the fqdn if I search for a hostname or to add the extra 0 characters to the asset number.  I think I can fix the asset number issue with a  append some  to the front until it is 8 characters long but that's avoiding the fact that I really would prefer to just search for the string without manipulating it to match the thing I'm looking for.
Instead of testing if your input string is in the line, test if your input string is in any of the columns. The  function is ideally suited for that:To break this down a little: each line in your  iterable is itself a list of columns, you can loop over these.  does just that. We test if  is present in each column with , and  will execute the loop until it finds a column where  is , in which case it stops iterating over the loop and returns  itself. If no match was found  is returned instead.
