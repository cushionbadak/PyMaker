Within my script I have one large While: try: loop. Within this, I have want to increase some pointers in the case that a picture was successfully downloaded from my camera and resized, here is what my code looks like within my larger python script:picturenumber contains a string '1' to start and then will increase.I'm only wanting this to run one. So essentially I'm running through my larger code continuously, then for every sweep through the larger loop, I want to check this try statement once and if the file exists, delete some files and increase the pointer.I'm getting the following error.Extremely new to python...so hope it isn't a simple mistake :(
You need a new line and a . Try this:You can include a  statement to execute code regardless of the outcome:
try like this,python try syntax,
The syntax for try/except in Python isA couple of general guidelines:Unless you really want your code to silently handle all exceptions, catch specific exceptions. This will allow you to better handle anything that goes wrong.When using multiple  blocks, place blocks with more specific exceptions higher up (i.e., make sure subclassed exceptions appear before their base). The first block with a matching exception will win.Place as little code as possible under the . Any code that can raise an exception you are expecting belongs in the ; any code that should execute only when no exception is raised should go inside the . That way if it raises an exception you weren't expecting it doesn't get squashed.Also, you may want to take a look at the  module instead of using .
