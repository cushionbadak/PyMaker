I'm in desperate need of a cross platform framework as I have vast numbers of .NET products that I'm trying to port to Linux. I have started to work with Python/pyQt and the standard library and all was going well until I try to import non-standard libraries. I'm hearing about pip and easy_install and I'm completely confused about this. My products need to ship with everything required to execute them, so in the .NET world I simply package my DLLs (or licensed DLLs) with my product. As a test bed I'm trying to import this library called requests: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requestsI've got an  file and the library source in my program directory but it isn't working. Please tell me that there is a simple way to include libraries without needing any kind of extra package installer. 
I would suggest you start by familiarizing yourself with python packages (see the distutils docs.  Pip is simply a manager that install packages directly from the internet repository, so that you don't need to manually go and download them.  So for, example, as stated under "Installing" on the  homepage, you simply run  in a terminal, without manually downloading anything.Packaging your product is a different story, and the way you do it depends on the target system.  On windows, the easiest might be to create an installer using NSIS which will install all dependencies.  You might also want to use cx-freeze to pull all the dependencies (including the python interpreter) into a single package.  On linux, many of the dependencies will already be including in most distributions. so you should just list them as requirements when creating your package (e.g.  for ubuntu).  Other dependencies might not be included in the distro's repo, but you can still list them as requirements in .I can't really comment on Mac, since I've never used python on one, but I think that it would be similar to the linux approach.
