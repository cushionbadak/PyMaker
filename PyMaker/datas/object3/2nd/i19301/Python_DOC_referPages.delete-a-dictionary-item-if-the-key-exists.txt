Just in case I miss a more efficient solution.
You can use  :Note that if the second argument, i.e.  is not given,  is raised if the key is not in the dictionary. Providing the second argument prevents the conditional exception.
There is also:This only does 1 lookup instead of 2.  However,  clauses are expensive, so if you end up hitting the except clause frequently, this will probably be less efficient than what you already have.
Approach: calculate keys to remove, mutate dictLet's call  the list/iterator of keys that you are given to remove. I'd do this:You calculate up front all the affected items and operate on them.Approach: calculate keys to keep, make new dict with those keysI prefer to create a new dictionary over mutating an existing one, so I would probably also consider this:or:
