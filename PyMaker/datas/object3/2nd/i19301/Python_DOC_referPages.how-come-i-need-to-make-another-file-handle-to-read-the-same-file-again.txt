I was playing around files with python, so i wrote this:The second loop does print the file only if i uncomment the second file handle.Why is that?Shouldn't it work without the second one?  
It's because after the first loop is finished, 's current position is at the end of the file. At that point, there is no more data to read.To read the data again, you need to use  to move back to the beginning of the file.
Because you need to seek back to the beginning of the file using this:When you  the file again for reading, it resets the file's current position to the beginning.
You are at the end of the file when you print . you can do a  to get to the beginning again.
Do:  before second loop.Its because you read all lines from the file and  method goes to the first byte of file, and you can read it again.
You can also make a closed loop ahead of the for-loop.
