To calculate exponents in Python, we use the  command. For example, we type  for the cube of x. How does Python evaluate such polynomials? Is that 3 flops used in this calculation? What about non-integer exponents? Say ? 
The  operator translates to the  opcode in the bytecode, which the interpreter then translates to the C-API  call with the 3rd argument set to None. calls the  slot on the operands (see ).If both are integers, the  C function succeeds and its result used.If however  is an integer and you use  as the power, the integer power function raises an error and  is tried next. In that case, provided  is greater than 0, the C library  function is used on two float values, which on most architectures is then handled by the floating point support in the CPU.
