I thought there would be a library that would help me to do this task instead of writing many lines of codes. I tried finding some solutions from books related to my problem, but I could not find any. One of the recent books I did read related to probability:Python for Probability, Statistics, and Machine Learning for Jos√©  UnpingcoThe task is that I have a matrix like this one belowand I want the program to calculate the steps of moving from, say,  to  in the second row. and from  to  in the third row. If any step is repeated, it will be added to the previous step. For example  to  in the first and second rows is repeated at the end of the matrix.The desired output is will be the / . In the first case it is  to  prob = 2/7-1Desired output
You can use a  to count how many times a transition occurs and then calculate probabilities for each transition.You can use  to combine two slices of the list  - one with the last element removed and another with the first element removed - to get tuples for adjacent elements.  does that. Then can you can count similar tuples - which represent transitions - with a :Output
