Having some problem testing property of the class with unittest. Here is simple exampleExample class:TestSuite for this class with a simple case to check it's  property value:and  module:Alltogether it gives the result of execution of the main module:Can't find where is the problem with it - how to properly access this  property from ?EDITED:Ok, turns out that it can be fixed by:Add fixed  attribute to the  in  method:Add concrete instanse as a  value:So updated question - is there any way to define  so it works with instances, that will be defined depend on the user in main?
Doing  in  is the correct way to initialise for each test. (Because it is executed before each test in that class.)When you create  in , then  in  will refer to the same global  instance for all tests. So if you change an attribute in one test, it will affect that attribute in other tests. For example, the second test  will fail:Option 1 in your edit is the solution:Add fixed  attribute to the  in  method:That creates a new instance of the company for each test.So updated question - is there any way to define SetUp so it works with instances, that will be defined depend on the user in main?Yes, the 2nd option in your edit does that; but wrongly. What do you want to achieve? If you want the firm's name or other attributes to be globally defined, you could always put it as a global or in if-main, along with any other attributes you want common among the test instances:
