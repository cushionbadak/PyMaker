How do I represent an unlimited amount of characters until the pattern in the end is found (`_)? 
There are a few different ways you can represent an indefinite number of characters:: zero or more of the preceding character (greedy): one or more of the preceding character (greedy): zero or more of the preceding character (non-greedy): one or more of the preceding character (non-greedy)"Greedy" means that as many characters as possible will be matched. "Non-greedy" means that as few characters as possible will be matched. (For more explanation on greedy and non-greedy, see this answer.)In your case, it sounds like you want to match one or more characters, and for the match to be non-greedy, so you need .In Python code:This regex won't match your second example, , as there is no non-word character before the first .
