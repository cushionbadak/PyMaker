I have two Byte objects.One comes from using the Wave module to read a "chunk" of data:The other uses MIDI information and a Synthesizer module (fluidsynth) The two files are of different length.I want to combine the two waves, so that both are heard simultaneously.Specifically, I would like to do this "one chunk at a time".Here is my setup:Info about the return from get_a_chunk_from_each():type(from_wav_data), type(from_midi_data) len(from_wav_data), type(from_midi_data)4096 1024Firstly, I'm confused as to why the lengths are different (the one generated from wave_object.readframes(1024) is exactly 4 times longer than the one generated by manually slicing bytes_from_midi[0:1024]. This may be part of the reason I have been unsuccessful.Secondly, I want to create the function which combines the two chunks. The following "pseudocode" illustrates what I want to happen:
It turns out there is a very, very simple solution.I simply used the library audioop:https://docs.python.org/3/library/audioop.htmland used their "add" function ("width" is the sample width in bytes. Since this is 16 bit audio, that's 16 / 8 = 2 bytes):
