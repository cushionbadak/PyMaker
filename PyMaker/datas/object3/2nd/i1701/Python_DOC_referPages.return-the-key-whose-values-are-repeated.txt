I have dictionary whose values of the keys are lists. each list may contain some values repeated more than once like this I want to do loop that takes the keys whose values have frequencies more than 1 for example: how this can be done?
Using :
You could use Counter:OutputOr if you prefer the values as a list of tuples:Output
The first step is to reverse the mapping.Then grab a set of all values where len > 1
