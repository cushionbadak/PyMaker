I have a test coming up where we have been provided full access to perl5 and python3 documentation. The problem the search feature in these documentations have been disabled as I guess it uses the internet to get results.[Exam environment, the internet is disabled] I was hoping if I could write a hacky/ make-shift website documentation search to use during the exam.[I will learn and reproduce the code in exam and then use it NOT carry it on a device or something]All the resources available online either reference external libraries or implement sophisticated ranking searches. Which is not practical for my purpose.Details:The documentation is hosted on the university domainI have access to Perl5, Python3.6, python2.7, Vanilla JSRequirement:Search website for the keyworddisplay links based on the frequency of the said keywordI would appreciate if you could point me to appropriate resources or give advice as to how to approach this. EDIT 1:I am on some sort of a private network. So WGET works to pull the website but links pointing to external download sources are disabled, I can only access links that point to locations within the docs.EDIT 2:I ended up using perldocs had a hard time looking for stuff but it was better than alternatives and best available. 
Why don't you build the docs yourself with sphinx?Just take python repo https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Doc and run the sphinx, then you can also apply any theme you like: python-docs-theme, rtd-theme.
I think the best way for you would be to download the docs for offline use;https://docs.python.org/3.6/archives/python-3.6.7-docs-html.zipYou can then search the documentation offline aswell.
