I am trying to parse a json object whith following code in python 3.when I execute the script, I got an error:I have parsed many json objects with this code and can't understand what is wrong with it now, or what is wrong with this particular json object.Regards.
The solution is to use  in from of your stringThis helps interpret your  variable as a raw string so you won't have trouble with the backslashes inside the json string.
In this part you could remove double quotes (") from html.tothe extra double quotes are creating cyclic errors in JSON parser and HTML is fine without double quotes inside elements. 
Try putting  before the string in . I just tried it and it worked for me. Check out Lexical Analysis for more info.
