Natural Text
I want to do the following:1) Ask the user for input for a file path they wish a directory listing for.2) Take this file path and enter the results, in a list, in a text file in the directory they input NOT the current directory. I am very nearly there but the last step is that I can't seem to save the file to the directory the user has input only the current directory. I have set out the current code below (which works for the current directory). I have tried various variations to try and save it to the directory input by the user but to no avail - any help would be much appreciated. CODE BELOW
I came across this link https://cmdlinetips.com/2012/09/three-ways-to-write-text-to-a-file-in-python/. I think your issue has something to do with you needing to provide the full path name and or the way you are using the close() method.
You have to alter the  statement to not only include the filename, but also the path. This is where you should use . Id could be handy to first check the user input for existence with . does not really make sense for the , since it returns a single , so there are no separate things to be joined.Notice that your file listing will always include a -entry, since the file is created before  gets the file list.As ShadowRanger kindly points out, this LBYL (look before you leap) approach is unsafe, since the existence check could pass, although the file system is changed later while the process is running, leading to an exception.The mentioned EAFP (it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission) approach would use a  block to handle all errors.This approach could look like this:You should further refine it by catching specific exceptions. The more code is in the  block, the more errors unrelated to the directory reading and file writing are also caught and suppressed.
Move to the selected directory then do things.Extra tip: In python 2 use raw_input to avoid special chars error like  or  ( just use  in python 3 )
