Check the below code :Output : 
You could use slicing and indexing:OutputThe statement  is known as a list comprehension, is the equivalent of the following:Finally another alternative is to use map:The function map applies shift to each element of data, but it returns (in Python 3) an iterable so you need to convert it to list.
