This is the first posting I've done to this forum.I have these strings, integers, and filenames declared early on...the program reads in unicode glyphs one by one, and assigns each a 'type'.later on, we want to add to a running count of each 'type' and write a record to a file that shows all the occurrences of each 'type'. It's routine code, that we don't want cluttering up our  function, so we call another function to do it....at this point, two different  - two different functions. here they are...fine and dandy, but this seems really redundant to me. even though only the actual NAMES of the values change, I have to call a different function for each type!Is there any way write a single function that wherein we can concatenate the actual ITEM NAMES to do something like the following...?if you don't know what the heck I'm trying to do here, let me know and I'll try to make it clearer...
Create a  or a collections.Counter and then inside  increment the value that has the key that matches For example, if your dict is named :For the files, create a  of files and write to the one that has the key that matches .Same thing for the file headers.
