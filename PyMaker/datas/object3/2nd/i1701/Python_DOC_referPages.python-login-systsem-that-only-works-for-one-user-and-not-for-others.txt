The format in the file looks like this `Username: john password: psw123 'When I put multiple users in to the file and then try the code it sayes the username and password it correct and incorrect for some reason
First, let's analyze a part of your code.  The condition in your commandis possible to write with parentheses (by the operator precedence) asNow, the right-hand operator of the resulting  operationis a nonempty string, and - consequently - evaluated as  (see Boolean operations), which makes your  statement the same asand, consequently, the password is never checked.Now, to the logic of your program:In your input file you don't have the words "Username: " and , but something asso the string literals  and  are totally inappropriate in your  statements. You wanted compare the entered username with the username in your file, and the entered password with the password in your file, in our example something likeor - following the format of lines in your input file - The right-hand part of  is simply the line of your input file, so your  statement may look asso the (corrected) code of your program becomesNote the  branch of the  loop - it will perform only in the case when the loop is naturally exhausted, not interrupted by the  statement - see The for statement in the documentation.
If the file just contains the usernames and passwords, not the words  and , you should you should not have those strings in your equality check. It should be:Also, you should not print that the name is not found in the  condition. The input will only match one line in the file, you'll print an error message for every other line. You should break out of the loop when you find a match, and print the error message in the  clase of the  loop.
