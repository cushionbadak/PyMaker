When trying to add new element to my  class object list, I noted that all list values are the last value of added item. I use append to add new items. How can I get the correct answer?
This is because in your class you defined x within the class's body, not it's  method. That makes it a class variable, one and the same for all instances of the class, as per the documentation.
You should create new instaces of class , not changing 's class  attribute.So you should define  method for class  (more info about : link, link):Appending values to the list: Create new object, otherwise you'll change first object:...and so on. You could append objects instantiated inside parens:
