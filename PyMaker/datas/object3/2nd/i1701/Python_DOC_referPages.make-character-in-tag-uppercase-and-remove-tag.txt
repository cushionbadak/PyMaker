Natural Text
How to make a character between a tag uppercase?For example I have this string: Should result in:
Constantly as longest as there's < big> in txt remove tags and uppercase the text between them

Those don't look like real xml tags. But assuming the number of  tags are used correctly, you can split it by tag and apply  to strings between.
