I have a list of 3 lists that each have 1 list inside each of them. I have a compare method that will give me the similarities of the list which contains the characters, not the id. By using the compare method, i used a for loop to compare the "a" list with other lists as in "a" compare to "a", "a" compare to "b", and "a" compare to "c". But after finish comparing the 1st list with other lists and itself, how do i loop to the 2nd list and 3rd list and continue compare with other lists again to get their similarities? Like, ( "b" compare to "a", "b" compare to "b" and "b" compare to "c" ) and ( "c" compare to "a", "c" compare to "b" and "c" compare to "c" ).
For future reference, it's better to include your input lists (a,b,c) in your code instead of using a screen shot to save people having to type out the whole lists. I used some shorter versions for testing.You could do something like the following to iterate through both lists and compare the results. This is neater than using Output:You're probably better off storing the scores in a different array than the one you're keeping your lists in.
Just use a second nested loop like that
You could also use  to compare all of your sublists. Also, in your  function you may want to consider returning a value that indicates sublists are not comparable rather than raising an exception so that you don't short circuit your loop prematurely when comparing a larger set of sublists.Following is an example (also includes a slightly simpler version of your  function that returns  when lists are not comparable due to length, but does not perform the comparison of a list against itself since the return value will always be 100 in that situation and seems to be a performance waste).
