I have an IP address  (ie: ) in string form that I'm hashing, and taking the first 4 bytes of that hash. I want to then convert that hashed result to binary format:I tried doing the following, but I only get 30 bits instead of 32 (I remove the first 2 chars of the string because it's the  prefix):How can I do this correctly? The result of  looks something like b',\xc3Z\xfb'. I've tried the methods here and none work with the format I'm converting from. Convert bytes to bits in pythonWhat I have: 4 bytes from the Hash of a 32 bit IP Address string, ie: What I'm trying to get: the 32 binary representation as a string, ie: 
Guess this would does the work
 gives you a binary representation of an integer. The particular integer you're asking for a binary representation of in this case is the result of , which happens to be 751000315:The binary representation of 751000315 that  gives you is , which is correct:It has thirty digits (plus the  prefix) because that's how many digits are necessary to represent that integer. if the result of  had been, say, the integer  (for example, if  were ), the binary representation  gave you would be , which is even shorter. can't guess that you want leading zeroes, and it certainly can't guess how many. What you need to do is format your integer, like this:â€¦ or, in the extreme example I gave above:
