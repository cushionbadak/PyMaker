I am trying to create a leader board for a quiz that I am creating. I have wrote the code to write the users name and their score in an external file, and they are currently in the order of which they were sent there, like so:I want to put them into size order so they look like so:I have spent quite while trying to figure it out but I am having a lot of trouble. I would really appreciate it if someone could help.This is the code I am using to send the data to an external file:
Maybe consider to create a dictionary and then you can sort of 'sort' the dictionary.Here is a link with an example:How to sort python dictionary by keysExample code is: Otherwise, there is also the function 'sorted' which sorts however the key, so in your case the names. Lastly, there is a good website from python.org:How To: sorting
If you're storing people and their scores in a dictionary, you can create a list of tuples from the dictionary that is sorted.If you want to then write to a file, you just need to loop through the sorted list and write each value in the list.Here is an example of how to get a list of people containing their name and their score.Each splitLine is a list of size 2, the first element is the name, the second is the score. You can then add to your blank dictionary by stating that the first element (the name) is the value and the second element (the number) is the key.
instead of using string to store username and score, use  to store it as key/value pair,First let's create a dictionary,Now use  function to sort items of dictionary, you can get dictionary items using .  gives you list of tuple in this format, . This list of tuple has name on index 0, and score on index 1, hence we need to sort it on index . You can use lambda for provide  you want to use for sorting.Finally use  because default behavior of  is to sort in ascending order,Now open a file and write to it.Quick summary of what is happening above.Create a dictionary to store your data.use  to get data out of dictionary in form of list of tuple.use  function to sort this list of tuple on index .use  for descending order.use  to open a file and write sorted data to it.Complete code,It will write to a file  in  drive (windows).
