I wrote this class:But when I try to use it ...I'm getting an error:What am I doing wrong?
 is not an error â€“ it's the representation of your object.A little experimentation shows that  has all the attributes you assigned it:If you want to change the representation that gets shown when you print instances of your class, you need to write a special  method to tell Python how they should be represented, for example:There's also a  method you can define, which Python will use in preference to  when printing objects if both are defined. You should think of  as returning an informal, human-friendly representation of an object, and  as the formal representation (which, if possible, should be a valid Python expression that could be used to make an exact copy of it, as in my example above).
