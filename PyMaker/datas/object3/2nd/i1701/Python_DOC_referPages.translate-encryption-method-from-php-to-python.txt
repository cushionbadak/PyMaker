So I'm trying to implement a system where user authentication is based on external sql.This external sql is on my first website where I have a lot of users and I simply want them to login with the same credentials.The passwords stored in the database are encrypted so I need to figure out the encryption method. I have full access to the website so I found this php code (site is based on php):and also this:My question is:how to translate this method to python?I don't quite understand the randomness and how to repeat it. Cou;ld someone explain?Thanks,C//edit:I mean I don't understand where this middle part is saved and thus how can it ever be compared to crypt(password, the_same_function(but gives totally different value);succesfullyI feel like I'm missing something obvious here, could someone explain? I know it's basic.Thanks again
Main magic here is in 2 lines:the one that you mentioned:and the one which checks if password is changed:in fist one the salt for the password is generated, in second hashed password from database is used to extract the salt which has to be used in  methodHere you have more info: http://php.net/manual/en/faq.passwords.php#faq.passwords.saltminus may be because you didn't put enough work at first and ( the thing that made it harder for me ) you didn't put your password verification code and you didn't put your python code.I think you have enough now to write your own code. Take a look in the python hashlib documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html and using salts. I hope it's enough to get you going if not post your python code.
