I have 4 lists:I want to know every sting in string1 belongs to which group, if the string is about fruit, then ignore it, if string is about school and home, print them.The result I expected:Here's my code, it did print out something I want, but with many duplicate values:I know this is not an efficient way to find the match. If you have any suggestion please let me know. Thank you!
You can do this with a combination of  and . We use  to ignore strings that have any occurrence of a word in . Otherwise, we find the match using :Output
Assuming you are trying to see if any of the lists no, school, and home have a word that is in any of the strings in string1.I would just concatenate no, school and home lists together then just doHope that is of some help, I'm not in a position to test it but that's my best bet without doing a test to see if that works :)
