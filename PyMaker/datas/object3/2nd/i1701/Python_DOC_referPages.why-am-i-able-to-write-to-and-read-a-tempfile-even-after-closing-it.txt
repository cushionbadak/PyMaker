Natural Text
I was experimenting with opening text editors from my python script and I noticed something that apparently contradicts my understanding of the documentation of tempfile.My experiment started out with Alex Martelli's answer.My code -OUTPUT:In the code, I explicitly call  on the file object declared with , however even then I am able to write and read contents to it. I don't understand why this is happening. According to the docs-If delete is true (the default), the file is deleted as soon as it is closed.   If calling  deletes the file then I SHOULD NOT be able to write and then read it. But it displays the correct contents of the file that you enter when  executes. And like a tempfile, the file is not visible in the directory where I opened the terminal and ran the script. What is even more strange is that  works correctly for the first two times and possibly incorrectly for the third time.Am I missing something here?  Additional Experiment:If I run the following code then I can clearly see the file created. But that doesn't happen in the original code.
Lets have a deeper look at your code.First you create your temp fileand this outputso there is nothing to  worry about. Then in the next statementsyou are closing the file and actually the file gets deleted, because you are getting the following output:Afterwards however you are recreating your file viaso this is why afterwards the commandreturns
