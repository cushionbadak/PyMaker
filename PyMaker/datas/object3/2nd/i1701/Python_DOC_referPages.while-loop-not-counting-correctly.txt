This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                I've been learning programming in python for the last two weeks and it's going great so far. But now I'm stuck and can't seem to find an answer.I found a really weird behaviour of a while loop, I just can't wrap my head around.This code prints:2.0 should not be printed, right? When x becomes 2.0 the statement "x<2" is false, therefore the loop should exit and never print 2.0.And now for the really weird part: it works with other numbers. Step_size=0.4 prints up to 1.6, step_size=0.1 up to 1.9.Using "x<1" as a statement and step_size=0.2 also works.What am I missing?Best regards,LeoEdit: I'm using python 2.7.5 and the default Idle Editior v2.7.5
It's floating point arythmetic. Output in console for python 3.6
