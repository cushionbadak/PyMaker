From my understanding I can use this example from the GIPHY docs (https://gyazo.com/1b6c0094162a54fe49029f665badf8df) to open a url but I don't understand it too much. To add onto that, when I run this code I get the error: discord.ext.commands.errors.CommandInvokeError: Command raised an exception: AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'urlopen'My question is how can I randomly import a GIF from certain tags once the user types #giphy in a text channel Here is my current code: (Code got updated)Thank you
The response that the API gives is formatted as json. You need to parse through it to find the url you wish to embed. After it has loaded, it will be a dictionary in python.The below code is an example of how to do this. It will make a call to the giphy API and return the first 10 results and will randomly select a result as a message.Note that  is used as it is asynchronous, meaning it will not block your code. I have also modified the command so that you can search for anything. To match your previous request url, you can use . If the user does not specify a value for search, then the giphy random endpoint will be used instead.Also, it seems that discord natively supports giphy. While I was testing, it already made it's own giphy calls. I've tested this using some different characters (!, ~, ') and space and it seems to always work. See below examples.
