I'm trying to understand the necessity to delete everything from the array in the last string.The task is: Find the link at position 18 (the first name is 1). Follow that link. Repeat this process 7 times. The answer is the last name that you retrieve.
Although that isn't the way I would do it, this is so you start with a new  every time. In this line:you append to the . If you delete the content of the list, you will start fresh each iteration of the outer for loop.The function would act differently when you index into the  if you had all the tags in there from the previous iterations. The key lines to look at for this are:and If you didn't reset the ,  would correspond to a different element.I'm not sure I would say what you did is wrong, but without actually knowing about the site you are using this for, I would be inclined to use a list comprehension. The second way seems more Pythonic to me, and I also think it's more efficient.
