I am currently self teaching myself Python , and this is my first program. I am doing some simple projects so i can improve. Would like to hear feedback on this one.
Your program will throw an exception if the user enters an invalid (nondigit) character. Use isdigit to avoid such cases.    Converting  to integer every time you want to compare it with some other integer is costly, and frivolous. Convert it once and reassign it to . is not necessary. Use , and break when needed.Keeping an entire  object just to count user input is a bit overkill. Have a single integer ( in my example) and use it.You print "between 1 and 100" but your program creates a random integer between 1 and 5. I am not sure about your intentions with doing that (perhaps a debugging aid), but I presume it's a small mistake.A minor suggestion, move the  to the  function since it makes more sense for the function to declare its own purpose.Here's how I would make those changes to the  function:
