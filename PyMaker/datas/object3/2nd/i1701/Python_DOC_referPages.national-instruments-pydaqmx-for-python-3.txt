Python 3.7I am writing a Python (3.7) code for National Instruments hardware. There is a python library for Python 2.7. There are instructions on how to convert the library to be with Python 3.I have downloaded PyDAQmx-1.4.1.tar.gz from the project websiteextracted the content of the archive file to a directorygo to that directory in the terminalto convert PyDAQmx library from 2 to 3, I run the 2to3 converter in the terminal following instruction.You can inspect the log file for error and warnings.next,buildand installthis should create an egg file in the Python 3 directory. And yes indeed there is a file -> PyDAQmx-1.4.1-py3.7.eggThe first time you will try to import the PyDAQmx library in Python 3 the egg file will be unzipped and you get PyDAQmx subdirectory in the site-packages folder.there is DAQmxConfig file in a subdirectory. why didn't it work? and is there a better protocol than what is available on the PyDAQmx website
Here is the solution:follow the protocol posted on the webpageBriefly,download PyDAQmx-1.4.1.tar.gz from the project websiteextract the content of the archive file to a directorygo to that directory in the terminalto convert PyDAQmx library from 2 to 3, I run the 2to3 converter in the terminal following instruction.You can inspect the log file for error and warnings.next, buildif you install you indeed get an egg file but there is a corrupted file.the DAQmxCallBack file is corruptedyou need to go to \PyDAQmx-1.4.1-3 folder which you got after the conversion from 2 to 3 and copy the file DAQmxCallBack file from the \PyDAQmx\ subdirectory to site-packages subdirectory of Python 3 installation.Another way would be to skip the install command and just directly copy PyDAQmx folder from \PyDAQmx-1.4.1-3 to C:\Python37-32\Lib\site-packages (or wherever you have you python3 installed)
