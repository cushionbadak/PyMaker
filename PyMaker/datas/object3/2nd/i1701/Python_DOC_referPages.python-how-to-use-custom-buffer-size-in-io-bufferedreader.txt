From what I understand, the  argument to  is supposed to control the read buffer size passed to the underlying reader.However, I'm not seeing that behavior. Instead, when I  the entire file,  is used and  is ignored. When I ,  is used as buffer size, and the  argument is again ignored.Minimal example:Outputs:Am I misunderstanding how the BufferedReader is supposed to work?
The point of  is to keep an internal buffer, and you set the size of that buffer. That buffer is used to satisfy smaller reads, to avoid many read calls on a slower I/O device.The buffer does not try to limit the size of reads, however!From the  documentation:When reading data from this object, a larger amount of data may be requested from the underlying raw stream, and kept in an internal buffer. The buffered data can then be returned directly on subsequent reads.The object inherits from , which states:The main difference with  is that methods ,  and  will try (respectively) to read as much input as requested or to consume all given output, at the expense of making perhaps more than one system call.Because you called  on the object, larger blocks are read from the wrapped object to read all data to the end. The internal buffer that the  instance holds doesn't come into play here, you asked for all the data after all.The buffer would come into play if you read in smaller blocks:
