I want to compact my code as much as possible.Why isn't the following allowed in Python?
In this particular case, the problem is that Python uses indentation to determine block inclusion.  Look up the "dangling else" problem.  Some languages use braces or other "visible" punctuation; Python uses white space at the start of a new line.  Without those new lines, you don't have a legal  in all cases.
In the grammar, you're looking for (I rearranged these).  So an  statement has a , which is the part that is executed if the  is truthy.  A  is either a single simple statement, or an indented block of simple statements. A simple statement is one small statement with an optional semicolon or many small statements separated by semicolons.  All simple statements end with a newline.If you're looking for a reason in the design sense, I can only speculate.  This probably made writing the grammar much simpler, and the designers would probably see limiting code like that in your example a benefit.
Actually, you can have multiple if statements in one line. For example your code Can be written like so as one liner.or in case you preferHowever I agree with @timgeb in the comments - it is readability that counts!EDITSince your edit your question from "Why can't I write the following code as a one-liner" to "I want to compact my code as much as possible. Why isn't the following allowed in Python?" ... Well because indents are important for python, so what would you suppose the following code would do:? One could think that this code is either representingorSo what do you expect? This would be chaos because no one would know anymore how something gets parsed.
