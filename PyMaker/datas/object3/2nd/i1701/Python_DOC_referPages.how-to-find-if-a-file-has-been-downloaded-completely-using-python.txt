We are having a python script which automates the batch processing of time-series image data downloaded from the internet. The current script requires all data to be downloaded before execution. This consumes more time. We want to modify the script by writing a scheduler which will call the script whenever a single data is completely downloaded. How to find that a file has been downloaded completely using python? 
If you download the file with Python, then you can just do the image processing operation after the file download operation finishes. An example using requests:However, with the sequential approach above you will be spending a lot of time waiting for responses from the remote server. To make this faster, you can download and process multiple files at once using aysncio and aiohttp. There's a good introduction to downloading files this way in Pawe≈Ç Miech's blog post Making 1 million requests with python-aiohttp. The code you need will look something like the example at the bottom of that blog post (the one with the semaphore).
