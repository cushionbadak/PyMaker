So how to the title description?So the list:Desired output:So merge the every four packs of elements!I am thinking about a list comprehension, but it's not a working well (it is, it's below my question)
You can get the elements from slicing index of the range, we can do that because of the  argument (last one), that make that sequence into an integer (number).Note: i am ordering them by rank, so (best on top, and worst at bottom)Option 1: :Option 2: :
Assume the length of  is the multiple of 4 and each element of  is an integer (1 to 9)Here is another option without using string.
