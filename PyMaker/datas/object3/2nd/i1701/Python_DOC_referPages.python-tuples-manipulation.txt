I have a tuple in Python like this - Now, I want to group the tuples with the same third element. I have to convert this tuple,a intoHow do I write Python code for this? To convert  into ? Since tuples are immutable I'm not able to write the code successfully. 
This can be done with .It's assumed that groups of equal last elements cannot be interrupted (like in your sample data). If they can, you need to sort  with  first....can you explain "interrupted"?Sure. What I mean is that  lumps together groups of consecutive elements where  returns the same value. So if we had something like then the  from above would create three groups, not two.If you don't want that to happen, sort  first.
Use :
Given the elements are already ordered by the last element (well the tuples with  as last element, etc. are positioned in a sequence), we can use :
