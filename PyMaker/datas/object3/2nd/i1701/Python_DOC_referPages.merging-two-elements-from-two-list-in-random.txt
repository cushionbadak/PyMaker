I am trying to randomly match two elements from list and tuple. My goal is to create a string with 1 to 1 match.Below is the ideal code I am trying to achieve in the end.Here is what I have so far.As you can see, the color 'red' is being used twice and the transportation 'car' is also being used twice.I am having trouble assigning each transportation to only one of the color and each color to only one of the transportation.Also, I would really appreciate any tips on how to turn the tuple in to string.ex) ('red', 'car') -> 'a red car' for every item i have in list.
something like that might work:note that you have to convert  to a list for  work:  modifies the list in-place.as for the second part of your question:  will help:
You can also try like this.Use  and .
