Natural Text
The question could apply to any web oriented language.As the title says, I would like string based on the port number:For example:This should print out "ssh". A more verbosed version would make sense:Could return print out "File Transfer Protocol". The function has no complexity, the purpose of the question is not how the code would be, but if there is any implementation already embedded in the languages.
Have a look at python's socket module
