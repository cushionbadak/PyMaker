So each object will hold one row for what will be a database table.Example ListsI then want to create a function that will iterate though ListID and create a ' object' eg,  would be the first object then . I'm not sure how to preform this but keep it in a format that can still be persisted to a database table

You can use dictionary combined with zip, and this way you can also retrieve data using ListID:
If you don't want to use any third-party libraries like pandas, you can use defaultdict for an easy implementation:
