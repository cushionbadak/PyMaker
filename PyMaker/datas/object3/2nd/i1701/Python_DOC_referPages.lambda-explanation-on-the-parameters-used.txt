I would like to inquire about something rather simple which is about lambda parameters.I understand how the function of lambda works but when it comes to this I got confused with which is which parameters.Example:Here is a shorter version to compare it:Now, my question is  is the variable for the list or  is the variable for the list in the first example for lambda? And what is the default value for either  or  (judging either one of it belongs to product? since I did not initiate the initial value for it for the "lambda example" and only the second example I initialized.)
The  in python takes in a list, and returns a list where each element has been modified according to some function.  You seem to want to take a list as input and get a number as a result, in which case neither  nor lambda functions are particularly helpful, and a simple  loop is probably the best way to do this.
With:each time the lambda function is called, the  argument is the running total (or accumulated value) and  will be successive elements of the iterable . Since you didn't specify the optional initializer parameter, the value of  will be set to the first element of the iterable ( in this case) and the first call to the  with start with the second element of the iterableâ€”otherwise  would have been the value passed as the initializer and the first call would have passed the first argument of the iterable as the  parameter the first time.
