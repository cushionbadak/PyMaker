Python3 defines for loop as  in the grammar book.  is defined as .For me, it's hard to understand how double for loop fits in the grammar description for list comprehension.There are several smaller questions:And what about ? I assume it's used for list comprehension.Then does a normal for loop can use  block?I'd appreciate if you can come with examples.
As you can see from the other rules of the grammar: is either a simple statement (in one line), e.g.:or it is a newline, followed by an indented block (which consists of statements). is simply the string "else".I usually read the  of a for-loop as "no-break": It is executed after the for-loop is finished, but only if it wasn't exited by . The reason it exists is consistency with , which has an  statement, as it's basically just a repeated .
According to the documentation, the  clause of a  loop is executed if the loop ended without having been broken.See these two examples:Here, the  part correspond to , and the output will be:And second:Here, the  part correspond to ,and the output will be:
The  after a for is executed if the loop finished normally (if it not breaked with  keyword)https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html is just a indentation level or a single statement
