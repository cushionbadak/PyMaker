I have program in python, which reads the data from the api and writes it to the file eth.txt.I would like to program create a new file with a date name every day, like eth_9.11.2018.txt, eth_10.11.2018.txt, ....  and then write on it.Can you help me ?..and by the way... Is it possible block "#write to file" write in a more friendly and short way? It must contain a character * between words, and must write in a new line...Thankyou for help!
You can define dynamically the name of the file you want to write.In this case,  will append the current day to it.To write in the file more elegantly, you can join the list your strings with '*' in one line.
