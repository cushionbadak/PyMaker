Natural Text
Currently, I have two functions:  and .segmentString takes a string and a fill character and returns lists of 8 character strings. For example, if there is a 13 character string, it splits it into a list of two strings where the second string has 3 fill characters to make it a complete 8.char2bin takes individual string characters (single character) and turns them into a list of 8 bits. It does not work for multiple character strings. For example,I need to create a function (in this example, let's call it framer) that takes the result from segmentString and convert it into a list of bits, where each list of bits are contained in a separate list within a list.For example, from the segmentString function, this would create a list of two strings. Each letter of each separate string is converted into a list of bits, and each list of bits is contained as a list for each string.As you can see, there is one general list that contains two lists that contain 8 lists of bits, which were converted from a string character by char2bin.How would I do this?
You can use a list comprehension for this:This uses utf8 encoding, but since your input text is all ascii characters, there's one byte per character.Non-ascii characters require multiple bits to encode.
You could either use list comprehensions or make use of the  module. You can learn more about list comprehensions here, and more about itertootls here.
You can use below code to achieve your goal.Output Â»
