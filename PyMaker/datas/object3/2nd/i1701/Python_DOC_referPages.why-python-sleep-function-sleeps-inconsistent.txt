It gives outputSkipped 52 second row
Three reasons:  is not precise, your computer is switching between any number of processes, all the time, and executing the rest of your code (looking up the  reference, calling the  method, looking up the  attribute, and calling the  method with a string argument, and printing the result of that last call) take a bit of time to execute too.See the  function documentation:The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the  following execution of that signalâ€™s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.There will be variations in the exact amount of time passed between the  calls. So your 1 second sleep can take a fraction longer than a second, and printing out the time each iteration takes another fraction. So sometimes that means you jump from the last microseconds of one second to the first microseconds of 2nd second after that, and the time display seems to have skipped a second.The following script prints when you'd see a 'jump' of 2 seconds:The loop has to do more work, so it'll probably print more often.For me, on Python 2.7, after some a few minutes running time, this outputs:so the display may have jumped 2 seconds, but the actual time difference between those steps was about 1 second, 1 millisecond, and 61 microseconds.
