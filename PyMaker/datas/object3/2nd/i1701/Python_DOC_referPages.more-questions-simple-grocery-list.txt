Yesterday I posted a question about a grocery list and recieved a lot of help with it. I have encountered another problem with it. Here is my code: The problem comes when you input an item for the first loop and then don't input it for the second one. For example, putting in: Milk, 5 - Eggs, 3 - Bread, 2, into the first loop and then only including Milk and Eggs for the second loop results in an error:What can I do to prevent this from happening? 
Instead of loopingyou should be doingsince  contains all items in the store and  only the purchased items. is a bad name by the way, it's a dictionary, not a list.Demo with adjusted code:
Change:to: is used when you want to get a value if it exists, or get a default value otherwise. That makes it so, if  doesn't contain  (you didn't actually want that item), you treat it as having a count of 0 (if it does have the , the default  is ignored).Alternatively, flip your loop to loop over the shopping list () rather than the inventory, and leave the calculation unchanged. In that case, you want the exception; if your shopping list contains an item that isn't in the store, you want the attempt to look up its price to fail.Side-note: Not necessary for correctness, but if you're using both the key and the value, it's easier to iterate them both in parallel, rather than just iterating keys, and looking up the value later. It also lets you provide more useful names so the code self-documents. The loop could be changed to (for example):avoiding repeated lookup and making the intent more clear.
