While it is simple to search by using  for most methods that have a clear  arrangement, for example , I cannot work out how to look up the method  in python's inbuilt help function.Which module does  belong to? How would I search in  for  and related methods?Furthermore is there any way I can use the interpreter to find out which module a method belongs to in future?
Don't try to find the module. Make an instance of the class you want, then call help on the method of that instance, and it will find the correct help info for you. Example:In my case (Python 3.7.1), it's defined on the type  (exposed publicly as , but  doesn't know that), but memorizing that sort of thing isn't very helpful. Knowing how to figure it out by introspecting the specific thing you care about is much more broadly applicable. In this particular case, it's extra important not to try guessing, because the  function can return a few different classes, each with different methods, depending on the arguments provided, including , , , and , each with their own version of the  method (though they all share a similar interface for consistency's sake).
From the text of :See also the section of python's  module documentation on the class hierarchy.So you're looking at , , , or . These all have their own sets of class hierarchies, but suffice it to say that they share the  superclass at some point - that's where the functions  and  are declared. Of course, each subclass implements these functions differently for its particular mode - if you doyou should get the documentation you're looking for.In particular, you're having trouble accessing the documentation for whichever version of  you need, because you can't be bothered to figure out which class it is. You can actually call  on an object as well. If you're working with a particular file object, then you can spin up a terminal, instantiate it, and then just pass it to  and it'll show you whatever interface is closest to the surface. Example:
