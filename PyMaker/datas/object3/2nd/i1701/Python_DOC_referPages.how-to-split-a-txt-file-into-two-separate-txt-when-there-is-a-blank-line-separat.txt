Natural Text
How can I split a single .txt file into two or more .txt files when a white line occours?Here is a example of what my txt looks like:I would like to know how to split this single text file into:First txt file:Second txt file:
If you know the file will only have one blank line, you can  the contents at the double newline character:If your file has more than one blank line this will fail as the split will return more than 2 parts and try to assign them to only two names,  and .  can be told to only split a maximum amount of times so it may be safer to say:If there are two or more blank lines,  will be the contents up to the first blank line.  will be everything after the first blank line, including any further blank lines.Of course, this can fail if there are no blank lines.
