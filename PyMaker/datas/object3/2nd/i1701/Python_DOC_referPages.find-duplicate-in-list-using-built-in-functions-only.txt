This question already has an answer here:check for duplicates in a python list                    7 answers                I am a TOTAL Noob so please be gentle!I have written this code:The code runs fine and it does what it is supposed to do which is find the first duplicate value in a list if any and return .My question is how can I have the same function perform the same task if the list is not sorted (sorting is not allowed) and i can only use built in python functions?
Collect nums in a  as you iterate:You can also shorten this down to:This simply checks whether the  has as many elements as its  which by definition has no duplicates.Note that both these set-based solutions run in linear time because of a set's  contains-check. The naive brute force approach of searching for each element in the list remainderis quadratic because of a list's  contains-check.
