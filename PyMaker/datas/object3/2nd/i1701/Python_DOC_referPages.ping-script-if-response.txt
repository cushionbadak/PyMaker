You can test it by running the system commands directly on a terminal and checking the return value:You should remove  and just do:Which should return the correct result:For system calls, I recommend to use the  package instead, which includes  function that can print the command output and then return an object containing the command's return code.If you wanted to hide the output of the  command, you can pass  to  of :The recommendation to use  is noted in the  doc:The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning  new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is  preferable to using this function. See the Replacing Older Functions  with the subprocess Module section in the subprocess documentation for  some helpful recipes
