Is there a better way to write this while maintaining its current functionality? (checking balances, updating, subtracting, etc...)If so, where would I begin? I saw a code briefly in class that was for a similar questions and it looked more streamlined.
There is always room for improvement - although SO is not quite the right place - you might check the rules of engagement in http://codereview.stackexchange.com and ask there. Read rules first, post later or it gets downvoted/closed fast. On SO we mostly fix broken code. Your code has some flaws - especialy on the "trust user input" side - so some improvements:if on python 3.6 use string literal interpolation  guard against malicious users that withdraw negative numbers - also protect your clients from depositing negative numbersstreamline the testing by using lists (DRY-principle) and loopsbind your data to your unique account identifier - f.e. the accountnumber and use dicts to assigns each transaction to the correct account instead of relying on "order" or smth alike. In real live each transaction also has unique identifiers for what bank to use and which account to use.Reads:Error handlingDatastructures - f.e. , ,  for startersstring interpolation PEP 498Some usage:Output:
