I'm test a method which makes external API calls which are mocked using a  decorator. However, I'd like to be able to set an environment variable, , such that if it is truthy, the patch is not applied.Essentially, I'm looking to something similar to the  and  decorators (cf. https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures), but like  and . As far as I can tell, though, no such functionality is built into . Should I write my own decorator?
You could write your own decorator that checks the environment variable and then calls the regular  if needed. You could also use the  argument in the regular  decorator.wraps: Item for the mock object to wrap. If wraps is not  then calling the Mock will pass the call through to the wrapped object (returning the real result). Attribute access on the mock will return a Mock object that wraps the corresponding attribute of the wrapped object (so attempting to access an attribute that doesn’t exist will raise an ).I think that means you could check the environment variable before setting the return variable in your test. If you don't set a return value, then calls will be passed through to the wrapped object.
You could just manually monkey patch out the dependency you're trying to mock/fake. This is what the  decorator is doing under the hood (it also unpatches for you at the end of the function).Note that when you assign to the given module attribute you're trying to patch over, that patch is live for the entire session of your interpreter. So if you just patch and don't unpatch, that patch will be live for other tests in your test suite.If you're doing it one time this might be nice as a quick/dirty solution, if it's many times you might want a decorator to do it.HTH.
