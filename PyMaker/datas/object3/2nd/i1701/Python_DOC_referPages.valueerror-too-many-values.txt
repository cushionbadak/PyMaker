Natural Text
I am going through a python tutorial.  I typed in exactly what the tutorial has but it won't run.  I think the issue is the tutorial uses Python 2 something  and i am using Python 3.5. For instance the tutorial does not use parenthesis after the print and i have to and it uses raw_input where i use just input. This is what i am trying to run-This is the error i receive:If i put just two numbers with out  a comma it will concatenate them.  I have tried to change to integer but it gives this error: When i searched it on here the answers did not seem to apply to my problem, they were much more involved or i didn't understand. 
 returns a string. A string is an iterable, so you can unpack this with:but only if the string contains exactly two items. So for a string this means that the string contains exactly two characters.The code however hints that you want to input two integers. We can use  to split the string into a list of "words".We then can perform a ping with  as function:
Your input should look like this: returns a single line of input - a string. Parsing it is left to you.
