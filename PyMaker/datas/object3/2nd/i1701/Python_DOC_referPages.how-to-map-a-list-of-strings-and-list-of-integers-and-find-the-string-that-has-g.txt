 for highest value onlyFor your result, you don't need an explicit mapping, e.g. via a dictionary. You can calculate the index of the highest value and then apply this to your key list: for highest n valuesIf you want to the highest n values, a full sort is not necessary. You can use :
You could do something likeIt finds the maximum numbers index of , then gets the item of that same index in .This should work, however I recommend using python dicts in the future for this kind of thing.
I guess you could try using operator.itemgetter:Tell me if this worked
