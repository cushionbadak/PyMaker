I don't know if I'm using it properly.  def read_places_file(filename) -> List[PlaceInformation]: We are defining a method that takes a parameter called, 'filename'.  And then what does the rest of the line mean?  What does the '->' operator mean?  Thank you very much in advance.  
Those are type annotations indicating the format of the function's output.
