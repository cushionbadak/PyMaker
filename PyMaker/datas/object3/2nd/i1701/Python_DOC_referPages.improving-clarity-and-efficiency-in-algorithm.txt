In this code I was trying to find the most common name in a list of strings such that the program ran in O(nlogn). I recognize that this can be done in O(n) with a dictionary. Are there any obvious ways I can make this code better?
Slightly cleaner, while maintaining the same algorithm:Alternatively:
You could use groupby instead:OutputOr a more readable alternative:In both alternatives the idea is that groupby handles the grouping of the consecutives values. Then you could find the largest group and return the key of that group. These solutions are O(nlogn), if you are interested in a O(n) solution you could to the following using Counter:Output
