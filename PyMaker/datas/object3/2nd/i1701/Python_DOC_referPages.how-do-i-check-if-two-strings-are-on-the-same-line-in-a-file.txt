I have a program where I ask the user their username and password, and it checks a file to see if they have the correct username and password. Each username and password is stored on its own line.this is what I havethe problem i'm having with this is that any username can be used with any password since it check the whole file. Is there any way to check if they're on the same line in the file?
You can easily make this function checking the file line by lineAnd you can use this function this way:
Iterate over  and check whether the username is in a line AND the password is in a line.In , it checks whether string  is not empty or , which is not intended, so you need to check both the username and the password separately like this:Resources:Python 3 docs
Note that your code does not do what you think it does. It doesn't check the username at all it only checks if the username is not "False".This does what you want:but I strongly recommend that you use some sort of library for a task like this. You should probably at least be hashing your passwords. This code is a terrible idea.
You can check it reading line by line. Don't forget to close the file or open it in a  statement to free resources when you finish.
