Natural Text
I have a big text file and I want to make a new file from the 1st file but with some changes. Here is a small example of my 1st file's contents:I want to change the  and . In fact in new file:Expected output:I am trying to do that in Python and wrote the following code but it does not return what I want. Do you know how to fix it?
This will do it:To successfully add  to value you need to convert it to an , but also convert the resulting value into  to avoid errors when writing to .Resulting file looks like this:
If you want to use a pattern that can be applied to editing some data line-by-line you can do as follows:Of course the  definitions will depend on the particular task at hand, in your caseNote that I don't strip the newline at the end of each string, neither in the function neither in the implicit loop that is calling it, so to properly join the lines we use the null string .Note also that, in case of a large input file, the file is lazily read until the output buffer is full (use the   opt arg to change the buffer size iff you know what you're doing) so that this is particularly efficient memory wise.
