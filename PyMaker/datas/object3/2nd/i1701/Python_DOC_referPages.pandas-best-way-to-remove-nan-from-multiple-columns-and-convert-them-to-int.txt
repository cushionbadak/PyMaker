Suppose I have below CSV data:What is the best way to read this data and convert col1 & col2 which would be float to int.I am able to use this and convert my filtered dataframe which only has the numeric columns (col1,col2,col3). How can I modify the main dataframe itself ignoring the label column which is string?On a related note, I could also use below command. Any idea how I could run it in a loop so that variable name col%d is dynamically generated, since I have 32 columns.
