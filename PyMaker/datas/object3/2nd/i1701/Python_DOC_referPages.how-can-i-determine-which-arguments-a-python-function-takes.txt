Use the help built-in function of python.help([object])Invoke the built-in help system. (This function is intended for interactive use.) If no argument is given, the  interactive help system starts on the interpreter console. If the  argument is a string, then the string is looked up as the name of a  module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and  a help page is printed on the console. If the argument is any other  kind of object, a help page on the object is generated.Let's say you are coming from Python 2.7 and need help with the  function of Python 3. Go to the interactive prompt and type :As you can see  takes 4 keyword arguments (, , , ). Press  when you are done to exit.
help(f) shows documentation and parameters for a python construct f, like a class or function.Eg on the console showsHelp on my new function f ...showsHelp on function f in module main:f()https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help
 function in python can be used to view the documentation for a class or a function. I like to keep an  interpreter running when coding in python.  provides operators like  and  specifically for this purpose.
