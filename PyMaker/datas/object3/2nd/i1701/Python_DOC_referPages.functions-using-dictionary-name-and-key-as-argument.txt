I want to write a function that takes dictionary and team as an argument and returns the total runsi.e 
Try this:
This isn't a function, But a way to aggregate all scores at once.Run through the dictionary and sum the values as you go. Outputs:
You can use  to get a list of the numbers, then pass it through  to get the total:You can even simplify it as a one liner, though it might be less readable:
You call your function with the name of the dictionaryThen you try to compare that to a stringIdentity comparisons: If you really want/need to ensure that it is the specific dictionary, change it to In a function, you want to use the name of the parameters used in the definition.  Inside your function (inside the function's scope) the dictionary you passed as the first argument has been assigned to  and the key you passed as the second argument was assigned to .Your dictionary keys are strings so you need to paa a string for that argumentFunctions are used to make a process more generic so that process can be reused with different arguments/values passed to it's parameters.  While there may be some reasons to check for specific parameter values (maybe for debugging), usually it defeats the purpose of a function.You could have written it like this:or
