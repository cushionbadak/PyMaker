I am trying to insert data to my postgres table after reading a xlsx file.I need to validate the xlsx sheet data before I insert it into my table.I am working on pandas dataframe I am using sqlalchemy as my ORM tool.My model class:I am doing a bulk insert using a list of dictionaries.My medicalPlan_dict looks like below:I need to validate the data before I insert it into my table.I read about sqlalchemy validations, and tried something like below, assuming that it will take care of the validations at the model level.I need to put few validations on each variable. Only the rows which passes should be inserted. I am not sure how to work on validations at model level. How can I achieve this. 
Two options:Add a  on the column and add your regex there, seehttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/functions-matching.html . That works in whatever way you throw the data into the database.Use event based validation as demonstrated here , create a list of objects you want to insert and use  for batch insert.
