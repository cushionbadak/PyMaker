I am trying to convert the below type of string into Dictionary in Python.I would like to make the dictionary like:
If you will continue to use the identical string format, you may use a complex regular expression to cover various patterns.The following is a regular expression for a few patterns I have anticipated. Let me know if this solves your issue. If not, please provide details on where my solution fails:Edit for explainingGroup one  match string begin with F, have one or more numbers, and have  after them  match string as less as it can, and it have 2 or more  at the end the string end  or nothing Group two  after matching group one, it is easy to find the string like . because the first group takes precedence over the second group, so the second group can only match the remaining strings.CodeOutputEdit: because the former regex does not work when string is I changed regex to . And we need one trick. add one blankspace after string.
