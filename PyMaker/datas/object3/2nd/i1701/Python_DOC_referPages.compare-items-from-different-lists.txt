Natural Text
I have a function that is a part of hangman, that gets two inputsI need a way to know that the letter in a word from the words in a specific spot, is identicalto the letter (that is uncovered) in the pattern and that those letters are IN THE SAME PLACE.also, word and pattern ought to be in the same lengththis is what ive tried:print: not good.. as you can see here:the print I need:thanks!
something like this might work:it compares one letter of the word against one character of the pattern (using  in order to iterate over those pairs). it ignores if the character of the pattern is .as the function is written now it does not consider the length of either the word or the pattern.
If you use  instead of  for your missing character then you've basically got a regular expression, eg:
Check the below code:Output:Note: Its gonna work only in the case where the pattern is given such as it starts with certain characters. For e.g, it's not gonna work in case if the pattern is "__a_". Please edit your question if you need something like that.
This code will filter words that start with supplied pattern and are as long as that pattern (including "_" characters):
