You know how when you download something and the downloads folder contains a file with the same name, instead of overwriting it or throwing an error, the file ends up with a number appended to the end? For example, if I want to download , but it already exists in the target folder, the new file will be named . And if I try again, it will be .I was wondering if there is a way in Python 3.x to check that and get a unique name (not necessarily create the file or directory). I'm currently implementing it doing this:In the example above, running  would return  if  already exists in the cwd.  can also contain the full or relative path, it will work as well.
I would use PathLib and do something along these lines:This only handles files as written but the same approach would work with directories (which you added later.) I will leave that as a project for the reader.
Another way of getting a new name would be using the built-in  module:If you execute this function from within Downloads directory, you will get something like:where the  part was generated internally by the Python's  module.Note: with the  argument, the function will create (and leave undeleted) an empty file with the new name. If you do not want to have an empty file created that way,  just remove the , however keeping it will prevent anyone else from creating a new file with such name before your next operation (though they could still overwrite it).Simply put, having  prevents concurrency issues if you (or the end-user) were to run your program twice at the same time.
