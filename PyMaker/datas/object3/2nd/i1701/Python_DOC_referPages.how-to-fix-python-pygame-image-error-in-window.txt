Based on this answer, it's recommended to use relative paths instead. It's always better to do so, since you don't have to care about '\', '/' or OS (someone already did it for us :v).The problem seems to be it, because the code below works well for me. It's been considered you have an images_store folder to store your images at same father directory as your .py file (of course, you can change it any way you want).p.s.1 - See more information about os.path here.p.s.2 - I'm using MacOS.
