Natural Text
I've got a text file that is written as follows:Goal: I want to be able to extract any of the lines that starts with a "State" as key and the subsequent line as value (cities) until it hits a "!" or another "State".The code below works from a help I got from another posting but it only works when there are no other "garbage" in the text file. I would like the code to only pick up the state and cities.The output of this code with the text file as written above comes to an error as follows:Please advise. Thanks!
It is important to reset state when you see "!"I hope it is not a homework :)
