This is my problem:I have a list of lists (adjoining) that is setup of x and y coordinates.I'm trying to create a function that can figure out which way to go, that should return a single element from that list. That return value will be the direction the character moves.(Example: adjoining = [[1, 0], [3, 2], [1, 1]]. Return returns the smallest both x and y coordinate which is [1, 0].)My function should return the value with the lowest x coordinate. If there are multiple x coordinates that have the same low value, the one with the lowest y coordinate should be chosen.How can I create a function that can figure out which x and y value is lowest?
Just use min() like so:
You can do this:Result:Use the  parameter to define the fields which will affect the sorting process. First, you will get the minimum element based on  value and if there are many of them, they will be sorted again based on their  value.An alternative is to use the  function from  module:
I used  with the  attribute. This allows you to define the criteria by which to sort the list.The rest of the code is base on list comprehension.This filters  based of some chosen criteria. Just need to make sure what follows  can be evaluated  or .
