Here is an approach that splits and cleans up the string a bit and then uses dict comprehension with  on slices of odd and even list elements (keys are even, values are odd) to generate the output you are looking for (and will work on strings that contain multiple key value pairs but not very well if your strings contain nested dicts, lists, etc).That said, the answer from @jpp is really clever.
