I made a Python 3 script to process some CSV files, but I have a problem with the data.I send to the stream with the insert_rows function, if I only import  one file I have the same rows in the CSV and the BigQuery, but when I import more files, BigQuery lost rows respect CSV file, but insert_rows don't  return errors. Thanks for the help         
Issue was fixed by adding a new unique column into the CSV file, using this Python Standard Library to generate a new column and add in all rows an unique id.
