Natural Text
I am working on an assignment and I have hit a wall. The assignment requires me to count the frequency of words in a text file. I got my code to count the words and put them into a dictionary but cannot put words together if they have different cases. For example I need the output to show  but it outputs this instead . Here is my code. Any help would be much appreciated.
Seems like in the question your saying there is a uppercase and lowercase issue, so why not:Or:
You can use an inbuilt function called  for this as an alternative to looping through the list.example :
lower all the words when comparing.
You can convert the words to lowercase, and then count them. So, your code changes to something like this.Basically, you will be storing in the dict, where keys are the lower case versions of each word.Do note, that you will lose "data", if you are doing operations which are case sensitive.
