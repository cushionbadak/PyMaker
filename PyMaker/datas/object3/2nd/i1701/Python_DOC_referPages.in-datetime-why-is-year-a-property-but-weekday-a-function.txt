I have a question about this piece of Python 3 script:TIOWhy is  without parentheses, but  isn't? Why is one a property and the other a function?
Probably because  is a required argument when constructing a  object. No computation is required within the object to access the  value. See the implementation:Whereas weekday needs to be computed:
Because  is required for defining  objects and is subsequently set as a property of the class:All arguments are required.While  needs to be calculated via a method from year, month and day.
There's no particular reason I can think of. It's a module with a documented API which says  is a method not a property. One can argue whether it should have been otherwise, but as soon as the module was released and people wrote code that depended on this interface, it could no longer be changed. (Other than by deprecating the module and releasing , which the Python gods have indeed done for a few modules that were much more badly broken by design). If it really bugs you you can 'fix' it. In Python3 (simplified ):
For no good reason. It's inconsistent, and violates some basic principles. Don't read too much into it, it was probably some instant decision that stuck.
Because weekday need some operations.
