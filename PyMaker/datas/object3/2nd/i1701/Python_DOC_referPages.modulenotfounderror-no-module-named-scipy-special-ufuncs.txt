I already installed scipy on Python3.6:But, it does not work with this error.:How can I do?Thanks very much for your help.
In general, don't use . Best use a virtualenv, and install everything into it.What you see is a sign of a broken install, best reinstall from scratch --- or activate a virtualenv.
The  (aka Universal Functions) is part of the NumPy framework. When working with SciPy, it is necessary to install NumPy first as it's a dependency. You are getting this ModuleNotFoundError is likely due to the unavailability of NumPy package.Before you try anything, list the currently installed packages:If NumPy isn't installed then try installing it:Edit:It seems that you had tried install scipy using ubuntu package installer. That's why your scipy version is 0.17. Sometimes it is possible that some ubuntu packages are outdated. Therefore, it's better to use the official package managers, like PyPI in case of Python.First uninstall the scipy installed by the package manager:When uninstalled successfully, reinstall it using PyPI:This will install the latest version (1.1.0) from python package index.If all goes well, you should be able to run your code without any errors.
