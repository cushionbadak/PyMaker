Natural Text
I am trying to write a class, for text manipulation. The idea is class will support basic text preprocessing, but if someone wants to write a very complex preprocessing function, they should be able to use the base class and override it. I tried the following way, even though I can somehow make it to work, I don't think that is the correct way to do it. Now, if I want to write a new preprocessing function, which is the best way to do it. I tried following,It is not working. What I want basically, is the preprocess function ( modified ), should be able to override the one in base class , so that when that  is called, , should be based on the new preprocessing function 
The following will do:If you now call the constructor of , the new  method will be used:

If you want to inject behavior, just use a function:Use very simply:Actually, if all your class does is store some functions, you can go full-functional programming:
try to change the  : super.init(corpus)to super().init(corpus)
