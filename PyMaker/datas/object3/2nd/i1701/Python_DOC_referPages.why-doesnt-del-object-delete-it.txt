The code below creates a "tee" object that tees stdout to a file as well as the terminal.If do  as below when I'm done tee-ing, the object doesn't get deleted and the  member doesn't get called (so the tee-ing continues):But if I call  directly, things work fine:Why doesn't the  work? What's the right way to do this?
Note  doesn’t directly call  — the former decrements the reference count for x by one, and the latter is only called when x’s reference count reaches zero.  Taken from the data model section of the Python 3 documentation.You've referenced the class inside the constructor:The reference will remain and as a result the object will stay “alive”.
What you’re actually looking for is the with-statement that is used for a specific context. You open the file, do something with it and close it again.This will call the exit method in the end.Actually your class is doing the same thing with the file handler in the write method. For the delete method: As the others already mentioned, the delete statement will just decrement the reference counter. Once the number of references has reached zero, the object will be garbage collected and the delete method will be invoked. But this won’t happen in your case since the object is still referenced by the standard output.
