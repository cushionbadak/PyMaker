How do I correctly define  for my map class?From Jupyter I am generating the map like this:But  error occurs on .I am able to make it work if I use  instead.
The  method must return a string. From the docs (some emphasis mine):Called by the repr() built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not possible, a string of the form <...some useful description...> should be returned. The return value must be a string object. If a class defines  but not , then  is also used when an “informal” string representation of instances of that class is required.Edit: As @khelwood suggests you can  in the  method.
