I recently tried to write errors to a file which I managed to do after some research. The problem now is I'm trying to write calculation results to a file, but I can't seem to get the two functions I use to work together. Can someone take a look at my code and help me?(as of now have I commented out my function attempt to write the result I get from calculator() to a separate file called "result.txt") 
You never call the writeResult() function. You should add a parameter to writeResult() like this:where str is the value that will be written to the file. Then you have to call it. I would call it in checkError() because that's where you call calculator(). To get the value that is calculated by calculator, you will need it to return it. To do that, all you have to do is add the result variable to the return statement, so the function will look like this:Then you should call it in checkError() and pass it to writeResult() as a parameter:So basically the value that you get from calculator() is getting passed as a parameter to writeResult. 
Your writeResult() function is the biggest problem here. The write() function in Python takes a string parameter, which is what it actually outputs to the file (see the Python tutorial for an example). So, you need to put the result in that function call. In order to do that, you will have to add a parameter to your function. So it becomes:I used str(result) there because result will be a number type, so you need to explicitly convert it to a string. Otherwise, Python will throw an error.Also note that I removed the last line return. In Python, you don't need to explicitly put return statements when nothing gets returned.Now you have to change calculator() to pass the result to this function. One option is returning the result and then calling writeResult in your main() function. Another is to just call writeResult in the calculator function, by changing the last line to writeResult(result) (again, no need for the empty return statement).
