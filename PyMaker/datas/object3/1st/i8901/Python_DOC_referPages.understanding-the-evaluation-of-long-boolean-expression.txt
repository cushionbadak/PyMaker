This is a logic question we are learning in a Python class. I dont understand how the answer is 3, that is how not x or y or not y and x is True, can anyone help?
Whenever confused with boolean expressions, it helps to use parentheses to make the sequence of evaluation clear. The parentheses can be placed by following the precedence rules and the associativity of operators. Then you can substitute and evaluate the results:If you evaluate the last example yourself, you'll see how it leads to False or True which yields True thereby allowing the if statement that contains it to run.
