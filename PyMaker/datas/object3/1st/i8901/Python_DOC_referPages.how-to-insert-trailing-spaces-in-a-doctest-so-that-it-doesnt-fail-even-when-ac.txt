I'm trying to do a doctest. The 'Expected' and 'Got' results are identical, but my doctest still fails. It's failing because there are trailing spaces after x-axis y-axis in the printout which I haven't included in my docstring. How do I include it though? When I insert the spaces manually, and do the test, it runs successfully as long as I keep the cursor there. x-axis y-axis______________________[cursor here]                           However, if I run the test with my cursor somewhere else, then the trailing spaces get removed and the test fails. I know that sounds really strange, but it is what it is!This is the code:Below is my result when it fails. Even on here you should be able to select the area after x-axis y-axis and detect whether there are trailing spaces or not.
I found a solution, using the normalize white space flagput it either in the doctest asor when calling the doctest
