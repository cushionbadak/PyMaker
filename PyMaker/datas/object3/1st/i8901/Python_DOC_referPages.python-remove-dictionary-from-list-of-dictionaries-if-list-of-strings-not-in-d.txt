Natural Text
I want to remove from results every dictionary that doesn't contain every string in the str list in the text. At the moment I can do it with one condition, for example:But this wouldn't check if ' 4 ' is in text too.
Simply use all to test if all the items in the list are in a dictionary value and use that in the filter of your list comprehension:
You could use an all in the condition of your comprehension:You could also use set.issubset and str.split instead:This will check if your ['text'] splitted at whitespaces contains all the characters in strs. Depending on the length of the text and the number of items in strs this could be faster than the all-approach.
