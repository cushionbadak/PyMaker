Here is my json file format,while loading the above json which is in a file I get this error,here is my python code,
You appear to be processing the entire file one line at a time. Why not simply use .read() to get the entire contents at once, then feed that to json?Better yet, why not use json.load() to pass the readable directly and let it handle the slurping?
,} is not allowed in JSON (I guess that's the problem according to the data given).
The problem is in your reading and decoding the file line by line. Any single line in your file (e.g., "[{") is not a valid JSON expression. 
Your individual lines are not valid JSON. For instance, the first line '[{' by itself is not a valid JSON. If your entire file is actually valid JSON and you want individual lines, first load the entire JSON and then browse through the python dictionary.
