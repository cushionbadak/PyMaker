Preface: I understand this question has been asked before, but I cannot find a solution to my error from looking at those previous answers.All I want to do is call diff for the output of two different commands on the same file.  Why is it that I receive following error?If I were to run this command from my shell it works fine.
diff is complaining that it can't find the file with the strange name <(./espressoc ./Tests/Espresso/GoodTests/Init.java) because that's the argument you fed it.subprocess.Popen (check_call is a convenience function for it)  is directly calling what you give it, there isn't a shell to interpret redirections or anything, unless you tell it shell=True, which will then call the command via /bin/sh (on POSIX). Note the security considerations before using it.So basically:If you wanted to be "pure" (probably more effort than it's worth), I think you could subprocess all three processes (diff, compiler 1 and 2) and handle the piping yourself. Does diff wait for 2 EOFs or something before closing stdin? Not sure how it actually deals with the double input redirection like your line has...
