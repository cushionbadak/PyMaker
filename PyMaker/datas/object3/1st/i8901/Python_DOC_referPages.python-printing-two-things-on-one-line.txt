I'm working through the edx python course. I've done everything correctly in the last assignment. However, I'm struggling with this print issue. I have a function displayHand(hand) which essentially takes a dictionary with keys being letters and values be the number of occurrences of the letters. The function then prints a string with each key appearing the same number of times as its value. So for example if Now in the program for any given hand it wants me to display it using the displayHand function with the text "current hand: " Again, if hand={a:3, b:4, c:1} the program should display How do I do this with a print statement? I've tried print("current hand"+str(displayHand(hand)), but this first evaluates the function and then just prints None. I can't put print("Current Hand: ") and displayHand(hand) directly underneath, because then they print on different lines. I need to get them to print on the same line. 
Python 3:Notice the end="" which appends whatever is inside "". The default setting is end="\n". In this case, we will just use an empty string. See here and here.Output:
That should work for you : In print() function default end is new line. In the code above you just change it to whatever you want.
You can use print twice, you just have to add a comma after the first print ex: print("a"), print("b").
You could do the following:That creates a string first which is then printed.Then  prints the desired output:
