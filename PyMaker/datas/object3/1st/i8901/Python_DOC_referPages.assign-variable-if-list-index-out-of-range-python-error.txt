Natural Text
How to pass a string to a variable if an index error is found? Consider the code:A number of these functions must be imported (pairwise2 align), but the file.lists are single column text files with one sequence id (text and numbers) per line, that are used to extract from the fasta1 and fasta2 text files. Basically, I want to try: each list command ( a=fasta1[int(l1)]) and if there is no error (the id is in range), do as normal (assign variables a and b for that iteration), but if NOT, assign the 'a' variable some placeholder text like 'GGG': This code doesn't quite work (when integrated with above code), which isn't surprising given my lack of python prowess, but I don't quite know why. I actually get no text output, despite the print calls... Am I thinking about this right? If there is NO error in the index, I just want it to go on and do the pairwise alignment (with the first a and b variables) and then print some text to stdout. Any ideas? 
Python's conditional (aka ternary) expressions can one-line this for you. They're often criticized for lack of readability, but I think this example reads well enough.
You don't need continue, because it will skip that iteration of the loop. Consider the following:
