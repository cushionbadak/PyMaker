I want to make a program that returns a group of True variables that i found in my program. Like this:What I want is to return as a printEdit 1:The code is a letter counter!eacha letter in a group has a value.Likea=1b = 2 ...If a number repeats more than 4 times, that number is a trueThe group would be a name. like John in an imput.The program reads it and gives a number for each letter.what I am using right now is this (Preatty ugly I know, but I started programing this month...), where "a" is the amount of letter a in the name, b is the amount of b in the name....
Why don't you use a dictionary? Take a look in this code as an example.Now you the list - although inside brackets and I don't know how to remove them since they are part of the list... Maybe iteration over it again should solve the problem, although I am not a truly expert in Python.
