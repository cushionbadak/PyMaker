I have an abstract base class:I'd like to use this class as a spec for a mock.This works partially. For example, mock_a.x results in AttribureError("Mock object has no attribute 'x'). However mock_a.f is not speced based on the abstract method from A.f. It returns a mock regardless of the number of arguments passed to f.Mock can create a mock speced from A.f with create_autospec ...... but doesn't do so for the attributes of AHow can I create a mock that accurately implements the abstract base class?
Apply mock.create_autospec() to the class:
