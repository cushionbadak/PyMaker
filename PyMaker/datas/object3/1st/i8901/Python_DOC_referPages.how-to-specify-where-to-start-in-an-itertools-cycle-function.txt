I need to cycle through a list for starting position between 1-4using itertools I am able to cycle through the listThis does return the next position, but what if the next time I need to start at 3? How can I set the start position?I need the start position to change often, I cant just change the list to start at 3.
You can't set a starting position; it'll always start where the given sequence starts.You can move the cycle along a few steps before you use it for whatever you need it for. Use itertools.islice() to skip some items:You pass in the iterable, then a start and stop value; None here means that the islice() iterator continues forever or until the underlying positions iterator is exhausted.Demo:The other option is to pass in a different sequence; you could pass in [3, 4, 1, 2] for example.
You can use itertools.islice for that:this will result in a generator that emits 3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,...In case the start position k is large (compared to the length of the original list), it can pay off to perform a modulo first:This will generate an equivalent result, but islice will not drop the first 10M elements.
Use slices of the original list:Demo:
