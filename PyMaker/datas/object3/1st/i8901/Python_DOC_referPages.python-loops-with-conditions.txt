Function f will do needless iterations. Is there an idiomatic way to enforce the condition in the for loop?
You can use itertools.islice(iterable,start,stop[,step]) for that:Given you do not need i and j in your computation (you only need them for bounds checks, you can even omit them).
Well, you can always use range:provided that some_number does not depend on row and some_other_number does not depend on value. Otherwise you can't really do anything.Note that this requires both array and row objects to support __getelement__ (e.g. when both are real list). It won't work for generators.
You can't in-line that condition, but you can prevent the inner loop from being entered. enumerate does have a start parameter you could try
