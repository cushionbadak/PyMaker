This question already has an answer here:Converting integer to string in Python?                    9 answers                My code:Result:The function is supposed to return the sum of each digit of the argument "n".Why do I get SyntaxError in the commented line? The variable c is of type string so it shouldnÂ´t be an issue to apply a type cast to int.
In Python you do not cast that way. You use:Technically speaking this is not casting: you call the int(..) builtin function which takes as input the string and produces its equivalent as int. You do not cast in Python since it is a dynamically typed language.Note that it is of course possible that c contains text that is not an integer. Like 'the number fifteen whohaa'. Of course int(..) cannot make sense out of that. In that case it will raise a ValueError. You can use try-except to handle these:
In Python, you cast a string to an integer by using a function int().
Basically, you need to cast string to integer using int(n)
