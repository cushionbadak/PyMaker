Given the following program:In my do_something function, how can I identify that the 'the_func' variable came from the 'MyClass' class?  Specifically, how can I get an un-instantiated reference to MyClass?...returns nothing obvious.
Look at the __wrapped__ dunder:It's functools.update_wrapper that adds this attribute.  I also want to point out that your usage of update_wrapper is somewhat strange.  It would be more usual to use my_function and another_function here rather than another_function and cls.  Then you would access the class object through __wrapped__ and __self__.  
when you print the_func, you get the function object.So the_func.__name__ will give you the name of that class name in which the function is wrapped!
