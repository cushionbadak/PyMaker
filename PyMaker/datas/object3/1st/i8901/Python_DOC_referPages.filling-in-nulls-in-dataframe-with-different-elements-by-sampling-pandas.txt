Ive created a dataframe 'Pclass'my initial dataframe 'df' looks likeI want to fill in the null deck values in df by choosing a sample from thedecks given in Pclass based on the weights. I've only managed to code the sampling procedure.I'm having trouble implementing a method to fill in the nulls by finding null rows that belong to class 3 and picking a random deck value for each(not the same value all the time), so not fillna('with just one').Note: I have another question similar to this,but broader with a groupby object as well to maximize efficiency but I've gotten no responses. Any help would be greatly appreciated! edit: added rows to dataframe Pclass
This generates a random selection from the deck column from the Pclass dataframe and assigns these to the df dataframe in the deck column (generating the required number).  These commands could be put in a list comprehension if you wanted to do this across different values of the class variable.  I'd recommend avoiding using class as a variable name since it's used to define new classes within Python.  Running for multiple levels of the categorical variableIf you wanted to run this on all levels of the class variable you'd need to make sure you're selecting a subset of the data in Pclass (just the class of interest).  One could use a list comprehension to find the missing data for each level of 'class' like so (I've updated the mock data below) ... However, I think the code would be easier to read if it was in a loop:
