tkinter will call your function with only one argument. Your function expects 2 so it breaks. Just refer to the global value name from the functionFor a small learner program this might be ok but you may wish to find a nicer way to get that value into your function than using a global as you create larger more complex and/or reusable scripts.One way to do that is to partially apply your function before passing it to the tkinter widget using the library function functools.partial.You can create a new function with the name keyword argument preloaded and pass it to the button, this function only expects one argument and it all works ok. This is a technique called currying, which is from functional programming.
You have the function printInput which takes two arguments, but when it is called, tkinter only passes it one input, i.e. the event.In order to pass the name argument as well, you need a lambda function:This will pass the global name variable to the function as a parameter.
