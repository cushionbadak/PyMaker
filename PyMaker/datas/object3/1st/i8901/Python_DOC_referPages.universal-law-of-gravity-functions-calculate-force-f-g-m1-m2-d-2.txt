I am currently trying to learn Python, so I can provide new opportunities for the children of my community.I am stuck a on functions, I am trying to calculate the force of between two bodies of space using the Universal Law of Gravity equation. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, I feel like I a might not even be calling the m2, so it can calculate or perhaps I need to make planet specific functions that then populate the equation, and require a user input? Here is what I have so far: I am learning from reading a book, and watching youtube, I know there are holes in my understanding. Any help or orientation would be greatly appreciated.  
I would do something like this:A few problems to point out:d.Jupiter=7.41(10**11) This gives the error TypeError: 'float' object is not callable because you call functions like function_name() and so when you use 7.41(10**10) it thinks you're trying to call 7.41 as a function. Don't forget to add a * between 7.41 and (10**11).m2.Jupiter= 1.8986*(10**27) This gives the error AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'Jupiter' because you can't just assign the parameter m2 a property without first defining what that is. If you want to have multiple options, use a dictionary like I do above or create a separate class. print (input("what planet you want to calculate? Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune? : ") Here you're just printing the value that you input. To get the input value, assign it to a variable. Then you must call the function gravitationalForce at some point with your arguments. Don't define your arguments within the function, get them outside and then pass them into it.
There are a few different issues with this code. I cleaned it up a bit below, hopefully this helps to set you on the right trackNote that the planet constants were moved into a dictonary and the m1 variable is being passed a constant 100
