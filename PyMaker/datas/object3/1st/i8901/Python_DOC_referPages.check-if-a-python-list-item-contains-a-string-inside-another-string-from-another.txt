You should use the split function here, and then check if the country specified in url is allowed.This will avoid (in)validating a country since an indian link may concern a topic with "england" in it.
Simple list comprehension will achieve this:
You can use the membership operator in to see if a string contains a substring. So, loop through country, and check if each element is in each url in urllist.

You can do this easily with a list comprehension:which is equivalent to
