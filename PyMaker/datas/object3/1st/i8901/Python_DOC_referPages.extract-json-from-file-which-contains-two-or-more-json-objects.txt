There is a file which contains two or more json string like this:how to use python to transform these json string to json Object from this file?
You can use re.split to split every occurrence of }\W*{ while preserving the brackets and then convert every item in the result with json.loads:Output:In the regular expression above (?<=}) is positive lookbehind assertion which causes \W* to match only if it is immediately preceded by }. Similarly (?={) is positive lookahead assertion that requires { to follow \W*.Update Alternatively you can use re.finditer to find matches instead of splitting the string. It will also work in a case where there's no whitespace between the objects:Output:Note that both of the methods above will break if your JSON has a string with } { with any amount of whitespace in between.
