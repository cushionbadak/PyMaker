I have a List of Lists of Lists in python. I need to sort the highest level of lists based on one of the values in the lowest levels. For a toy model, my list is created first with list small, which is a list containing lists with three items each: Then there is a larger list, large, that is created by appending the small list and another item together:This is done in a loop, so if the loop has a counter of 5, it will proceed through a function that creates a list small 5 times, each time, appending it to list large. My goal is to sort the final list based on an element in the smallest list (the list that comprises the small list). I am currently printing the large list out line by line, with the small list ordered by the index 1 of the lists within it (see: 5,10,15 in order, 1,3,6 in order, etc), so my output is this:However, i would like to print the large list in order of smallest to largest when looking at the element in index 1 in the list that makes up the smallest array. So my ideal output would be this:I have tried sorting with itemgetter(), however, when sorting large with itemgetter(), i can only sort the items in list large, which are [category x] and [[a,b,c], [a,b,c]]. Is there a way to access the lowest level of elements for itemgetter? or another way to go about sorting this list?Thanks.
This can be done in one line:The sorted built-in function takes a key parameter:key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a  comparison key from each list elementUsing a lambda expression, the sorting key can be extracted.
