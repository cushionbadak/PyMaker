I'm supposed to create a function and test cases for it that returns the point of intersection of a ray and a sphere.  If there are multiple points of intersection (the ray goes in and out of the sphere) then it should return the point closest to the start of the ray. I have to do this using a quadratic equation.  Here's what I have right now.  I wrote one test case for this so far but it did not return the right point. Here is my test cases code.  It's just the very last one.  I know some of the indentations are off but they are right in my text editor it just copied and pasted weird.  Here's the error i get. Also here is my vector_math file. And here's my data file. Again sorry about the indentation.  I know the classes look wrong but it's right in my code.  Also any suggestions for making my code neater and more concise are appreciated.  
The assertEqual calls are comparing the objects for equality, not the contents of the objects. Per the documentation of the unittest module, you will have to register the __eq__ functions in your geometry types via the  unittest.addTypeEqualityFunc().
