In Python, how can one print a number that might be an integer or real type, when the latter case would require me to limit my printout to a certain amount of digits?Long story short, say we have the following example: Is there a "Pythy" way to ensure e.g. in case num == 1 that I print 1 instead of 1.000 (I mean other than cluttering my code with if statements)
With Python 3*, you can just use round() because in addition to rounding floats, when applied to an integer it will always return an int:This behavior is documented in help(float.__round__):And help(int.__round__):* With Python 2, round() always returns a float.
If you need to maintain a fixed-width for float values, you could use the printf-style formatting, like this:
If you use a fix number of floating point, you could just use a replace to remove the extra 0. For instance this would do the trick:
