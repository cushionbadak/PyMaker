Natural Text
I am really new to Python (only started coding 2 weeks ago and still getting use to the terminology) and would love some help understanding lists and text files. I have a text file that stores a list (I have also read it is called an array - is that correct?) of car details e.g.My first question relates to "Are these lists?". Are they the same thing as coding:If the text file is the same as above - How do I call the data into Car1, Car2 etc.?My second question would be how would I say search for car '2' and then change the year, say from 2012 to 2016?Any help would be very much appreciated.
Lists and arrays are synonymous.Question 1Generally when data is stored, it is stored as a delimited text file. That is where the data entries are separated by some special character. For example, if a file containedThen this would be a comma delimited text file (csv). You don't normally want to store data as it would be formatted by a particular language as in your example. Question 2Dictionaries in Python are probably needed so that your data would be indexed by names rather than positions. If you were to store your data as:Then you could set cars[1]["year"] = 2016 This format will also allow you to use json formatting when writing to a text file. You could also serialize/pickle your data or use a database as other commenters have said.
I would personally chose dictionaries in this case. You could easily define each one of them as simple as:Storing and reading dicts from a file is fairly easy with pickle or the built-in json library
