I need to replace every number in a string with the number itself but between quotes:Result:I know I can use use this regex to replace every number in a string with another string:but this would give me:How to replace with the matched number itself modified?
You can use the \1 construct to refer to matched groups.Note the use of raw strings (prefixed with r) to avoid having to escape the backslash – you should be using a raw string for the pattern to match as well, otherwise the \d may be interpreted as an escape in the future.In addition, the pattern (\d+) matches any number of digits in a row, rather than just one digit – without this, a string like This is number "1" and this is number "2""2" would be produced.
You can use a backreference to the previously matched content in the replacement pattern. Syntax is \g<Number>, where Number is the number of the captured group or 0 for the whole match.As you want to quote contiguous numbers as one and not number by number, you need to use  \d+ as pattern, not just \dFull code:See http://ideone.com/x5uLte
You don't even need regular expressions for something this simple:
You need to capture your number like so:And the replace with back reference (+your quotes around it) "$1"see here: https://regex101.com/r/oXsFX7/1
This will do:Also please avoid using str as variable as str is a built-in type of string in Python.
