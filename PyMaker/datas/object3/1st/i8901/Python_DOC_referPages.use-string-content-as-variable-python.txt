I am using a package that has operations inside the class (? not sure what either is really), and normally the data is called this way data[package.operation]. Since I have to do multiple operations thought of shortening it and do the followingbut since it's considering i as a string it doesnt do the operation, and if I take away the string then it is an undefined variable. Is there a way to go around this? Or will I just have to write it the long way?. In particular I am using pymatgen, its package Orbital and with the .operation I want to call specific suborbitals. A real example of how it  would be used is data[0][Orbital.s], the first [0] denotes the element in question for which to get the orbitals s (that's why I omitted it in the code above).
You can use getattr in order to dynamically select attributes from objects (the Orbital package in your case; for example getattr(Orbital, 's')).So your loop would be rewritten to:
