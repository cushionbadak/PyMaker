I don't understand why when I set the symbol to real diff() seem to consider it a constant:
The issue is that the variable x in t and the variable x1 are not considered the same, due to the "real" attribute of x1. Hence, in the differentiation the x1 variable is treated as a constant, yielding 0.  To fix this if you intend on working with real variables, you can define your expression with a real variable x. Instead of passing an explicit dict with the locals keyword argument, you could also just call locals() with locals=locals() to pull in all the entire local symbol table as a dict, which may be useful if you have many Symbol variables.
