How can determine class of IP address in python. I am working with ipaddress module of python.Following are class definitionsGiven a IP how can I check if it belongs to Class A, B or C
IPv4Use ipaddress.IPv4Address and ipaddress.IPv4Network types.I gave you the tuple form as you have the network address and mask but if you prefere the /X suffix it also accepts it. There are actually some additional ways.To use it you will just check if a certain IPv4Address is in the IPv4Network as if you were checking in an element is found inside a list:IPv6Use ipaddress.IPv6Address and ipaddress.IPv6Network types instead and correct IPv6 ip strings when creating the objects.GenericIf both supporting IPv4 and IPv6 is desired, ipaddress.ip_address and ipaddress.ip_network convenience factory functions can be used, and the module will create the appropiate IPv4 or IPv6 class depending on the string format.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html
