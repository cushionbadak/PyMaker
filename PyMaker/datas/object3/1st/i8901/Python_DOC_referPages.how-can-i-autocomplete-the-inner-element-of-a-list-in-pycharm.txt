How can I autocomplete the inner element of a list in pycharm and only the inner element ? Not a mixure of methods of the list and the inner element but only the inner element's methods ?example:a = list()a.append(1)a[0].___ (I want this to only show methods for integers and not both of integer and list)
You you are using Python 3.6 or newer you should be able to use variable annotations:This tells PyCharm that a is a list containing only integer objects.Caveat: I don't know if the current PyCharm 2016.3 release actually supports PEP 526; the Early Access Programme release 2016.3 certainly included support but I don't follow the release cycle.
