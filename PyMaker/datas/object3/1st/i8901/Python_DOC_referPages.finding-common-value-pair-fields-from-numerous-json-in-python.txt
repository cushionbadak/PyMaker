I have list of JSON files. Now I intend to find all the common value pairs from all these JSON and copy it to different JSON. Also the common value pairs should be removed from all JSON's. lets say I have a.json, b.json, c.json ... z.jsonNow the common label value pair in all of them is then, this common element should be moved to a new JSON file called common.json and also the element should be removed from all the JSON files. An eg json file would look like:I way i am thinking is too complex. I thought to take each line and of first json file and check with all other jsons. There should be something easy and efficient. any pointers?
To compare all files in one time, you can also use Sets to compare all key-values at once using &Note that you can also do other operations with Sets, here an example from the doc:EDITFinally, I asked my own so question based on the same problem as you (almost). Here is the best responseIf you are too lazy to click on the link, here is an overview:
Since you didn't provide your exact JSON sample, I assume it is just regular json as '{"key":"value"}'.  convert json string to dictionary:now assume we have two converted dictionaries:comparing two dictionaries and finding the common key-value pairs(similarly for the diff k-v pairs), I am using python3:My post showed you the idea how to solve your issue, it might have edge issues for your specific JSON lines, you can modify it and fit your needs. Hope it helps
