Natural Text
I want to print the number of words in a txt file having 1-20 letter. Tried this but it prints 20 zeroes instead. any idea?edit - in the end the program should plot 20 numbers, each one is the number of words in the file containing 1-20 letters. 
EDITTo produce individual counts for each word length you can use a collections.Counter:This uses a generator to read the file and produce a sequence of word lengths. The filtered word lengths are fed into a Counter. You could perform the length filtering on the Counter instead.If you want to ignore punctuation you could look at using str.translate() to remove unwanted characters, or possibly re.split(r'\W+', line) instead of line.split().Try it like this:This could be simplified to:but that's playing code golf.You can also use a collections.Counter if it is practical to read the entire file into memory:And no doubt there are many other ways to do it. None of the above expect or handle punctuation.
It should be like this,counter shouldn't be in for loop,and you could use len() method to get the length of words:Or my way:Hope this helps.
using regular expressions
