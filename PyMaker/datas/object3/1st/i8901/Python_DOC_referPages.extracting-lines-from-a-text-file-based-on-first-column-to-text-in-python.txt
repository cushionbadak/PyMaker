I'm using Windows 7.0 and have Python 3.4 installed. I'm very new to Python. Here is my list. It is a price file. I have thousands of these, but have been trying to get it to work on just one for now.I am trying to extract only the lines that begin with hfus,ious, or oaus.Here is the desired result.Here is what I wrote so far but it's not working. I also would like if it would loop through each file and overwrite the existing file with the truncated list saving it with it's original name. The file 033117.txt represents a date. Every file is saved as mmddyy.txt. Getting it to work on all files would be ideal, but for now if I can get it to work on even one file that'd be nice.
I suggest to use the with statement when you open file objects so you do not need to explicitly close the file, it will be closed automatically for you when the indented block is exited.Reading and filtering from a file and write the results to another file (not overwriting the same file) could be accomplished by using a list comprehension and selecting the appropriate lines that gives a more concise way to accomplish the task:If you want to overwrite the file instead of opening a new additional file and write to it, do the following:See open, modes for open modes.

Try this query:Even am new to python so there might be many better solutions but this should work. 
For this kind of data processing I suggest using pandasOf course, you want to use more meaningful header values ;-)
Try using a with statement to open your file instead of outFile = open(). This should help create less errors :)
