I am trying this (datetime.datetime.today()-datetime.datetime.today()).days giving -1and expecting a value 0 instead I am getting -1. In this case I have add 1 to the resultCan someone tell me why?
timedelta objects must always have a positive number of seconds and microseconds; the way a negative delta is expressed is by using a negative number of days. The seconds and microseconds then count in the other direction from those negative days.datetime.datetime.today() produces a full date and time, complete with microseconds. The second call is executed a fraction of a second later, and subtracting the two gives you a negative timedelta.So as a result, you get a timedelta with -1 day difference and a positive number of seconds almost equal to a full day, except for a fraction of a second:Note the 86399 seconds and 999990 microseconds in the resulting timedelta object. The difference is not a full day, it is only 10 microseconds.If you need an 'absolute' number, use the timedelta.total_seconds() method:Divide that again by 86400 to get a number of days:Alternatively, add 1 to the .days attribute of a timedelta when seconds or microseconds is non-zero:
try to store data in a variable: You will get the zero.Although this is the proper explanation for your answer:Martin Pieters' Answer
There is a micro seconds difference while you are subtracting the dates.Suppose datetime.datetime.today() is giving From this you can see that both are ran in the same seconds timestamp but micro-fraction difference. So, when you do you will get -1 day as result, which is a correct result.
