Python has the built-in function type and each instance also has a __class__ attribute. I generally believed they returned the same thing. Even the documentation of both sounds similar:instance.__class__The class to which a class instance belongs.and type(object)With one argument, return the type of an object.However in abc.ABCMeta.__instancecheck__ there is a check if they are identical (slightly shortened):When will this not be the case? When is type(instance) not the same as instance.__class__?
type(instance) and instance.__class__ may be different, even with new-style classes, as Guido mentioned in PEP 3119:Also, isinstance(x, B) is equivalent to issubclass(x.__class__, B) or issubclass(type(x), B). (It is possible type(x) and x.__class__ are not the same object, e.g. when x is a proxy object.)For instance:
This is the case for old style objects (inheriting from nothing). Such objects do not have the __class__ property. I think they do it this way to prevent errors. Example for Python 2.7:See this for further information: Python type() or __class__, == or isNewClassVsClassicClassWhy does `type(myField)` return `<type 'instance'>` and not `<type 'Field'>`?Note: The given lines from cpython were changed in 2008 last time (commit), so it really seems to be a compatibility thing or they just forgot about it.
