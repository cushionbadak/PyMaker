This question already has an answer here:Output from sys.stdout in interactive mode                    1 answer                I have one question about this for loop, that writes strings to a file:Why am I getting those numbers?
In the interactive interpreter mode, Python will echo all expression statement results that are not None. Here, the number are the return values of all the outfile.write(...) calls. Assuming outfile is a file openened in text mode, the file.write() method returns the number of characters written.For example, the first line written is '0 0\n', which is 4 characters, as are '1 1\n', '2 4\n' and '3 9\n', after which you write 5 characters for '4 16\n', etc.If you don't want to see those numbers, assign the return value of the .write() method to a variable. It doesn't matter what variable here; an assignment statement is not an expression statement so there is nothing to echo:
