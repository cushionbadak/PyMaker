By using subprocess module , how can we create a directory with today's date and time as directory name ?I can follow one process , like assigning todays date to a variable in the the python and use that variable as reference to create a directory. And I am using windows as my target machine.but is there any other best ways I could follow ?Thanks
If you think that you can rely upon your system's timezone setting, you may use built in date command (on Unix-like systems) in a way like this:Though, there are other solutions, like to use os.mkdir().
Try it out.The following will create a folder with the current date as its name. See the 'man date' to adjust the output to your liking.
