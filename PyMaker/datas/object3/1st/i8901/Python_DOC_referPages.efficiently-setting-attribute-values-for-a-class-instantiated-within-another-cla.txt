I am trying to set the attribute values of a certain class AuxiliaryClass than is instantiated in a method from MainClass class in the most efficient way possible.AuxiliaryClass is instantiated within a method of MainClass - see below. However, AuxiliaryClass has many different attributes and I need to set the value of those attributes once the class has been instantiated - see the last 3 lines of my code.Note: due to design constraints I cannot explain here, my classes only contain methods, meaning that I need to declare attributes as methods (see below).Basically I want to replace these last 3 lines of code with something neater, more elegant and more efficient. I know I could use a dictionary if I was instantiating AuxiliaryClass directly:But this does not seem to work for the structure of my problem. Finally, I need to set the values of AuxiliaryClass's attributes once MainClass has been instantiated (so I can't set the attribute's values within method Auxiliary).Is there a better way to do this than obj.Auxiliary().IthMethod = some_value?EDITA couple of people have said that the following lines:will have no effect because they will immediately get garbage collected. I do not really understand what this means, but if I execute the following lines (after the lines above):I am getting the values I entered previously.
To speed things up, and make the customization somewhat cleaner, you can cache the results of the AuxilliaryClass constructor/singleton/accessor, and loop over a dict calling setattr().Try something like this:
I understand what is happening here: my code has a series of decorators before all methods which allow memoization. I do not know exactly how they work but when used the problem described above - namely, that lines of type obj.Auxiliary().IthMethod = some_value get immediately garbage collected - does not occur. Unfortunately I cannot give further details regarding these decorators as 1) I do not understand them very well and 2) I cannot transmit this information outside my company. I think under this circumstances it is difficult to answer my question because I cannot fully disclose all the necessary details.
