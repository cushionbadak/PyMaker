The columns in my table look like this:Name1 | Name2 | Weight | Height | Number1 | Number2Some of the Number1 and Number2 columns are Null, and I am only trying to update the Null rows only. To do this, I have 6 lists:Lists 5 and 6 contains the values to be inserted in Number1 and Number2 respectively, and are in the same order as Lists 3 and 4.So what I am trying to do is:search the table for all the rows with Null values in Number1 AND Number2;search Lists 3 OR 4 for values to match Name1 OR Name2, so if a match is found in list 3, the values for Number1 and Number2 should still be filled in from lists 5 and 6, respectively.So the code I'm thinking of looks something like this:However, when I run it, it adds rows to the table, but no values for Number1 or Number2. Where am I going wrong?
Where am I going wrong?Probably here:The is keyword tests for object identity, which isn't what you want here. And even the test for equality won't help you here, as the order in both lists are different.The resulting behaviour is that none of your if branches is executed. To achieve your goal you need to test if both lists contain the same members:Testing if a list contains another list with PythonHowever, your question is unclear about the exact condition: Are Name1/List3 and Name2/List4 supposed to contain exactly the same members, or is it sufficient for one member to be contained in the other? You might be able to figure the solution out yourself; if not I suggest you open another question on this specific problem.
