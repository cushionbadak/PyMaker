Please dont give me minus. I want to ask a better method to solve this problem, because what I am doing now is becoming a huge burden for me. Hier is my question: I have two lists. I want to make sure that none item from one list is in the other list. In Python I have been working with the following lines... (Assuming List_s has 3 items.)These lines were actually OK for me, till I suddenly realize that I have to work with lists with >200 length. And I have a lot of lists to compare. So how could I change the code? Thank you very much for your help!
You can convert one of the lists to a set and use set.intersection:Note that the elements in both lists must be hashable.
You will get the same results whether you use:or:But set.isdisjoint is much faster.  On my computer, isdisjoint takes about 150 nanoseconds to run against test data, while intersection takes 95 microseconds to run against the same data--about 630 times slower!
For very large list, Clearly,is much more efficient
