With the structure:How can I export to a .csv file using each column and row like?  Is there useful functions to quickly format lists to .csv files this way?  I want each value in list to be a new tab in excel.
You could use :Or the official csv lib.my.csv is now :
I think this should do what you want.The file mylist.csv should then be read correctly by excel automatically.
This is an efficient way of doing it if you list is not VERY huge
