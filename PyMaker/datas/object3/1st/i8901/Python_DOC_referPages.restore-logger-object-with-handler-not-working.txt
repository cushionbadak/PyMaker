Could I store the logger object which contains  and restore it? As an example:And the console output works well but no output in file. Only the log in the __init__ will be outputted to the file but not the log in function.Any help is appreciated. 
I guess it's an configuration issue of the logger. Especially the log level. The default is 'WARNING'. So your logger.info(..) get's ignored. You have to configure the logger.Looke here: Docs for logging
