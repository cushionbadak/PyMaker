I have a function that creates a dataframe:Now I want to put the dataframe values into a dictionary with the key being the date and the dataframe being the value:however, every time I rerun the function to add a new date, it adds the new date and value but it also overrides the previous date's value. What am I doing wrong?Thanks!
If you are keying your dictionary by dates, they must be unique to avoid overwriting the existing value for a given date.Alternatively, you could create a list of values for a date using something like this:This uses Python's EAFP coding style to attempt to append a dataframe to a list of dataframes for a given date.  If an exception is raised because the dictionary doesn't contain the date-key, it then creates a key of the given date and assigns it a single-item list value which can later be appended to.
From the minimal information that was given, I can only assume that you're putting a dictionary inside a for loop. For example, This will return a dictionary that only contains data for '2017-02-28' because the dictionary is being overwritten each iteration of the for loop.
