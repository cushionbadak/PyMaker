I'm trying to calculate a value once (because it takes a long time) and then store the value so that it can be used again.I am aware types.MethodType but I want to just reference a property and not have to call it.Error Message:
You just need to store the result of the expensive calculation in another attribute. You can mark it as private by giving it a name with a single leading underscore. That's just a convention though, Python doesn't do anything special with such attributes, but users of your code will know that they shouldn't meddle directly with it. Python doesn't really have private attributes, instead it has the philosophy of "we're all consenting adults here". See https://stackoverflow.com/a/70736/4014959outputWe initialize ._compute_once to None and only perform the expensive calculation if ._compute_once is None. We can force re-calculation at any time by resetting ._compute_once to None.For more info on how properties work, please read the excellent Descriptor HowTo Guide by Python core developer (and SO veteran) Raymond Hettinger.
