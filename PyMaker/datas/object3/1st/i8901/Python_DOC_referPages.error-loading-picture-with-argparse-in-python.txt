Using PyDev with Eclipse and receiving an "AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'perfect4k'.  The picture is saved under the project folder; however, it seems as though it is not able to load.  Thanks in advance, I am a newby at Python.  FYI, this is an example code I have borrowed off the internet.Output:
Python variable names cannot contain a dot "." character, as this is use to reference some further property of that object.The name "perfect4k.png" is used for one of the args, and this behaviour for argparse does not sound well defined. I suggest using an underscore "_" for this instead. If you are expecting the help text to show this name, you could try using the keyword parameter "metavar". It is described in the python documentation as:metavar - A name for the argument in usage messages.(reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-add-argument-method)In your specific case you could add it this way:So the actual argument is "input_file", but will be referred to as "perfect4k.png" in the help output.This means you will also need to refer to it as input_file elsewhere in the code. You will also need to give the same treatment to the output file.
