The ordering is in DFS meaning so if the <div id="DIV_2">..</div> has some child like <div id="DIV_2"><ul class=".." style="..">...</ul></div>, the ul tag would have id: UL_3.I tried to find all tags and then, remove their attributes and one by one add them their ID's.re.findall(r'<([a-z][a-z0-9]*)\b[^>]*>',snippet) This finds all tags.

First replace all tag attributes with the id structure and a unique identifier. In a second step replace the unique identifier one by one in a loop.Codere.subn() returns a tuple including the number of subs, this enables the break condition for the loop.Result
