Hi,I just want some clarification as to how data flows through a class. For instance, is the data in () in DangerousVirus = Sequence('atggagagccttgttcttggtgtcaa') self or seqstring?I'm confused as to how init can have 2 variables when theres only 1 in the (). Wouldnt that mean that only self contains the sequence and seqstring is empty?Thanks for the help! (:
self is a reference to a Sequence which is being initialized. The data string is passed as seqstring. You can see this by adding a line to print it:
The __init__ method does indeed take two arguments, but once an instance is created the self argument is "bound" to the instance (__init__ becomes a so called bound method of the instance), so you don't have to specify the instance itself anymore. If you call the  unbound __init__ function from the class like thisyou indeed have to specify the instance explicitly. The name self is just a convention, it could be anything in the definition. Take a look at the tutorial section on instance methods where this is explained.
As the other answers have said, the self arg gets passed automatically to method calls. So you must include it as the first arg in the method definition, but you must not include it in the method call.However, there's no need to define a class for this, a simple function is sufficient. And you can use the built-in str.translate method to perform the transcription very efficiently. For large sequences, this is much faster than doing it with a Python loop as in your transcription method, since most of the work is done by compiled code, so it runs as fast as if it were written in C, not Python.outputAs mentioned in the docs, any chars that aren't in the translation table will remain unchanged in the output string. Eg,output
