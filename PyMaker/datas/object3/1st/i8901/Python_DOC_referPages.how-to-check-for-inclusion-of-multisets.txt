A multiset is a set which allows for repeats. So a submultiset is one that includes fewer or the same number of each element.Is there a way to represent and operate on multisets in Python?Sets obviously don't work for this. For example, the code below returns True, which is not what I want because it takes the repeated letters as one letter.
The most simple representation for a multiset in Python which I know of is a collections.Counter object. It supports basic set operations (+, -, &, |), and although it doesn't have methods like issubset you can probably mimic those with the more simple operations. For example, To check if our Counter "multiset" Counter({'e': 4, 'h': 3}) is a subset of the multiset Counter({'e': 1, 'h': 1}), Or we could verify things like the well-known addition rule,  It is worth noting that a Counter does not have the same breadth of interface as something like a C++ std::multiset, so interpreting it as an equivalent structure wouldn't be a good idea. It can be handy for some operations however.
