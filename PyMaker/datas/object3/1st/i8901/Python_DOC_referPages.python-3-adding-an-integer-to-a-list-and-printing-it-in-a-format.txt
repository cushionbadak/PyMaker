My list is laid out like this:My code is this:The code is supposed to print out only the info of the players with at least 1 win.Each win is 3 points, so the program has to calculate each players points and display it along side their information in a table.The problem is that when it prints the points its on a newline indented, only the last player on the list isn't effected by this problem. Please help.
The last string in your split line contains a newline. You need to strip() it.or, when you read the line:Which gives you what you want:Also relevant:works and actually uses the template you designed.*data unpacks the list into its individual components, so you don't have to subscript them in, equivalent, in this case, to doing:print(template.format(data[0], data[1], data[2], data[3], data[4]))
The problem is that you don't remove the line end characters from the last element of the line! Right before printing, after you inserted the points, data looks like this:To fix it, you can add strip to your data = ... line to this:Some more points:don't compare strings when you want to compare numbersskip the header line, e.g. using next(file) before the loopno point in casting wins to float and then int, just use intinstead of insert(4, ...) just use append to add to the end of the list
At least one of your problems is data type:Here you have two strings and are comparing them lexicographically.  You really want two numbers and to compare them arithmetically.Without any error handling, that would look like this:
