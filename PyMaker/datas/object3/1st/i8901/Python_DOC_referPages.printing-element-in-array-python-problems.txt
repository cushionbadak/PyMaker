I want to go through each element of an array I've created. However, I'm doing some debugging and it's not. Here's what I have so far and what it's printing out. output: Why does 'i' return my whole array and not just the first element: 2? I'm not sure why this is returning my whole array.
This line will create an array of length 1. The only element in that array is an array of the numbers 2 -> 30. Your loop is printing the elements of the outer array. Change that line to:This answer is correct for Python 2 because the range function returns a list. Python 3 will return a range object (which can be iterated on producing the required values). The following line should work in Python 2 and 3:
First of all, change xcoords so that it isn't a list inside a list:We don't need to iterate over a list using an index into the list using len(xcoords).  In python we can simply iterate over a list like this:If we did need to keep track of the index we could use enumerate:
