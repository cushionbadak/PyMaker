I thought ayncio and the use of coroutine is not related with thread, since coroutine is a type of "thread" running under program's scheduler, so there should be only 1 thread running each process. But when I ran examples in Making 1 million requests with python-aiohttp, the code is like below:With Windows' Resource Monitor, I found that the code create 25 threads in 1 process.
The aiohttp library uses threads for concurrent DNS resolving by default in order not to block IO loop, see aiohttp/resolver.py. If you want asynchronous DNS lookups, you need to install python package aiodns, which in turn uses pycares.You can then do:If you want to set AsyncResolver as a global default, this worked for me with aiohttp 2.2.3:
Python's standard library includes a module called threading which allows to run python code concurrently by using Thread instances.  asyncio and aiohttp does not use the threading module to operate.Python itself might use OS (low level) threads as an implementation detail - but this probably changes between different platforms and versions.  For example, the number of OS threads for a simple print('hello world'); s = input() for python 3.6.0 in Windows 10 is 3.Check out https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/asyncio/windows_events.py to find clues for what might start OS threads in windows.
