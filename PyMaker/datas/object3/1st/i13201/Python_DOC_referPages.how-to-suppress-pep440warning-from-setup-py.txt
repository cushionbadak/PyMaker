I am running python setup.py or python3 setup.py which gives me PEP440Warning's for unrelated packages I am not going to fix:I would like to silence this warning, and I tried a number of variants of the -W switch without any success:match module: -W ignore:::pkg_resources: → warnings there, no message about invalid -W specificationmatch class name: -W ignore::PEP440Warning:: → Invalid -W option ignored: unknown warning category: 'PEP440Warning'match fully qualified class name: -W ignore::pkg_resources.PEP440Warning:: → Invalid -W option ignored: invalid module name: 'pkg_resources' (??)match the message test: -W ignore:PEP 440::: →  warnings there, no message about invalid -W specificationmatch all warnings: -W ignore  →  warnings thereThe last attempt leads me to believe that for some reason the command-line switch is not being honored at all. Why?
If using -W ignore still shows the warning, setuptools is either not using the warnings module to generate that output or it is starting a new Python without the same options.Try using an environment variable like this: export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore"If it still shows the warning, then I'd check the source code to see how that warning is being generated.
