Natural Text
I have a python code and i'm reading a certificate and matching only the root cert. For ex my certificate is as below:I want to fetch only the root certificate, which starts with CZImiZPy. I read the certificate into the variable data and applying the below regexBut it fetched both the encrypted certificates and not just the first one. Is there any better way I can tweak the regular expression?
You want to search for text, not substitute it with something else. Explanation:re.search() will always return the first match.
re.sub can get a count variable as a parameter:re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)The optional argument count is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced..If you want to only change the first match, do the following:Note that if you want to extract, you shouldn't use re.sub. Visit the re module to learn about all available functions that help you extracting patterns from a string.
