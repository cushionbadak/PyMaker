So I got the assignment to make a small Bingo App (Windows btw) after I followed a few webinars on Tkinter GUI and some Googling.I have made successfull little apps that worked correctly, but this time I try to make it with knowledge I think I have.Anyway, in that Bingo app, I want 50 labels that represent 50 numbers of the Bingo card, 5 rows of 10 numbers.I know how to align them, but they need to show up first.Can you look at my code and assess what I do wrong?Ignore the many Dutch comments :)
You need to learn about data structures, like list.You had root.mainloop() early on in the code. That starts a loop. Nothing after that is executed until the window is closed, which means it has to be at the end.Choose one geometry manager. You can't use both grid() and pack() in the same parent widget, much less on the same child widget.You had some typos, like label7 = instead of label17 =, and label28.Label instead of label28 = Label. Most of these would never have happened if you had used a list.Obviously, 50 labels won't fit in a single column in a window of that size. You've got some decisions ahead of you involving window size, label placement, possible scrollbar, and so on.The resulting code taking into account all these points (except the last) is shown below.
