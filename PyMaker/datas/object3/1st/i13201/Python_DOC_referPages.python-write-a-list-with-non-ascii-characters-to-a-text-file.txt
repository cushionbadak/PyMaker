Python seems not to like non-ASCII characters and gives me the following errors:Do you know if there is a way to solve this problem ? Maybe it's possible to write files in UTF-8 / unicode ?
The issue is that the file is getting openned with ascii encoding (which might be what is returned by locale.getpreferredencoding() for your environment). You can try openning with the correct encoding (maybe utf-8) . Also, you should use with statement so that it handles closing the file for you.For Python 2.x , you can use codecs.open() function instead of open() -For Python 3.x , you can use the built-in function open() , which supports encoding argument. Example -

Best method would be to play with unicodesOutput:Dejan Živković
Try using UTF-8 encoding. You can start by putting # -- coding: utf-8 -- at the top of your .py file.
