I have Python2.7 installed on my computer. Is there a way to see if the .py code I have will compile in Python3 short of installing Python3?
You can use this program: https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.htmlIt will convert your code form 2 to 3, or give you information about what needs to be changed.
Without knowing anything about your code or operating system, it's hard to say what would be best. If static analysis is the way you want to go, I would suggest taking a look at this to see if any differences jump out at you:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#common-stumbling-blocksBy the way, Python 2 and 3 can be installed simultaneously on the same machine without too much effort if you change your mind.If you're running Linux: Running both python 2.6 and 3.1 on the same machineIf you're running Windows: How to install both Python 2.x and Python 3.x in Windows 7
