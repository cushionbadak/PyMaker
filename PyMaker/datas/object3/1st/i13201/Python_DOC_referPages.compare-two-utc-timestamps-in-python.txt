My data has a UTC timestamp field as a string format(e.g '1426402510'). I need to compare this field to the current time and emit the duration in seconds. I am not sure how to convert this string into a proper datetime format for conversion - my attempts at using the different datetime methods in Python yielded errors, so I would appreciate your help. Here is a portion of my code:thanks for your help.
To get the current time as "seconds since the epoch", use time.time():If you need to use datetime:You could use timedelta.total_seconds() on Python 2 where / timedelta doesn't work.
To convert the string to a datetime object, you just need to use utcfromtimestamp calling int on your timestamp string.
