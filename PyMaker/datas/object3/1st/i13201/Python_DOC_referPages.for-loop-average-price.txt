I need to create a function where I can find the average price of all the cars (given any list of tuples)^ I know this doesn't work for the sum... but I have no idea what to do^ I know i should implement something like that to find the averageHow do I approach this? Do I have to have my sum_price(CL) function print a list for the sum() operator to work?
You're on the right track with sum(), but you should put the iteration inside it, so that it actually has something to add up:To find the average, just divide by the length of the list. You don't need to divide it by all numbers from 0 to the length of the list (exclusive).And I would use return here:Then put the call in a print() call:
You can use a list comprehension inside the sum function call, iethis would be functionally equivalent
In python 3.4 and above use the builtin statistics module and the mean function:
