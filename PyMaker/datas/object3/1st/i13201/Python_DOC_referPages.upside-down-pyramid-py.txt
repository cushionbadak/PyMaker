So I have an assignment that requires me to print an upside down pyramid made out of asterisks in Python. I know how to print out a normal pyramid but how do I flip it?The height of the pyramid is determined by the input of the user. This is what I have for the normal pyramid:Output:
If you want to reverse the pyramid, just reverse the outer loop. Thanks to the magic of python, you can just use the reversed builtin function.Also, you can simplify the body of the loop a little bit using string multiplication and the str.center function.
