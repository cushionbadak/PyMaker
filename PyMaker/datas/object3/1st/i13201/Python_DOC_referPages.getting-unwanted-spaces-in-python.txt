I'm trying to read from an originally empty file, after a write, before closing it. Is this possible in Python?Flushing with f.flush() doesn't seem to work, as the final f.read() still returns nothing.Is there any way to read the "foobar" from the file besides re-opening it?
You need to reset the file object's index to the first position, using seek():which will make the file available for reading from it.
File objects keep track of current position in the file. You can get it with f.tell() and set it with f.seek(position). To start reading from the beginning again, you have to set the position to the beginning with f.seek(0).http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek
Seek back to the start of the file before reading:
