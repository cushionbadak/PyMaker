I am writing a program to calculate the mass of a given molecule. I have defined every element as an integer. I need to be able to type in a chemical formula like NaCl and have it print out the sum of the atomic masses of Na and Cl. So far I have things set up so that I can type in a chemical formula and it turns it into a list of elements, so if I typed in NaCl it would give me ['Na', 'Cl']. Here is the code:Firstly I need to know how to tell the computer I am inputting variables that I previously defined, not strings. Then I want to make it assign each item from the list to its own variable. Something likeMy main issue is that at the moment my input is treated as a string. 
I believe what you want is a dictionary, like so:Later, when you have your inputs, you can access them in a loop:
Use the sum() and map() functions to add up the appropriate values from a dictionary:
Using a dictionary, you can easily take string input and handle it:
