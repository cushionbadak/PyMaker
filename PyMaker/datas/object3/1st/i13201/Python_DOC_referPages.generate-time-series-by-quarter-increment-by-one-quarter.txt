I looked through the arrow and python docs, doesn't seem to be anything that incrementally steps by quarter. For example, the following code incrementally gives you the month, given a starting month up until now. Looking thru the arrow docs, month end is convenient. anything out there that does quarterly?I'm looking for a solution that steps by quarter up to nowinput: 14Q3output: 
To get the current quarter, use: (month - 1) // 3 + 1. To generate quarters in the given range:   where Quarter is a simple namedtuple subclass:OutputThe current quarter (15Q4) is not included.
not pretty but works
