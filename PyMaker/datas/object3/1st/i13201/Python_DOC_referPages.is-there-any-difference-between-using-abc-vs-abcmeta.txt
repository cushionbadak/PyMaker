In Python 3.4+, we can door we can doAre there any differences between the two that I should be aware of?
abc.ABC basically just an extra layer over metaclass=abc.ABCMeta. i.e abc.ABC implicitly defines the metaclass for us.(Source: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.4/Lib/abc.py#l234)The only difference is that in the former case you need a simple inheritance and in the latter you need to specify the metaclass.From What's new in Python 3.4(emphasis mine):New class ABC has ABCMeta as its meta class. Using ABC as a base  class has essentially the same effect as specifying  metaclass=abc.ABCMeta, but is simpler to type and easier to read.Related issue: Create abstract base classes by inheritance rather than a direct invocation of __metaclass__
