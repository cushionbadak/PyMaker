my code needs to ask the user for 3 numbers. if the numbers are over 100 or under 1, tell them "no way, try a different number"My problem is: I can't figure out how to define my variable prompt, and am getting the below stacktrace when I run my code.Code:Stacktrace:
Here is how I would approach the get_int function:Inside function get_int, the prompt, minval, and maxval arguments are already defined because they are in the argument list. The prompt argument is passed to the input() function, and then the minval and maxval limits are used for range checking within an infinite while loop. The function returns a valid number within the range. If the user enters an integer that's out of range, we ask them again until they give an acceptable input. So the caller is guaranteed to get an integer within the specified range.This isn't ideal design, because what if the user doesn't want to enter a number, but they want to "navigate back"... so that's outside the scope of this approach. But there is a more advanced programming technique called exception handling (read up on try / catch / throw for examples) 7.4. The try statement.Outside the function, where get_int is invoked, the minval and maxval are defined as global variables in the main module namespace. For testing I just ran in interactive mode, accepting a single value. Tested on python 2.7 and python 3.2.If you've never seen the "xxxxx {0} xxxx".format(value) string formatting expression before, that's described in the python help files section 6.1.2. String Formatting and 6.1.3.2. Format examples.
