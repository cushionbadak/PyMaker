Hello everyone, I'm using the library "ParseDateTime" to convert a date as a string into type date.E.g:Oct 4 = ' 2015-10-04 00:00:00 'I Try this:This code works, but strangely i see 2016 instead of 2015.So I see this:' 2016-10-04 00:00:00 'Thanks
To parse "Oct 4", you could use datetime.strptime():If you want dates from the past; pass "Jan 1" for the corresponding year as the source time (default is the current time "Oct 25"):
