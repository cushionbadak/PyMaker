I'm trying to write a wav upload function for my webapp. The front end portion seems to be working great. The problem is my backend (python). When it receives the binary data I'm not sure how to write it to a file. I tried using the basic write functon, and the sound is corrupt... Sounds like "gobbly-gook". Is there a special way to write wav files in Python?Here is my backend... Not really much to it.I even tried...I am using aplay to play the sound, and I noticed that all the properties are messed up as well.Before:Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 44100 Hz, StereoAfter upload:Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono
Perhaps the wave module might help?EDIT:I think in your case, you might only need:In this case, you just need to know the sampling rate. Check the wave module for information on the other output file parameters (i.e. the arguments to the setparams method).
The code I pasted will write a wav file as long as the data isn't corrupt. It was not necessary to use the wave module.I was originally reading the file in Javascript as FileAPI.readAsBinaryString. I changed this to FileAPI.readAsDataURL, and then decoded it in python using base64.decode(). Once I decoded it I was able to just write the data to a file. The .wav file was in perfect condition.
