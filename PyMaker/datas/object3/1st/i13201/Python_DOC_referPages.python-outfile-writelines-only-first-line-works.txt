Natural Text
I found a line of code that searches for and replaces a string if it appears in text on this answer:Search for a line that contains some text, replace complete line pythonI modified it and used it three times in a row like so:The problem is, the only line that works is the first one. Why is this and how do I solve it?
I'm going to guess that searchFile is a file (which you created with a call to open), not a list.File objects have an internal pointer to their current location. When you read something from a file, the internal pointer gets updated - so a future call to read will not return the same result.Iterating over the lines in a file, as you do here (line for line in searchFile) is another example of an operation which changes your current position in the file. You can think of iterating a file as calling read lots of times, under the hood.So once you've iterated through all the lines in a file, you've reached the end, and subsequent reads from the file will return nothing. You can test this by getting the current position of the file after you've iterated using tell:There are two ways to get around this. One option is to reset the file's position to 0 after you've read it.The other option is to read the file once and store the contents in a list.You should choose the first option if your file is too big to fully read into memory, and the second option if you want to be able to close your input file quickly.
