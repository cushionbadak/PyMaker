This is a very simple question but I can't seem to understand why I am not getting it. Result: Expected Result: Although it iterates over all the item I only get first item index, why is it? Also advise even though its pretty simple. 
index returns the index of the first element only. From the docsReturn the index in the list of the first item whose value is x. It is an error if there is no such item.Use enumerate instead. When you iterate using enumerate you can access the element and its index on the loop:
Use List Comprehension:Output: [0, 2, 5]
Use keyword enumerate()  this will generate a counter from 0 to N.So i will contain the indexes for li.
