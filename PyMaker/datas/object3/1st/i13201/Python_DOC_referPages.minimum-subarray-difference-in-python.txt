Consider I have a non-empty array of integers: A0..An. And consider a parameter P where 0 < P <=n. I need to find a minimum absolute difference between left and right subarray splited by P. For example:The solution in this case is 1I finished with the code below:but I my solution has some bugs. It works in some cases but return wrong answer in some conditions. For example: in condition like large sequence, numbers from -1 to 1, length = ~100,000 it returns the wrong answerP.S.: I finished with solution below:
The bug is this:You terminate if next is not improving on diff. This is wrong, since you still might find a better solution later on.Other than that, I think your idea goes in the right direction. What you should do to fix your bug is go through the whole array unconditionally and just return diffin the end.Like so:(Note: I tried to modify as little as possible, i.e. to stay as close to your code as possible. Also, I did not really test this. But I hope you get the idea.)
This is more concise yet still O(n):itertools.accumulate is available from Python 3.2 up.
EDIT (the previous solution had a high complexity, my bad)This is a remake of yours, but getting rid of the indexing on the listand using the min built-in function to get the minimum.calling it withproduces
