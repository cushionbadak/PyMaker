I have 2D lists of the form:Sometimes there are 4 (as here), 8, 10, 12 or 16 pairs of xy coordinates in these lists.The following little function I've written will test whether two sets of x y coordinates overlap, e,g., dotOverlap( [55, 99], [399, 88] )However, I'm somewhat embarrassed to say I cannot think of an easy way to test all possible cases of overlap (i.e., pairwise comparisons):How might I programmatically go about doing this?
You can use itertools.combinations to generate all the combinations and you can unpack the combinations over your function, one by one, like this
