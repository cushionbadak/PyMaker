I am using Windows 10.  I have been able to install virtualenv using pip.  I installed both Python 3.5 and python 2.7.  That was done from the command line.  I even ran the commands as administrator.  In my path, I have Python 3.5, and the corresponding Scripts folder, occurring prior to the path to python 2.7.  It appears to use the python 3.5 by default.  So, when I ran the command 'virtualenv test' it starts to install a virtual environment but then it fails and I can verify that it did not actually complete the process of creating a virtual environment.  I posted the output of this command at this url: http://pastebin.com/NLZ6tKn1As an additional note, I am running the command from the D drive and python 3.5 is installed in the Program Files folder on the C drive.  Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions, Bruce
This is a bug specific to Windows and it happens when you have a space in the directory path where Python is installed.This is also why the default installer for Python uses a path like C:\Python27\ to install Python (for the 2.7 version).Your directory for Python is c:\\program files\\python 3.5 - please uninstall Python and then reinstall it to a path that doesn't have spaces.
