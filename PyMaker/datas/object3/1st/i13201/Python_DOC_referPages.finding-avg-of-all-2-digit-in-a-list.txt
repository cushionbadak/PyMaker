I'm trying to find the avg of list but only when n >= 10 (two digit numbers, my original list is limited to 100).Here's what I have right now: I get that I have to find the total sum of the list when n > 10 and then dividing by the length (only > 10, my original list has single digit elements, so I'd like to avoid them). But when I run it, I get an error saying: local variable 'n' referenced before assignmentAny help on how to structure this function to achieve the end results (sum/total of only 2-digit elements = avg)Thanks!

I'd either collect the good grades and use sum/len, or use the mean function:
Here is a clean way of doing it:
So you should use a for loop instead of a while loop. Instead of having two for loops and making a new list, you could just account for the sum inside the first for loop. I demonstrate this below.
I think you should manually go over the code step by step and try to understand what is wrong.  Meanwhile this may give you some hints
Since Python 3.4 there is a statistics module.So you just need to filter out numbers in range <10,100), for example with a list comprehension, and then pass this filtered list to the mean function. Simple as that.
You could do this fairly simply with a list comprehension
