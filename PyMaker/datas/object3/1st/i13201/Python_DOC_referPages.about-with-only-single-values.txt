I have It's not a dictionary because I don't have key: value pairs. Does using the dictionary brackets like this create a new technique that I haven't learned yet and if so, what is it called so I can read up on it?If not, I'm assuming that the incorrect use of the {} is the reason I'm having trouble adding and subtracting from it?Basically the premise is"If word in wordList meets certain criteria, add that word to newList"
{var1, var2, var3, ... } is the syntax for creating a Set. A Set is a collection that has no repeated elements and has no indices. For future reference, you can use the type() method to find the type of any object, like this:
You make a set, there is the document:https://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html
When you use {'word1', 'word2', 'word3'} to define your value, actually it equals set(['word1', 'word2', 'word3']).You can try to check them:So, they are same.If you want to make a dictionary object, the format is necessary to be combined of key and value as a pair:Although it's similar for brackets between dictionary and set , as Will Sherwood said, you can use type to check type of the object.
