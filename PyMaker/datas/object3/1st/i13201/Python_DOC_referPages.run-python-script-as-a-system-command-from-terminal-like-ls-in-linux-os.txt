Natural Text
I have a python script which i want to run from terminal in linux without using "python" keyword in the beginning. For example my script name is helloworld.py which is accepting 2 arguments from terminal.I want to run this script as "helloworld" from terminal instead of "python helloworld.py"
To make the file an executable, rename and change the mode for the access permissions, e.g.:And edit the first line of the file be a shebang:There are at least three ways to run it from a shell:Use something like ./helloworld or /path/to/helloworldMove it to a directory on your PATH, e.g. /usr/local/bin or ~/binModify PATH to add the directory, e.g. export PATH=$PATH:/to/dir
