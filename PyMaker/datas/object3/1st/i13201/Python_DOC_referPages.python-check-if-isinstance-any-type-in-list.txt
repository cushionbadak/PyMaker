How do I pythonicly do:It seems silly I can't just pass in a list of classinfo's:So what is the isinstanceofany function?
isinstance() takes a tuple of classes for the second argument. It'll return true if the first argument is an instance of any of the types in that sequence:In other words, isinstance() already offers this functionality, out of the box.From the isinstance() documentation:If classinfo is neither a class object nor a type object, it may be a tuple of class or type objects, or may recursively contain other such tuples (other sequence types are not accepted).Emphasis mine; note the recursive nature; (classinfo1, (classinfo2, classinfo3)) is also a valid option.
You were pretty close with the title of your question already. You could use any and a list:But looking in the docs of isinstance reveals:Return true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns false. If classinfo is not a class (type object), it may be a tuple of type objects, or may recursively contain other such tuples (other sequence types are not accepted). If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised.This means the better way to do it is
This will solve your problem:Based on the documentation there are a lot of ways you can pass values of types in to isinstance.You might also look into voluptuous if you're trying to do a more complicated validation of which this is just a part.
You generally shouldn't be using isinstance, but what you're wanting to do can be accomplished with the any() builtin function.
