What would be the best way to read the first couple of bytes of an opened file without messing with the file position? Is this too much jumping around:
You could use os.pread(fd, buffersize, offset) but that was only added in Python 3.3. Like this: to read the 2 bytes at the start of the file.Another option would be to duplicate the fd and then seek on the duplicate and then close the duplicate: Why can't file objects be duplicated directly?
