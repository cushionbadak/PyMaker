When outputting a list of objects how can you return an int type representation for the objects?I've tried this:Where list_of_objects is a list of Passport instances. But this gives an error __repr__ returned non-string (type int).I could solve this problem using a string for both, but I'm wondering if type int is possible?
__repr__ is required to return a string representation of the object. Returning a different type is not a valid implementation of __repr__.If you want a way to return some number, then add a custom method that does that.Btw., note that implementing __repr__ is not a way to make id in list_of_objects work. For that to work, you should implement __hash__ and __eq__. But at that point, you should really think about if you want 5 == Passport(5) to be true; probably not. So you should change the way your check works by explicitely looking at the id property instead.Instead of if id in list_of_objects, you could do the following:
You could check a parallel list of the object ids instead.
__repr__ must return a str as you have seen.The proper way to do what you are asking is:
