Here's what I'm doing to rescale a tuple of ints to another tuple of ints. Is there a better way?I need this for an image resize with the Image module, as that requires a tuple of ints. So for example, if I want to resize an image by 50% I would doSo I'm only working with a tuple of length 2. I'm mostly concerned with simplicity of the code as the above seems like overkill.
In your code, you are creating a list and then converting it to a tuple. Use the map function to delay evaluation of of the list (in python3) instead.Based  on the comment, you can do this too (remove []):
I think something similar to this would help you.As per definition of the map function:map(function, iterable, ...)  Apply function to every item of iterable and return a list of the results
