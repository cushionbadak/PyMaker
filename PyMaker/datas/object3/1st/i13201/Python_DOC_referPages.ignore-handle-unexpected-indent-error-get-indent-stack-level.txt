I want to use indentations for code control, and have two questions.1) Is it possible to force python ignore 'unexpected indent' errors?Code like this raises 'unexpected indent' exception.Is here any flag or another trick to execute above code as normal?2) How I can get indention level in my program? Is something like that possible:Output:Thanks!
IndentationErrors are syntax errors; they happen at compile time, not run time. So you can't do anything in code to ignore them; you'd need to change the parser somehow.You might consider using Python's context managers. These enable running specific code when entering a block; this might fit your use case, even if the actual enter code is pretty trivial. See the contextlib module for some examples.
