I am trying to read a .csv file and add values for the corresponding month.For example, if my file has 3 years of data and I want to find the sum of the values that correspond to january in those 3 years.File example:and so on.. I know how to open the file and convert the file into a list using split and strip.I do not understand how to append specific elements to a list because my data has almost 50 years and its a dumb idea to go for if statements.

The open, strip and split functions are acceptable for reading CSV files is arguably it would be more straightforward to use a module like this.Reading CSV then becomes:I'm not sure what is dumb about using if statements, but the date format you list as an example is a bit odd. Also, 10 lines of real data would have been more useful to help answer your question.There are lots of ways to solve your month correlation requirement. A basic approach would be something like:...which would work but may be more code than you need.If all you want to do isread datafilter certain rowson those rows do a sumthen look into iterators, predicates for a filter, and the built-in sum function.
If you want to do all the heavy lifting yourself, without taking much help from the standard library:
There is no other way to find the elements you need other than scanning each one for "jan"Computers are really fast and this is an operation with O(n) complexity (not that complex). I think your answer would look something like this assuming you parse the CSV file into a List of Months and values
