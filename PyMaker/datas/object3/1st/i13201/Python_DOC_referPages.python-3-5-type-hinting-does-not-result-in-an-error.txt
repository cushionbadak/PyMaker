One of the new features in python 3.5 is type hinting inspired from this project. typing: PEP 484 â€“ Type Hints.I want to test it, but it does not work as expected.results in:I would expect an error because I am expecting a bool as return. I tested it on python:3.5 (docker) and local. Did i miss something, to make it work? Does this typing not work at runtime (like python app.py)?
See the fifth paragraph of the abstract in the PEP you link to:While these annotations are available at runtime through the usual __annotations__ attribute, no type checking happens at runtime . Instead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line type checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily
In order to get static checks, consider a project like mypy, on which PEP 484 was based on. No checking will be performed on runtime is explicitly declared in the PEP to ease fears of some transition to a static looking Python. As Daniel pointed out, you can view the attributes in the __annotations__ attribute in a form of:for function overdrawn(). If you want you can create your own small type checking function to perform little runtime checks utilizing this dict. Play around with it. Additionally, if you're up for the read, take a look at my answer on type hints here.
