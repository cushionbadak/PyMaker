I am trying to make a python script that will allow me to place music into one large folder so when I run the script it will create folders according to the first part of the music files. So let's say I have a music file called OMFG - Ice Cream.mp3 I would like to be able to split each music file name so that instead of OMFG - Ice Cream.mp3 it would chop it off in this case Ice Cream.mp3 and then it would use OMFG to create a folder called that. After it created that folder I would then like to find out a way to then move, in this case OMFG - Ice Cream.mp3 into the folder that was just created.Here is my code so far:My main trouble is how to loop through each object in the string.Thanks, Alex
It is convenient to use pathlib module for such tasks:Example:It moves OMFG - Ice Cream.mp3 to OMFG/Ice Cream.mp3.If you want to move OMFG - Ice Cream.mp3 to OMFG/OMFG - Ice Cream.mp3:
You can try out this code that:Loops through the listSplit each element into the listCreate folder if it does not  exist yetTransfer music to that folderLoops through the list
