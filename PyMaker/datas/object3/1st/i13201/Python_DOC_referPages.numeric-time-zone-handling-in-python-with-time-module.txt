I have the following Python code:I have made a mistake, it appears.  For example, in the JSON that I'm reading, time_local is [06/Oct/2015:15:29:35 +0000].  My script outputs 1444166975 as the result.  However, that is not correct, so far as I can see:Having the linux date command do the conversion back gives:So far as I understand (which could easily be wrong...), I want the output to be in GMT in order for the conversion to epoch to be correct.  What am I missing?
Don't use time.mktime() with UTC time. It accepts local time and therefore your code is wrong if your local timezone is not UTC.Use calendar.timegm() instead:See Converting datetime.date to UTC timestamp in Python
