I have an error raise eb : list index out of range.I don't understand why when i do a raise in an other try - catchI'm doing a try - catch in a try - catch and both raises errors.Here is my code and the error line is at raise eb :Regards and thanks
If you comment the raise statement there, it doesn't mean that you don't have an Error; it simply means that you handled the Exception -- which in your case is from what I can tell an IndexError -- by catching it with the except Exception and then calling PrintException(). When you raise an exception what you actually do is: The raise statement allows the programmer to force a specified exception to occur.So, by un-commenting, you allow the IndexError named eb to re-appear after catching it in the inner try-except block and get caught by the outer try - except clause in which you again re-raise it.Generally, you don't want to catch exceptions in such a generic way because it might hide some unpredicted behaviour of the program that you would like to know about. Limit the exceptions you catch in the except clause by simply specifying them, in your case, an except clause of the form:would probably suffice.
