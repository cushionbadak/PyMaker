Let's say I have this:How can I possibly remove say the dictionary with id 3? (so I the dictionary list will contain id 1, 2 and 4) or people that weight over 180 (so I won't have id 2 anymore)I've tried everything from easy things like To other things I found on google but to no avail. I'm sorry if that's been posted before or if it seems super easy but I've been looking for hours for something to help me and nothing did.
as it is not a good idea to delete from a list you are iterating over i suggest the following list comprehension:
pop() for arrays takes an integer as an argument, not an object. Use instead.https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html
