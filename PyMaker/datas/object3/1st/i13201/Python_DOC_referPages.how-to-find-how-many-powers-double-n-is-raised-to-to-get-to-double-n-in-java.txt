I want to find the equivalent of Math.log in Python in Java. Basically how many powers is a double 'n' raised to to get to the full double 'n'. Example (100, 10) returns 2. Because, 10 is raised to the second power to get to 100.27, 3 returns: 3.49, 7 returns 2. Etc... Does anyone know what this would be in Java.
In Python you can use math.log which takes a second argument which is the base.In Java there is no such function, but you can trivially solve for the same thing
