i use ipython notebook and I want to call a terminal command: fft <in> <out>my "fft" is in my $PATH so using a terminal, this would work. How can I run this command in my ipython notebook?the problem is that my fft executable is in my $PATH folder, and python won't recognize this
Found the solution:xterm opens a new terminalfft ...; calls the function fft exit -f closes the terminal
