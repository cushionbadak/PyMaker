Natural Text
So basically I have a program which can create a users username and password in a document and search for the password used with the username that is input by the person using the program.For example:The programs asks me to input a username I enter: '13'.Under 13 in the text document is 'sadfsdfsdf'.I want the program to skip to below the 'Username: 13' and read and print 'Password: sadfsdfsdf'.note that I have multiple usernames and passwords In the .txt fileu = 'Username: 'Thanks in advance!
When you want to open a file, you should almost always use the with statement:This will ensure that any errors are being handled correctly and the file is not left open.Now that the file is open, we need to loop through each line until we find one that matches our username. I hope you know how for loop works:And we need to get the next line which contains the password. There are many ways to get the next line, but one simple way is to use the next() function which simply gets us the next element from an iterable (the next line from a file in this case):Now you have a password and an username, and you can do whatever you want with them. It's often a good idea to have the inputs and outputs outside of your program's logic, so don't print the password right inside the for loop, but instead just receive it there and then do the printing outside.You might even wanna turn the whole search logic into a function:Finally, it's absolutely insane to store anything in this format (not to mention password security stuff, but I get you're just learning stuff), why not do something like:This could then easily be converted into a dict:And now to get a password for an username, you'd do:
So, imagining your file is like so:You can parse it (with regular expressions) like so:Now you can get the password of someone by asking for the password of that user :
Maybe not the pretties, but something like this will work: 
Note that this will not work if a password happens to be a username, e.g:If you search for "user3" this code will output "user3" as the password for "user3" because it finds the first instance of "user3" (line 4) and then looks to the next line (line 5), which is the next username.Even worse, if "user3" is the last line in the file, it will end with an error because there are no more lines. You could add a check that the index of the found username is even (i.e. index 0, 2, 4, 8) with this code:but there isn't much you can do if this happens.However, you could manipulate the file of usernames to only have usernames like this:which printsSo the code could be changed to this:Here is a breakdown
