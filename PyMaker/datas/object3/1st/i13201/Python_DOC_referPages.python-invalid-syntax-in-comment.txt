Natural Text
Using IDLE Python 3.4.3. This is a script that gives the user a small quiz, then calculates how many the got right. I'm having an invalid syntax error in a comment before my script runs. Here is the whole code around the comment. The specific comment is under the line score = decimal.Decimal(score):I run this, get the invalid syntax error, then it highlights the s and c in the word score red. using ' makes no difference in this. However, when I run the code like this:It still gives a syntax error, but this time only highlights the s in score red. repr added by unutbu's request:Is there an error with the comment?
# is used to indicate the start of a comment. Triple quotes are used to indicate the start and end of multiline strings. Although strings are not comments, sometimes multiline strings can be used as multiline comments. However, the placement of the string still has to abide by Python syntax rules.raises a SyntaxError because the string follows an expression which is not a string. amountright/7*100 """this takes the amount...""" is roughly equivalent to Python does not know how to evaluate a number followed by a string. Even if it could be evaluated, the value would be assigned to score. The multiline string would not be interpreted as a comment. For the multiline string to act as a comment it must be on a line by itself:or, use the more commonly used comment syntax:Putting a # in front of every line might seem like a pain, but a good texteditor for programming in Python should have a way for you to select a region of text andpress a button or key combination to insert the # signs for you. If youreditor does not have this feature, find one thatdoes.
I had a similar problem:Sometimes IDLE points you in the wrong direction and says "invalid syntax" when there is a wrong character at the wrong place, e.g.works well let's say in line 50, butproduces the message "invalid syntax" pointing to a irrelevant comment in line 1It took me some time to find the typo "]" in the formatted string.So always check your braces!
