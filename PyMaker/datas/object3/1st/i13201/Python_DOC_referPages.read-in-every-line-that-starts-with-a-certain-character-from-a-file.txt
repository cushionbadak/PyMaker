Natural Text
Hi i'm just learning python and i am trying to read in every line in a file that starts with an 'X:'. I don't want to read the 'X:' itself just the rest of the line that follows.This is what i've got so far:It doesn't have any errors but it doesn't print anything out.
try this:dont use names like file or linenote the append just uses the item name not as part of the fileby pre-reading the file into memory the for loop was accessing the data by character not by line
That should give you an array of all the lines you want, but they'll be split into separate words. Also, you'll need to have defined storagearray before we call it in the above block of code. It's an inelegant solution, as I'm a learner myself, but it should do the job!edit: If you want to output the lines, simply use python's inbuilt print function:
Read every line in the file (for loop) Select lines that contains X: Slice the line with index 0: with starting char's/string as X: = ln[0:] Print lines that begins with X:
