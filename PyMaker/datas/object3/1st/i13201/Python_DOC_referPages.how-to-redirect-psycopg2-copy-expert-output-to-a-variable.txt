I would like to process the csv data of a table instead of writing it to a file. How can I redirect psycopg2 copy_expert() into a variable, somewhat like this:
You can temporarily redirect sys.stdout to a string in Python 3.4.contextlib.redirect_stdout(new_target)Context manager for temporarily redirecting sys.stdout to another file  or file-like object.This tool adds flexibility to existing functions or classes whose  output is hardwired to stdout.For example, the output of help() normally is sent to sys.stdout. You  can capture that output in a string by redirecting the output to a  io.StringIO object:https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.redirect_stdout
Instead of redirecting sys.stdout to a variable, it's easier to replace sys.stdout directly:This works because io.StringIO returns a file object, which copy_expert expects for the second argument.
