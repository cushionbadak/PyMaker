I am trying to get my output data to look like this:But I don't know how to deal with the varying name length. My output currently looks like this.The program I have written is to take an input file of grade scores and collect the data and neatly print out the average.The input file looks something like this:And here is my code that collects the name and scores, and prints out the data with last name, first name, average score, then the actual scores that resulted to the average.I just need to figure out how to have even spaces so it makes an even row and column like the first output. Help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!
I find it simpler to use Python's builtin C-style formatting:Note that a negative field width indicates that the field is to be left-justified.
Use string formatting with field width specifiers:This uses the str.format() method with the Format String Syntax to slot values into a template.The first slot formats strings into a field 20 characters wide, the second slots floating point numbers into a field 4 characters wide, using 1 digit after the decimal point (leaving 1 for the decimal point itself plus 2 digits before the point).If I were you, I'd also look at the csv module to read your data, rather than use string manipulations. You'll get list objects with separate values for each column:
The answer I find easiest is just using some basic string arithmetic. For example, say for want the aligned a variable 20 spaces ahead of left-alignment, in your case the "average" variable, you could simply do this It's just a bit lengthier, but the code is easier to interpret in my opinion.(Note: this method only works with mono spaced fonts! But most Python output is defaulted to a MS font :-) )
