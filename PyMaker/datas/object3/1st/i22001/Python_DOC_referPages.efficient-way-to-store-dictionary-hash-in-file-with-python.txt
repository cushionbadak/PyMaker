I'm implementing a Unix userland tool that needs to store a hash on the disk. The hash will be read every run of the program, pretty frequently. The hash needs to store "name:path" values only.I looked at the bsddb standard library module for python, but I can see it will be deprecated in Python 3. I also saw the pickle standard library module.I'm not a python guy, so what is the efficient way for hash serialization and frequent open/read/close operations?
I would start with the shelve module and see if that isn't too slow. It does exactly what you want.or to read from itIt's essentially a wrapper around pickle that provides a dictionary abstraction.
I'd use pickle and see if it's fast enough for your needs. 
I would suggest you use pickle / shelve for serialization of data.http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/01/saving-python-dict-to-file-using-pickle/http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html
