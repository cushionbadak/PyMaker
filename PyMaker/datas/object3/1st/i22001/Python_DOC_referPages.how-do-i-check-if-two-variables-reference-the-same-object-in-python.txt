x and y are two variables.I can check if they're equal using x == y, but how can I check if they have the same identity?Example:Now x == y is True because x and y are equal, however, x and y aren't the same object.I'm looking for something like sameObject(x, y) which in that case is supposed to be False. 
You can use is to check if two objects have the same identity.
To build on the answer from Mark Byers:The is evaluation will work when the variables contain objects and not primitive types.  If you need to compare primitives as well, I'd suggest using the builtin id() function.From the Python docs:Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime.So that will become this:
