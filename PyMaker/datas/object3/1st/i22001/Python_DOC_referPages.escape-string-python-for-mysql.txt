Natural Text
I use Python and MySQLdb to download web pages and store them into database. The problem I have is that I can't save complicated strings in the database because they are not properly escaped.Is there a function in Python that I can use to escape a string for MySQL? I tried with ''' (triple simple quotes) and """, but it didn't work. I know that PHP has mysql_escape_string(), is something similar in Python?Thanks.
See MySQL C API function mapping: http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/MySQLdb.html
The MySQLdb library will actually do this for you, if you use their implementations to build an SQL query string instead of trying to build your own.Don't do:Do:

Use sqlalchemy's text function to remove the interpretation of special characters:Note the use of the function text("your_insert_statement") below.  What it does is communicate to sqlalchemy that all of the questionmarks and percent signs in the passed in string should be considered as literals.  
{!a} applies ascii() and hence escapes non-ASCII characters like quotes and even emoticons.Here is an examplePython3 docs
