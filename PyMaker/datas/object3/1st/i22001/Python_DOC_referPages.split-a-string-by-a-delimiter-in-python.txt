How to split this string where __ is the delimiterTo get an output of ['MATCHES', 'STRING']?
You can use the str.split function: string.split('__')
You may be interested in the csv module, which is designed for comma-separated files but can be easily modified to use a custom delimiter.
When you have two or more (in the example below there're three) elements in the string, then you can use comma to separate these items:After this line of code, the three variables will have values from three parts of the variable evSo, if the variable ev contains this string and we apply separator '@':Sa., 23. März@19:00@Klavier + Orchester: SPEZIALThen, after split operation the variabledate will have value "Sa., 23. März"time will have value "19:00"event_name will have value "Klavier + Orchester: SPEZIAL"
