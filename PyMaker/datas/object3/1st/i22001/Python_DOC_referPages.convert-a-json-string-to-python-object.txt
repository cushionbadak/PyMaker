Is it possible to convert a json string (for e.g. the one returned from the twitter search json service) to simple string objects. Here is a small representation of data returned from the json service:Lets say that I somehow store the result in some variable, say, obj. I am looking to get appropriate values like as follows:I've tried using simplejson.load() and json.load() but it gave me an error saying 'str' object has no attribute 'read'
I've tried using simplejson.load() and json.load() but it gave me an error saying 'str' object has no attribute 'read'To load from a string, use json.loads() (note the 's').More efficiently, skip the step of reading the response into a string, and just pass the response to json.load().
if you don't know if the data will be a file or a string.... usefrom https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#text-i-ojson.loads from the python built-in libraries, json.loads requires a file object and does not check what it's passed so it still calls the read function on what you passed because the file object only gives up data when you call read(). So because the built-in string class does not have the read function we need a wrapper. So the StringIO.StringIO function in short, subclasses the string class and the file class and meshing the inner workings hears my low detail rebuild https://gist.github.com/fenderrex/843d25ff5b0970d7e90e6c1d7e4a06b1so at the end of all that its like writing a ram file and jsoning it out in one line....
The json string from any request or http server is of type byte arrayto convert them in to string, (since the question is about byte array returned from a server request, right?) here the response.content  can be a byte array or any returned string from server request which is decoded to string (utf-8) format and returned as python array.Or just use a bytearray but use json.load instead json.loads
