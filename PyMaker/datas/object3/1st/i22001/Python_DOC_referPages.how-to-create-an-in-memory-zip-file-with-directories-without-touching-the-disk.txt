In a python web application, I'm packaging up some stuff in a zip-file. I want to do this completely on the fly, in memory, without touching the disk. This goes fine using ZipFile.writestr as long as I'm creating a flat directory structure, but how do I create directories inside the zip?I'm using python2.4.http://docs.python.org/library/zipfile.html
What 'theomega' said in the comment to my original post, adding a '/' in the filename does the trick. Thanks!
Use a StringIO. It is apparently OK to use them for zipfiles.
