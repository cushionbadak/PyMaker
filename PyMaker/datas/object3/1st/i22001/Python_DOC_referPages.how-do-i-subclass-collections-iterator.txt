According to the documentation on ABCs, I should just have to add a next method to be able to subclass collections.Iterator.  So, I'm using the following class:However, I get an error when I try to instantiate it:I'm guessing that I'm doing something stupid, but I can't figure out what it is.  Can anyone shed some light on this?  I could add a __next__ method, but I was under the impression that was only for C classes.
Looks like you are using Python 3.x. Your code works fine on Python 2.x.But on Python 3.x, you should implement __next__ instead of next, as shown in the table of the py3k doc. (Remember to read the correct version!)This change is introduced by PEP-3114 â€” Renaming iterator.next() to iterator.__next__().
