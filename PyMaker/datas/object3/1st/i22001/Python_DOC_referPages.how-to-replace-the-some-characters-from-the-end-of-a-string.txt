I want to replace characters at the end of a python string.  I have this string:I want to replace the last 2 with x.  Suppose there is a method called replace_last:Is there any built-in or easy method to do this?
This is exactly what the rpartition function is used for:rpartition(...)      S.rpartition(sep) -> (head, sep, tail)I wrote this function showing how to use rpartition in your use case:Output:
Using regular expression function re.sub to replace words at end of stringPrints:or Prints:
This is one of the few string functions that doesn't have a left and right version, but we can mimic the behaviour using some of the string functions that do.or
For your second example
When the wanted match is at the end of string, re.sub comes to the rescue.
Here is a solution based on a simplistic interpretation of your question. A better answer will require more information.Update(After seeing edited question) another very specific answer.Update 2There is far better way to do this. Courtesy @mizipzor.
