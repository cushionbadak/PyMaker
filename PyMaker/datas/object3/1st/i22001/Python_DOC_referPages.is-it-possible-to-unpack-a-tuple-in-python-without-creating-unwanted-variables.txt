Is there a way to write the following function so that my IDE doesn't complain that column is an unused variable? In this case I don't care about the second item in the tuple and just want to discard the reference to it when it is unpacked.
In Python the _ is often used as an ignored placeholder.You could also avoid unpacking as a tuple is indexable.
If you don't care about the second item, why not just extract the first one:
it looks pretty, I don't know if a good performance.
Yes, it is possible. The accepted answer with _ convention still unpacks, just to a placeholder variable.You can avoid this via itertools.islice:This will give the same res as below:The solution, as demonstrated above, works when values is an iterable that is not an indexable collection such as list or tuple.
