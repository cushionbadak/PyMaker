I have a list of size < N and I want to pad it up to the size N with a value.Certainly, I can use something like the following, but I feel that there should be something I missed:
or if you don't want to change a in placeyou can always create a subclass of list and call the method whatever you please
There is no built-in function for this. But you could compose the built-ins for your task (or anything :p).(Modified from itertool's padnone and take recipes)Usage:
I think this approach is more visual and pythonic.
gnibbler's answer is nicer, but if you need a builtin, you could use itertools.izip_longest (zip_longest in Py3k):which will return a list of tuples ( i, list[ i ] ) filled-in to None. If you need to get rid of the counter, do something like:
You could also use a simple generator without any build ins.But I would not pad the list, but let the application logic deal with an empty list.Anyhow, iterator without buildins
If you want to pad with None instead of '', map() does the job:
more-itertools is a library that includes a special padded tool for this kind of problem:Alternatively, more_itertools also implements Python itertools recipes including padnone and take as mentioned by @kennytm, so they don't have to be reimplemented:If you wish to replace the default None padding, use a list comprehension:
To go off of kennytm:
