I have a DNS script which allow users to resolve DNS names by typing website names on a Windows command prompt.I have looked through several guides on the DNS resolve but my script can't still seem to resolve the names (www.google.com) or (google.com) to IP address.The script outputs an error of The code:Please give advice on the codes. Thanks!
input() is the wrong function to use here. It actually evaluates the string that the user entered.Also gethostbyname_ex returns more than just a string. So your print statement would also have failed.In your case this code should work:

Use raw_input instead of input.
