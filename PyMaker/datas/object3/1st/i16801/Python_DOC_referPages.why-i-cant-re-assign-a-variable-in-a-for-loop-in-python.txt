This question already has an answer here:python assign values to list elements in loop                    4 answers                Today I find an interesting fact, that I can't re-assign variable in a 'for loop', but why?Here is my code:
When you loop over a list with for i in my_list, i isn't bound to a list cell on each iteration. It's bound to the object the list cell referred to. Assigning a new value to i binds i to a new object, but there's no link between i and the list that would cause the list cell to be affected.An equivalent way to loop over a list would beHopefully, it's clearer in this formulation that i is not an alias for the list cell. (Don't actually loop over lists like this.)
Let me guess, you want to have a result like the followingTo do this, you need to do this:UpdateWhy your code doesn't work? Because i is not a reference to an object but a primitive value assignment. Python variable reference assignment.Update 2If the element of the list is an object rather than a primitive, then it seems that i become a reference to that object.Update 3Please see some of the discussion in the comment below. In python, everything is an object. No primitive.Ref: For Syntax
