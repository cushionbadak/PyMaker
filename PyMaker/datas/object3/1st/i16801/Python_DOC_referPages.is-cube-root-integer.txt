This seems to be simple but I cannot find a way to do it. I need to show whether the cube root of an integer is integer or not. I used is_integer() float method in Python 3.4 but that wasn't successful. AsbutI tried x%1 == 0,x == int(x) and isinstance(x,int) with no success. I'd appreciate any comment.
For small numbers (<~1013 or so), you can use the following approach:This truncates the floating-point cuberoot, then tests the two nearest integers.For larger numbers, one way to do it is to do a binary search for the true cube root using integers only to preserve precision:
In SymPy there is also the integer_nthroot function which will quickly find the integer nth root of a number and tell you whether it was exact, too:So your function could be (And because SymPy is open source, you can look at the routine to see how integer_nthroot works.)
If your numbers aren't big, I would do:Of course, 15 could be replaced with something more appropriate.If you do need to deal with big numbers, I would use the sympy library to get more accurate results.
I think you should use the round function to get the answer. If I had to write a function then it will be as follows:You can use something similar to int(n**(1.0/3.0)) == n**(1.0/3.0), but in python because of some issues with the computation of the value of cube root, it is not exactly computed. For example int(41063625**(1.0/3.0)) will give you 344, but the value should be 345.Hope I have answered your question. If you have any doubt, then feel free to contact me.
To elaborate on the answer by @nneonneo, one could write a more general kth-root function to use instead of cube_root,
This is another approach using the math module.Line 1: Import math module.Line 2: Enter the number you would like to get the root of.Line 3: Enter the nth root you are looking for.Line 4: Use the power function.Line 5: Rounded to 10 significant figures to account for floating point approximations.Line 6: Print a preview of the nth root of the selected number.Line 7: Use the modf function to get the fractional and integer parts.Line 8: Print a preview of decimal part of the cube root value.Line 9: Return True if the cube root is an integer. Return False if the cube root value contains fractional numbers.
