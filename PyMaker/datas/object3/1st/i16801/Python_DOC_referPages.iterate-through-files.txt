I'm trying to adapt someone's code for my (Windows 7) purposes. His is unfortunately UNIX specific. He doesRunning this, I got (not surprisingly)I looked into the documentation for pathlib and thought yeah, I should just be able to change PosixPath to Path and I would be fine. Well, then dir_ generates a WindowsPath object. So far, so good. However, I get pathlib is at version 1.0, what am I missing? The purpose is to iterate through files in the specific directory. Googling this second error gave 0 hits. Remark: Could not use pathlib as a tag, hence I put it into the title.UpdateI have Python 2.7.3 and  pathlib 1.0 
I guess you should use Path.iterdir(). 
Use glob module instead, which works same on both platforms:
Try Related documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.iterdir
Now your code will work on both platforms. You are specifing de type of path... if you want it to be cross-platform you have to use "Path" not "PosixPath"
Important to know:Every time you encounter an object is not iterable error, you must remember that the system also performs an iteration on a string,For example: This function is also the contents of the email and the attachment must be in the list! (even if there is only one file).In conclusion: Always try to insert the string into the list that can save a lot of problems.
