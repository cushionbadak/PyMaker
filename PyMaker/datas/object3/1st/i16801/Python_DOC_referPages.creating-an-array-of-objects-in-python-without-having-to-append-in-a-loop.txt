I am trying to create an array of object. I am able to do it like this:  I want, however, to create the array without the loop (because I think for a more complex object the appending can be very time consuming). Is there a way to achieve this?
You could always use a list comprehension:If you are using Python 2.x, you should also replace range with xrange:This is because the latter computes numbers lazily where as the former creates an unnecessary list.
or using repeat
