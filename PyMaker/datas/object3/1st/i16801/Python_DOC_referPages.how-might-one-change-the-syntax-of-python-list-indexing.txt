After asking this question, it received a comment about how you could do something like this:Is it possible to use this or similar concepts to make it possible to index lists like my_list(n) instead of my_list[n]?
You'd have to use a custom class, and give it a __call__ special method to make it callable. A subclass of list would do nicely here:You cannot use this to assign to an index, however, only item access works. Slicing would require you to use to create a slice() object:For anything more, you'd have to create a custom Python syntax parser to build an AST, then compile to bytecode from there.
the parentheses in my_list() are treated as a function call. If you want, you could write your own class that wraps a list and overwrite the call method to index into the list.
You could create a function that returns a lambda function:
