For the life of me, I can't seem to get the numbers to add up! They are all printing separately. For example, it is displaying "That will be $95.00 $90 $8.50 for the ..." I think it's as simple as getting the bracket numbers correct.. but I can't seem to do it! I want the "adult" + "child" + "delivery" to be a total.. not separate prices! 
You are adding up the string representation of those numbers. The + operator for strings does concatenation. If you want to add the amounts you will have to do the addition while they are still float and then convert the result to string.
Your are adding formatted strings; adding strings places them one after the other.Add the numbers first:You may want to study how you can format strings with str.format(); it would make your printing code a whole lot simpler and more readable:
