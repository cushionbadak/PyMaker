I am unable to open any CSV file produced by a program(I don't have full details of program), it comes out with file names like 266925.130314-88850999.wordThe file is a csv, it opens in excel 2013 and all editors fine, I have tried opening with original file name, I have tried opening by changing extension from .word to .csvNothing works, I get the errors detailed below.Sample Part of CSVFull error Message in idle guiPandas error (not given full because its massive amount of text with traceback - can add if required)I have tested this file exists with I can use EXACT same code with report.csv (this csv is a known working one not created by program) and it loads fine. I do not understand why this file wont open, I have tried open/read_csv/read_excel, all produce same errors on both idle and pandas.Pulling my hair out, please assist.
The issue here is that Python uses escapes in strings - '\t' is a tab character, so when that sequence appears in your path, it changes meaning (note how in the output, the other backslashes have been escaped). Python is looking for 'C:\Console2\edz    est.csv'.The best solution is to use forward slashes for paths - Python will do the correct thing, even under Windows.You can also use a raw string (r'C:\Console2\edz\test.csv') or escape your backslashes ('C:\\Console2\\edz\\test.csv') - but the former can't deal with trailing backslashes, and the latter is hard to read and write.
\t is an escape character in python, try \\t. you can  also prefix the string with  r 'raw string' before the path  (r'C:\Console2\edz\test.csv'','r')
