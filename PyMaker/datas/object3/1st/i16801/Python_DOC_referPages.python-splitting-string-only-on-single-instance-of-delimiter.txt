Natural Text
I'm trying to extract numeric values from text strings that use dashes as delimiters, but also to indicate negative values:At the moment, I'm manually checking for the "--" sequence, but this seems really ugly and prone to breaking.I've tried a few different approaches, using both the str.split() function and re.findall(), but none of them have quite worked. For example, the following pattern should match all the valid strings, but I'm not sure how to use it with findall:Is there a general way to do this that I'm not seeing? Thanks!
You can try to split with this pattern with a lookbehind:(An hyphen preceded by a digit)With this condition, you are sure to not be after the start of the string or after an other hyphen.
@CasimiretHippolyte has given a very elegant Regex solution, but I would like to point out that you can do this pretty succinctly with just a list comprehension, iter, and next:Also, if you use timeit.timeit, you will see that this solution is quite a bit faster than using Regex:
