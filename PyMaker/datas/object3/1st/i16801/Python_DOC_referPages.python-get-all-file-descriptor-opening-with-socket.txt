I use flask and flask's internal web server on a unix based os. I run it like;I restart some serivces in my code likeWhen I stop flask app, other services ,which I restart, start to listen 8000 port. It is caused by file descriptors opening by flask inherited by subprocess. For prevent this problem I try to reach all file descriptors of socket. How can do that?
For solving this problem, gc can be used for getting all creating object. After create and bind socket, you can run this code and get all socketobjects;This code prevent inheritance of sockets' file descriptor.  
In that case Popen should be called with close_fds = True.
