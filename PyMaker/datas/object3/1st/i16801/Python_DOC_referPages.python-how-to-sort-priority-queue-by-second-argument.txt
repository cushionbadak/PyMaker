Let's say, for example, that we have the following data that I want to insertto a priority queue:(0, 3, 5)(1, 2, 7)and I want to sort my priority queue by the second argument and then by the third.How can I do that? beacuse, by default, priority queue sorts its elements by the first argument.Thanks for the help.
The implementation of Queue.PriorityQueue relies on heappush(), which doesn't provide a way to handle custom sorting.You could subclass PriorityQueue and use a little hack to make this work without breaking functionnality:Test run:(Please note that this is python3 code)
From the documentation it appears that priority queue does not support custom ordering. A basic work around would be to create a wrapper object around your tuples and set the custom ordering in thereThis is merely an example, and you should take care of edge cases where the other object is a tuple, a list, an empty tuple and a tuple with one element.
from the documentation for Queue.pyThere actually a PriorityQueue that automatically sort the elements in queue, but usually the elements are tuple structure (priority number, data) I wrote some sample code here, it Q._pop() the tuple with smallest priority number:The output is:One thing I notice is that for the first time we print the q.queue, before we do any _get(), it doesn't show ordered queue, but once we call _get(), it always gives ordered queue.
