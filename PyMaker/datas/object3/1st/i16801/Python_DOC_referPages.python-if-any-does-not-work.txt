I want to check if any string elements in a list phrases contains certain keywords in a set phd_words. I want to use any but it doesn't work.How should I fix this?
That may happen if you use IPython's %pylab magic:Here's why:any and all get shadowed with numpy functions, and those behave differently than the builtins. This is the reason I stopped using %pylab and started using %pylab --no-import-all so that it doesn't clobber the namespace like that.To reach the builtin function when it is already shadowed, you can try __builtin__.any. The name __builtin__ seems to be available in IPython on both Python 2 and Python 3, which is probably on itself enabled by IPython. In a script, you would first have to import __builtin__ on Python 2 and import builtins on Python 3.
