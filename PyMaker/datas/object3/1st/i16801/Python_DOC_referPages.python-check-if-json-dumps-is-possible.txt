is it possible to check if a value is able to be "json.dumps"d like json.dumping.possible(code) with a boolean output?I would be thankful for help
There is no way to check if an object is serializable to a json format. However, you can (even if it is not really EAFP compliant) try and if it fails go for a fallback process:A way to be sure would be to implement your own JSONEncoder if you are entirely sure of the data processed.
