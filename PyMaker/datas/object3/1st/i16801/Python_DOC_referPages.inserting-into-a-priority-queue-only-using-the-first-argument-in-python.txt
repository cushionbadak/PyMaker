How do I insert items into a priority queue, but ensure that it only takes as it's priority the first argument given.  For example:I would like the top two if statements to be placed into priorityQueue LIFO.  How would I do this?
Pass the arguments as a separate tuple:
If you want equal priority elements to be returned in a LIFO order, you should add a count value to your keys:This makes your values be four-tuples, rather than three-tuples (so you'll need to update the code you use to access the values). The second value will be steadily decreasing (count yields successively increasing integers forever, and we're negating them). If the first values of two tuples in the queue are equal, the second values will be compared and the most recently added one will always be the smallest (and so selected by the queue).By the way, unless you're using your queue to synchronize data between multiple threads, you should probably be using the heapq module's functions on a regular list, rather than using a queue.PriorityQueue instance. The latter uses heapq to implement its logic internally, but it also does a bunch of locking that you probably don't need (for single threaded code it is pointless overhead).
