Let's say I want to explore import statements in Python. How, from the Python command line, can I find the file in which import is defined? Note I am working in Python 2.7.6 (iPython) in Windows 7.For most objects, just entering the object name is enough. For instance:Yields the following:But you cannot do the same with basic commands like import.I have tried searching my Python folder but unsurprisingly don't get something as simple as C:\Anaconda\lib\import.py. Is there a simple way to find out where such statements are defined (I realize much of the time it will be in c-code, but that is what I am after)?Update (5/27/14)It seems people think it cannot be done in any simple way with a built-in command. However, if your life depended on it, you could write up some inelegant grep-type function in Python, no?
import isn't a module the way that os is. Instead, it's a statement.https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#import
When you call os after importing, it prints the path to the file because it is a module. Instead, import is a statement:Just in case you feel like you needed to know, here are the other statements that do similar things when called blank:
