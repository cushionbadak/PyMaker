Natural Text
I have the following code:I am trying to query select * from geo.places where text = 'Boston' (for example).I keep receiving this error:What can cause this error and how can I solve it?
Not sure, what is going wrong, but when I try to do the same action using requests library, it works:Note, that there are differences, my code is much simpler, it does not work with cookies and it does not try to pretend Safari browser.If you need to use cookies with requests, you will find very good support for it there.
The URL you construct is not a valid URL. What you send isThere should be no spaces inside the URL, e.g. you have to do proper URL encoding (replace space with '+' etc). I guess requests just fixes the bad URL for you.
Your query might have blank spaces in between. Requests take care of the white spaces in your url and hence you don't have to take care of it.Just replace each " " by "%20" to make the url work.
As stated in other answers, you need to encode your url due to the white space.  The call would be urllib.quote if using python2 or urllib.parse.quote for python3. The safe parameter is used to ignore characters when encoding.
Use requests is good choose. but we should found out why?query = "select * from geo.places where text ='"+word+"'"There are some space in your paramter.we should be url encode this space.you should convert the spaces to '%20', but in python the '%' is special char, you should be escaped use '%%20'
