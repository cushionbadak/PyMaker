I am writing one file :I want to convert the encoding to UCS-2 little endian format. Is it possible to do this in open() or close() functions. Any ideas would help.
In Python 3,  according to documentation in :https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#openyou can specify the encoding with the encoding parameter.
On Python 2 you can use codecs.open with the encoding parameter.If you use Python 3 just use the encoding parameter of open.UCS-2 is a subset of UTF-16, so try to use 'UTF-16' as the parameter value.
