Natural Text
I would like to implement the concatenation of paths to files using "\" as an operator, redefining the corresponding function (if any).For example:Thus, adding str "\" between path1 and path2 in the redefition of the method, I should assert codepath = '\home\codes'
The pathlib module supports / for concatenating path objects.As an example of how to use __div__, here's a simple class that extends str. It should work as long as at least one argument is an instance of MyPath (i.e., it won't work with two plain strings).
