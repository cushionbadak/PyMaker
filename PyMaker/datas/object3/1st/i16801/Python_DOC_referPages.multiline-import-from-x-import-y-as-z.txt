Is there a way to use the from X import Y as Z idiom on a multiline import?Specifically, I want to write something like from some.very.long.package.name import LongName as OtherLongName. The whole thing does not fit in one line.So I tried to write it using parentheses to cross lines, but I found some strange behavior with the as keyword. Specifically:The only way I have figured out to do what I want is therefore:Is there any way to do it in one statement?
Add a slash where you want to stop:Without it Python will think the line is over and throw SyntaxError.You can also use importlib.import_module if you find operations on strings more convenient:
