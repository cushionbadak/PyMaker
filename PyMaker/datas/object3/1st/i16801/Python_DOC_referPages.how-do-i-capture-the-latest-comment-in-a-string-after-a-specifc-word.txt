Natural Text
I am trying to format the data in  string variable below to print the latest comment after the word "Patchset lock",i gave te expected output below,can anyone suggest how to fix it?EXPECTED OUTPUT:-
Not sure what you mean (and your first code has IndentationError, by the way), but this might do the work:Explanation: .rsplit('Patch Set ', 1)[1] splits at the last occurence of Patch Set (rsplit) and gets the second part ([1]), and .split('\n', 1)[1] splits at the first occurence of \n (split) and gets the second par ([1])
Its a little bit tricky.Basicly:Search for last String Position of "Patch Set "Make a Substring, from this position to endSearch for second Position \n;Again, make a Substring, from this position to endDon't know the functions in Python, but this should basicly do it.
