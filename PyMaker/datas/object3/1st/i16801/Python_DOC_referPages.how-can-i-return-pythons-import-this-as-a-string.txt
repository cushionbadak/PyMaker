Typing will return the Zen of Python, but nowhere do I seem to be able find a solution about how to  set it equal to a string variable which I can use further on in my code...
You can temporarily redirect stdout to a StringIO instance, import this, and then get its value.This code works on python2.7 -- for python 3, use io.StringIO instead of cStringIO.StringIO, and also have a look at contextlib.redirect_stdout which was added in 3.4. That would look like this:
Let's look at what this.py does:Let's note that the encryption is just ROT13.So if we really wanted to grab the string, we could do:Or, to explicitly follow the style of the this.py module...
I think the accepted answer is overcomplicated for this case (while very interesting for capturing the standard output in general).In Python 3, you can get the Zen of Python as a string by simply doing:
the string is stored in this.s, butthat's funny, because it's encrypted:
