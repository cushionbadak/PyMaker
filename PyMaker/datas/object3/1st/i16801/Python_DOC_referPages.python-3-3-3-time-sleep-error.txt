the sleep function comes from the python time module so you to import before you call any of it's methods just put import time before you use any time stuff. It's normal to just put all of your imports at the top of your code.see here for more info on importing:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html
You need to import the time module. Just write import time at the top of your file on its own line to import it.
