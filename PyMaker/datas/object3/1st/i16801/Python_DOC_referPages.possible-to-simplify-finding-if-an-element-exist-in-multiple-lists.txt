This is my Python code, it's usable but... I'm sure there a way to simplify this long code. Anyone have a good answer for this?
You can use any and a generator expression:See a demonstration below:
As I feel is obligatory for Python questions involving collections, here's an answer based on itertools:Beware though, that this answer becomes inefficient (compared with your original code) if the trees change to a different collection that implements in by doing something faster than a linear search.
Use any():In essence, any() is equivalent to a series of or operations on an iterable of booleans, while its cousin all() is equivalent to a series of and operations.
partialAnswer is in at least one of those lists if & only if it's in the concatenation of the lists, so:
You can use sum. It will be less efficient, but looks simpler.
