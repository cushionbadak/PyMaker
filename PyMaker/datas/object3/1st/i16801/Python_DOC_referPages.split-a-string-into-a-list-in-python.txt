Natural Text
I have a textfile that I want to put into lists.The textfile looks like this:I have tried splitting the list with this code:Output:But it does not give me the output i wantIt splits on the spaces between the Title.How can I split it into a list without breaking up the title?Expected output:
split() takes an optional maxsplit argument:In Python 3:In Python 2, you need to specify the maxsplit argument as a positional argument:
may be u can try using re.split('your patter, string) , which should give you proper list based on your regex.
Read the  docs: 

Syntax for splitting is:  str.split([sep[, maxsplit]])  'sep' is the seperator used to split strings(by default it matches any white space character)'maxsplit' argument can be used to limit no. of splits as mentioned by TimHere if you are using '\t' in between your columns, you can just use '\t' as seperatorAs per standard practice, '\t' is used as seperator for columns so that splitting won't interfere with other spaces in strings. And moreover there won't be any compatibility issues with whatever python version you are using.Hope this helps  : )
