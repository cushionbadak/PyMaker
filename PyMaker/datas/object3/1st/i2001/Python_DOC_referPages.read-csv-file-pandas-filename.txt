I am trying to read several csv files that all have different names but same structure inside:I cannot read the first and last one:`    How can I solve it? 
You can loop through the files and append them one by onedata will contain all the dataframes in the directory
and 
Replace the 'Pass' at the except.Raise and exception or write the the log the error that occurred.And then It will be easier to understand what is the problem.
The new code without globI think what you want can be solved using Ipython:Hope it helps.The old codeI think what you want can be solved using the glob library:Hope it helps.
