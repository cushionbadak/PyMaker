I know that you can cast dict_items into a list to allow item indexing. But I do not know why this operation is not allowed directly. Is it because dict_items objects are generators? If so, when I'm seeingis Python evaluating my generator when repr is called?
dict_items do not support indexing because these objects are intended to be set-like, and sets do not support indexing.They do quack like sets in other ways:If any value is not hashable, you lose the ability to treat the dict items views with set operations.It is not sensible to give indexing support to dict_items views, because the dict does not have an ordering until Python 3.7+, so accessing "the 0th" item would not be well-defined. Even in Python 3.7, where there is a sensible ordering to use for indexing (i.e. the insertion order), it is non-trivial to implement this with O(1) complexity, so it's not supported. The "unwritten rule" is that indexing should be constant-time operation (as it is for list, tuple, dict, str - see here).
