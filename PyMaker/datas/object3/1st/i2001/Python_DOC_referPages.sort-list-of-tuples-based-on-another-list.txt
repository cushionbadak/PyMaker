I have a list of tuples for eg.  I have another list I want to sort l1 on the second value of every tuple according to the order present in l2. The final result should be As you can see, the tuples whose second value was a are present first, then comes tuples with second value b and the lastly those which have c.I wrote the following:This is pretty straight forward. But I was wondering if there is any pythonic way to get this thing done?
You can use sorted with an appropriate key function:
You can create a dict that uses the value as key and the index given by enumerate(l2) to sort it:Using a dict that way has the advantage of not using index(...) on every lookup into l2. You would use dict.get() to avoid missing keys causing trouble and just provide a default thats sure to not be in the list so they get put at the end/front.Output:
You could also just use the sort method of the list l1 to sort on the second value of each tuple:If this is not sufficient and you need the second list l2 for the definition of the order, you can use the index method of the list:
