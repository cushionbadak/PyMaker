This question already has an answer here:Disable assertions in Python                    6 answers                I want to invalidate the "assert" in my Python codes when I run it as a release edition. Consider that a lot of "assert" may be used in my files in the developing procedure, but I want to skip the compiling of "assert" to enhance the efficiency. Is there some simple method like a pre_define of "NDEBUG" in c++ ?
Use command line option -O. As described in the docs:In the current implementation, the built-in variable __debug__ is True  under normal circumstances, False when optimization is requested  (command line option -O). The current code generator emits no code for  an assert statement when optimization is requested at compile time.
