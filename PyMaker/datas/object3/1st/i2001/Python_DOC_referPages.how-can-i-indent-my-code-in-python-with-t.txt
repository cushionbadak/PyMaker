Natural Text
I'm new to python and was having trouble with a dice rolling game. I want  the outputs of attacker and defender health to be on the opposite side of the screen instead of under the other output. Is there anyway to indent my output, because when I try to, all I get is str and int errors.My code:Current output:
Instead of adding print this much times you can try adding \n after the text in the stringEx- print("The Quick Brown fox jumps over the lazy dog \n\n")What you may try for tabprint("attacker health: \t\t Defender Health\n",attacker_health,"\t\t\t\t",defender_health)You may alter the no. Of \t based on your screen size. You should try \n and \t instead of typing print this much times. Hope this helps you out. 
Using Python3's inbuilt string formating, you can print them side by side (that is how I understood from your question). In the above solution everything within {} is a placeholder for variable which are supplied as keyword arguments to format method. Hope this helps.
