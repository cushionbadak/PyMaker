The CSV files that I'm dealing with look like this:I am trying to create a dictionary of lists, having the 'Emotion' entries as keys, and the 'begin' (second column) as the values of the keys that occur in their row.Desired output would look like this:So far I've managed to output the desired output, but each value is a list of its own inside of the list of each key.My current code:Current output:Any hints on what to change in the code to output my desired dictionary of lists?Thanks in advance!EDIT:The dictionary values should be outputted as integers.
