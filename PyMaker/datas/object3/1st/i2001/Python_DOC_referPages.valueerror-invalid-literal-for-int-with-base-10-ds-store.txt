I am working on implementing a program that will give me the result for the Positional inverted index of an xml file.First I need to change the type of document number from string to int in order to use it later on.Some of my code is the following:Now when I run it using the command: $ python def_ind.py -i "./index/" -d "output1111.txt" -p "output222.txt"I get the following error:I understand that there is a string that can't be int, but I didn't knowhow?What am supposed to do in here?I am trying to get output that will check each word how many times appeared in each document number and in which line.for example:(document number: line number where the word found)snapshot from my xml file:I am using python 3.7.Note: I found many questions with the same error but non of them suited my situation.
The function os.listdir() returns names of files in that particular directory.AS your error says, you are trying to cast these names to integers. That is the cause of your error, in this line:The code you pasted is a mess (maybe its just wrong indentation after pasting to StackOverflow); I cannot understand what you are trying to acomplish there. As far as I can see, you never actually use the values of the list docID_list, you just iterate over it. So why are you even casting the values to int?
