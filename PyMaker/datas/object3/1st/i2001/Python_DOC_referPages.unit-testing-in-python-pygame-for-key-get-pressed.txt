I am new to python coding and need some help with unit testing. I want to test my modules that move the images location in Pygame based on what the user has pressed. Here are my modules:Here is where i call these modules:How do i go about testing these? is unit testing different when working with Pygame?
One way is to abstract pygame.key.get_pressed() away, so you can replace it during your tests with something else that returns the fake input we want to test (let's call it mocking). When running your game, you would pass pygame.event.get as argument to on_execute, and in your tests, you pass a function that returns whatever you want (a mock).But since we're using python where, we can also monkey patch pygame.event.get (replacing the entire function at runtime).So in the test we would do something like this:and behold, now pygame.key.get_pressed() will always tell use the right arrow key is pressed.Now that you know about this, take a look at the build-in mock module.
