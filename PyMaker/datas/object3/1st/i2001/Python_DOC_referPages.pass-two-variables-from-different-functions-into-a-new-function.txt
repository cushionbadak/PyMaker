I've looked around for a solution that can help my situation but couldn't find any simplistic or basic techniques that I can understand. If there are any useful sites or posts that you think could point me in the right direction please post them.I've made two functions that are identical but serve different purposes e.g like a login system - one function for each user. In each function, there is a variable that I would like to "pass" to a new function (which is completely different to the other functions). I've tried using the return and global function but they don't work and I don't think I've used them right. A simpler example of my situation below:I want the "topping" and "topping1" to come into the "something" function.This code is not my real coding situation but a simpler version and hence the use of functions and passing these variables is necessaryThanks
Your functions do not return anything. If your purpose is to assign a variable with the return of your function:When you declare a variable in a function it only lives in the local space and will not be callable in the global space. The example below shows what happens when you declare it as a global variable.Once you have declared it as a global, the local space in the function something will be able to use them as a global variable, even if you do not pass them in your function.
All you need to do is have your functions return a value. Then use the value returned from it to call the new function.If you wanted the pizza function to call pizza1 and then pizza1 to call something you can just restructure the code to be this:
The first thing that you have to do is: name the static variablesThen, when you call the function something you have to write in () the variables to print.With the last line of code you say to the program to print the variables a and b.
