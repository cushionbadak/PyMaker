I'm new to python and found some object lists while using djnago queries like I want to know how to do the same design with other objects "my own classes", is this related to operators overloading like c++ and if so , how to do this?
You can do it by implementing the special __or__ method (and possibly also __ror__), as described here.If the left operand has __or__ defined, its __or__ method is invoked. If it doesn't, or __or__ threw NotImplemented, then the right operand's __ror__ is invoked.Other operators are implemented similarly, using the various special functions.
