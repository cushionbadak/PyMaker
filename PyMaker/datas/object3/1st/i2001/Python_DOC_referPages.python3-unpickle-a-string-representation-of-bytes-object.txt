Is there a good way to load a bytes object that is represented as a string, so it can be unpickled?Basic ExampleHere is a dumb example:Attempt at a SolutionOne solution is of course to eval the string:But, seems wrong to eval, especially when the strings might be coming over a network or from a file....Any suggestions for a better solution?Thanks!
For a safety concern you can use ast.literal_eval instead of eval:
Is there a reason you need to have it as a str? If you're just writing it to file, you can 'wb' instead of 'w'. (https://pythontips.com/2013/08/02/what-is-pickle-in-python/)
You can use encoding="latin1" as an argument to str and then use bytes to convert back:Output:
First of all i wouldn't use pickles to serialize data. instead use Json.my solution with pickles BUT with json I highly recommend you to use json to serialize your data
