I have an API that has unit tests written inside of it. The thing is that that API can't be run as 'stand-alone' script from terminal, it has to be run from a custom framework. In that API there is a function that basicly calls unittest.main() but test cases are not found if the function is ran from 'outside'. Is there a common solution for this kind of problem?
You can tell unittest.main() to load the tests from a different module by passing the name of that module in as the first (or module=) argument.For example, to use the current module name, use:You may want to study the code that implements this functionality; unittest.main is an alias for the TestProgram class, which uses the standard unittest API to discover, load and run tests. If you need more control it can be useful to just use the API directly.
