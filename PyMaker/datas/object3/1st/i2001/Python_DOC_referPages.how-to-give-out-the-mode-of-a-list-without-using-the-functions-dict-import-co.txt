I have to write a program where I have got an input of 10 numbers and the program has to give out the mode of the list, without unsing the functions:dict, import, count, max, sort, enumerate, sorted!I do not know how I can write the function "count" an "sort" manuel.
Using c as a tuple that holds (count, item). We can use iter to iterate through the values in lst and if their count is greater than the previous we can update the tuple to represent that item, after the iter is exhausted we print the item from the tuple.
If there were no restrictions on the functions or modules you can use, the most efficient way to get the mode of a list is to use the most_common method of the collections.Counter class:But since you are not allowed to use import, you can implement the same logic yourself by using a dict (not the dict function, but the dict data type) to keep track of the counts of each distinct item, and then iterate through the dict items to find the item with largest count:so that:would return: 2
