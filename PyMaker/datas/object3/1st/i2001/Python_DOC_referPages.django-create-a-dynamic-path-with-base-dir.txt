I have a very simple question but I don't understand why it doesn't work.I would like to set the path to .json file like this :But i'm getting this issue :How I can define the path from BASE_DIR and come back to .json file ?
You can see the issue in the error message: src../../package.json - there is a forward slash missing in src...Instead of concatenating strings, use os.path.join so that you don't have to worry about missing/duplicate forward slashes.
First of all the problem in your code should be obvious: You are missing backslash between the BASE_DIR and the hard coded path you are adding. This thiswith open(settings.BASE_DIR + '/../../package.json') as package_json_file:should work (if the package is there of course).However, to avoid such inconsistencies, it is better to explicitly use os.path.join to properly create paths, i.e you can use something like with open(os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, '..', '..', 'package.json')) as package_json_file:More info on join: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join
