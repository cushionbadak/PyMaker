I have a DataFrame    I want to add all the elements across all rows that would give the result without using iterrows:note: no element occurs twice in a single row in the original DataFrame.
Using collections.Counter, you can sum an iterable of Counter objects. Since Counter is a subclass of dict, you can then feed to pd.DataFrame.from_dict.
Not sure how this compares in terms of optimization with @jpp's answer, but I'll give it a shot.
