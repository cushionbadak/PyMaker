I can only push two values onto the stack array that I have created when I use the myPush() function. The reason I need to do it this way is because I am not allowed to use the built-in stack functions. Plus I have to use an array not a lit. Thank you.I can only push two values onto the stack array that I have created when I use the myPush() function.
