Where can I find official documentation on tkinter.filedialog module including all the methods and options?Here I can find just a reference to it.https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html?highlight=filedialog
By @progmatico,Those options are the same used by the tk/tcl toolkit. Python just passes the options to that library, while opening the corresponding dialogs. See for example options for the correponding tk_chooseDir dialog in here. Pass your options as keywords without the -. More help for other widgets here
