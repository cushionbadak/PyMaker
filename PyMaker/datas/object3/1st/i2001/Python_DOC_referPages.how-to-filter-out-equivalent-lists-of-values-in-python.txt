Natural Text
When given a list of lists like: [[5, 2] [2, 5]]I want to reduce this list to this: [[5, 2]] or [[2, 5]]I've already tried the following: list(map(list, set(map(frozenset, parts_to_add))))But the problem with this method is that it turns my lists in sets and while this works - it filters out all the equivalent lists - it also eats all of my duplicate values; When given [[3, 3]] it returns [[3]], due to the nature of sets in python. Is there another way of doing this?Any help would be grately appreciated.

A more straightforward approach would be,
