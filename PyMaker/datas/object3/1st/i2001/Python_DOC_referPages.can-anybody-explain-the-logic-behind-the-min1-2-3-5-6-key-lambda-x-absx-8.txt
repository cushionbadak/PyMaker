This is my list: a = [1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14].I want to get the number that is closest to 5, this is the solution:Please explain what is happening in the above line.
abs(x-5)abs is absolute mathematics function which is equivalent to |x-5|.example : abs(x-5) when x=6 is 1, and when x=4 is also 1.lambda x: abs(x-5)It can be written as which means for a = [1,3,4,7,8,9,12,13,14]will givekey = lambda x: abs(x-5)Here the value returned by this lambda function is stored in key variable.ThusLastly min(a, key)The min function uses key as an iterable to calculate minimum value.Using the position of minimum value obtained from key it displays the value from iterable a.Thus forminimum value is 1 at position 2 and it displays value at 2 position from iterable awhich is 4.
The code is using the min builtin function, but with a key parameter. Thus, it does not return the actual minimum element of the list, but the element for which that key function is minimal, i.e. it behaves more like "arg-min" than actually "min".In the key function (defined as a lambda expression), abs is just the absolute difference, in this case between the parameter x (a number from the list) and 5.That line is somewhat equivalent to, but much shorter and more readable than, this loop:
Explanationmin(iterable, key) returns the smallest item in the iterable with respect to the key. So it iterates over the iterable, each time evaluates the key(x) for an element x, and then returns the element for which key(x) was the smallest.Since key=lambda x=abs(x-5), we thus evaluate the absolute difference between 5, so if x=3, then abs(x-5) is 2, etc. So this will result in the number that is the closest to 5.Making this an O(log n) algorithmGiven the list is ordered, you can find this in logarithmic time with:For example:
try thisgives 4the function np.searchsorted will give you index of the upper limit (7)
