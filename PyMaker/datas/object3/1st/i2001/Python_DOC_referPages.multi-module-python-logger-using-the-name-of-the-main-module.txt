I have multiple python modules that I'd like to use the same logger while preserving the call hierarchy in those logs. I'd also like to do this with a logger whose name is the name of the calling module (or calling module stack). I haven't been able to work out how to get the name of the calling module except with messing with the stack trace, but that doesn't feel very pythonic.Is this possible?main.pysub_module.pyDesired Output
