I'm new to python and the problem I'm facing is how can I count groups of duplicates. For example given a list like this:['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down'] I have to calculate the following:[('down', 3), ('up', 1), ('right', 2), ('down', 2)]Or rather how can I achieve this in a pythonic way coming from languages like java/c#?EDIT: Since it seems that I didn't clarify my my problem enough, I don't want to count all the occurrences of for example down in the list, but only those that are neighbors (if that is the correct phrasing), so Counter(my_list) doesn't give the desired output.
