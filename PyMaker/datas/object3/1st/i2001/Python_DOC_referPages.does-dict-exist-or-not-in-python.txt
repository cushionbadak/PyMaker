The first code snippet:It prints {} and the function __getattr__ isn't invoked, which means the attribute__dict__ exists.The second snippet:It prints getatrr and None, which means the attribute __dict__ doesn't exist.Why is __dict__ {} in the first case, but None in the second case?
the issue is that when you define this:you're overriding __getattribute__ which is supposed to return something. Since you're not returning anything, you get None for every attribute you'll try.Documentation states:This method should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an AttributeError exceptionA viable way to define it is to call object.__getattribute__ in the fallback case (in my example, I have added a small test on __dict__ which prints:In the end, the hard attribute lookup work is done with object.__getattribute__ that invokes python runtime.
