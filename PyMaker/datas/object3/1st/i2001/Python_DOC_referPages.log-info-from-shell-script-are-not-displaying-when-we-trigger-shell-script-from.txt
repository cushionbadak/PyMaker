I am calling shell script from my pyhton program and the shell script is having INFO & DEBUG logs as part the output.When i run the shell script from python program, i can see only standard output, but not the INFO & DEBUG logs which are output of shell script.My Code:here when i print the shell script output, i can see only partial output and cannot see the output like '18/10/20 11:24:55 INFO test test' (Which is shell script output)Could someone help me to provide some info how can i get all the shell script output.
It looks like your script is sending INFO and DEBUG logs to stderr. You can try just to remove stderr=subprocess.PIPE, to see if the output appears in terminal.If you really need the subprocess.PIPE for stderr, say you want to capture the stderr output from Python, you will need to call process.communicate() see more info Popen.communicate
