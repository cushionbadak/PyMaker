I have a list of strings that looks like this:Where each block is separated by a title marked with 'title'.I need to separate these blocks and format it like this:I'm currently using a for loop to do the job, my code looks like this:which is the desired format, but I'm actually trying to avoid the use of for loops.So, is there a way of doing this with a built-in pandas function?
You can do it with str.contains and ffill
For a pure Python solution, you can use itertools.groupby:ExplanationGroup by whether the string ends in [title].Extract results as a list for slicing later.Extract the odd elements as titles and even elements as names via a nested list comprehension with zip.
