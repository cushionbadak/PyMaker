Please need helpGetting below errorFile "/usr/lib64/python2.7/json/encoder.py", line 184, in default      raise TypeError(repr(o) + " is not JSON serializable") TypeError: datetime.datetime(2018, 10, 17, 12, 40, 10, 783000, tzinfo=tzlocal())  is not JSON serializable
How to convert the original dictionary to JSONThe following ran for me without issues:However, when I ran it as:I got the same error as you. If you can convert the result of datetime.datetime(2018, 10, 17, 12, 40, 10, 783000, tzinfo=tzlocal()) to a string before calling json.dumps, it should fix your issue.How to extract OutputValue from original dictionaryOutput for me is ec2-51-111-211-211.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com when using the dictionary in your question (after converting datetime.datetime() result to a string but before converting the whole dictionary to JSON).
