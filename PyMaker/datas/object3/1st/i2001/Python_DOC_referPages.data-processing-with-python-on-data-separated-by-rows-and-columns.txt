I have a data that is separated by rows(date time row) as suchWould like to clean it in a way to separate the A, B , C, etc as shown in the 1st value after the date time row as a column and the values that come after the A,B,C as another column followed by capturing the date time and input as another column. Something like thisWould greatly appeciate if anyone can guide me along. I've try reading by doing a pattern match then to grab the following lines but unable to accomplish it.Understand that the code as above is nothing alike to what i want to achieve therefore would like you guys to help me to guide me along and to show that i've tried some stuff. Thank you for your timeEDITED: Included the 3rd line of data to show the spill over of value from 2nd line of data with a \t tabspace before line
It is always a good idea to open a file using with open(), then you can parse the lines as you want in a list, in my case I just checked to see the first 2 characters of the line is a digit, if it is, it stores the value to be added to the desired line later:Edited: Added rstrip to remove '\n' and included timestamp and spill over updated in question with the output.
Another easy approach is to use a Regular Expression: Regular  Expression HOWTO and Print lists in Pythonread from the .txt file IDM.txtremoved whitespace on the left side using lstrip()created regular expression pattern_num for finding the match line starting with digitslog string formatted per OP requestwrite the final results to IDM_clean.txtUpdate: Final and last solution as Generalization:Screen from the file:
