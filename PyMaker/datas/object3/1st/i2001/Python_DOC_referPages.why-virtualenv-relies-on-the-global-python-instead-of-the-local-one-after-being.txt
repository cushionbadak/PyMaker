I pulled (git) a python project which was created (by me on another computer) using virtualenv. So, the python library is actually in a local directory (e.g., fila_env/bin/python) in this project. After pulling it, I can locate that (see the tree below). However, when I activate the environment (using source fila_env/bin/activate), the python on this machine is being used instead of the virtualenv's:I googled around but I couldn't find a good solution to this. I would like to know:How I can assure that if someone pulls this project, they will onlyuse the provided python library, and not their own python.Is this a correct approach to create a virtualenv, and push the entire project (including the virtualenv) to the cloud?Here are some more info:
You cannot and you shouldn't, If I use 32-bit Linux and your virtualenv has been created on 64-bit Windows (or vice versa) your python binary certainly will not work for me.Again, no. virtualenv is a developer's tool, not a distribution tool. For distribution you should consider sdist/egg/wheel, or creating platform-dependent binaries with PyInstaller, py2exe or similar tools.
