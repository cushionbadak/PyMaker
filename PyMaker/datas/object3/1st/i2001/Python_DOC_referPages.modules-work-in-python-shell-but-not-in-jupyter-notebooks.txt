I used:and got :Next, I tried to make sure it installed, but I got:I tried I also tried using it in Jupyter Notebooks:    import geopyI am not sure, because noob, but I think it might have something to do with the fact Python 2.7 was by default installed with my distribution of Ubuntu, and I installed Python3 and have been using it instead. I added Python = Python3 in the first line of ~/.bashrc in hopes of fixing that. This has happened numerous times before to me with other packages. Please help. Any criticism is welcomed, sorry if I didn't conform to stackoverflow etiquette in any way (still a noob).
I think that Your problem may be fixed with virtual env. Just create Venv, and then use "python" from there. Look here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
type 'python -V' in shell and run, see if the default env is your wantedif you've created virtual env, make sure you created correctly and do not !!! move the env !!! 
Try the command as below in your notebook.Maybe you installed in the different python with Jupiter environment.
