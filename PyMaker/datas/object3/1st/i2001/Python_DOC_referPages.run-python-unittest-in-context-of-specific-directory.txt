In my python application, I open mp3 files with relative paths from where the program was started. To keep it simple, I made a minimal reproduction of the problem I have in my project here.Basically, I have a structure like this:In main.py I have a simple function that prints and returns the current working directory:So if I cd into the src folder and run python main.py I see:This is the desired behavior, as in my program the file paths to the mp3 files are relative to src.The problem arises when I try to write tests. I can't seem to get a test like this to pass, no matter what I pass to --start-directory and --top-level-directory:The question: How can I run my tests as if they were running in the context of a specific directory if they are saved to a different directory?Constraints:the tests must import using absolute paths, as in my example: fromsrc.main import get_cwd
There is a os function to change the directory, try adding os.chdir('src') to your test.
An option is to mock the value given by os.path.basename with a return value of "src"
