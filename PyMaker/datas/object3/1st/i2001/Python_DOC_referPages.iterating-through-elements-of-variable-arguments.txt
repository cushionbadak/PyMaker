I have a function scalar_func(*args) that takes a variable number scalar numbers. It preforms some math with them and outputs a scalar. As a trivial example, we'll assume scalar_func multiplies each number:I would like to have scalar_func work with lists. To do so, I made another function list_func(*args). It takes in a variable number of lists and makes a new one like so:Obviously, this function is just pseudocode. How can I implement list_func?
You can use zip here:If you have large lists, you may wish to create an iterator and use next to reduce memory consumption:This may also be rewritten for greater efficiency:Alternatively, you can itertools.starmap for the functional equivalent:
