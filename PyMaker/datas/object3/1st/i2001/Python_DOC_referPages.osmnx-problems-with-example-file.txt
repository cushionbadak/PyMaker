I'm really new to Python and to OSMnx as well. I'm trying to figure out how this package works, my ultimate goal would be to be able to create shapefiles from a list of streets and I hope this package can get me closer to this.Unfortunately, I've already had problems with running the example code for getting street network for a single city.This is how the example code starts:and then this is I'd like to run:and the error message is this:I use the win7 and jupyter framework.Thanks in advance for your help!
Your issue appears to be that pyproj is not installed properly. I see you've answered your question, but there's a somewhat simpler answer. If you have installation problems such as this, you can follow the OSMnx instructions that state:If you have any trouble with the installation, try installing OSMnx in a new, clean virtual environment using conda and conda-forge:
With some help of RunOrVeith I figured out a way which is working now.I use Python 3.6 instead of 3.7.I created a virtual environment following this site, using conda.I installed in the newly created environment geopandas, rtree and osmnx, following this blog article, using conda install -c conda-forge nameofpackageI run the code above in my question.
