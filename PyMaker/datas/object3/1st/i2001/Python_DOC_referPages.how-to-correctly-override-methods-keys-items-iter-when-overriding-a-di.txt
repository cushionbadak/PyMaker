I am trying to make an enhancement in dict which supports file operation in particular folder in a way it's done in a dict. Following is an exampleIt creates two files in LALALA folder with correct content.I could handle get,set,contains,del,pop methods correctly but I can't seem to wrap my hand around keys(),values(),iter methods.I want all the file names to be printed when I call keys(), and when I iter on it I want k - Name of filev - content of fileFollowing my code, Please have a look and help.
1:you didn't even save the information of filenames,so your keys() function doesn't work2:Inherit class UserDict instead of inheriting class dict3:I can't see what's the meaning of inherit class like dict/UserDict ....4:To use FolderDict like real dict ,what you need to to is write __iter__  __next__ __getitem__  __setitem__  __next__  __getattribute__   __delitem__ keys items values ...... in your class.
