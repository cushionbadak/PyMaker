This question already has an answer here:What does %s mean in a python format string?                    7 answers                What does %d do in this line of my code?Here's my code.Here's the input and output for your reference.
It takes the value that is after your string and places it into the string at the %d. The first %d gets the first value, and the second gets the second and so on...So it prints like this. "and Puppy (whatever j+1 is) (User (whatever I +1 is) ) "
