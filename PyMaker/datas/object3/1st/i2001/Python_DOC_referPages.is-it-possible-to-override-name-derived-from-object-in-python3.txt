The example below works in Python2 but not in Python3. Is there an equivalent method for overloading the __name__ of a class in Python3? See related question.
Python 3.3 and up use the __qualname__ attribute to form the class represenation string:You probably want to set both __name__ and __qualname__, but only the latter has any effect on the string output you are looking for.
