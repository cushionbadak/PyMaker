Natural Text
In discord chat there is a limit of 2000 characters per message so is there any way to bypass it?like example in below code when someone types !ping bot sends a embed message. So is it possible to make it split message after or before a certain line bot hides that messages and gives option to view or click next page or something.
You can split your text yourself or use the easy way as suggestend py @Prashant Godhani here and use the textwrap.wrap() function:If you'd rather replicate the functionality of the textwrap module yourself you can do so by splitting your text at spaces into words and combining the words until they would overshoot the length you are allowed to use. Put that word in the next sentence, join all current words back together and store it in a list. Loop until done, add last parts if needed and return the list:Output of self-made wrapper:Output of textwrap-example: 
you can use await bot.say many times.for line splitting use python textwrap library that is amazing for line splitting. please refer this example and than use bot.say many time in loop.
