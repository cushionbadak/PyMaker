I have a nested list of the form:How can I get this into unique combinations of the initial elements, of the form: I know that's a lot of lists, but I need it in that form. I don't have an idea where to begin.
You can use itertools.combinations:This outputs:[[['a', 'b'], ['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3']], [['a', 'c'], ['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3']], [['b', 'c'], ['b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3']]]
Nevermind, I solved it. Here is a working example.
You can use a dictionary with itertools.combinations:Result:Or, if you prefer nested lists:The idea, in both cases, is to reduce the number of Python-level for loops.
