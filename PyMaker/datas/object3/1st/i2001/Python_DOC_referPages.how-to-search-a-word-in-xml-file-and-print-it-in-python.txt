Natural Text
i want to search a specific word(which is entered by user) in .xml file. This is my xml file.here is my Codei have tried everything but still its giving me error a bytes-like object is required, not 'ElementTree'i really don't know how to solve it.
the error happens because you are passing an elementtree object to the fromstring () methods. Do like this:Use find() and findall() methods to search.for more info, check lib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlSimple example:test.xmlexample.py
