Natural Text
I'm working on a hangman game in Python. My "answer" list contains all the letters of the word in order, the "work" list starts off with dashes for each letter, which are then populated with correct letters.When using index(), it only returns the lowest position in the list that the value appears. However, I need a way to make all instances of the value be returned (otherwise repeating letters aren't getting filled in).I'm new to Python, so I'm not sure if some kind of loop is best, or if there is a different function to get the result I'm looking for. I've looked at enumerate() but I'm not sure how this would work in this instance. 
As you mentioned the problem is that index returns only the first occurrence of the character in the string. In order to solve your problem you need to iterate over answer and get the indices of the characters equal to guess,  something like this (using enumerate):OutputNote that work is slightly different from what you put on the comments.Further:How to find all occurrences of an element in a list?
