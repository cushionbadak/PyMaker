I am using Python 3.6.2 in a Conda virtual environment, on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.I have tried several ways to list both the files and directories of a particular path but I every method I try seems to only list the files in a directory, not the files and directories.My code containswhich shows only ['170224-ARC122-1-uM-Cis-S1-subsample_R1_001.fastq.gz',  '170224-ARC122-1-uM-Cis-S1-subsample_R2_001.fastq.gz']If I call a break before the listdir command, and then step through the listdir command the variable is filled with the correct contents *** NameError: name 'directory_contents' is not defined['170224-ARC122-1-uM-Cis-S1-subsample_R1_001.fastq.gz', 'bw', 'Stats',  'bwChrM', 'bg', '170224-ARC122-1-uM-Cis-S1-subsample_R2_001.fastq.gz',  'bgChrM', 'Log']Calling the break after the listdir command gives['170313-ARC122-no-Cis-S5-subsample_R2_001.fastq.gz', '170313-ARC122-no-Cis-S5-subsample_R1_001.fastq.gz']What is it that I am not understanding or what extra keyword/argument have I overlooked ? Why am I getting different results depending on if I break before the command or afterwards?The apparent simplicity of this seems hardly worth posing as a question but I have run out of solutions.
You could use the first result of os.walk():Output:os.walk() returns a generator - so it might query more then you want.
