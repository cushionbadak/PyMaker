Have you taken a look at the debug error? The error occurs in file: ft01_poisson.py, also with the error message: TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variableIt would seem you are calling another python script and you need to start debugging from there and not just the error message. The error message also suggests that you need to have the $DISPLAY environmental variable set. You can use the Python library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ to view your environmental variables.
