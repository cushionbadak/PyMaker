I need to find integers of a file. I need to get the average of these ints (I already have this part figured out). I get the error: "error on input []: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly"EDIT - Code is working. Thank you everyone! DiCaprio helped me to come up with final solution.I edited my final code to be this:How can I find the integers of this file?
use cast int(x) to transform str to int. By default everything is read from file as str.EDIT:I just thought you probably get a problem with the for i in line: part.Line would need to be split. try using for i in line.split(' ') assuming your ints are split by a space.EDIT 2:If it is one int per line use:
The problem here is that 'int' in lines is a string, and you need to convert it to an integer first. You can do this by replacing 'int' with int(int).This is assuming that there are only numbers (characters that can be represented as floats or integers) in the file. If not, you need to account for that.It's also not a good idea to name a variable after a built-in function, so I would change the name int to something else.
You probably shouldn't use "int" as variable as it's a built in and if you try to reference it later you wont be able to.So by the looks of it you want to take all integers in a file and average them? Here's a function that will do it:
Have you tried using regular expressions?  It might work a little easier for you.Read the file and using an expression like this should parse the file for integers.https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.htmlI hope this helps.
Or why not this, a straightforward solution:Just directly convert to integers without going trough each characterAnd if there are non-numeric values:
Another solution with try and except:
I offer a slimmed down version of DiCaprio's answer with a few modifications to make sure you're just collecting integers and can use the function for multiple files.
You can easily solve it using the regular expressions module.That regular expression will match any string consisting of decimal numbers in the file's content and findall will return a list containing them.You might want to avoid matching integers that are in a word. For example, not counting the '2' in "sample2". In that case, you could change the regular expression from r'\d+' to r'\A\d+\s|\s\d+\s|\s\d+$'
