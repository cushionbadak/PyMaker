This question already has an answer here:Why does range(start, end) not include end?                    8 answers                The program calculates the multiplication table from 0 to 12 for the number the user has entered.I am trying to display the contents of the array with the results in it by for looping through it. However, it only displays the tables from 0 to 11, but not the 12th one, even if the 12th data is there.Here is what I came up with:The output looks like this:What could be causing that ? Coming from VB and C# so I may be mistaking the i as an index, while it is a value from the array, but I really don't see how I could be fixing this. Thank you !
The range() function is non-inclusive of the upper bound. So when you're saying range(0,12), you're only going to get [0,11]. If you want [0,12], you have to do range(0,13). Note that range(0,13) is equivalent to range(13) because the default lower-bound is 0.See the documentation.
