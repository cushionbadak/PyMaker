I understand why a tuple which contains a mutable object like list is not hashable, since list items in the tuple can still be updated.example:While this is not hashable:The above make sense to me.But when I create a namedtuple with list items it is still hashable:and when I add a list:Why this difference between tuples and namedtuples?
But when I create a namedtuple with list as items it is still  hashable...You never do that. You create a named-tuple with a str, 'adam' and an int, 20The following:AndDo not create namedtuple objects, they create namedtuple classes. According to the docs:Returns a new tuple subclass named typename.In other words, collections.namedtuple is a factory function that returns a class. If you create instances of those classes, their instances follow the same rules as regular tuple instances.So consider:TestTuple, the return value of the namedtuple factory function, is not a namedtuple instance, it is an instance of type, like all other classes.When you create instances of this class:They follow the usual rules of hashability that regular tuple objects do:Note, the fieldnames argument accepts either a sequence (e.g. a list) of fieldnames, or for convenience, a space/comma-delimited string of fieldnames, so also from the docs:...  The field_names are a sequence of strings such as ['x', 'y'].  Alternatively, field_names can be a single string with each fieldname  separated by whitespace and/or commas, for example 'x y' or 'x, y'.
