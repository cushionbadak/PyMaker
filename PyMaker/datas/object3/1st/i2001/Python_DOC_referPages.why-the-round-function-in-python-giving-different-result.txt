I am trying to take the round of float number but in python for different  float values it gives the different result. Example : - and   as you can see the result round(4.5) return 4 while rount(3.5) return 4. How to solve this problem. ? I want round(4.5) to return 5. Please help me out. Thanks
See official doc.Basically it called even round. It will round x.5 value into even choice.And here is why.
From docs:if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2).I.e. Python 3 does "rounding half to even".You can do "round up" this way:
