I'm supposed to read in a csv file, and create a function that when called, will display the top scorer for a specific module. My current function is:The CSV contains the following:I get an error saying:I know I'm doing something stupid, so a lil help would be nice!
Your top110 is obtained from the "maximum" value among columns of each row, which is a string, and is overridden for each iteration. By using an expression of top110(row["first_name"]) you're treating top110 as a function when it is a string, hence the error.If you want to obtain the top scorer of each module, you should use the max function on all rows with operator.itemgetter as they key function to specify the column you want the maximum value to be based on:
When you read in data it will be read in as a string. You have to convert it to whatever you need, such as an int.It's the same with inputs.So put int() around whatever you need to do comparisons against.The error is because you are attempting to do some type of comparison that does not exist for string objects.Also for future reference, I would recommend Pandas for handling csv.
