Dear Python Date and Time Lords,I am trying to parse dates of which some are clearly not dates but I want to ignore those or use a default datehowever I am not making progress.Does someone have a suggestion, how I can deal with none-dates when going through a list and parsing dates?
I would first point out some mistakes you have made in your code. I'm hoping this will help you to understand where you have gone wrong.I'm not sure why you think you can pass the argument default to the datetime constructor. It is not available option. You can see the available arguments in the documentationstrftime is a class function returns a new datetime object. If you call it on an existing datetime object like you do in your example, it does not modify the existing object.You are specifying the date format string as a f string. This is not necessary.So here is an example of how you could do this:
@Robin Zigmond Thanks. I think that works!
