If I have an input like: "1 2 3 4 5", I can convert it as list of int as follow:In case we have an input like: "1 2 hello 4 5.0", it's possible to convert it in a list like this: [1, 2, 'hello', 4, 5.0] ?
I used ast.literal_eval for this .According to the docs literal_eval .It safely evaluates an expression node or a Unicode or Latin-1 encoded string containing a Python literal or container display.INPUTOUTPUTINPUTOUTPUT
Not without some extra work: you'd need your own conversion function that handles the various types. Something like (untested!):
If you are into list comprehensions as much as I am, you might want to use something like this (first you should transform the string input into a list with split()):a = [int(x) if str(x).isdigit() else float(x) if str(x).replace('.','',1).isdigit() else x for x in a]
