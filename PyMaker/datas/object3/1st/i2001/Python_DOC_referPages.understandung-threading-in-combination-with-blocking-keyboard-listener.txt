What I try to implement is a timeout countdown which can be interrupted by a pynput key event.In my first implementation there is a bug: I do not see a possibility to tell the pynput thread that the timeout is over.According to Python threading documentation, do I need to create a more complex Condition object, or kind of a sync thread? Or is what I want to extend the original pynput class?For me it is very hard to understand in this case which one thread is here producer either consumer.The code..Module codeThe actual program
Worked for me with listener.stop().
