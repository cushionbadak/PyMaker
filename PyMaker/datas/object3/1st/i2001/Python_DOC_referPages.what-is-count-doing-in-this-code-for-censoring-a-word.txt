Natural Text
Okay, so I was over at Codecademy and I've been stuck on this code for a while, I just wasn't getting it. So I eventually ended up just getting the solution and trying to understand it. but I'm not really understanding it all.The code is:Now I think count has to be the index (Since it says words[count] = stars), but I don't get why they set it to an integer (0) or added one to it, I'm guessing it has to do with setting the placement of the censoring in the text but would really appreciate if someone could explain this better to a newbie so I'm not just getting through this without understanding it.Thanks in advance :)
I think you copied the code wrong mate. Here's what I think it should be - Here count it keeping track of the position of the word under evaluation. If the word happens to be equal to the censored word, it correctly replaces the word with stars. Now how do you know where that word is in the list? - count
One way to give you a better indication of what is going on is as follows;Make count a global variable so you can access it outside the function, then simply print the result.When ran, you will see that count returns a value of 2Count is incremented by 1 when it encounters the word that is being censored.However, as some of the other users have pointed out in the comments, the 'censoring' doesn't quite work!
