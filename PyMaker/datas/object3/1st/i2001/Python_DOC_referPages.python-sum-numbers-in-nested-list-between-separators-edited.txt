I have nested list, which looks something like this [[1, 0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]]. How can i sum numbers (in this case ones) between separators (in this case zeros)to get output like this: [[1,2], [3,1]]?EDITAnd what about situation, in which the list starts with 0 and has more groups of ones? for example [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1] --> [1, 2, 2]
You could use groupby:Output
Or in the condensed form
Sum before and after the index of the separator:Output:An edit to handle the test case in the comment:Output:
