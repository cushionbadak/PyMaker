I'm having trouble converting these perl regex to python, I've converted simpler ones before. I don't really understand the modifiers /s and /is, I know that /g is global.I also don't know what the first one exactly does. The second removes a specific li tag with a message in html files.
First regex does nothing but appends ref///docs to the beginning. Explanation:\] matches the character "]"\( matches the character "("1st Capturing Group (/uploads/.*?.pdf)\/ matches the character "/"uploads matches the characters "uploads" (case sensitive)\/ matches the character "/".*? matches any character (except for line terminators)*? Quantifier â€” Matches between zero and unlimited times, as few times as possible, expanding as needed (lazy)\. matches the character ".pdf matches the characters pdf (case sensitive)\) matches the character ) Global pattern flagsg modifier: global. All matches (don't return after first match)Consider the example:test_str = "](/uploads/something.pdf)"perl:python:Output of printing test_str after substitution:I don't know what you really want to do in second regex, but the perl regex says to replace any URL of example.com to any variable $test. Lets play around:perl:python:Output of printing data after substitution:Modifiers:i means ignore case (case insensitive search)s means dot will now match any character (including newline)
