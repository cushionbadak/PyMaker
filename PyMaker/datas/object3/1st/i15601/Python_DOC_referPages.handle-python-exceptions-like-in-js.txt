I came to python from Node.js and I'm accustomed to such error handling:Is it acceptable in Python to handle errors likeSo that the function always return a tuple with exception and data values:(None, data) or (Exception, None)
The Pythonic way would be to either move the try outside do_smth:or to return None in a failing case:Note that Python generally has a preference for "easier to ask for forgiveness than permission"-style coding.
Although there is no error in your code, you usually don't pass exceptions as arguments into other scopes unless the exception instance will be actually used as data. Exceptions in Python are lightweight and they bubble up to render a full traceback, so you must just let them live and happen.If you expect some kind of exception happen when you call do_smth, just write code to handle it, like this:Pro tip: avoid catching just Exception. Always expect specific types of errors, get used to write and raise your own exceptions as well. It helps a lot. Read more about it. ;)PS: I also come from JavaScript as primary language; I'm sure you'll love Python too. :)
