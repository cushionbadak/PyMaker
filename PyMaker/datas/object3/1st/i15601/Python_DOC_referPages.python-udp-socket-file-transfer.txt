How do I get a response from the server?Client side:SERVER side:I can send a message from the server that the client will receive, but can not seem to get communication (like an ACK.) to make it back to the server. (yes UDP is not a good way to be doing this i'm pretty sure, but that was a specific for the project)  
for question 1: to send the ACK, you could replicate what you have in the reverse direction. 
Since UDP is connection-less you don't know beforehand you receive a packet where the packet will come from, so you have to use recvfrom to get both the packet and the peer (address/port) the packet came from. Then you have to use that address to send data back.What you're doing now in your client (but what really looks like the server) in the loop is send the same data over and over to itself. Instead in the loop you should receive packets using the previously mentions recvfrom then send replies to the peer you received the packet from.So something like the following pseudo code
After many attempts to get a simple acknowledgment reply from my server this did it. Beyond literally starting completely over each round, the time.sleep(.1) function was the only missing key.  It allowed the server and client both time to close the current socket connection so that there was not an error of trying to bind multiple bodies to a single location or something.Working result:Server Command Window:Client:Client Command Window:I did finally remove the redundant input("Client: ") there at the top. A special thanks @JoachimPileborg for helping, but I have to give it to the little guy just because it was the path I ended up taking.
