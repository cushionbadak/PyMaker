I am new to working with Python, and seem to be having an issue that no matter what I search, and no matter what I try, still presists.I am trying to execute a system command using the exec function.I have tried the following:Which returns invalid syntax with a cursor on the first /I have triedWhich returns unexpected character after line continuation character and a cursor on the last character of my argument g in this case.I have been searching for a solution for the last hour, and nothing has helped. How can I simply execute this command without an error being thrown?Yes, my line endings are correct.
exec is used to execute Python code that is represented as a string or code object.  From the docs:exec(object[, globals[, locals]])This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. object must be either a string or a code object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed (unless a syntax error occurs).To execute a system command, you can use os.system:
Maybe try putting an r in front of the string so it reads exec(r"\\usr\\sbin\\something --arg")
