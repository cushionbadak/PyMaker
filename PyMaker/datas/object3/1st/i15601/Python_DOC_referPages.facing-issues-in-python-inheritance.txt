Trying to test inheritance with python. My scenario is like below..In a folder I’ve a base class named Asset_Base and a child class named Asset and they looks like below..in Asset_Base.py file:in Asset.py file:while i run this Asset class getting this error..After trying few things found it works fine if i just change the import statement like below from Asset_Base import *I’m new to python and not sure about the difference between import Asset_Base and from Asset_Base import *Can anyone please explain it a bit.Thanks in advance.
That's because in your first example, your class is inheriting from the Asset_Base module (that is, the .py file) -- not the class of the same name that it contains.Note how your error message talks about module.__init__().Change your import statement so that it reads from Asset_Base import Asset_Base.In addition, "module contains a class of the same name" is an anti-pattern in Python. Avoid doing that.
imports a module (a file)You import everything that is in your file (in this case the class Asset_Base)For more information take a look into the Python documentation.
