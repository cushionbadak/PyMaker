Just started learning Python. How can i get a status of file's attributes in Python? I know that os.chmod(fullname, stat.S_IWRITE) delete readonly attribute, but how can i get status without changing it? I need to get all of the attributes of "hidden", "system", "readonly", "archive"
You can use directly the Windows API like that
you need to take a look at module stat and os.stat
If you are using python 3.4+ you can use pathlib stat method.Output:here is more information about os.stat_result
