Have you a great method to count number of Sugar in my goblet? 
You can use a generator expression with sum and isinstance:Also, list.count did not work because the method was testing how many items in the list equaled Sugar.  In other words, it was basically doing item==Sugar for each item in the list.  This is incorrect because you want to be testing the type of each item, which is what isinstance does.
