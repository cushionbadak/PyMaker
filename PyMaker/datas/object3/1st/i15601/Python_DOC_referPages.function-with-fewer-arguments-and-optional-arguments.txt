I often write code that looks like this and am looking for a better suggestion. Basically, I usually create some general function myfuc_general that handles all the cases I need with parameters, usually with optional parameters. However, often I usually run 2 (possibly more) specific functions. Everything is the same except one of the arguments is different, in this case a. I run them so often that I actually prefer to just have two additional functions so I don't have to remember what the optional parameter needs to be. So for myfunct_specific1, I am running a=10 and for myfunct_specific2, a=20. Is there something better to do than this? This seems pretty sloppy and it has the disadvantage in the event that I need to change the myfuct_general call, then I have to change all the other functions.edit (addition):iCodez thank you for suggestion. I have this particular situation and it is throwing me an error. Help? Thanks again
You can use functools.partial to make this a lot easier:Below is a demonstration:
