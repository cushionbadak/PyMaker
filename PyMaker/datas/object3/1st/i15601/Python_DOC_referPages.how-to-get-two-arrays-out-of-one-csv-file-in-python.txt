I've a csv file containing lines like this:A,x1 A,x2A,x3B,x4B,x5B,x6The first part reflects the group (A or B) a value (x1, x2, ...) belongs to.What I want to do now is importing that csv file in Python, so I have two lists in the end:ListA = [x1, x2, x3]ListB = [x4, x5, x6]Can someone help me out with that? Thanks in advance :)

after putting your data in a pandas Series object names ser, just type in ser.loc("A")and ser.loc("B") to get the data slice you want.
Using preassigned names for your vectors lead to lots of duplicated logic, that gets more and more complicated if you add new vectors to your data description...It's much better to use dictionariesThe relevant docs, from the python official documentationsetdefault(key[, default])append(x)
