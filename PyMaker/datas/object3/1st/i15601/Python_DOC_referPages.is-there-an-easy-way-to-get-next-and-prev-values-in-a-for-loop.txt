So...is there an easy way to get next and previous values while iterating with a for-loop in Python?I know this can be easily done if you do something like:But what about:
Here is a common pattern that I use to iterate over pairs of items in a sequence:If you want three items (prev, item, next) you can do this:i is the previous element, j is the current element, k is the next element.Of course, this "starts" at 1 and "ends" at 8. What should you receive as prev/next at the ends? Perhaps None? Probably easiest to just do this:
easiest way I know of is 
You could always convert a into an iterator with iter and then iterate over that.  This will allow you to use next inside the loop to advance the iterator that you are iterting over:Also, the None in there is the default value to return if there is no next item.  You can set it to whatever value you want though.  Omitting the argument will cause a StopIteration exception to be raised:
If you want both the previous and the next element in a circular sequence for each iteration:
this is easy too:
Probably overkill but I sometimes use the following more general generator for this, which yields a sequence of 'windows' of any size on a list or other iterable. (The window size must be less than the length of the iterable.)
