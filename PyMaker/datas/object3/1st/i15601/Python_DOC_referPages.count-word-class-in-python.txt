Natural Text
I want to create a class which has a function to count the words in a string which is passed through the function as a parameter (is my terminology correct?). This is what I have an it gives me an error "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'sentence'.myHacks.countWords("please count me")
It sounds like what you need is just a function, not a class. Classes have to be instantiated, and are used when you need to do more than just one operation on a related set of data. For your single use case, a function will probably suffice:Also, you never use my_list, and you're counting letters in that sentence, not words. This is probably what you need instead:In order to use your method, with a class, like you've written, you'd have to call it this way:
You are mixing the class instantiation with the method call, you should instantiate a class with the correct stringand then call the countWords method on the new object
