I want to how to find even numbers from lists of lists.The example was:should return (maximum even numbers):I found how to find even numbers from list, from stackoverflow:but I want to know how I can make it so that it can find even numbers from each list, in list.
Though you don't say it explicitly, it seems you are looking for the maximum even number in each list within a list of lists. And from your example it seems you want the programme to add 0 if there is no even number. In that case this will work:
You can build this algorithm up from the inside-out using some nice Pythonic language constructs:This will print out:
python 3.4 takes a default value for max so if after filtering there are no even numbers we can return 0 as a default value:
As I understand you want to iterate over a list of lists, grabbing biggest even number from each list or 0 if not even numbers were found. Here is your function then:Make sure to read about builtin max function :)
You're almost there! :-)Check what the builtin max function does.I added some print statements to help follow what the code is doing. The code above will output:
here you go:i used lambda to check for even number, then filter to save value for true, then max if lenght of list greater then 0 else 0
