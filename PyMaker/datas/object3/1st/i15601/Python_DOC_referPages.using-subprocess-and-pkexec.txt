I'm trying to use run a command alongside with pkexec, but is says no such file is found.OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directoryHowever, path is okay and the file is there.
You probably want to use:Since subprocess.Popen quotes each entry in the list; so your example is the same using this on the commandline:Instead of:From the documentation (emphasis mine):args is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence of program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments.
