So for an assignment for class the instructor wants us to create a program that is similar to a time clock. You enter the time that you start and enter the time that you leave and the program figures out how much the person gets paid. However, the program has to be in a 24 hour format so for example, if you want to type in 2 p.m. you need to type in 14:00. With that logic, what if you were to work until the early hours of the morning such as 01:00? I have the program prompt the user for the times as follows:I then use start.split(":") and end.split(":") to create a list separated by the ":" and I use eval() afterwards to obtain the integer but whenever I try to enter an integer that has a 0 in front of it (such as 01) the program responds with a syntax error and that it is an invalid token.Is there any way around this to obtain the number value?
Don't use eval(). Use the int() function to parse strings representing integers. You can safely pass zero-padded numbers into int(); int('01') returns 1:
There is another way you can strip the values. You can user str.startswith function OUTPUT:
