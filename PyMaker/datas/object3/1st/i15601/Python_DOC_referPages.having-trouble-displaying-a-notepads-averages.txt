I need to make a program that displays an average of about 5 numbers from a notepad file. I feel that I have most of the code right but I keep getting this error:TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer." How can I fix it? Here's my code:
The range built-in only accepts integer arguments:Thus, amount needs to be an integer:Also, you forgot to close the file at the end of your function. You can use a with-statement so that this is done automatically:Finally, this line is a problem:numbers is the file object, not a list of numbers.  You need to read the numbers from the file into a list in order to do len(numbers).  I think you actually want something like this:Using a list comprehension, it will read-in all of the numbers from the file, convert them into integers, and then store them in a list.  Afterwards, we can easily find the average by diving the sum of the list by its length.
