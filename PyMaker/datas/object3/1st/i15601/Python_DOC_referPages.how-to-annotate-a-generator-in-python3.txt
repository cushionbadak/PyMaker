Python 3.x supports (optional) function annotations:I sometimes encounter problems as to how to represent a given "type" can be represented, and this time, I have a function that returns a generator:How should I annotate the return value? Is there any reference I can consult to?
Annotations in Python 3 can be any valid expression, not just a type, and are not actually used for anything internally (for more on annotations, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107). There are no guidelines or standards as to how to use these annotations so they can be used in whatever way is easiest for the coder (See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008#programming-recommendations). In your specific case you could use a string or global variable to indicate your type, or perhaps the types.GeneratorType, although there is no way to indicate that the generator produces ints.
The typing module defines the Generator type, which you can use like:See also PEP 0484.
