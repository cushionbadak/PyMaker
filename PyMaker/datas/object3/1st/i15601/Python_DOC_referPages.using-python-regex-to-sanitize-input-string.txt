Natural Text
I have the string:text = 'href = "www.google.com" onmouseover = blahblah >'I want 'href = "www.google.com">'Currently, my function looks like this:which ends up removing the website link and replacing it with the string '.*' .  I think I'm supposed to use ?Pname somehow?, but do not know ho to write it properly so that I get the correct output.
You don't want to substitute in .*, you want to substitute in whatever the first .* matched.To do that, you need a backreference, like \1.And this means you need something for the backreference to refer back to—a capture group, like (.*) instead of .*.More generally, the replacement string is not a regular expression, it's a different kind of thing—basically, it's a template that's all literal characters except for backreferences.* So, you don't want to try to escape the quotes, unless you want literal backslashes in the results.So:This is explained in more detail in Search and Replace in the Regular Expression HOWTO.* Or it can be a function which takes each match object and returns a string.
An alternative way to accomplish your goal is to take a substring. No regular expression is needed. The idea is to find the second double-quote character using the string method index().For a string called input, this expression gives you the position of the second double-quote character:If that value is k, write input[:k+1] to extract everything up to and including the second double-quote character.Try out the following in your Python interpreter.
