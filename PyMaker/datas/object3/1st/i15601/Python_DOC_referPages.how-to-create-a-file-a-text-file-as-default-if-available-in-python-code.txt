This question already has an answer here:Create empty file using python [duplicate]                    2 answers                This is the code I have so far, yes I know the 'dirs' code creates a folder, but I am not sure of the code (if there is one) to create a file instead! Any help would be appreciated :D
Inorder to create a file and work on it, use the open() function.fp = open(outfile, mode)modes:r: readw: if file exists, replace it with a new onea: append existing fileIn your case the mode is 'w'
For create a file you can just open a file in write modeopen('file.txt', 'w')https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open
