I have the following object being returned using response.json within the Requests module:This object has two elements, playerTableStats and statColumns. These can accessed with the following code:If I convert the contents of statColumns into a string object, I can use it as part of a .format() statement to map playerTableStats. I could do this like so:However that doesn't seem very Pythonic and doesn't take into account the fact that both statColumns and playerTableStats will vary in their number of elements when I am returning different .json objects from the same site.Is there a cleaner way to get all elements of statColumns into the format:Thanks
