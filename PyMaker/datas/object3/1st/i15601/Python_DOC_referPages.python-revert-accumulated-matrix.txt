I have a matrix like this how i get the partial sums by columns in python?
If you don't want to use numpy or itertools, here is the code
If you want a solution that doesn't involve numpy, and just uses list of lists and itertools.tee (which is builtin), then the below should work
Trynp.vstack((Z[0],np.diff(Z,axis=0)))where Z is the matrix you are differentiating.
From the second line, what you want is just the difference of row i and row i-1, and the first line is just the first line of the original array. The easiest way to get this is with numpy. So this works:As Lord Henry Wotton (!) points out, the difference a[1:]-a[:-1] is the same as np.diff(a, axis=0).
I think this one is niceHere I prepend a list of zeros to the list of lists (obtaining c), and by a bit of packing and unpacking using zip I have a list of lists with the expected results.
