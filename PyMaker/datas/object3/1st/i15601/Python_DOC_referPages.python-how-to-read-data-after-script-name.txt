I am new to python and would like to give the arguments to a script as in-line arguments after the script name.For example: given the script I would like to launch it from terminal in the following way:I am able to read/print into terminal via the following command:But in order to do this I have to interact with the program, my question is: how can I give to the script all the arguments in the line in which I execute it from shell?
You have to use sys.argv to retrive parameter after scriptssys.argv[0] will give you first argument.Please use different argument as python script_name.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4If you have to use unix type argument syntext like python script arg1=val1 arg2=val2 then user argparser
Check out the argparse tutorial for information on how to use the argparse module. It's an easy-to-use yet powerful module for interacting with command-line arguments, setting up help messages, formatting printouts, and more.
