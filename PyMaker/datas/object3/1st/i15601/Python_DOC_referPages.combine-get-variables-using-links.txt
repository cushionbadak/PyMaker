I have a view that will show some products. Also I have a filter on the left side. For example: Price: Less than $5, $5 - $10 ... etc.Brand: Apple, IBM, Intel etc.the problem with the links now. Now I need these queries to be combined together. However, each link will remove the other queries. Expected Result: I know I can do it using many if else. But is there anyway to do it in django or HTML to make this happen? Another Explanation: I need a way that will keep adding to the query in the URL. like amazon when you filter the products. First you pick the brand then you pick the price range then etc. I don't want to check every time if there is a query in the Url or not. I just want a way that will not remove the current query and just keep adding to it.
