I'm new to programming, and obviously I can easily run a program to get the answer, but I want to get a clearer and better understanding of why this code runs "dessert". I understand len(s) is the length of the number, but what about the three numbers "-1, 0 -1"? Can I get a detailed explanation of why this prints dessert?
s t r e s s e d0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 range function :  range(start, stop, step)len(s) = 8len(s-1)= 7the loop starts at 7 stops at 0 and counts(steps) bacwards by 1 (-1)so , the loop prints7 6 5 4 3 2 1d e s s e r t
The code creates a range that counts down. Starting at len(s) - 1 (so 7, stressed is 8 characters long), it'll count down to 1 (the end point is not included). In other words, you are giving range() three arguments, len(s) - 1 is one argument, 0 is the second and -1 is the third, and they represent the start, stop and step arguments. See the range() type documentation.The code then uses those values to index s; s[7] is the last character in the string, d, then s[6] is the one-but last character e, etc.Breaking this down to the components in an interactive session:If you wanted the code to print out desserts (with the s at the end) then you need to adjust the range() to loop up to -1:
It's all about range().It's all discussed here.It can be used in three ways;Where in the first case, it will give [1, 2, 3, ... stop-1], in the second case [start, start+1, start+2, ... stop-1], and in the third case [start, start+step, start+2*step, ...stop-step].The thing to note here is that the range you get is [start, stop). Where standard interval notation has been used.The other thing to note here is that step can be negative, which is what you have in your example.
You call a loop with its start index, then tell it to traverse to end index and lastly increase the index or decrease the indexIf you useThe loop will start from 0 index and traverse till last index with 1 index increment
