I am trying out the map function and it is giving me unexpected output:When I try to call it with map(lambda x: x, range(3))(), it says map is not callable.
I think what you're looking for ismap returns an iterator. The message you are seeing is simply the object type for which you have just created an instance
That is not an error.  Instead, it is a representation of the map object (an iterator) returned by map in Python 3.x:Note that my output is not exactly the same because I am using a different implementation.  Still, the same principle applies.map in Python 2.x meanwhile returns a list:But in modern Python, if you want a list result, you need to explicitly convert the map object into one:You can read about this as well as similar changes on Python's What's New in Python 3.0 page.
