I am trying to produce a score depending on whether all elements in the list are the same. So if all elements are the same (like in the example above) the score will be 40. I tried with:
Create a set and check the length. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.Demonstration
Not sure exactly what you mean by the scoring as you don't discuss how you arrive at the score of 40. However, one way of checking if all elements in a list are the same would be:This simply returns True if they are all the same or False if not.
Why don't you create your simple function?

I know it's not good idea but it is also a solution.
