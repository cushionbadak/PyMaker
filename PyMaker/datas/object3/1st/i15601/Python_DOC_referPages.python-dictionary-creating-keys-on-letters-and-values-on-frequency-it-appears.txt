Natural Text
I have to read text that looks likeetc...I want to create a dictionary, how can I read through this and set T, C, A, or G as the key and the values is the frequency that letterappeared throughout the text?
Simply pass the whole string to a collections.Counter() object and it'll count each character.It may be more efficient to do so line by line, so as not to require too much memory:The str.strip() call removes any whitespace (such as the newline character).A quick demo using your sample input:I used the Counter.most_common() method to get a sorted list of letter-count pairs (in order from most to least common).
