I have a method has_related_object in my model that needs to check if a related object existsBut I get the error:Business.has_related_object()RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: Business has no customer.
This is because the ORM has to go to the database to check to see if customer exists. Since it doesn't exist, it raises an exception.You'll have to change your method to the following:I don't know the situation with self.car so I'll leave it to you to adjust it if it needs it.Side note:If you were doing this on a model that has the ForeignKeyField or OneToOneField on it, you would be able to do the following as a shortcut to avoid the database query.
Use hasattr(self, 'customers') to avoid the exception check as recommended in Django docs:
