I'm converting int to bytes using this command in python:but when I print b I get this value:what is wrong with this piece of code?
The bytes() function documentation points to the bytearray() documentation, which states:The optional source parameter can be used to initialize the array in a few different ways:[....]If it is an integer, the array will have that size and will be initialized with null bytes.You asked for a bytes() object of size 5, initialised to null bytes.You probably want to turn a into a string first:Demo:If you wanted to have the byte value 5 (so the ENQ ASCII control code or whatever else you might want it to mean) you'll need to put it a in a list:(no need to provide an encoding then):
You are creating a byte array of length 5.To get the binary represenation of the number 5 you can use bin()
