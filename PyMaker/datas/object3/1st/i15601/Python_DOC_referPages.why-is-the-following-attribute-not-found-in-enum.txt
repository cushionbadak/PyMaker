I am using Python 2.7.5 and I installed Enum as pip install EnumI have written out the following code to test Enum.This throws me an error saying.AttributeError: type object 'Color' has no attribute '__members__'.Why is python not able to get __members__ ?
You're confusing enum with enum. They have many similarities, but are not the same thing. In particular, the attribute you're looking for does not exist.
You need to use the enum34 backport:
you have to install enum34 to get key value pair
