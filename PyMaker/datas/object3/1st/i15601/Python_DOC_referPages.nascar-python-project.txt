I'm trying to make a python program where 20 cars go random speeds which update every minute (set as a second right now).  It tracks the distance they drive, and the first to 500 miles wins. But, I get this error when I run it: Traceback (most recent call last):  File "E:\Python\NASCAR.py", line 3, in <module>    class Car:  File "E:\Python\NASCAR.py", line 10, in Car    while miles < 500.00:TypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() < float()I'm not sure how to fix this error, so any help is appreciated.
Your while loop crashes on its second evaluation of miles < 500.00, because miles is a float the first time through (which is OK), but None the second (which is absolutely not OK).  This is what the error message was telling you.More specifically, sort doesn't return anything, so miles = mile() assigns to miles the None returned by cardistance.sort().As an aside, your Car class isn't really a class...  At least, it does nothing anyone expects a class to do, and you never use it.  Your entire program runs only as a side-effect of class definition --- in other words, by accident.You probably wanted a function (or several), not a class definition.  Then, later, you would call that function, ideally from main.  Something like:I suggest you re-read the Python Tutorial's "Defining Functions" section.  Then move on to the Python Tutorial's "Classes" chapter, and contrast what you're doing with how classes are typically created and used.
