I am trying to write and read as quickly as Python will let me through the serial port. The problem is that I am writing to fast and it is not working. I believe the problem has to do serial buffer and that I might be over writing my input buffer. Can I increase the input and output buffer? Is their any method or function or flag that tells when the buffer is full, empty, or busy? I am trying send these two command over and over and over as quickly as possible
Yes, you can use the Serial.outWaiting() method to check how much data is still waiting to be sent.I'm not sure exactly how the Serial.write() method behaves, if it just adds the data to the internal buffer before returning. It would have to be that way in order for the above to be needed, but on the other hand there's nonblocking() to make it non-blocking. It's a bit confusing.
The problem may be with the baud rate. You can set up baud rate in the constructor, make sure that both serial link partners are configured:If the delay after write operation works, you may create a wrapper class for serial port interaction, for example:
If you run your code on Windows platform, you simply need to add a line in your codeWhere 12800 is an arbitraery number I chose. You can make receiving(rx) and transmitting(tx) buffer as big as 2147483647See also:https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.htmlhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.ports.serialport.readbuffersize(v=vs.110).aspxYou might be able to setup the serial port from the DLL            // Setup serialProperty ValueType: System.Int32The buffer size, in bytes. The default value is 4096; the maximum value is that of a positive int, or 2147483647And then open and use it in Python
