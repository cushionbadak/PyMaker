Any idea how to sort a list that contains elements of type set ?This is the code I'm using:Example of how my result_list looks like:I would like to sort the list by descending order according to the 2nd element in each tupple of the list elements.The sorted list result should look like
I suggest to use float to map the second element from a string to a number. This will allow sorted to sort by numbers. If you don't use float, sorted will sort the second element as strings.Result:Hint: Don't use set as a name since it is a built-in function.
sortedlst contain the descending sorted elements by second element
