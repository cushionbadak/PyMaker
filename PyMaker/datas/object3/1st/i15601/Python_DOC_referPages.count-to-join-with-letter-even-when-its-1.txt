Natural Text
I want the code above to output the number of times the symbol appears even when the value is '1'.Here is the current output of the code:However, it is missing the values that appear '1' time (i.e.'\')Here is what is stored inside words.txtSo just to clarify the point of this is to output the freaquency that the symbol appears in the file. Any help would be appreciated!
While return true answered your question;You may want to use collections.Counter to find the frequencies.
Change if count > 1: to if count > 0:.
There's really no need for the if at all if you are going to print anything greater than 0.
