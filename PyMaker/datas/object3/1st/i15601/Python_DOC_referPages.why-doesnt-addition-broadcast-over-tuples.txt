E.g., why can't I do:and get:as a result?
Because the + operator is used to make a new tuple that is the combination of two other tuples.  That is just how Python was designed.To do what you want, you can use zip and a generator expression:
'+' operator concatenate tuples . if you want to sum tuples item you can use:or 
Its because of you add tow tuple and + operation for tuples concatenate them ! you can use map and zip functions for that :or use a generator : and a better way with operator.add: 
Since Python thinks of tuples as lists that are immutable, adding two tuples is just like adding two lists. So, just as adding two lists will concatenate them:adding two tuples will also concatenate them:You can create a new tuple that consists of the sum of each pair with a few of Python's built-in functions:This works by using zip() on the two tuples to make a list of pairs:And using map() to apply sum() on each element of that list, to get a list of sums:And, finally, using tuple() to turn that from a list into a tuple.
Element-wise addition is a more specialized operation than concatenation. Fewer tuples could be added together: what would ('a','b') + (1,2,) equal? Or ('a', 'b') + (1,2,3) for that matter?Since concatenation is arguably the more commonly desired operation, and importantly, well defined for all tuples, it makes sense that addition of tuples performs concatenation.
