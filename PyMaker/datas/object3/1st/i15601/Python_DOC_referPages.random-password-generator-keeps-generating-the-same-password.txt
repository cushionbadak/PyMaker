I have to write a program that generates random passwords (using ASCII values and the chr() function) using Python and I have gotten my program to generate a random password, but when the program loops, it keeps printing the same random password and I have no idea what to do to fix it. If anyone could give me some advice, that would be great because I'm new to pythonhere is the code that I have so far:
You never reset position, so your while loop always returns True after the first password is generated.Because you also do not reset password that means you generate just the one random password and re-display that value over and over again.You need to reset both inside the outer while loop:You could just use while True instead of start == stop there. You could also use a for loop instead of your inner while loop, simplifying your setup:Cleaning that up some more by using string.ascii_letters and string.digits:
Once you have been through the loop once, position is equal to LNGTH, so the loop while position<LNGTH: will exit immediately.Set position back to zero and password back to "" inside the outer loop
Your code only generates one password and keeps printing it. That's because it runs the loop while position < LNGTH just once: inside the loop, you increase the position until the password is long enough. But during next iterations, position will be already long enough - so the while loop won't be entered; instead, the already previously generated password will be printed.You have to reset position to zero before entering the while loop.
At that point your program did everytime the same, so without initialising random you get everytime the same random.you should use random.seed() first or even better use random.SystemRandom() if available.
