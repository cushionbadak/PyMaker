I would suggest reading the python documentation:https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html for input and output of files and https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html for the very useful csv module.

I would suggest reading the documentation on writing to files, then coming back, show us your code and see where you went wrong if you run into trouble.
Try this Input:Program:Output:
