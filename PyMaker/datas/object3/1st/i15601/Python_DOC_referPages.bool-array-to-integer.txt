Is there any build in function in python to convert a bool array (which represents bits in a byte) like so:into a byte array like this:I am aware oh numpy but I was looking for something within python itself
This will do what you want:
Just use algebra:
To convert integer strings in different bases, simply use the int() function with anappropriate base.Using generators ([1 if i else 0 for i in p]) have a more performance than map (map(int, p))here !  
Using int, you can convert binary representation to int object (by specifying base 2):
int with base 2 give integer from binary
