I need to define a function called remove_letters(str1,str2) which returns a string obtained by removing from string two every letter occurring in str1So far I have this but It doesn't remove the duplicate letters, it only removes what you put in for it to remove.UpdateI now need to test this function for a variety for strings. When called the code only returns the last result and not the first two. This is my code.
Or in a loop:Both the loop and the list comprehension have the same logic, we keep the chars in str2 that don't appear in str1.Using your own code, you need to iterate over str2 and remove any char from str2_list that  is in str1 then use join on the list to get a string:
You can use str.translate and str.maketrans for this:If you test this solution with timeit.timeit, you will see it is quite efficient:
