Natural Text
I'm having some issues trying to split a string by punctuation. Specifically every character that belongs to string.punctuation. For example for the stringInput: I would like the output:For reference string.punctuation is:I would like any character in the string to be its own token. I've currently tried using re.split(). However, all I've been able to achieve is splitting based on non word characters. For example: which gives the output:Furthermore, the two '??' should be split. Any suggestions? 
You can use re.findall:The pattern above finds all occurrences of ., ?, or a series of one or more word characters.  I kept the pattern simple just to demonstrate, but any other punctuation characters that you want to capture would be placed inside the character set [...].Also, you may want to use string.punctuation instead of typing out all of those punctuation characters.  
for this NLTK exist:I have use a little feature, nltk is vast and powerfull , take a look at it
A little late on this.  You should be able to do this with split().  All you're doing is consuming whitespace, so everything else is between characters.  Example:  \s+|\b|(?=\pP) will split on (and consume) whitespace, or word boundry,or punctuation (within a look ahead).  Don't have Python to test with, but in Perl  gives ['Hi', '.', 'How2', 'are', 'you', 'doing', '?', '?'] For reference, this raw regex is the same thing   but is with the punctuation characters in your list.  Note that the inverse is to find all words and punctuation.  For every split thereis a negative find all ...
