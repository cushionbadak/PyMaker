I am trying to take the users input to create a calculator like idea. I understand how I can take 1 value of input but I don't know how to take 2 values of input "or split" and set them equal to my problem above If the user enters "5 a" it will set 5 as the (newval) value and call to the add function. If the user enters "5 s" it will set 5 as the (newval) value and call to the subtract function and eventually print out the accumulating total.
I don't know how to take 2 values of input "or split" and set them …The way to split a string is with its split method.So:By default, split splits on any whitespace; to split on just a single space, use split(' ').Also, split will return as many values as there are words. This means if the user types 123 + * or 123+, you'll get an exception about trying to unpack 3 or 1 values into 2 targets. You can handle that with a try/except, or you can store the result in a list and check its len, or you can use partition to guarantee that you get exactly two words.
