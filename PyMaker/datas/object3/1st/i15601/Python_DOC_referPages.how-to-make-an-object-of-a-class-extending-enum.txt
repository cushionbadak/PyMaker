I have the following Python class.But when I try to create an object it color = Color()it throws an error telling TypeError: __call__() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)What is the other expected argument.
Per the docstring in the source code (note that this method is defined on the metaclass, EnumMeta):[__call__] is used both when an enum class is given a value to match  to an enumeration member (i.e. Color(3)) and for the functional API  (i.e. Color = Enum('Color', names='red green blue')).The required positional argument value is either one of the values of an existing enumerator, or the name of a new one. This is covered in the documentation here for the former, and here for the latter.
