each game needs 2 pointsI made it really simple just to explain this stuff easilySo to play each game, it requires you to have at least 2 points otherwise it becomes game overif you guess right, you earn 2 pointsif not, you lose 2 points.with the outcome(points), you can either play again or quitif you play again, you pay two pointsHOWEVER, when you play for the second time or more, that lineinitial_p += 2 and initial_p -= 2 still have points that you typed in the very beginningI'm so confused right now I can't even explain rightBut if you understand my explanation, Please help meThank You
The quick and dirty response is to change to the following. Basically, you're placing the global variable as a local variable and reassigning the global. This should also happen at the very bottom as well. Also, you can just ask for the input inside of the function, and have a default argument of initial_p. For example,And modify some global point value or something from the return. Sorry if this is sloppy, was written on my mobile.
