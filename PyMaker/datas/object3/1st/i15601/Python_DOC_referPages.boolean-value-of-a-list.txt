I made a function and my result is a list:Now I need to return a boolean value. If all of the elements are 2 or higher, I need to return True otherwise I need to return false. In this case it would be : True. ( Because all the elements are 3 and 3 > 2)Is there any code to do this quickly?I tried to make a FOR - loop like:I think this is correct but I want to know if there is a faster method.thanks in advance!
Make a generator (generator expression here) that yields booleans and pass it to all function:I see you posted your code, it's not correct as it will only check the first element of the list. You can fix it:
Output: Trueor in a more condensed wayOutput: True
If you have to define your own function.It also is a fast solution because if the first condition is false, the entire and returns false.
