When I try to run the following heartbleed code, it throws a syntax error. I am new to python. I have tried to find the syntax error, but failed. I am using python 2.6.The error is:root@bt:~/Desktop# python heartbleed.py File "heartbleed.py", line 238    if (opts.starttls) or (port in {25, 587, 110, 143, 21}):                                      ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Please try Convert it to tuple.
is Python 3 syntax. It creates a set, and the direct Python 2.x equivalent code would bethough any sequence type would do (e.g. Lafada's answer), but you might well find the rest of the code has bits that aren't backwards compatible with in Python 2.xEdit: I'm wrong. As per @jpmc26's comment, it's Python 3 syntax but also backported to Python 2.7+
