Natural Text
I have the following string:I want to pull out the value "Mini-Series", without anything before or after it. This is what I have so far:How would I only get the "TV Mini-Series" text?
If you want to search based on Mini-Series and want 'TV Mini-Series you can put a possible leading with a space in your pattern .so as TV is upper case letters [A-Z]* could match any combine of uppercase letters before Mini-Series! 
Using re.search would be better suited to this:
Regex seems like an overkill when you can simply use str.split:
re.match(r'.+ (TV Mini-Series)', x).group(1)  => 'TV Mini-Series'Note: you want to use group(1) because group(0) is defined to capture the whole string
