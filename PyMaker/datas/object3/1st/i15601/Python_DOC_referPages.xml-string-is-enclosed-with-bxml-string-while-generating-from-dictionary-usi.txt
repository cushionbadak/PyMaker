I am using dicttoxml module for converting dictionary into xml. Code:Output:I do not know why it is enclosed with b' '. How to generate xml string without this b''?Browser is also giving error msg when opening xml file with this content. 
That is the normal represenation of a String that is not Unicode in Python 3. Try this in the Python shell:So everything is OK. You don't have a problem.See also str vs bytes.Edit:See how encoding and decoding works.So just use my_byte_string.decode(my_encoding)  where my_encoding is probably "UTF-8".
Library author here.It appears you're using Python 3. Python 3 stores strings in binary format unless you specify an encoding.Continuing with your example code, to convert xml from a string of bytes to a string of characters, use the decode method:Cheers!
