Natural Text
I have written a python text adventure game and the final thing I want to add is a counter to count the amount of turns taken that will be displayed at the end of the game.It only needs to count every time the player inputs something but Im not sure how to code this and its a bit embarrassing as im sure this will be a very simple solution im using python 3.4.1
Without seeing an example of your code, it's pretty much impossible to tell you anything specific that will work in your code.But I can give you something general that you can probably adapt to fit your code.Now, anywhere in your code that you call input(), you instead call counted_input.input().And when you want to display the turn counter, that's just counted_input.counter.(If you're using Python 2.x, change input to raw_input.)Now that you've added an example to the question:This suggestion will work just fine as it is, but you can make things even simpler.Your whole game is built around a command loop. You call input exactly once per loop. So, all you need to do is count how many times you go around that loop. You can do that like this:And now, you just print out or otherwise use counter the same as any other variable. For example:(I'm guessing that you don't actually want to troll your players with a score command when you don't keep score, but that should show you the ideal.)If you want to get clever, there's an even simpler way to do this: Just loop over all the numbers from 1 to infinity. How? The count function, which works kind of like range except there's no stop value because it never stops:
I know many would probably not like this idea, as I have seen conflicting views on global variable use, however I would use a global variable for turn count storage and a global function to track it. For example:Then, when an action is taken, you could do:I believe you need to have include the global in your function, however.Example:
