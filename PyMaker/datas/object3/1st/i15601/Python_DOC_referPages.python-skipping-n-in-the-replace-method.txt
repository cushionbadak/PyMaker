Natural Text
The below json,this is from where I read data->=======================================================================================    there are two possible things any of which will do either   Possible solution 1) :   if the replace method works inside loop  I am trying to do a replace at two  places, the replace function with the raw string notation works for  the above variable json_input_string but the same replace fails when  I try to do so inside the loop of list1.(list1 has data in the unicode format like this [u' set variable Text '  ' ',u'expression Text ' ' in table'] Moreover most of the python read  write functions I have tried so far fail when I need '\n' to be kept  in the replacement string.)   OR   Possible Solution 2)   If the json_input_string can give me data in desired format   when i print json_input_string it gives me the output as below even though its type is 'str':some have single quotes and some have double quotes. I want to convert  this string into an output without single/double quotes like this and  write to a file.
m = str(c).replace(...) the new string is in m, not c. Python strings are immutable.
Thanks a lot guys for the help .luckily i got the answer . I was  thinking ,because i don't see '\n' as text it is not there but it  just shifts to a new line so if i just change my replace method fromalso you need to hold this replace inside a loop by assigning the replace value to a variableit works fine :).thanks for your efforts
