I replaced all "2" with "3" cause i am working with python3.4After i made this i always got the error above. Did i destroy any path? How can i undo it? Thank u for your help
When looking at the Python 3 documentation on "Extending Python with C or C++" we see thatThe initialization function must be named PyInit_name(), where name is the name of the module, and should be the only non-static item defined in the module file.(https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html#the-module-s-method-table-and-initialization-function)This means that we cannot just change the file name of the module without changing the init function. We have to compile the module with the final name in the first place. Renaming the .so file after compiling it will not work.
