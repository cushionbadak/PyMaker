Why does this code print [None, None, None, None]?
Because print returns None?So, the print is done (4, 5, 6, 7,) and then the list comprehension is returned ([None, None, None, None])What you want to do is use join:or use the sep argument of print (I don't have python3 right now but something like this:)
print is a function but it return None that's why you are getting noneDo thisso when you do this print prints i 1, 2, 3, 4, and then each time list comprehension return the output which is None hence None, None, None, None
