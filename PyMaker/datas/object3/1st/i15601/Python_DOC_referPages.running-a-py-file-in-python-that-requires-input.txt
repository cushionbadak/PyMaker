the question I have is really a simple one, and maybe the issue is just myself not knowing the correct parameters for python with Linux. The file I am running uses input from the operator both to run the program, and also to get the information to convert, which I will place below:The issue when I run this in python as "python GalaxyConverter.py, the following error appears: It seems the issue is that the file does not know to take the command I put into the terminal as input for the python file. May I ask what I should do to fix this? The Entire Code is below: 
In python 3, you can just use input in your example, it can input strings.But in python 2, the same function is raw_input.input function in Python 2 is equals to eval(raw_input(prompt)), it will evaluate input string as a Python expression.Obviously your running python version is python 2, but I don't know what the code's python version is. But you need to modify all input to raw_input if it is python version is 2.Ref:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#inputhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
