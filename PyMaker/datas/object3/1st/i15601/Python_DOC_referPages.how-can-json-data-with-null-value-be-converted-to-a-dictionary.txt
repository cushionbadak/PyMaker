I have JSON data which looks like this. If not for null (without quotes as a string), I could have used ast module's literal_eval to convert the above to a dictionary. A dictionary in Python cannot have null as value but can have "null" as a value. How do I convert the above to a dictionary that Python recognizes?
You should use the built-in json module, which was designed explicitly for this task:By the way, you should use this method even if your JSON data contains no null values.  While it may work (sometimes), ast.literal_eval was designed to evaluate Python code that is represented as a string.  It is simply the wrong tool to work with JSON data.
