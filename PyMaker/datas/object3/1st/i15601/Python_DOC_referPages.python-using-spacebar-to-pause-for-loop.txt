Natural Text
I am looking for a way to pause the for loop below when the user presses [spacebar] and then continue the loop from the most recent iteration when [spacebar] is pressed again. Currently, the script prompts the user for three values and then prints words from a text file at timed intervals until there are no words remaining.What would be the best way to go about this? Thanks very much.
Here is partial answer to you question (part about space is not answered, however please read to the end, there are some hints).I adapted answer from here Non-blocking read on a subprocess.PIPE in python .With this user will be able to pause/resume reading with pressing Enter button.For space you can try to use recipes from this answer How to get user input during a while loop without blocking...or use some console ui (curses, urwid, ...) or gui (tkinter, pyqt, ...) modules.
