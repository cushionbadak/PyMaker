I am currently working on a program which handles a number of different possible entry widgets in a Python program.I need some code to be able to determine what type of widget a particular object is, for example Entry or Checkbutton.I have tried using the type(var) method to no avail (I get the error missing required variable self) as well as the var.__class__ and I am making no progress.Does anyone have any idea of how I can solve this?
If you need the name as a string, you can use the .winfo_class() method:Or, you could access the __name__ attribute:That said, using isinstance is a more common/pythonic approach:Also, your current code is failing because type(d).__name__ does not return what you think it does:Notice that it returns the name of the type object returned by type, not the name of Checkbutton.
