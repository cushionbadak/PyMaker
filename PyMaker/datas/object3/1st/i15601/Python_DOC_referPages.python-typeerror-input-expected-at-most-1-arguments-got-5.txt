When I am trying to input get a number into the system I get an error.That is the code in question and the error entails this:I have no idea why please help!!!
This is five arguments being passed to input:Use the str.format method to provide a single string to input.
input expects a single string, not 5 arguments.You can use the format function to generate your string using these variables.
The error pretty clear... You're passing 5 arguments:Coming from Java, are we? :-)If you want to display variables in an string in python, you can take a look to string formatting (what other answers use) or you could also do:Also, if you're running this using Python 2.x (any version less than 3) I strongly recommend using raw_input instead of input. Input will eval the user's input as python code, and eval is evil!
Although print optionally takes multiple argument, input doesn't.You either need to use the format function - userInput= int(input("What is {} - {} = ?".format(RanNum1, RanNum2)), or add the values userInput= int(input("What is" + str(RanNum1) + " - " + str(RanNum2) + " = ?")) (the first option there is best).
