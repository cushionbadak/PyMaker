I'm fairly new to Python.  I have a list of dictionaries.I want to extract the values associated with the x key and plot them.  To do that the list must look like this, and the values must be integers (or floats).My question is: how do I extract these values, and convert them to integers?
This can be done using a list comprehension using the dictionary's get method.If you'd like them as integers, convert them in the list comprehension
Use a list comprehension. For each item get "x" and cast to int:If you need floats change int to float. 
You can use list comprehensionor map
