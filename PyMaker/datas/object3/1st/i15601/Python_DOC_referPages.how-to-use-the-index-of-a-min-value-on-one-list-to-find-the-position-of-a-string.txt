I am currently trying write a function to use the position of a min value on one list to reference a string on another list.I have two list, one with states names and another with floats.  I am using the min method to get the minimum value of the float list.  The problem is, how I use an index to mark the position of that value then use it to return the state that holds the same position on the other list?This is the code I am currently using, but it does not go all the way through the list before it returns a value, which is way too soon in the list.
This is a bit terse to read, but here is an alternative way to do it. You can use min to find the minimum value in values. Then you can use index to find the index at which the minimum occurs in the list. You can then use that returned index to index the correct element from states.
Try this:This first builds a list of pairs, each having a value as first item and its index as second item.  So when you find the minimum, the first item still has the main impact (the index will only be taken into account if the values are equal).  Taking the index is then done using [1] in the end.
Not entirely sure what you are asking, but a dictionary might be a better choice. Also setting heartcount=0 inside the loop resets the variable back to 0 each iteration. Check your variables inside the loop.
