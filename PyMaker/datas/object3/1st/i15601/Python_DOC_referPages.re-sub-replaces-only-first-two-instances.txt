I have found this interesting issue with re.sub:Notice how only the first two instances were replaced. It seems that adding the [implicit] argument name for flags fixes the issue. I was wondering if anyone could explain it or it is in fact a bug.I've encountered this issue before with the missing argument name string but never for flags and with string it usually blows up.
The fourth argument to re.sub is not flags but count:This means that you need to explicitly do flags=re.IGNORECASE or otherwise re.IGNORECASE will be treated as an argument to count.  Additionally, the re.IGNORECASE flag is equal to 2:So, by doing count=re.IGNORECASE in your first example, you told re.sub to only replace 2 occurrences of : in the string, which it did.
