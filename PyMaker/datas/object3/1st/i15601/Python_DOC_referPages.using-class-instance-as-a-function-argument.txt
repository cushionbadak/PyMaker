Suppose I have something like:Is there anyway to have it so that the changes to pet.weight are not transferred to my_dog.weight?I want the function to be able to take information from a class instance, perform calculations, and then leave the original instance unchanged.
You are reassigning the value of the pet.weight attribute on this line:Doing this affects the pet instance even after the code has returned from the feed function.To fix the problem, simply create a local name that is equal to pet.weight + 5 and work with that instead:Now, we use the value of pet.weight but avoid changing it.Also, you have defined your class incorrectly.  By doing this:you have made name and weight to be class attributes of Dog.  This means that their values will be shared among all instances of Dog and modifying them will affect all instances.  In other words, all of your Dogs will have the same name and weight.But then you do:which overshadows the class attribute name with an instance attribute of the same name.  Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are unique to each instance of a class.  So, weight is still a class attribute (shared by all Dogs) while name is now an instance attribute (unique to each Dog).I think it would be best if you removed those lines and wrote the Dog class like so:Now, name and weight are both instance attributes. Each Dog has a unique name and weight and changing either of those values on one Dog will no longer affect the other Dogs.For more information on this, you can check out these sources:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htmlhttp://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
