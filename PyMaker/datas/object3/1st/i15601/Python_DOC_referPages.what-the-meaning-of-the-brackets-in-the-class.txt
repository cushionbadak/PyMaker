In python, when I read others' code, I meet this situation where a class is defined and after it there is a pair of brackets.I don't know what is the meaning of '(SearchAgent)',because what I usually meet and use doesn't seem that.
It indicates that AStarFoodSearchAgent is a subclass of SearchAgent. It's part of a concept called inheritance.What is inheritance?Here's an example. You might have a Car class, and a RaceCar class. When implementing the RaceCar class, you may find that it has a lot of behavior that is very similar, or exactly the same, as a Car. In that case, you'd make RaceCar a subclass ofCar`.We didn't define get_number_of_wheels on RaceCar, and still, it exists, and returns 4 when called. That's because RaceCar has inherited get_number_of_wheels from Car. Inheritance is a very nice way to reuse functionality from other classes, and override or add only the functionality that needs to be different.Your ExampleIn your example, AStarFoodSearchAgent is a subclass of SearchAgent. This means that it inherits some functionality from SearchAgemt. For instance, SearchAgent might implement a method called get_neighbouring_locations(), that returns all the locations reachable from the agent's current location. It's not necessary to reimplement this, just to make an A* agent.What's also nice about this, is that you can use this when you expect a certain type of object, but you don't care about the implementation. For instance, a find_food function may expect a SearchAgent object, but it wouldn't care about how it searches. You might have an AStarFoodSearchAgent and a DijkstraFoodSearchAgent. As long as both of them inherit from SearchAgent, find_food can use Ã¬sinstanceto check that the searcher it expects behaves like aSearchAgent. Thefind_food`function might look like this:Old/Classic Style ClassesUpto Python 2.1, old-style classes were the only type that existed. Unless they were a subclass of some other class, they wouldn't have any parenthesis after the class name.New style classes always inherit from something. If you don't want to inherit from any other class, you inherit from object.New style classes unify python types and classes. For instance, the type of 1, which you can obtain by calling type(1) is int, but the type of OldStyleClass() is instance, with new style classes, type(NewStyleCar) is Car. 
SearchAgent is the superclass of the class AStarFoodSearchAgent. This basically means that an AStarFoodSearchAgent is a special kind of SearchAgent.
It means that class AStarFoodSearchAgent extends SearchAgent.Check section 9.5 herehttps://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html
This is inheritance in python, just like in any other OO languagehttps://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance
It means that SearchAgent is a base class of AStarFoodSearchAgent. In other word, AStarFoodSearchAgent inherits from SearchAgent class.See Inheritance - Python tutorial.
