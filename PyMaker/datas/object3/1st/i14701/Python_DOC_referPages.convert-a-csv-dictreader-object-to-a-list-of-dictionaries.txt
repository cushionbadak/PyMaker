A csv file names.csv has content:I would like to read it into a list of dictionaries, with the first row containing the keys:But is the type of reader csv.DictReader? How can I convert reader into a list of dictionaries?Thanks.
If the delimiter is not actually a , you need to specify " " or whatever it is.Just to clear any confusion, the code works fine for python3.6 also, the only difference is that using DictReader gives Orderdicts by default:You can access keys exactly the same, an OrderedDict just keeps key insertion order:Which py3.6 actually does too, so if for some reason you really want a dict:The ordering retention on insertion in py3.6 is an implementation detail and may change, but if enough of us use it, it may just have to stay :)
Use list():Demo:
