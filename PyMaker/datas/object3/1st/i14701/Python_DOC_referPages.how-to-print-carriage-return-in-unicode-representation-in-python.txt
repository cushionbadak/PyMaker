Natural Text
I use python 2.7, in the following testI got resultsSome starts with an \u but some doesn't.How do I print \r as \u000D? or '1' as \u0031?
What you need is the ordinal of the character, or its position in the character table. This is returned by 'ord'. For more information please see: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#ord and https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.htmlCarriage return is 13 (please see: http://www.theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-control-characters/carriage-return-ascii-code-13.html ) by ord(u'\r') (or 0xD in hex)And '中' is 20013 (please see: http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=4E2D) by ord(u'中')If you want it expressed in hexadecimal you could do something like '%04X' % ord(u'中') which will return 4E2D.Hope this helps.
