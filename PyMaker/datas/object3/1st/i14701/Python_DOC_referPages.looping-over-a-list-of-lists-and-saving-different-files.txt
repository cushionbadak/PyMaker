Natural Text
I have a list in python with 4 elements that are all themselves lists of lines ( text)I want to save those elements in numbered filenames.I get the error message :Any hint what i can do to fix it ?
If you are iterating through your textblock with for n in textblock:, then n will take the value of each item in textblock (so n is a list). Then if you try and get textblock[n], then you are trying to use the list n as an index.You can just have:Don't try and close ffile -- it is closed automatically by the with block.If you want to use the index in the file name, I think what you want is something like this:enumerate will give you the index and the items as you iterate through the list.
You can use enumerateNotewith open will take care of close().for i in [1,2,3] gives 1,2,3 in each iteration.No need of [1,2,3][i]
Let's clarify your data structure. It sounds like this:So let's use python's iterable for loop structure to traverse the outer list.But we want to write the contents of each inner_list to a file, using the position of the inner_list in the outer_list. Let's use the built in enumerate() function to get the position.Let's examine writing the inner_list to a file.All together that would be:EDIT: There is one more step needed here, as pointed out by @mhawkeThe write() method requires it to be passed a string. We can convert our inner_list to a string quite easily. My preferred method would be to use the join() method. We can specify that we join each string in inner_list with a new line character, so that it will print nicely, i.e.Therefore our final solution would be:
If you want to write lists of lists use the csv module:
