If I print a datetime object in python with a simple print myDateTime (or print(myDateTime) in python3), how can I recover the datetime object from the resulting string?I could have asked "what is the python strftime format used by datetime.__str__()"?ps: There are many questions about conversion of strings to python datetime objects. In the spirit of using stack overflow as a repository of quickly available, useful programming tips, I'm asking this since none of those questions answer this rather specific and oft needed query.
By definition, str(datetime_obj) is datetime_obj.isoformat(' '). There is no method that would parse the ISO 8601 format back; you have to provide the format to strptime() explicitly:%z supports +HHMM but it doesn't support +HH:MM that is why the replace() call is used here.datetime.timezone is available since Python 3.2. For older versions, see How to parse ISO formatted date in python?Convert timestamps with offset to datetime obj using strptime.
If the datetime object doesn't have timezone info (perhaps interpreted as UTC time), you can do something like this (python 2 in this case, but the same in python 3):
