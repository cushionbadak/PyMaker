This question already has an answer here:Bare asterisk in function arguments?                    3 answers                I know the meaning and usage of *args. But sometimes there is nothing like args after the *. For example, in the function pprintthere is an * in the signature. What does it mean?
Arguments after the * are keyword-only. The * "soaks up" any additional positional arguments, so if you defined:then calling:wouldn't work, as no z is supplied and only two positional arguments are expected:z must now be supplied by keyword:You can do this with a standard *args, but using * makes it clear that you don't want any additional positional arguments and causes an error to be raised if any end up in the *. As the PEP puts it:The second syntactical change is to allow the argument name to  be omitted for a varargs argument. The meaning of this is to  allow for keyword-only arguments for functions that would not  otherwise take a varargs argument
