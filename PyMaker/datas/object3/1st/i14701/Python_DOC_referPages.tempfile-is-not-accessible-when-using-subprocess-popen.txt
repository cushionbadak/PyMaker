When I run the following script, the error"Command line argument error: Argument "query". File is not accessible" occurs. I'm using python 3.4.2.
f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() returns a file-like object which you're trying to provide as a command line argument. Instead, you want the actual filename which is available via its .name attribute - although I'm somewhat confused why you're creating a tempfile, writing to it, seeking back to position 0, then replacing your tempfile f object with the contents of the file? I suspect you don't want to do that replacement and use f.name for your query.Also, there's some convenient wrapper functions around subprocess.Popen such as subprocess.check_output which are also somewhat more explicit as to your intent which could be used here instead.
