Natural Text
Hello to divine people with knowledge about Python.I'm currently studying Python 3.4 and have encountered a problem.About the load function, even when I used this function with the correct txtfile name an error appears.Looks like Python cannot find where the text.txt is..Can someone please tell me how to set a directory of a function? Thank you.
You are probably looking for os.chdir(path). Alternatively, you could use os.path.join(path, *paths) to dynamically build the absolute path to hand over to the open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None) function. It could also be that your text.txt file is not in the same directory as your 030415.py file (F:/CSSE1001/Assignments/SunMum).Update: There are several ways you can load an entire file.If you want to read all of a file as text, you can write data = open('text.txt', 'rt').read()If you want to get all of a file's binary data, you can use data = open('text.txt', 'rb').read()If you want the lines of a file, a simple way to get them would be with lines = tuple(open('text.txt', 'rt'))If you want the lines without the newlines, you could type lines = open('text.txt', 'rt').read().split('\n')If you want to process the lines efficiently while avoiding newlines, you could use for line in (line.strip('\n') for line in open('text.txt', 'rt')): to start a for loop.If you are working with comma-separated values, you probably should look at the documentation for the csv module available with Python.
