Is there any prettier way to write this if-statement:I've tried this, but it didn't work.Or maybe the first one is the prettiest?
You can use any and a generator expression:Or, if you prefer all instead of any:The first solution seems to read a little better though.As for why your attempted solution did not work, the or operator in Python does not behave as you think it does.  From the docs:The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value  is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.So, self.is_legal(l or r or d or u) was only passing the first truthy value to the self.is_legal method, not all of them.
An empty list in Python is false.You can produce an empty list with a comprehension and a conditional like so:
You can use a tuple or set: Extending this idea a bit further: Or using the fact that an empty list or set or whatever is false: I guess it all depends on what you consider to be "pretty".
