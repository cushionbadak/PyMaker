I wonder whatÂ´s the best and fastest way to count the number of occurrences of a particular object (user-defined class instance) in a Python list?For instance if we have a class called MyClassand a list myList consisting of six elements:we could count the number of occurrences of an object which is a MyClass instance by iterating myList and using the isinstance() function:But is there any better or more pythonic way to do this?

It sounds like you're asking for a filter:
