I am trying to execute a c program with an input string argument on a python script. But I am getting a type error. p -> is a string variablevuln -> is a c binary that I can execute fine using the terminalThis is the line that is giving the error:TypeError: system() argument 1 must be string without null bytes, not strThanksUpdate:This is the complete code
You don't need the escaped double-quotes.should work fine.Please note that if you'd like to read output from vuln, or interact with it in any way, you'd be much better off using the subprocess module.
Your input string is all messed upThe extra backspaces are escape characters, and you do not want those here
