Given a tuple containing a bunch of integer elements, how can one find the sum of all the elements?For example, if I have a list of tuples:How can I get something like this:where 3, 4 and 5 is the total sum of each of the three tuples respectively?
You can use map and sum function like thisAlternatively you can use list comprehension, like thisNote: I personally prefer the list comprehension version, because map function in Python 3.x will return an iterable map object, which needs to be explicitly converted to a list, like this list(map(sum, li)).But list comprehension will give a list in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
You could use list comprehension.
For beginner:Create result variable which type is list.Iterate every item from the give list by for loop.As every item is tuple so again iterate item from the step 2 and set sum of item to 0.Add sum.Append sum to result variable.Demo:
