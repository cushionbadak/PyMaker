I'm designing a tic tac toe game in python that times how long it takes the user to beat three levels and then saves this score to a file called 'Player Times.txt'. I want to rank the times each player gets to go from low => high.So this is what happens when you beat the three levels. You can then look at the leaderboard but it just prints out all the times that have been written to the file. What could I do to rank these times?
Fortunately, you're writing a nice, neat file for easy parsing. It will look something like this:That means we can do this:First, we sort the opened file (it's an iterable, so we can do this directly), using the score as the sort key. We'll use lambda to define an inline function that takes a parameter, which will be each line in the file. The score is after the string "'s time is " and before the last two characters, ".\n", so we cut off the last two characters, split the remaining string on "'s time is ", and turn that into a float. sorted() will use this number to determine the proper order.This gives us something very similar to the original file object: a list of strings, only this time they're properly sorted. A quick way to nicely print a list of strings is to unroll the list with *, and since there's already a newline at the end of each line, we'll tell print() to use an empty string as the separator instead of the usual space.Result:The default ascending order that sorted() uses works here, but if you want to sort from high to low (a game with points, for example), you can pass the keyword argument reverse=True, e.g. sorted(['a', 'bbb', 'cc'], key=len, reverse=True) to produce ['bbb', 'cc', 'a'].
