I have a time String like thisï¼šI use this command line to convert it:But this returns:ValueError: time data '07/01/2015-14:31:58.520' does not match format  '%d/%m/%y-%H:%M:S.%f'My python version is 2.7.7
%y denotes a 2 digit year, but your string has a 4 digit year.  Use %Y (capital Y) to denote a 4 digit year.  See the docs for more information.Note that datetime.strptime may be more useful, as it will return a full datetime object rather than a tuple.  The format syntax is essentially the same.
It should have been capital Y for year (%Y in place of %y)
You need to use %Y instead of %y
To get a datetime object, use python-dateutilTo installThenAll operations to datetime objects is possible.
the time.strptime syntax %d/%m/%y-%H:%M:%S.%f is incorrect, it should be"%d/%m/%Y-%H:%M:%S.%f"where the only difference is that %y has become %Y. The reason is because from  the docs  %y is without century number ( [00,99] ), whereas %Y is with century number, which is the syntax you use with "2015"Tested and functinal in python 2.7.5 and 3.4.1Edit: Zero answers when I started typing this, 6 answers by time of post, sorry about that!Edit #2: datetime.strptime functions similarly, so if you want to use that as well, you can!
