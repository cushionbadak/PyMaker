I'm new to Python and I keep getting this error:when I try to run this code:What am I doing wrong?
This line is your problem:Python interprets what's in those square brackets as a key to get an item from what's just before themâ€”in this case, getting the item with key "ram", "bak", ... from list. And, of course, the list class isn't a container and doesn't have any items!Remove the leading list, and you get a list literal, which is probably what you want.See the documentation on lists for more information on how to create them.See also the official Python style guide, which statesnames that would otherwise collide with keywords or builtins (like list) should have single underscores appended rather than being mangled (list_ instead of lst or lizt), except in the case of clscontainer literals and function calls should have spaces after the commas ("ram", "bak" instead of "ram","bak")
To define a list,or but list is a type, which you can call with parenthesis but you can't get an item from list using the square brackets.
