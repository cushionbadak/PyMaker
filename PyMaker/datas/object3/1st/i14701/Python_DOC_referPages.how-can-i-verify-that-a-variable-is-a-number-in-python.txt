I am writing a code on the subject of engineering which requires the user to input several values which the program will then work with.At the moment I have the following code:In simple terms I am trying to ask the user to enter a value for strainx which is a number. If the user enters anything other than a number then the question will be repeated until they enter a number. However, by using this method the code does not accept decimals and there will be instances where the user must enter a decimal. Is there any way around this?
Just try casting to a float and catching a ValueError if the user enters something that cannot be cast:casting to float covers both "1" a "1.123" etc..If you don't want to accept zero you can check after casting is the number is zero, I presume negative numbers are also invalid so we can check if the number is not <= 0. 
If you insist of using regex, this pattern appears to work:Match optional negative sign, match any number of digits, optional decimal with any number of digits.Tip: You can use isnumber = bool(re.match(num_format,strainx) or the latter part directly into the if statement.
If you are looking for Integer check then try this - If it returns True then the variable is number else it's something else.But if you want to check if the character value is number or not. eg - a = "2"above script will return False.So try this - 
If you are using Python 2, instead of using regular expressions, you can use Python's in built type checking mechanisms.Let's loop while strainx is not a number, then check whether the latest input is a number.
