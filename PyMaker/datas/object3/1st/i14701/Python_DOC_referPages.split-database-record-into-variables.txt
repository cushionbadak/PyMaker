I have a function to search for a line in a database where id code/name matches and then loads the record e.g. [(1, 'John', 'Smith', 30)]I am using python and how can I split this list into individual varaiblese.g.Sorry I am new to this and this is probably very simple to implement. This is what I have so far:Thanks for your time in helping :)
Assuming you're using sqlite3, it has a nifty row factory built in that lets you access the rows as if they were dictionaries, with the column names as keys:I know this isn't exactly what you asked for, but it's usually what you actually want. Creating variables dynamically is a bad idea. If you really want to, though, the answer is the same as dumping any mapping into the local scope, which you can search for if you must.If you'd prefer attribute-style access (like a.ID) to dict-style access (like a['ID']), that's pretty simple. (But remember that not every valid SQL column name is a valid Python identifier!)The most efficient way to do this is probably to create a namedtuple out of the description:If you're using MySQL, I don't know if any of the MySQL libraries provide the equivalent of Row, but it's not hard to build yourself by using the description property of a cursor, the same way we build a namedtuple out of it. For example:Unlike the special Row factory, which is specific to sqlite3, Cursor.description is required by the DB-API 2.0 spec.
