In the C header file I have:I am trying to set and pass all the parameters in the Python and pass them to callAndSave:But I am getting "output parameter is NULL" error for pointerParam. How should I define "___OUT_ char* pointerParam" in Python correctly?
The ___OUT_ in the specification generally means that this pointer will have data written to it. So you must allocate a buffer to write to. ctypes.c_char_p() doesn't make a buffer - it's just a null pointer.Look into ctypes.create_string_buffer. You must figure out yourself how big of a buffer callAndSave expects.
