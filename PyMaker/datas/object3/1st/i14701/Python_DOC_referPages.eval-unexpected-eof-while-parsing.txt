So I'm trying to get two inputs that separate usernames by credit hours and every time after I've exited the loop I get an unexpected EOF.Specifically the error I get is:I'm not sure if it's related (or if it's just something I'm overlooking) but I have to enter through Credit in order to exit the loop. Shouldn't the loop exit after pressing enter when Student comes up due to the AND operator?edit: added classify func. I don't think this is the problem though, I've tried removing it and it still brings me back to the EOF.
You shouldn't be using eval() to turn a string into an integer. Use int instead.Credits must still be entered even after skipping the student name because the while condition is only evaluated before going into the code block, not after every statement in the block. If you want it to stop immediately when the user skips the student or credit value, do this:And, of course, use input for Python 3, and raw_input for Python 2.
