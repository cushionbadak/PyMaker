I'm using Enum4 library to create an enum class as follows:I want to print [1, 2] as a list somewhere. How can I achieve this?
You can use IntEnum:To get list of the ints:
You can do the following:
To use Enum with any type of value, try this:Updated with some improvements... Thanks @Jeff, by your tip!As result:
So the Enum has a __members__ dict. The solution that @ozgur proposed is really the best, but you can do this, which does the same thing, with more work[color.value for color_name, color in Color.__members__.items()]The __members__ dictionary could come in handy if you wanted to insert stuff dynamically in it... in some crazy situation.[EDIT]Apparently __members__ is not a dictionary, but a map proxy. Which means you can't easily add items to it.You can however do weird stuff like MyEnum.__dict__['_member_map_']['new_key'] = 'new_value', and then you can use the new key like MyEnum.new_key.... but this is just an implementation detail, and should not be played with. Black magic is payed for with huge maintenance costs.
class enum.Enum is a class that solves all your enumeration needs, so you just need to inherit from it, and add your own fields. Then from then on, all you need to do is to just call it's attributes: name & value:
Based on the answer by @Jeff, refactored to use a classmethod so that you can reuse the same code for any of your enums:Produces:
