The title is very explicit. i have a dict (very very big dict), and a it has this:so, orderItems is a dict, inside it has entries that is a list and inside it haslinks, what i need to get is the href inside orderi´m getting the list with: orderlink = json_response["orderItems"]["entries"]but i´m not very sure how to go through the list to find the href. Maybe with in.Thanks.
To access elements in a list, you have to use numeric indexes, or process all of them.The best thing probaly is to use a for loop in there, that will guarantee you will iterate over  all entries on the list:that will give you a list with only the desired URLs
Supposing that you have that JSON structure I will use this code to solve your problem:You need to pay attention to the dictionary structure in order to access to the field correctly. Before using this code, please pay read about dictionaries in the Python3 documentation.
