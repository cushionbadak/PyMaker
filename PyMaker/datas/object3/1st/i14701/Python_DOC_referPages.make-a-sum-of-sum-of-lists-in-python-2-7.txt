This is my whole code for a work in progress:Decoding the list:nList has multiple traces with trace1 having two points, trace2 having no points, trace3 having 1 point and so one. each point in the trace is made up of three elements [x co-ordinate, y co-ordinate, time.At the end of this whole code, I need to print the sum(sum(lengthList)), and this formula obviously doesn't work. Problem is, I have also tried print map(sum(sum, lengthList)), print sum(sum(lengthList)) and none of them have worked. It also has to be a function and not just a print as the nList needs to work for multiple lists of a similar nature. Thanks for the help!
I've made two modifications.Change length_list outside the function.at the end you can have this
This should help you from the "float object not iterable" error ! Edit:Declare the below, above the forloop  lengthList=[]and in the last else part of the for loop  lengthList.append(sum(float(x) for x in lengths(trace)))Out side the for loop  print [sum(float(x) for x in lengthList)]Good Luck!
You could use a list comprehension:This would sum the points values in lengthList, and then return the sum of those sums. Or as @soon pointed out, a generator:Although if you want to use any list methods, you should use the list comprehension.
just take a list lengthList = [] and enter element by  extendyou can change simple in your code in last for loopOutput
If you just want to calculate the total length of all traces, you should firstly calculate the lengths of all traces:As you can see, we skip traces with zero or one points.The next step is calculating the total length. You could just pass generator expression to sum function:Actually, you could remove the condition if len(trace) > 1, since sum works with empty lists pretty well:You could also use imap function (which returns iterator) instead of map (which returns list) for saving memory.
