I am implementing a linked list in Python 3. I am trying to get output such as "1  2  3" with two spaces in between. My current code prints out "1  2  3  " instead:How do I get rid of the last two spaces?
In Python you would typically use str.join() to build a string from a collection of items with some constant separator. This takes care of the problem of having an extra separator at one or the other end of your string.But you need to give str.join() an iterable. Judging by what you've shown of your code, you should be able to make this class iterable by defining the __iter__ method as something like:For more details about the yield keyword and iterables, I recommend reading What does the "yield" keyword do in Python?.Note also that PEP 8 recommends using is not None rather than != None:Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or  is not, never the equality operatorsOnce the linked list is iterable, your string representation is as easy as:Keep in mind when writing __str__ methods that you should return a string object, not print one in the body of the method.
Just a blind guess:Would you mind sharing your linked list implementation?
