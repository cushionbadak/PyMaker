I am trying to write a function eliminate that takes a string and 2 optional arguments. The first optional argument (bad_characters) takes a letter and the third argument (case_sensitive) takes a Boolean value. The function should take a string s and remove all instances of bad_characters. If case_sensitive is true, then the function should act case sensitive. If false, then it does not need to. This is what I have so far.I am having a hard time figuring out how to make the function remove upper case letters if needed. The function should also work if bad_characters is a list, tuple, or string.
Your problem is miss understanding about str.replace because it just replace one character so you need to loop over bad_characters and remove them one by one.SO instead of using == you can just use in operand,for check the membership, and then remove character from your string :And as a more pythonic way for remove a special characters from string you can use str.translate method :
You can use a very handy str.swapcase function here. Please note that the below code overrides bad_characters for clarity, but you can easily modify it to keep it unchanged.

You may use the string.translate(python2). string.translate(s, table[, deletechars])Delete all characters from s that are in deletechars (if present), and then translate the characters using table, which must be a 256-character string giving the translation for each character value, indexed by its ordinal. If table is None, then only the character deletion step is performed.Other mistakes in the code:Initialize case_sensitive only with True. True or False is True.While True then break adds nothing. Remove it.if case_sensitive = False: is an assignment while you need a comparison ==.  case_sensitive is a boolean, so just use it is if case_sensitive or if not case_sensitive.bad_characters == character is wrong. You cant compare a list to a character. use character in bad_characters instead.Here is the whole solution with corrections:
