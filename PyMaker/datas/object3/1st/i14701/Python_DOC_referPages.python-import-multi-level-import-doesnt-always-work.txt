I've seen this behavior in other cases so I don't believe it's boto specific, but I tagged this question as boto since this is where I saw the problem most recently.  When I do the following, it works in certain environments but not all:Some environments allow for this, but others give back this exception:AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'connection'But, the following works in all environments (or at least the few cases that I have):I've seen this with other libraries as well, not just with boto.  Can anyone shed some light onto what is happening behind the scenes that causes the first case to not always work?
Doing an import likegives you the boto package itself. None of the submodules will be imported with this statement, unless they're imported explicitly by boto. If they were already imported earlier, they are available with this import as well.on the other hand will import all submodules successively.Btw:would also help to resolve this particular issue for you.
