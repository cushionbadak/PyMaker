I have a process sends messages between threads using Queues.When I look at the processor time % alloted to this process, it's usually pinned at > 90%.Is there a better paradigm besides a while-True-check-inbox? I've tried sleeps, but the threads need to respond immediately.
Queue.get will wait (block) until there's something in the queue. During this wait, the thread will sleep, allowing other threads (and processes) to run.So just remove your check for self.inbox.empty():
