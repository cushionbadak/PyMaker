I have a structure something like this:This doesn't work because the original foobar function can't handle self being passed to it -- it wasn't part of any class or object to begin with. Python won't let me add the @staticmethod decorator either.I have no control over the definition of foobar, and I may have to override the value of foo in subclasses. How can I call foo, without passing the object calling it?
Decorators are plain functions, you should be able to call staticmethod(foobar) explicitly in the class definition
The approach from user2357112's comment seems to work, too:If return values shall make it through, you need return statements on all levels, though:
