I have a dictionary of items. I want to process all items except the ones which keys start with "_". Is there a performance difference of doing:vs.
I came up with a simple test program for this using the timeit module as per the advice of wwii. It's a useless script; all it does is store each key of interest (i.e. the ones that don't start with '_') in a variable, which is overwritten each time.This does three tests of running each block 1,000,000 times and returns the minimum execution time. Here are the results: Using continue: 1.880194Using if not: 1.767904These results vary slightly between runs, but the trend is always the same: The second structure takes around 100 ms less than the first for 1,000,000 runs. That means the difference is on the order of 100 ns for each run. I doubt anyone would notice that.At this point it's really a question of readability. For such a small block of code, it probably doesn't matter either way. Anyone who knows a little Python should be able to tell what both of those mean. Personally, I would choose the second option, but I don't see a problem with either.
