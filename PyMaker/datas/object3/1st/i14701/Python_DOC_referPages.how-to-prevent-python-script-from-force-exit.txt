I am running a python script and trying to prevent from force exiting or print an error message or log that into the log file.I am already using logging.info("") for logging.. or just print for printing something..but what or how do I create a method or function that can either do print or log when it force exit? For example, if my test.py is running and I press Ctrl + C to exit out.. I want to log that or print out.. I am using above coding for logging for when I want to exit the program.But this doesn't deal with something like ctrl + c I want to also log just in case program exit by accident or something
UPDATEDUse try and except:You could also leverage the atexit module to execute a function when the script exits.https://docs.python.org/2/library/atexit.html
You should likely take a look at Python Signal Handlers (specifically signal.CTRL_C_EVENT).Here is a more-complete answer... NOTE: You can make your processes fairly unkillable by using such things.
