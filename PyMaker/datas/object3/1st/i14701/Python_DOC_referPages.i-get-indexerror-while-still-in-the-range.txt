I am trying to read the rows of a csv file. My file looks like thisI use the following command to read the rowsThe output prints the first row, but then it give the out of index error right after.I'm guessing I'm making a silly mistake somewhere, but can't spot it. Any ideas on what I am doing wrong and how to fix it?EDIT: This is the output of print(list(r)):
DictReader(f) just gives you a one time look at your file -- you can only call list on it once, but you call it multiple times because it's within the loop. Later calls return an empty list. Just call list on it outside of the loop and save it in a variable, and you'll be golden.That is:Or, don't pull the whole thing into memory at any point:If you'd like to keep the index around for other purposes:If you want to get specific rows from an iterator (which csv.DictReader is a special case of) without pulling the whole thing into memory, check out itertools.islice at https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html. It basically allows list-style slicing on an iterator.For more sporadic rows:
