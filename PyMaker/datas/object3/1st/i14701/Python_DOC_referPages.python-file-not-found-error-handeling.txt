the error I get 
You need to place the except block at the same level as the try block, and add a colon, and use the right exception:If you only wanted to catch the open() call and not include the rest of the with block in the try..except handler, you need to open the file separately, then use it in the with block:Note that errno.ENOENT is not a valid exception to catch, it is only a constant. I used the FileNotFoundError exception instead; it is a subclass of OSError that is thrown when the file you tried to open was not found.
