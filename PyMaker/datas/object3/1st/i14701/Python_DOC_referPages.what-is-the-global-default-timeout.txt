Python 3.4 .Trying to find what is the default timeout in urllib.request.urlopen() .Its signature is:urllib.request.urlopen(url, data=None, [timeout, ]*, cafile=None, capath=None, cadefault=False, context=None)The doc says that its "global default timeout", and looking at the code its:socket._GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUTStill what is the actual value in secs?
I suspect this is implementation-dependent. That said, for CPython:From socket.create_connection,If no timeout is supplied, the global default timeout setting returned by :func:getdefaulttimeout is used.From socketmodule.c,Earlier in the same file,So it looks like Py_None, aka None, is the default timeout. In other words, urlopen never times out. At least not from the Python end. I guess a timeout can still occur if the networking functions supplied by the OS have timeouts themselves.Edit: oops, I guess I didn't need to go source diving for the answer at all, since it's right there in the docs.A value of None indicates that new socket objects have no timeout. When the socket module is first imported, the default is None.
