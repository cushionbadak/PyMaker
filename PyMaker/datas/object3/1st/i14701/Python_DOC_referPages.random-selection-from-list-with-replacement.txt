I have a list of lists, like so:I want to create a random list with replacement of a given size from a. The numpy.random.choice() method only accepts 1D arrays. I can write my own function to do this, but is there already an optimized way?Expected output:
You can simply call the standard library's random.choice() repeatedly. No need for numpy.This is an alternative to random.sample() that works without replacement and lets you choose a “sample” larger than the size of the original population.
Using numpy:
As of Python 3.6, you can directly use random.choices.A rough benchmark suggests this seems to be more performant on varying sample sizes than the list comprehension approach. 
The more_itertools library implements more_itertools.random_combination_with_replacement:
