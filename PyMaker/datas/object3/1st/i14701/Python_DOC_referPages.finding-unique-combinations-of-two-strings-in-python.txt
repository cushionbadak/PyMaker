I have two strings:And I want to test for how many unique combinations of letters there are. The strings are ordered, so I only want to match StringA position 1 with StringB position 1, StringA position 2 with StringB position 2, etc. So the pairs in the strings above are (KT), (TK), (TG), (TG), (KK), (KT), (GT), (TK), (TG), (TG), (TK), (KK), (KT).And there are 5 unique combinations: (KT), (TK), (TG), (GT), (KK)I have used the following code to produce the strings from two .csv files.But I cannot figure out how to do the comparison. I have tried to convert the strings to sets, as I read in another thread, that this is required, but I am not sure why, and I cannot get it to work.
Just use zip and set to combine the two lists of strings and get unique combinations. I used a list comprehension to return combined strings:Alternatively, if you simply want them in a set you can remove the list comprehension:
output:Or a simple one liner would do:output:
You can use use zip function and set to create the expected list :then use chain and combinations functions from itertools module for create the combinations  :
