I'm new in python and i'm trying to calculate numbers from loop. Let this question make easy for you to understand.I've this program in python:Now After running this program, it gives the following output:QUESTIONI want to calculate that zero occurs two times at case 1 and case 2. You can see that into my program i'm calculating Remainder at given inputs.Here is another example to understand!Suppose, I give input:Now, Here i want to calculate that zero occurs at one time. So, how to achieve that process in python?Help would be appreciated!
