I'm trying to use the re module in python to match a string with regex. What I'm trying to get is 192.168.1. from an IP address (so missing the last byte).I've tried out my regex in a regex editor and it seems to work. The variable original_ip contains 192.168.1.65 in it already, so that's where I'm trying to extract the first 3 bytes plus the . from.What I'm trying to do is get those 192.168.1. from 192.168.1.5 and have it return a string.Code:error codes:
The issue with your code is that you are not rawing your regex string:This makes \b act as a word boundary, instead of the character representation of backspace ("\b" means backspace and if you try to match the regex \b with the string \b, you get \x08 as the matched string).But it could be done simpler with split and join:
