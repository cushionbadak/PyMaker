I'm trying translate this Java code to Python:    I've done this:But I'm not getting the same result. The Java code works fine, but in Python not. This line in particular I'm not sure how translate to Python, maybe that is the problem:The (correct) output for the Java code is:The (incorrect) output for the Python code is:
The translation for that line into Python is:This gives (roughly!) the answer you expect:What the line does is multiply the number of radians by 100,000,000 (giving -56426494.71697667), convert the result to a long integer (-56426494L) then do a "bitwise and" (see e.g. https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) between that and 0xffffffff. Your current code only performs the first of these three steps.For a simple example of what bitwise and does:For each binary digit, the output digit is 1 only if both input digits are 1.
