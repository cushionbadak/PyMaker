I am using the following code (within Cherrypy) to open a file on the network share. (http://localhost:8080/g?filename=filename.docx)This seems to work fine, but when I open a file, for example a Word document, Word is opening behind the current browser window.How to open a link and focus on the window?
You can use pywin32 libraries. For example:
The documentation states (in part):Note that on some platforms, trying to open a filename using this function, may work and start the operating systemâ€™s associated program. However, this is neither supported nor portable.The last part of that comment is the problem. In fact, in reviewing the source code, it appears that on some systems a system specific command is called which opens the default program by file type. As the default program for a Word document is MS Word, the file will be opened in that program. As the default program for a web page is a browser, a web page will be opened in the default browser.However, you can tell webbroswer to use a specific program. See this answer for how to do that.
