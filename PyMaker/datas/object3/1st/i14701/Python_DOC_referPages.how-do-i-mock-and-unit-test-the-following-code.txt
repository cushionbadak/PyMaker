I created the following to unit test: Someone mentioned that there is no need to mock filenme.X without an explanation. Is there other way to verify the call to something without mocking filename.X? How would I change the following assertion to verify the call?
If create X is not a issue (i.e. db connection or network access) you can do your test without mock it. You have follow alternatives:Use mock's called attribute if you are not interested to check how your method call something_mockUse mock.ANY if you would like to check that something_mock has called by arg keyword arg but you are not interested about what is the valueUse call_args to extract something_mock call arguments and by calls as tuple extract arg valueThe first one isThe second one isFinally the third one isLast option is quite the same to mock X but I wrote it just to show all possibilities.
