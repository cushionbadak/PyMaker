In python strings have a method isnumeric and isdigit.I was under the (wrong) impression that isnumeric and isdecimal would return True for strings such as 123.45 and false otherwise. I'm running the following version of python:And I found that isnumeric and isdecimal return true if all characters in the string are integers, but false if a '.' (dot) is present. What causes this behaviour? Shouldn't '123.45'.isnumeric() return True?
As defined in the Python documentation, isnumeric returns True if all characters within the string are numeric, otherwise False. A dot is not considered to be numeric.
