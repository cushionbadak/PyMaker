I'm trying to open a password protected zip file in Python. However, I'm completely stuck!I've gone through the python documentation on zip files, but I can't find anything for opening one that is password protected.Could someone please point me in the right direction?
From https://docs.python.org/2/library/zipfile.html:Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory. path specifies a different directory to extract to. members is optional and must be a subset of the list returned by namelist(). pwd is the password used for encrypted files.Works on Python 3 too: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html
