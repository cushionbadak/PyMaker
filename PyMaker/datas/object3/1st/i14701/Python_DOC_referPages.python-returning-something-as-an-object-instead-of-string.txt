I have to make a Date class and two of the methods we have to implement are nextday() and prevday(). This is my code:As you can see, nextday returns the next day corretly, but it's a string object. Prevday, however, just returns something that looks like this: <main.Date object at 0x039E3270>How can I make these functions return another date object?
Ok try,Of course you have to implement year_is_leap().
prevday is returning a new Date object, though it looks rather odd because you haven't implemented __repr__().  Just change nextday to use the same Date(...) syntax.
