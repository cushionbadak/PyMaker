I have a list of numbers, all of which need to be divided by the same number. I can do this, no problem, but how do I create a new list featuring these new quotients?I have tried:but it only gives me one number, the quotient of the last number in the list, back.
Instead of a loop you can also use a list comprehension (see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions):
It's executing your code literally.So yes, of course you'll end up with a list with only one value in it.  What you want to do is move the list initialization out of the loop.
