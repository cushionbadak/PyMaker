I have a list of files inside a directory on Linux:I have assigned all inside a list:when I do for-loop it does list the files even though it has spaces.But when I'm trying to do a "cp" or "rsync" or any other command over them it appears as though they don't exist except for the ones with NO spaces.Any reason of this behaviour?ThanksHere are the output from the suggestions.
The file files 1.pdf isn't inside the current directory. It's inside the directory you listed, ./espacio/. If files.pdf worked, it's only because by coincidence there was also a files.pdf inside the currect directory.However, as @Colonel Thirty Two commented, it's generally a better idea to do the copying inside Python rather than using a shell command when you can.
With your solution @bobince now can do it as wanted also with MD5.
