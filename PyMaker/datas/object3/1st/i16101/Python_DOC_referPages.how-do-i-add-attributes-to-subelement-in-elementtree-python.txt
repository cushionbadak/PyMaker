I successfully added a new node to an Element using PY's ElementTree.I now try to give it attributes, which fails, despite I'm following the tutorial.my example xml:The node is created like this:which works, it can then be accessed via root001000 and it's tag can be read.but I fail trying to add attributes. I tried using the syntax I found in another thread here: (with my names ofc)Also I tried it directly, likeResults are alwaysbutI also found how lxml does it, but this does not work with elementtreeWhat am I doing wrong? How can I do it right? Is there a way to make elementtree do it? Or do I have to use lxml? (which would be dispreferred) ?
Isn't this you are trying to do? Assuming that subi is your element and you can access it, you can further use ElementTree method set:Look here about set method of ElementTree : https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.set
You can specify attributes for an Element or SubElement during creation with keyword arguments.Alternatively, you can use .set to add an attribute to an element after creation.Generated XML:Explanation:The constructors for Element and SubElement include **extra, which accepts attributes as keyword arguments.This allows you to add an arbitrary number of attributes.You can also use use .set to add attributes to a pre-existing element. However, this can only add one element at a time. (Suggested by German Petrov).Full Example:
