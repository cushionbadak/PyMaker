This code works, but I need to know how to pass the information from the list created above, into the file, shown as "Exchangerates.txt". How would I do this?sample input and output:Enter currency 1:YenEnter currency 2:DollarEnter amount:3The exchange rate for Yen and Dollar has been changed to 3.0This is what happens in my code, which is expected. However it does not write to the file and the information is not changed within the file, this is my problem.
You can do it with simplier approach:
A particularly easy way of doing this would be to use Pickle, something like this does what I think you're attempting:Note that this stores the exchange rates as a dictionary like: {'USD': {'GBP': 1.6, 'YEN': 3}}. It'd be fairly simple to have it add/check and update the inverse exchange rate too if that was desired.
