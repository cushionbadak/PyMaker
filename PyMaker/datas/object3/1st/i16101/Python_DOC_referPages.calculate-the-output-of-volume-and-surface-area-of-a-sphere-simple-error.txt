This question already has an answer here:TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'                    3 answers                I am new to python. I keep getting the error listed below. Can someone shed some light on the problem I am having? Thanksvolume = 4.0/3.0 * math.pi * (radius*radius*radius)TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
You need to convert your string radius to a float or double.Try this:
input returns a string. You can't multiply two strings together.If you want to convert it to an int or float (or any other type), do it like this:You may have been confused by looking at example code from Python 2.x, where input called eval() on the string for you, so you got a float or int or list or call to os.system('rm -rf /') or whatever the user typed. This was confusing and dangerous, so they fixed it in 3.0, so now you get just the string, and it's up to you to decide what to do with it.
