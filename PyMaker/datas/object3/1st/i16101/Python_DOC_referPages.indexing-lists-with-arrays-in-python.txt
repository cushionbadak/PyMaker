Pythons lists are really a variable length arrays of pointers and not a chain like one might initially think. So they do allow for random access in O(1) like what you are describing without the cost of a hash algorithm that a map has. If you need to use pure arrays you're out of luck or need to extract it into module and do it in C.Source: Python documentation
You can use a dictionary with a tuple as the key:
