after this if I execute a line it does not remove the files of size zeroBut if I do thisit removes the files.How does this actually work?
In Python3 the map function returns a map object (instead of a list in Python2).This is designed for lazy evaluation, which means the value was not evaluated before used. And list evaluates it.
map in Python 3.x returns an iterator. The function passed to the map is not called until the iterator is iterated.list consumes the iterator; causing the function to be called.
