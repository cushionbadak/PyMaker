Below is the output I received.But, it is repeating the values. Moreover 9 is not a prime number.Please help me on correcting the syntax.Below is the link:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops
As you have it, your program checks if n is divisible by a factor. If it is, great, you correctly print that it is composite. If it's not, you immediately print it's a prime number. The problem is you don't know that until you've checked the rest of the factors. Just because 9 isn't divisible by 2 doesn't mean it's prime. You have to check 3 as well.That means changing up your logic a bit. You need to check all of the possible factors before declaring n is prime. One way to do that is with an additional boolean variable.Notice that the "is a prime number" printout isn't inside the inner loop any more, it's outside of it.Another way to do this is to use a cool Python trick and add an else clause to the inner loop. The else clause only happens if the loop exits without hitting a break statement.    Note that this idea of tacking an else clause onto a loop is a Python-ism. It doesn't exist in other languages like C or Java. So while neat, it's good to understand the boolean variable-based solution as well. That technique will work in any language.
According to the link you have provided,it has a statement just under the sample code which saysYes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.So you should intent the else clause targeting the inner for not if.
