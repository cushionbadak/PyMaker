I have a large (21 GByte) file which I want to read into memory and then pass to a subroutine which processes the data transparently to me.  I am on python 2.6.6 on Centos 6.5 so upgrading the operating system or python is not an option.  Currently, I am usingwhich is slow (~15 minutes).  Before I start reading the file, I know how big the file is, because I call     os.stat( image_filename ).st_size so I could pre-allocate some memory if that made sense.Thank you
To follow Dietrich's suggestion, I measure this mmap technique is 20% faster than one big read for a 1.7GB input file
