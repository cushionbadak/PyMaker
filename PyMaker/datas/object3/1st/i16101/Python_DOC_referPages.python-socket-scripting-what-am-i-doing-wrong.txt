My socket program hangs at clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept() and doesn't spit our an error or anything.I followed directions on https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.htmlI've been trying to figure it out for an hour now, but to no avail. I'm using python3 btw. What am i doing wrong? EDIT: My intedentation is all screwed up because I pasted it wrong, but other than that my code is as I have it in my file.
If you haven't written a client script / program to connect to the socket and  send it data, it's also going to hang on serversocket.accept() due to there being nothing to accept. But assuming you have...It hangs because the loop never exits due to True always being True. In the example provided, once a connection is accepted they pretend that the server is threaded and the idea is to create a separate thread to begin reading and processing data received allowing the socket to continue to listen for more connections.
