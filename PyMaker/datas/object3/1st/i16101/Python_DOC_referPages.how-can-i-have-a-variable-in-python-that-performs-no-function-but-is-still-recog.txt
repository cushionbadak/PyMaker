Basically, I want my throw raw input variable to be skipped so that it can still be accessed and referred to later on, but doesn't need a user input to continue, so what happens is if you type "throw brick" within 5 seconds, it will bring you to the outcome print "good job!"I know such thing as a goto or jump don't exist in such a structure-based code. So, if anyone could happen to provide an alternative, your assistance would be much appreciated.
I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do, but it sounds to me like this:Ask the user for input, but timeout after 5 seconds (your time.sleep(5))Repeat over and over again (your restart)If so, it looks like this would be one way to do it: Keyboard input with timeout in PythonI modified the select-based answer with the details of your code:The use of select is a little advanced (ideally, raw_input should have an optional timeout argument) but it's easier than using threads which is the only way I could think of doing this with raw_input.The use of a while loop instead of your restart attempt at a go-to should be self-explanatory.
