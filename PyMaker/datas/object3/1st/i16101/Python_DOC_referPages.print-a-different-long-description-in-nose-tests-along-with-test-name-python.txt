I am using the command:When this is run only the first line of the description gets printed.I want the whole description along with the test name. How do i do that?test.py file
Unittest is documented as only showing the first line of the test method's docstring.  But you could override the default implementation of shortDescription method to customise that behaviour:Demo:Someone wrote a nose plugin to fix this exact annoyance, maybe you'd be interested to use that.  Here it is:  https://bitbucket.org/natw/nose-description-fixer-plugin/
