Is it possible to send a list of related commands using os.system() in python? I mean if I want to change current directory to a specific directory and then have a list of contents, how can I do it? (I don't want to use dir "path"- I want to do both changing current dir, and listing the directories)Note : It was just an example, I want to know how I can send multiple commands! (Some related commands in a row)Note : Python 3.2
os.system uses the local system shell. You can do it as @Rwaing suggests on many unixy shells but not other places like windows. A better option is subprocess.call and the cwd (current working directory) paramAs others have mentioned, if all you really want to do is get a list of the files, the existin python api does it quite well.Edit: sending mutiple commandsOne way to send multiple commands is to pump them into the child shell's stdin. Its shell dependant, but here's a windows example:
No need for system calls here. os functions chdir and listdir will change your current directory and list the files in a directory respectively.
have a look at os.listdir(path):https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdirexample:
