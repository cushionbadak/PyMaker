I don't understand the interactions between the root logger and child loggers:The last line logger.info( 'hello' ) should be accepted by logger because it has logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) rejected by the rootLogger because it has rootLogger.setLevel( logging.CRITICAL )But at the end of my script, I have a file root.log containing hello. Why doesn't the CRITICAL level block the message for rootLogger?
This is happening because the logger object is only inheriting the FileHandler object you assigned to rootLogger, not the log-level. Your Logger object sets its own log-level, so the parent's log-level won't be used at all. This means that logging through logger will check the log-level of the logger itself (which is INFO), and then the level of the inherited FileHandler (which is DEBUG) - it doesn't check the log-level of the parent rootLogger object. Because both logger and FileHandler are set to INFO level or above, you see 'hello' get logged.If you don't want logger to inherit the handlers from rootLogger, set the propagate attribute to '0' on the logger object:If you want the child logger to inherit the parent's log-level, set the child log-level to NOTSET:
