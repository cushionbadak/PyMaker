Natural Text
I want to check if each line in an example test file can make up a specific word 'aardvark'.e.g. given this example text:It should print out:Because on line 3 and 4 the letters in that line can make the word 'aardvark'This is what i have so far, i numbered the lines from 1 to how many lines there are in the example text. I don't know where to go on from there.I also wrote this, i don't think this will work though. But i tried :(
You can use collections.Counter like this:
Let's do it with NumPy!  All we need is a simple transformation function:For the string "aardvark" this gives us:Note the 3 in position 97, which is ord('a').  So we need three "a"s etc.Now simply pass your two strings, the needle we want to find and the haystack in which to find it:Now we have two arrays, all that's left is to compare them:That returns true...but beware case sensitivity; you may want to lower-case the strings before using them if you want case insensitivity.
A bit late but:This uses sets, which are unordered lists.
This can be done much easier, since a Counter returns 0 if you ask it for a key that isn't in it:Output:
