I currently have a subclass of unittest.TestCase which I use to run my selenium tests:I would like to subclass this class (FunctionalTest), where I would like to change the setUpClass method to disable javascript for the firefox browser, but still be able to use all the other methods of FunctionalTest :Subclassing like the following is not working:Any ideas on how to effectively go about this?
This worked for me, I'm not sure of the reason for having @classmethod, but here ya go..
