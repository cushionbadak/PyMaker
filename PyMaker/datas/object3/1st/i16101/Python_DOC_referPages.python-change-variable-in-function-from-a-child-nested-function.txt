This question already has an answer here:python: How do I capture a variable declared in a non global ancestral outer scope?                    5 answers                I have a function nested inside an other function. I want to change a variable inside the first function from the nested one.GivesUnboundLocalError: local variable 'step' referenced before assignmentIf I try and use global, it won't work either since it tries to dereference to a variable step outside myfunc which doesn't exist.Is there a way to do this without having a global variable?
Declare step as a nonlocal variable. It will make the identifier refer the variable in enclosing scope.NOTE Python 3.x only.
