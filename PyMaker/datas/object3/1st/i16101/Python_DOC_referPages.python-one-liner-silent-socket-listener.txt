Is it possible to write python one-liner, which will be listen on specific tcp port, accept connections, and response nothing.I can do this in two lines:But I want to run this from python -c, So it should be one line.How can I achieve this?
Using itertools.count and reduce (In Python 3.x, you need to use functools.reduce):You can also use other infinite iterator like itertools.cycle or itertools.repeat.Following lines are an expanded version of above one-liner.
