Say I have this piece of code:Obviously, this program won't work as str is a string and not an instance.Is there any way to print the attribute name from the instances of the Foo class out using code in the Other class?Or using code in the Foo class is the only way?
You're trying to access global variables using name. You can use globals to get a dictionary that map global variable names to objects:UPDATEUsing globals is a sign of bad design.You'd better to use a sequence or mapping to store multiple objects.
The actual way to fix this is to use Other class to create your Foo objects, and then keep these Foo objects as an attribute of the Other class.Fiddling with globals() may do what you want, but it is not solving the bigger problem with the design:
