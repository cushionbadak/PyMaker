I've already seen this question, but it's from the 2009.What's a simple modern way to handle XML files in Python 3?I.e., from this TLD (adapted from here):I want to parse TLD files (Java Server Pages Tag Library Descriptors), to obtain some sort of structure in Python (I have still to decide about that part).  Hence, I need a push parser. But I won't do much more with it, so I'd rather prefer a simple API (I'm new to Python).
xml.etree.ElementTree is still there, in the standard library:If you look outside of the standard library, there is a very popular and fast lxml module that follows the ElementTree interface and supports Python3:Besides, there is lxml.objectify that allows you to deal with XML structure like with a Python object.
