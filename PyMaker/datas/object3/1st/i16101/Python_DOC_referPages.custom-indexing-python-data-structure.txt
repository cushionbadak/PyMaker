I have a class that wraps around python deque from collections. When I go and create a deque x=deque(), and I want to reference the first variable....My question is how can use the [] for referencing in the following example wrapperIe, continuing from above example:I want to customize my own referencing, is that possible?
You want to implement the __getitem__ method:Whenever you do my_obj[x], Python will actually call my_obj.__getitem__(x).You may also want to consider implementing the __setitem__ method, if applicable. (When you write my_obj[x] = y, Python will actually run my_obj.__setitem__(x, y).The documentation on Python data models will contain more information on which methods you need to implement in order to make custom data structures in Python.
