My code pulls data from a csv file. I want to add a header to it. I am confused where to put the print statement so it will be at the beginning of the file (as a header).there is multiple if statement and I want header before each case.So I was putting it after if and before printing the rows.The result which I am getting is So definitely I wasnt asking for this.Seems it is searchng for every row and returning every time it is looping over.Any idea how to fix this.
please indent code after the try: to make the program work ;)the right place for printing your header line would be right before the line containing try:I assume you want the data to be printed in a tabular way, i.e. neatly aligned, so that your +'|'+ are forming vertical lines. Please investivate the string.format method regarding this. I assume your code to look like print( "{0:<30s}|...".format(row[17],...) ) after you are done. Please check the manual how this works.Your program will not "edit" the csv in any way but just neatly print its content. Should you wish to filter and re-arrange the fields in that file, you might consider using awk
