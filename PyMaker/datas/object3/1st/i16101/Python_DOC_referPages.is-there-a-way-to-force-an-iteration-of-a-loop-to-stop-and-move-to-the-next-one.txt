This question already has an answer here:Skipping Iterations in Python                    6 answers                Currently, I'm trying:Basically, if I want the entire iteration of the loop to stop. If there's an error, it currently "stops" by finishing up the try/except argument and going on to "xyz". How can I get it to stop and go to the next iteration of the loop WITHOUT going to xyz?
Use continue: If the continue statement is reached, the all code following it, ie the stuff thats in   ... ect ..., will be skipped and the for loop will move on to the next address. Then the whole process will start again.
Use a continue statement to skip to the next iteration of a loop.continue skips the rest of the body of the loop:
