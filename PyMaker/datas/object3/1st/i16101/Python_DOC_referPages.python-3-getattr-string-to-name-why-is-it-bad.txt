I have a string : `("Bit" + str(loopCount) ))`loopcount is just a number that I increment in a loop.What I want to do with that is creating some qtwidget as such :...and so on as many as I have in LoopCount.To do so I need to convert my string as a name. By looking on the net I have found this getattr which seems from far the easiest way to do so :    for BitNmb in range(0, self.mySpnValue):    getattr(self, ("Bit" + str(loopCount) ))which give me this error :AttributeError: 'Class2' object has no attribute 'Bit1'Which is quite frustrating as I can see in the error I obtain what I want with the "Bit1" but I have not a clue why it want to be a attribut of my class.And no way to do simplyI have read many time "do not use getattr us a dictionary" ok... but why ? Using a dictionary sound like a lot of work just for doing such a simple thing ?Thanks
Rather than create separate, numbered attributes, use a list or dictionary. In this case, a list will do just fine:creates a list of 3 QLineEdit objects.To set attributes dynamically, you'd use the setattr() function:
