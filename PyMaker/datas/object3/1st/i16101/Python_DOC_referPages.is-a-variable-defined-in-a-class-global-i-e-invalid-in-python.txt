Can somebody explain to me why, in the following code ext is reachable within the MP3File class, but not within its play method?  Sorry for the short question, that is all I need to know.
ext is not a global, it is temporarily a local when the class is being created. From the class statement documentation:The class’s suite is then executed in a new execution frame (see Naming and binding), using a newly created local namespace and the original global namespace. (Usually, the suite contains mostly function definitions.) When the class’s suite finishes execution, its execution frame is discarded but its local namespace is saved.Emphasis mine. The local namespace then forms the class attributes.By the time your MP3File.play() method is being called, that local namespace is long since gone; you cannot just refer to ext as if it still exists. It is now a class attribute instead!You can address that attribute via the self reference to an instance. Unless the instance also has an ext attribute, the class attribute is found and returned instead:or you can find it on the class:
