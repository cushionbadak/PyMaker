Any ideas on why this code doesn't work?I keep getting an error
What happens is that sort() sorts the list in-place so it doesn't return anything (in fact, it returns None), therefore the variable sortedNumbers will be None.What can you do? You can use sorted(), which will return the sorted list:Note: Don't forget to print your results:
Here is what the manual says about the sort method:Your statementresults in nothing being saved to sortedNumbers.
