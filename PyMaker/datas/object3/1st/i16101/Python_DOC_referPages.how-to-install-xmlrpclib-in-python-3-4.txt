xmlrpclib is part of the standard library in Python 2.x. It's not a package that you need to install.In Python 3.x you can import it from xmlrpc instead: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.html. You can import the client from xmlrpc.client: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.client.html#module-xmlrpc.client.
import xmlrpc.client as xc
