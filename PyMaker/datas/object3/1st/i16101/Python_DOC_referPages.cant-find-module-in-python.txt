I'm trying to do a linear regression using scipy.stats.linregress(). However when I run my script, i get the error message I'm using the Anaconda python 2.7 distribution which in its documentation says to have the module installed. Anaconda documentation In the python interactive interpreter, I can import the scipy module, but can't find stats. When I look up its __version__ it says 0.14, which should have the stats module..I really can't guess why the stats is unavailable..
This error:Means what it says. There is no attribute named stats in the scipy module.Not because no such thing exists on disk, but because no such thing has been importedâ€”because you never even tried to import it.scipy is a package. As the Python tutorial explains, importing a package doesn't import all of its submodules.Some packages have a __init.py__ that automatically imports some or all packages.* But that would be a bad idea for scipy, because there are a ton of them, so it would take some time to import all of them, and usually you only need one or two in a given project.So, you just need to do this:* There are also some cases like os which fake being packages but aren't, so you can use os.path without importing it, or cases like pyobjc that create special placeholder objects for their modules that automatically import the real modules when first accessed.
I get the same error when I import scipy instead of scipy.stats. Have you tried
