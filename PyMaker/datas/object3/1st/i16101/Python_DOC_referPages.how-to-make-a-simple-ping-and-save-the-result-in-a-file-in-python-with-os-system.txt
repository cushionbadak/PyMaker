This question already has an answer here:Python: How to get stdout after running os.system?                    5 answers                I wrote this simple script in Python:It's working in interactive mode from cmd of windows, but seems it doesn't work if I write on IDLE (it appear a cmd black screen). This is the first problem.The second thing that I like to do is this:I'd like to save the results of the pings in a file How can I do it?I'm novice of Python (two days) ;)Thanks a lot.
you save the output using subprocess.check_output output.txt
