This question already has an answer here:Can't set attributes of object class                    6 answers                Why is it possible to dynamically define a new attribute for every class instance in Python as long as it's not of type object?This behaviour seems to be identical in Python 3
From the python doc:Note: object does not have a __dict__, so you canâ€™t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the object class.Some class definition provide a __dict__ attribute and then it is included in instances by default. See also __slots__
