Natural Text
**hello, Is there any way to put words with accent on value entry in python?
Thanks for your answer but I do not need unicode. Python 3 accepts unicode or latin characters without any coding. The problem is that mac osx python Mavericks have a problem with tkinter libraries. The solution is to update the version of tcl tk to 8.5.15.1 Here I leave the address to download: https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/ For Mac users from the console to check if there is an error: python3 -m idlelib.idle Python 3 natively install the 8.5 version of tcl tk if i put the 8.6 does not recognize. other method to know the version is to run this code: import tkinter tkinter._test () After update ActiveTcl8.5.15.1.297588-macosx10.5-i386-x86_64-threaded.dmg can this written any accent character in a text field of tkinter without problem and without coding anything.I feel aber asked a question that I asked maybe wrong :)
Sure, you must use UNICODE. Take a look at Python's docs. There are many examples and ways to use it, but quite probably this example will be enough for you on how to declare your encoding to use in documents (UTF-( is default, but since you speak a latin language, latin-1 is probably more suitable for you):
