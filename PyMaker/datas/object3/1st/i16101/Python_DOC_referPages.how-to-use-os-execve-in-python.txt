I just started learning Python today and couldn't find a good example online to help me understand os.execve(path, args, env) properly.How do I use this method (os.execve) to achieve the following task in Python 3.4?Execute an external command (this command is not some windows command like mkdir, cd... It's a custom command), its location is C:\blah and it takes 5 command line arguments.Any simpler example of using this command would be much appreciated.
You want to use subprocess:os.exec* replaces the current program with another one. It has is uses, but its usually not what you want. Note that there are several variants here:call just calls the program.check_call calls the program and throws an exception if it fails.check_output calls the program, throws an exception if it fails, and returns the output of the program. More advanced use cases can be handled by subprocess.Popen objects.
