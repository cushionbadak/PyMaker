I keep getting the error 'int' object is not iterable, but I can't figure out why, any suggestions?
You're currently looping over a single number, which is not allowed. range(int) creates a list of values from [0,input).
This line has errors. You need to have something likei in - This basically checks for i in a iterable. Since len(short_seq) is not a iterable, it throws an error.
