Natural Text
I have a small python script that needs to do some simple stats on some lists of numbers - the sort of thing the statistics.py library seems suitable for.From what I can make out of the info on python.org, it should be part of the standard library in python 3.4.1 (on Win 64 bit), but I'm struggling to access the functions.import statistics just gives a 'no module named 'statistics' errorLooking through the python34\Lib directory doesn't seem to show a statistics folder, and creating one and saving the statistics.py file available from python.org doesn't seem to make any difference.Googling for how to install python libraries gives lots of examples referencing setup.py files and command line sequences, but i don't see how they relate to the statistics.py file available.I'm obviously missing something (probably obvious!) but being a newbie at this i can't work out what it is. Any pointers?
I had the same problem, and instead of:import statisticsI wrote:from Lib import statisticsGood Luck!
