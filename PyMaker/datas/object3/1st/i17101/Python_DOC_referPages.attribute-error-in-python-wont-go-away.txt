Why do I keep getting or my code? How can I fix this?I'm not sure what else to do.
To produce a sorted list of keys, use:instead. This works in both Python 2 and 3.In Python 3 dict.keys() does not return a list object, but a dictionary view object. You could call list() on that object, but sorted() is much more direct and saves you two additional calls.I see that you appear to count words in a file; if so, you are instead counting characters, not words; for word in line: iterates over a string, so word is assigned individual characters from the line. You should be using collections.Counter() instead:This code uses the file objects as context managers (with the with statement) to have them closed automatically. The Counter.most_common() method takes care of the sorting for us, not by key but by word count.
