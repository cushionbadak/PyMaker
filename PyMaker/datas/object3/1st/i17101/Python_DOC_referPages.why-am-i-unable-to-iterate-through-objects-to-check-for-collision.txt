I'm trying to make a game where you can move a character around screen and I had it so that if my character ran into a picture of a tree, the character would stop moving. After getting this to work, What I tried to do was change the code so instead of just using the tree variable, I wanted to iterate through a list of widgets, so that if my character runs into any of them, my character stops moving. What's strange is that it works when I have only one widget in the list. For example if I put list[0] or list[1] in my code, then my character will stop when encountering those widgets. But again, if I have more than one widget in the list and try to iterate through the list, it does not work, my character does not stop when encountering any of the widgets.I'm guessing I did something wrong with the for loop. Ultimately I want it so that if my character runs into any of the images in the list, the character will stop moving.Here is a snippet of my for loop, and below I have included the entire code (if that helps).Snippet:Full Code:
The issue you're having is that your character is moved if he fails to collide with each of your objects. So if you have three objects and he doesn't hit any, he'll move at three times his normal speed. If he collides with one of them, he'll be slowed to twice his normal speed, but keep moving.You need to change your code to test that he doesn't collide with anything before allowing him to move. The built in any function may help with this (call it on a generator expression):If you wanted to write an explicit loop, an equivalent one would be:
Walk plus type() is handy here.This will get you a particular widgets. You could think about rewriting your code somehow like this :But this looks wrong way round if this game will have a lots, lots of widgets.
