Natural Text
I want to analyze a specific part of a txt.file (lines 48-392) and I have problems numbering the single lines of the txt file.This is what I was able to come up so far:
Use itertools.islice() to pick a certain range of lines:The loop will only iterate over lines 47 (counting from zero) until 391, inclusive; counting from 1 that's line 48 through to 392, inclusive.
