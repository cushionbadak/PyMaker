Natural Text
I have a plain text HTML file and am trying to create a Python script that amends this file.One of the lines reads:I have a little Python script that goes off and grabs the co-ordinates of the International Space Station. I then want it to amend a file to add the Latitude and Longitude. Is it possible to use RegEx and parse just that one line? I don't fancy parsing the entire file. If it is possible, which module would be best to use? and how would I point it at that line?
If I understand you correctly, you have an HTML file with the line that you wrote out above. You want to replace the (LAT,LONG) part with the actual lat and long values that your python script will find. If that's correct, then I would recommend going ahead and writing the HTML file to a .txt file: I haven't tested this code, so let me know if it works or not! EDIT: If the HTML file is constantly changing, then you could use the urllib module to update it. See above code.
