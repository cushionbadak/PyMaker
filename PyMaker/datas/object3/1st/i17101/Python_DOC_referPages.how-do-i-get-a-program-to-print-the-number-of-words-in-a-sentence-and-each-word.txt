Natural Text
I need to print how many characters there are in a sentence the user specifies, print how many words there are in a sentence the user specifies and print each word, the number of letters in the word, and the first and last letter in the word. Can this be done?
I want you to take your time and understand what is going on in the code below and I suggest you to read these resources.http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlhttp://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#lenhttp://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split 
Please read Python's string documentation, it is self explanatory. Here is a short explanation of the different parts with some comments. We know that a sentence is composed of words, each of which is composed of letters. What we have to do first is to split the sentence into words. Each entry in this list is a word, and each word is stored in a form of a succession of characters and we can get each of them. 
We don't do your homework for you on stack overflow... but I will get you started.The most important method you will need is one of these two (depending on the version of python):Python3.X - input([prompt]),.. If the prompt argument is present, it is writtento standard output without a trailing newline. The function thenreads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping atrailing newline), and returns that. When EOF is read, EOFError israised. http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#inputPython2.X raw_input([prompt]),... If the prompt argument ispresent, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline.The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string(stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. When EOF is read,EOFError is raised. http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#raw_inputYou can use them likeas you can see, the text wrote was stroed in the my_sentance variableTo get the amount of characters in a string, you need to understand that a string is really just a list! So if you want to know the amount of characters you can use:len(s),... Return the length (the number of items) of an object.The argument may be a sequence (string, tuple or list) or a mapping(dictionary). http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#lenI'll let you figure out how to use it.Finally you're going to need to use a built in function for a string:str.split([sep[, maxsplit]]),...Return a list of the words in thestring, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, atmost maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at mostmaxsplit+1 elements). If maxsplit is not specified or -1, then thereis no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split
