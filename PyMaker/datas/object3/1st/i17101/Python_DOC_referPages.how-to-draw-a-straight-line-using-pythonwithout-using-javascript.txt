You haven't stated your environment, but you can use TkInter if you are doing GUI work with Python. http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm Note there are a huge number of Python GUI choices, but TkInter is the official Python one: https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgrammingIf you are in a web environment, then my advice would be to stick with javascript and the canvas tag. 
If I understand the question correctly, you can use turtle to draw anything you want in python. As the turtle webpage says, "it uses tkinter for the underlying graphics"
