My code looks like this (except i changed the numbers as originally they referred to variables):I get an error:Can anyone explain why this is? I am trying to use polyval to calculate the error (standard deviation). 
In Python, when doing unpacking of arguments or other collections - the number of names on the left side must match the number of items on the right. If there is an imbalance on the right, you will get this exception.Here is an example:If you have an imbalance on the left, you get a different exception:Now we know what is happening to your line. The polyval method is returning an object that has more than 2 values.
Where do you get polyval function from? It's not part of the standard library. You seem to be passing an incorrect number of arguments to it.Your code also doesn't correspond to the line of code the error is referring to. Given that you explain none of the variables in your code it is extremely hard to even suggest what is correct.
as you can see, numpy.polyval returns only one array, which I believe is y, and there is no delta, which you might expect if you're porting matlab code.
