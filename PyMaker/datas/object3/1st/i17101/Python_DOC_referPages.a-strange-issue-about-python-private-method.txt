I know everything is public in python, and we just treated these variables with double underscore as private variables,  but we can access these variables out of class in other ways.  but I met some issues when I test the following code.the exception is :why? please help me to solve this problem. thanks！yes, I realized I made a low-level mistake！ it should be si.SA_myPrivate('niutou') not si._SA_myPrivate('niutou')
You wantNote the double _.  The magic replacement keeps that, only append an _ + classname when that attribute is converted.
