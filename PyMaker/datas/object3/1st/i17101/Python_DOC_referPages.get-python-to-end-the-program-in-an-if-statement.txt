I am creating a game style program and are looking for a command that will just end the program at a certain point. There are no syntax errors and it all correctly indented in the idle.I want this command to execute after the 'YOU DIED GAME OVER' bit of the if statment.I tried to look for anything online but i couldn't find any hints. Code below
Use (this is standard practice for exiting):
Built-in exit() function will work. Another option is to use sys.exit.Both sys.exit and exit raise the same exception SystemExit. The difference is in convenience: you need to import sys module every time you want to use sys.exit and exit is the part of site module that's imported during the initialization.
You can also raise the exception directly
