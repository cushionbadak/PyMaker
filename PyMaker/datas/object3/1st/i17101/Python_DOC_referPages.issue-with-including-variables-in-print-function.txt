I have developed a piece of code for school and i have got to the end a run into a final problem, to finish the game i need to print off the end values of the results of the sums carried out and i am having problem including the variable names as inputted by the user, here is the code;I wrote the bit at the end in the hope that it would print the end values but i get a syntax error ?! and don't have clue why it is happening. Can someone please help me edit the last four lines so it will print in the format of:Bob now has a strength value of 4 and a skill value of 7I have used my method before but its not working this time so if someone could point out where i went wrong and how to amend this problem that would be great !!!!
You have concatenation operators (+) in places where you don't need them (at the beginning of print() and you don't have them in places where you do need them (after the variable in of '+char1nsk'.'). That's what's causing the syntax error.You might consider string formatting instead of string concatenation:
You are trying to use the + operator without anything to append:You don't need the str nor the + operators there, just use multiple arguments to the print() function:Only in the last two lines do I use str() and + to avoid a space between the value an the . full stop.You could, instead, use string formatting with the str.format() method to get a more readable string formatting option for those last 2 lines:Because the text is the same for both lines, you can re-use a template string here.
Try removing the + int the beginning of the print statements. Change it to this:
else:    print(char1 +' now has a strength value of '+char1nst+' and a skill value of '+char1nsk+'.')    print(char2 +' now has a strenght value of '+char2nst+' and a skill value of '+char2nsk+'.')
well since your using python3 why not use .format?insert {} into your string where you want a value, then call the format() method on that string with the values you want in the correct order.cleanest soluton if you ask me.
