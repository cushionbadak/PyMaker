So I have a function that finds the maximum value in a column in a csv file. I want to print the value thats on the same row as the max value, but in column 13. The code makes it clearer:The code above simply finds the maxvalue of column 4, what's not working is when I replacewithvalue[12] is trying to find the value in column 12 that corresponds to the max value of column 4. Note that column 12 contains strings, so I want the output to  look like this:
Track the value of magnitude corresponding to the maximum value in the 4th column.Also better use csv module from standard library for parsing csv files:Also, note that you should use with context manager while working with files and catch only specific to situation exceptions.Hope that helps.
