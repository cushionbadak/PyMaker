I am writing a code which assigns certain data to different seasons. I wanted the program to print the various data depending on what month it currently is.
You can use the strftime() function from the time module. This will store the current month in a variable called current_month.If you want to get the current season from this, try this function:Currently, this will not solve the date conflicts that you specified, as any day in January will return 'Autumn', and any day in April will get you 'Spring'.
will tell you the current month (abbreviation)will give you the numeric month (ie 1 = Jan / 12 = Dec)(or even better)as that will give you an actual integer instead of a string (be for-warned though January is 0)
You can use datetime.datetime.now:
whit import datetimeyou can use datetime.date.today()and return Current date or datetime
