Here is the code I'm given.The code creates a random matrix like this:[[52, 23, 11, 95, 79], [3, 63, 11], [5, 78, 3, 14, 37], [89, 98, 10], [24, 60, 80, 73, 84, 94], [45, 14, 28], [51, 19, 9], [43, 86, 63, 71, 19], [58, 6, 43, 17, 87, 64, 87], [77, 57, 97], [9, 71, 54, 20], [77, 86, 22]]But how can I change the code to output something like this instead?36 83 35 7328 11 3 45 30 4439  97  3  10  90  5  4255  73  56  27  7  3784  49  35  43100  20  22  95  75  2558  81  26  34  41  44  7232  23  2131  37  195  90  26  6  78  49  225  17  3186  25  73  56  10
