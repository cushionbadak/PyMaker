I did not understand where is the logic in my bug, so I managed to find a minimal example. I defined one class t, and said that something happens when you use the <= operator and that a>=b must compute b<=a.It works fineThen I derived a subclass u from t.When I compare two values, if they are both from t or both from u it works as expected, but if one is from class u and another from class t it fails. Why ??EDIT : There is no problem in python 2.x (from tobias_k), but I want to use python 3.3 at least
When you do a <= b and b is an instance of a subclass of a's class, Python will first call b.__ge__('a') (and then try other methods if this call returns NotImplemented)Here is how to implement it without infinite recursion:
