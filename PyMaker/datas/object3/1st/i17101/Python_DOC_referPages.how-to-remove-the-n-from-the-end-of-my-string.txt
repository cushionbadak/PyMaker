I am a total noob so please dont use crazy technical talk otherwise it will go straight over my head 
Using rstrip with \n avoids any unwanted side-effect except that it will remove multiple \n at the end, if present.Otherwise, you need to use this less elegant function:
Use str.rstrip to remove the newline character at the end of each line:However, I recommend that you make three more changes to your code to improve efficiency:Remove the call to readlines. Iterating over a file object yields its lines one at a time.Remove the "r" argument to open since the function defaults to read-mode.  This will not improve the speed of your code, but it will make it less redundant.Most importantly, use a with-statement to open the file.  This will ensure that it is closed automatically when you are done.In all, the new code will look like this:
