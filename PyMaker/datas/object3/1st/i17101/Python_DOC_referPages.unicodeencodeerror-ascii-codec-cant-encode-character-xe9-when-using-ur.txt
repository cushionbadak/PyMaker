I'm writing a script that goes to a list of links and parses the information.It works for most sites but It's choking on some with "UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xe9' in position 13: ordinal not in range(128)"It stops on client.py which is part of urlib on python3the exact link is:http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cafés-growing-faster-than-fast-food-peers-144512056.htmlThere are quite a few similar postings here but none of the answers seems to work for me.my code is:this calls the request functionlink = 'http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cafés-growing-faster-than-fast-food-peers-144512056.html'page = __request(link)And the traceback is:Any help appreciated It's driving me crazy , I think I've tried all combinations of x.decode    and similar (I could ignore the offending characters if that is possible.)
Use a percent-encoded URL:I found the above percent-encoded URL by pointing the browser at going to the page, then copying-and-pasting the encoded url supplied by the browser back into the text editor. However, you can generate a percent-encoded URL programmatically using:which yields
Your URL contains characters that cannot be represented as ASCII characters.You'll have to ensure that all characters have been properly URL encoded; use urllib.parse.quote_plus for example; it'll use UTF-8 URL-encoded escaping to represent any non-ASCII characters.
