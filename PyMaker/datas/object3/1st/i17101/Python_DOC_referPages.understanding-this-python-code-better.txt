I did this exercise based on a real life problem. Dave forgets his case in the bus, and he wants to find out wich one of the canditate buses is carrying the lost case. I understand the code, but I can't find out the relationship between the first function and the second one, as def distance(lat1, lat2):        'Return distance in miles between two lats'        return 69*abs(lat1 - lat2)I understand what monitor() does but not the relationship between distance() and monitor() and how they interact to show the results, can you please enlighten me ? I am a n00b.Thanks
Each degree of latitude is approximately 69 miles (111 kilometers) apart. So, lat1 is a latitude of bus and the second lat2 is a Daves latitude. By requesting this url in monitor you got latitude of bus, and then, using distance function, you got the distance in miles.
abs() is the absolute value of a number.^ little link there for python 3 works the same for python 2.if your looking for the meaning of absolute value <- that link there shows you a video.
