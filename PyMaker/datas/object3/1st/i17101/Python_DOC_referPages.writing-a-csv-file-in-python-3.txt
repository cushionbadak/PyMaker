I have three lists a, b, and c that I would like to write to a csv file as columns. I'm having trouble (since data has these as rows) and also with writing the csv. Here is what I have. 
There is no need to create variable data. Use built-in function zip. It makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.Documentation for reference https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
Excel stores data in Row-major order.You have to break the problem down first:Output:Putting it all together:Shorter (safer) version:See zip([iterable, ...]) for information on this built-in function.
