This is code for a bubble sort, but what is the use of -1,0,-1 in the while condition?
You are looking at arguments to the range() function; the numbers set up the range to start at the list length, minus one, then stepping down to 1 (the end point is not included in the range).So there are 3 arguments, the first is len(list1) - 1, the second is 0 and the third is -1.Say the list is length 5, then range(5 - 1, 0, -1) will produce a list with 4, 3, 2, and 1:The for loop steps over these values:The for loop assigns these numbers to passnum, and the next nested loop uses that to create a new range(). The first time, that inner range will go from 0 to len(list1) - 1 (exclusive), the next time from 0 to len(list1) - 2, etc, until the last time, when it'll run from 0 to 1, always excluding the stop index. For a list of length 5, that means the inner loop first assigns 0, 1, 2, 3 to i, then 0, 1, 2, then 0, 1, then 0.The code is missing an opportunity to use Python sequence assignment to swap to elements:
The first -1 subtracts 1 from the length of the input list because the indexes start from 0, not 1. The 0 is the start number(only neccesary to get to the next parameter). The 2nd -1 is the step so that tells it to move backwards through the range. Example:range(5, 2, -1) is [5, 4, 3, 2]
