I want to display the images in the folder using grid(). But when I tried with the following code, I got the output with single image iterated. My code:When I run this code, after 5 minutes a child window will popup, and it will display a single image like this;But how to get all the images in the dataset? Any suggestions are welcome.Tkanks for your support!
As I said in a comment, you're putting the same image in every row and column of the grid. Here's how to avoid that using the built-in divmod() function to iteratively compute the row and column for each one, based on the number of COLUMNS you want to display in each row based on the current value of image_count:
You always use the same column and row for all images in the dataset.Try removing the row and the column for-loop. and do something like this:This should be 70 times faster :)
