I am making code for a program that determines attributes for a character, I want my program to print in the style or 'char1 has a strength value of str1 and a skill value of skl1' I looked for a way to do this in Python 3.3.2 and found this however I keep on getting an error while running it like this; I don't know what this is and it is hindering my progress, this is the code;I'm not sure what's wrong if anyone could help me out that would be great, thanks!
You have your syntax mixed up; to use a string as a template, you need to use the % operator between the string and the tuple; the placeholders use %s to interpolate values as strings:Without that % in between Python sees that as a '...'() function call on the string object.I'd instead recommend you use the newer str.format() method to apply string formatting; it is more readable, uses a method call rather than an operator, and is more flexible:Especially when you only have one value to implement this is easier to use as you won't fall into the (oneitem)-is-not-a-tuple pit that many beginning Python users fall into.
or (although the numbers inside the curly braces are optional in python2.7 + I number them for compatibility with python <= 2.6 )
