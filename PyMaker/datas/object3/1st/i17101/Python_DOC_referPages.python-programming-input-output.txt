Natural Text
I am new to Python and need some help with my program. My quesiton has now been answered, thank you to everyone who helped me!
Rather than trying to parse a text file yourself, I would suggest you use one of the ready-made tools from the python standard library to do the work for you. There are several different possibilities, including configparser, csv, and shelve. But for my example, I will use json.The json module allows you to save python objects to a text-file. Since you want to search for recipes by name, it would be a good idea to create a dict of recipes and then save that to a file.Each recipe will also be a dict, and will be stored in the recipes database by name. So to start with, your input_func needs to return a recipe dict, like this:Now we need a couple of simple functions for opening and saving the recipes database:And that's it! We can now put it all to work:I have obviously left some important features for you to work out (like how to display the recipe, how to rename/edit recipes, etc).
