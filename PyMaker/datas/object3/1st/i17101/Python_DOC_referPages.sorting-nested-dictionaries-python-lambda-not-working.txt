I have a dictionary of dictionaries based on {month:{id:value,id:value},month:{id:value,id:value}} like thisand I'm trying to sort the value so that I can print the highest values for each month like august(8) highest value for august... sept(9) highest value for sept.. and so on.I tried using lambda like in many of the StackOverflow questions on this but it hasn't worked. I get a Key error .
For the input you have given,produces
It looks like you may be treating the dictionaries as lists in the lambda expression.  The termlooks like a 2 dimensional list index.  However your data structure is nested dictionaries.  So unless you have a guaranteed entry for key 0 for every top level dictionary (assuming it is the month of year) and a guaranteed key 1 in every sub-level dictionary it will give you a key error.  A suggestion to try:This will give you each month sorted by the keys of the nested dictionary.
