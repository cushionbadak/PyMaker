Is there a way in Python 3.x to create a new type? I can only find ways to do it in c++.Basically what I want to do is create a lexer, where I scan input and python can already do int and string, but if I want another datatype such as name, how could I assign it so that I can do...EX)
You would want something like this, a class. In the source code all of the object types you see in Python are in class form.The reason the output is slightly different to what you expected is because the name of the class is myName so that is what is returned by type(). Also we get the __main__. before the class name because it is local to the current module.
You might have a look at Metaclasses: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/14/python-metaclasses-by-example/However, what exactly do you want to achieve?
The short answer is you can't make a new type in python without editing the source code (written in C). However the answer about creating a class in python is probably the easier route to go since editing the source can create compatibility problems with packages (potentially speaking).
