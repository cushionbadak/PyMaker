I want to send requests to a Server, but somehow Python converts 4Byte values to 8 byte Values:up to v5 everything works fine but after v5 i always get 8Byte values instead of 4Bytes.Wireshark Capturing:up 00 00 03 e8 everything works fine:
Since you don't specify otherwise, you are using the native representation for your longs. Try adding the = specifier (native byte order, standard size):References:http://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#byte-order-size-and-alignmenthttp://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters
