Is the list of Python reserved words and builtins available in a library?  I want to do something like:
To verify that a string is a keyword you can use keyword.iskeyword; to get the list of reserved keywords you can use keyword.kwlist:If you want to include built-in names as well (Python 3), then check the builtins module:For Python 2 you'll need to use the __builtin__ module
