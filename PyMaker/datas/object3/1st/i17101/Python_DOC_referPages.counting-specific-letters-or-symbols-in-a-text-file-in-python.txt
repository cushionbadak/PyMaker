Natural Text
I'm trying to get python to count how many of a letter or symbol that there is in a text file. My text file is '*#%##' but for some reason when I input a symbol it counts all of the characters rather than the input so I get an output of 5 rather than 3 if I for example inputted '#'.This what I have done so far:
You are rebinding Symbol in the for loop:This just assigns each character in your file to Symbol, then increments the count.Use str.count() instead:or, if you must use a loop, then test each character:
For a large input file, you may want to consider collections.Counter
