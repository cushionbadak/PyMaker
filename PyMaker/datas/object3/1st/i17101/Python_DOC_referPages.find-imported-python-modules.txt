I'm building a flask application and I want to remove the redundancy on importing modules. So, on runtime I want to print all the imported modules.Is there a way to do that?
You can use sys.modules.keys() but you will need to import sys to use it.

sys.modulesdocs"This is a dictionary that maps module names to modules which have already been loaded."
