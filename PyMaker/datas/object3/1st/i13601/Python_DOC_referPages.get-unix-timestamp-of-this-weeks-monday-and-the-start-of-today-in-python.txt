I am trying to investigate how to find these numbers, but honestly the answers I have been finding around online have been confusing me.  I'm trying to figure out how to get the time of the start of today, and of the most recent Monday.I read about time.time(), but that gives me the time right now.
I prefer to work with datetime, then you can easily convert that to a timestamp: How to convert a Python datetime object to seconds.To get today's date, with the time set to zero (midnight) in local time:If you do this you will probably want to convert the time zone to UTC before converting to a timestamp. If you'd rather take midnight in UTC:Now to adjust to Monday, you need to know which day of the week this represents. Handily there's a weekday method that uses 0 for Monday, so you can just subtract:
Something like this should get you the unix timestamp for midnight today in your local timezone:And this should get you midnight on Monday, since Monday is considered the 0th day of the week:
Get UNIX timestamp of the start of today in PythonSee How do I get the UTC time of “midnight” for a given timezone? to get an aware datetime object that represents midnight. To get Unix timestamp from that object, call its .timestamp() method.Get UNIX timestamp of this week's monday The code almost the same for the monday's timestamp:If you need .timestamp() implementation for <3.3 Python version, see Converting datetime.date to UTC timestamp in Python.
