I am just curious if is the shortest way (or if there is an even shorter way) of writingin Python.
If ui is a dictionary, you can even simplify that with the dict.get method, like thisHere, if the key padding exists in the dictionary, then the value corresponding to that will be returned. Otherwise, the default value passed as the second parameter will be returned.
Maybe it's not shorter because of the import line but you can also change ui to be a collections.defaultdict.Then the way you'd write what you originally had would simply be:Not the shortest overall due to the setup, but once it's set up it's the shortest access to write out.
I think this is what you're trying to do:This is called a ternary expression.
