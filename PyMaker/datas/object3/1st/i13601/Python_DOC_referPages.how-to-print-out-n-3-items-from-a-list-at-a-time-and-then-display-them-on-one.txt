As you can see from the code below, I have my program read text from a text file (homework.txt) to a list called heightandweight. I then have it print 3 items in the list at a time. However it doesn't print the 3 pieces of information on one line. How would I do that?The above code will output:
If you don't want to use format strings (i.e. if you just want to print out a set of data without having a newline) then you can prevent a newline by using:or, if you're using Python 3:Assuming the latter, your code would then look like:
You probably need to learn about formatting strings in python. In your case the relevant code would be something like:Which could be compressed into just:However it would be much neater to have the original text file be organised like this in columns:Then your code could be simplified to:
With python it is very easy. I recommend you strongly to check the function join (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join).I am not sure if this is why you want but you can test this :
