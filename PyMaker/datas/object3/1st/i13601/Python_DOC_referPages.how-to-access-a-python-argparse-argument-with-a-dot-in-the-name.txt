Python's argparse lets me define argument names containing a dot in the name. But how can I access these ?Obviously attribute names can be created with a dot in their name but how can these be accessed ?Edit:My goal was to let argparse display the inputfile.txt name (e.g. with --help) but call the attribute "inputfile".After trying some of the suggestions the easiest way to accomplish this is using the metavar option:
Internally, argparse will add all attributes to the Namespace() instance with setattr. Accordingly, you can access the values with getattr:However, this is not as intuitive and in general attribute names with dots in them should be avoided.  It is recommended to use the dest option of argparse.add_argument to define your own variable in which to store the value for that argument, as hd1 suggests in their answer.
Using the dest option, you can assign it to any thing:Hope that helps.
Why not use FileType objects instead?
Rename the argument to inputfile and use metavar to set the display value for the user.
I strongly recommend you to refactor your code to change the argument name.But, if you won't or can't, this will do the job:
