I want to check all the values in a matrix and if it's 1 print the x,y coordinates. This is my matrix:This is my code so far:But when i run it i get this:the coordinates:and then this error:What am i doing wrong?
You are iterating over range(10) while you have a 4x4 matrix. You need range(4) instead.But this is not the pythonic way to go with this task.First of all you don't need to initial a list when you want to use a list comprehension so you don't need l=[] at all,then as a pythonic way for dealing with files you can use with statement that close the file after the nested block of code.And for iterating over an iterable and getting the indices you can use enumerate() function.Also note that in your code the line p = int(l[x][y][:-1]) is redundant and you don't need to convert the item to integer you can simply check with '1'. 
Alternatively I will suggest using numpy to deal with matrix.Here is how to do it with argwhere:To return as a list of tuples:To construct your matrix, you can do it with:Hope this helps.
You can do it simply this wayI kept the same splitting line as yours,Then in the second one I iterate over all the combinations and keep only x,y when 1 is met.And you get the expected result
After reading the matrix from the file:You can find all the 1 indices with one line:And if you want to flatten the array:
Another pythonic way would be to read a comma-separated data file with the csv library and enumerate() over rows and column fields:Output:Edit: Removed int() cast so that the try..except block is no longer necessary.
