I'm creating a small python program that iterates through a folder structure and performs a task on every audio file that it finds.I need to identify which files are audio and which are 'other' (e.g. jpegs of the album cover) that I want the process to ignore and just move onto the next file.From searching on StackOverflow/Google/etc the sndhdr module appears at the top of most lists - I can't seem to get the sndhdr.what() method to return anything but 'None' though, no matter how many *.mp3 files I throw at it. My outline implementation is below, can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?For example:
It very much looks like the sndhdr module of the standard library recognizes only file types that the standard library is also able to actually open ('aifc', 'aiff', 'au', 'hcom', 'sndr', 'sndt', 'voc', 'wav', '8svx', 'sb', 'ub', or 'ul').MP3 is not supported natively (nor OGG, FLAC, ...).You can try python-magic for detecting all kinds of file types (not only audio files).Depending on your OS, you can also call the operating-system command file on your files and parse the result with Python.You can also just perform whatever task you want to do on the files and just use try/except to check if an exception occured.
