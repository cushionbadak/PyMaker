for eg:This is python code to find all jar file in test directory but how to sort all jar file based on modification datetime.
First of all for checking the format of your file you can not use in operand you can use endswith or fnmatch and then sort the file list with os.stat().st_ctime:
Use a glob, which use the os.listdir() and fnmatch.fnmatch() functions in concert.
You can use os.path.getmtime() to get the latest modified time of a file. If you combine this with the list function sort, you can specify the key to sort on. By sending a lambda function as key, we specify the key to be the last modified time. The os.path.join(arg, x) is to get the full path to the file, where arg is your path argument, and x is the current file.
