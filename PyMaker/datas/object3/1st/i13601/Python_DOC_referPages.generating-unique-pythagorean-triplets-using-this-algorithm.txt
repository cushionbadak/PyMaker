As many others pointed out, when the return statement executes, your function will finish, and will not continue looping. However, you have options for returning multiple values from a single function. For example aggregating your values in a list and return that, or to use the yield keyword instead of return. The yield keyword will make your function a generator function, which returns an iterable generator object with all your expected elements.I advise you to split your code into separate functions, so you have the original formula as a function of i, and a generator function which will return the elements for 1 <= i < n. Note that you can collect the elements of a generator to a list by supplying it to the list constructor.
The return sentence. Change it for a yield. If you want to test it, you could:
Your function produces only one pair, because return interrupts function execution. You could use yield keyword, as suggested by @jgomo3, or map function:
