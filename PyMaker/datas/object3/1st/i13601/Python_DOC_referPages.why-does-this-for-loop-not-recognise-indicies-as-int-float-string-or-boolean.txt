Here is a short piece of code which is meant to check what data type a certain variable is, the return says True, followed by False, False, False. Could somebody tell me what is wrong with this code and how I could do a process such as this more efficiently?
You have to compare the type with the word in the list and not it's type. Also note that range excludes the second argument, and hence you need to do range(0,4) or range(4) which is better.A better way is to use isinstanceReturn true if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect or virtual) subclass thereof.You can change your code as,As isinstance returns a boolean value, you can directly do
You don't want to do type(types[x]).  types already contains types.  If you take the type of a type, you get type.Just do if type(examples[x]) == types[x].Even better is to do it this way:This has the added advantage of comparing all the types in the list, not just the first 3.Why you want to do this is another question.
Elements of types are classes (types) and type returns type for each of those. There're no types in examples, thus type(examples[x]) == type will always evaluate to False.This should work:You could also do this using map and isinstance:
