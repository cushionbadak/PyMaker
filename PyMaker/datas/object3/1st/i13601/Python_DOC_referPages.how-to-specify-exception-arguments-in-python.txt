How do I set the arguments when I create an exception? Where do I find the list of arguments available for each Exception subclass? What are the best practices?For example, if I know that a file does not exist, how do I raise the FileNotFoundError(missing_file) exception?This shows the list of members of the FileNotFoundError exception:This shows that it is possible to set some of the arguments when creating an exception: And this shows that those arguments mean something:So I know the arguments are there, can be set and can be used. But I couldn't find any documentation about it.Tthe raise documentation, the FileNotFoundError documentation or this post don't talk about the exception arguments.
Looking at the page you linked for FileNotFoundError, it does say that it's a subclass of OSError, which has signatureOne could reasonably infer that the subclass constructor has the same signature.
