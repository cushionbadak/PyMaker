I am trying to make a simple multi-threaded command prompt for a small AngularJS app I'm running.In this prompt, I want to type in a command without it being broken up by output, like below:Instead, I want it like this:I'm not sure if it's possible on the command prompt, and if needed, I might just import pygame or take a look at pyglet if needed, but I believe that the command prompt would be better for my purpose.I hope I explained it for you, but if you need more information, please ask below!Using Python 3.xGistthis is what it looks likeEdit: I added cmd.Cmd to be my command prompt and did what J. F. Sebastian told me to do, but it acts.. strange..
To avoid output from other threads interrupting your input, organize your script to perform standard I/O only in the main thread e.g., replace sys.stdout, sys.stderr with file-like objects that queue writes and consume the queue when you've done input:
It sounds like you want to run the python script as a background process:The & is what does that.If you want to run the script without output in the background from within Python, I would consider using threading.
