Natural Text
So I made this method to set parameters from a text file:When i call this method for example like this: it works well. Now I want to be able to add the same parameter multiple times, and when that happens, set the param like a list:How can I modify this method beautifully? All I can think of is kinda ugly... I am new with python
Just write it as simple and straightforward as you can.  That is usually the best approach.  In my code, below, I made one change to your requirements: all values are a list, some may have just one element in the list.In this method I apply the following choices and techniques:decode and parse the previous response only once, not every time it is referencedstart with an empty dictionarysplit each string only once: this is faster because it avoids redundant operations and memory allocations, and (even more importantly) it is easier to read because the code is not repetitiveadjust the value according to the special-caseuse setdefault() to obtain the current list of values, if present, or set a new empty list object if it is not presentappend the new value to the list of valuesDebugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  definition, not smart enough to debug it.Reference: http://quotes.cat-v.org/programming/
