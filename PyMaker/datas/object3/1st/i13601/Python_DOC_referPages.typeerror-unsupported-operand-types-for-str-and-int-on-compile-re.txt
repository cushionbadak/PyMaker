Good Afternoon, I have a problem with regular expressions.I want to pull a value to the following expression:More time to run the code it returns me the following error:What do you think can be already that I'm not adding an integer value more string but a list more strings.
You are calling the re.compile() function, whose second argument is an integer representing the different regular expression flags (such as IGNORECASE or VERBOSE).Judging by your variable names, I think you wanted to use the re.findall() function instead:You can still use re.compile, but then you must use store the resulting regex instance and call the regex.findall() method:Not that your expression is actually valid; you cannot use * without something to repeat; nothing precedes your the quantifier (the ( doesn't count as it defines a group with the )).
