The output of below code is different if:OUTPUT : FOOO \n Caught in fooOUTPUT : FOOO \n Caught in mainWhy is the output different in both cases?
Because they raise different exceptions.All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from Exception. except Exception catches most of the exceptions and this behaviour is often confusing.You should always catch specific exceptions e.g. 1/0 raises ZeroDivisionError and you should only catch that:You'll see different error in the outputBecause it was not caught by except ZeroDivisionError (issubclass(NameError, ZeroDivisionError) is False).
Because in the second case the exception is:Try not catching the exception in main, or print it. foo isn't defined by the time you try to call it.
In the first case you get the following error:In the second case however you get:The second one occurs because the foo() function is not defined yet when you call it.
Because in the second case, foo is not defined yet and thus calling foo() throws an exception.
