Why does my function fail when I use it through an import? It says "re" not defined. I also tried using a basic function like def x(): return 5+5 and that threw an error as well.Function Fails When Using As ImportFunction Runs Successfully NormallyRight now I am just testing out and learning how to use my own functions but I am currently having a problem here.  The function is my own and saved locally.  Using Python 3 on IPython Notebook The function runs correctly when used without an import
I am guessing the issue could be that first you created the script and missed putting import re and then when you ran the function in python , you got that error.Then later on, you corrected the file by importing re and then again in the same ipython session when you are trying to run the function, its still erroring out. Your saying -I also tried using a basic function like def x(): return 5+5 and that threw an error as well.Makes me believe this is the case.If the above is correct , then the issue is that, once you import a module into Python, Python caches the module in sys.modules , so if you try to import it again in the same Python session , you would get the same module (which means you would get the same function) .To fix this , the easiest way would be to close the ipython session, and open it again, and import it again.A solution that does not involve closing the Python terminal would be to use importlib.reload() . If q1 is the module, Example -
If you want to use module "re" inside the function, the import for "re" should be in the same file in which the function is defined. The alternative is to import "re" inside the function like you have done in your second code snippet.
