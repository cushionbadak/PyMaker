I am kind of new in programming (I only know python). Yesterday I finished making a 2048 game (running in the command line). Now I decided to make an AI that would auto-play, but I don't want this AI to run each time I run the game.So to my question, is there a way to make a program/script to actually input (in the command line) and read data from another program?My "move" code from my 2048 game:So what I want is a second program that is actually inputting in the( direction = raw_input("Where do you want to move?(WASD)")) instead of the player.Is there a way to do this?Edit:    I am running windows 10 
You have to replace the call for raw_input to call you custom function that handles the input.Something like:And in my_other_script.py have a function named get_input that does whatever you want to generate the inputNote that I'm passing the board so you can know what is current board state and use it to choose the best move.If you CAN'T replace the raw_input call, you can monkey patch it using the mock module. 
No this would be very tough and compilicated.I would recommend incorporating the AI into you're script, and then giving the user the option of playing as either him/herself or allowing the AI to play:
