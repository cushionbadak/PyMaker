I'm new to Python so I hope this sounds right.How could I use Python to write to an Excel file from user input?I want my script to ask users "Name:" "Job Title:" "Building Number:" "Date:" etc. and from that raw input, fill in the corresponding columns one after the other in an Excel spreadsheet. I don't want future use of the script to overwrite previous data in the sheet either. I'd like each time to create a new line in the spreadsheet and then fill in the correct entries in each row. I hope that makes sense. Thank you so much in advance for your help.

You may want to use the pandas module. It makes reading, writing, and manipulating Excel files very easy:http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
