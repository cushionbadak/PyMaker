I'm creating a python program and one of the methods must allow two different turtles to approach or 'try'  to converge at a single location The dependency of whether the turtles converge or not depends on the random speeds of the turtles. But my immediate concern is trying to make two different turtles move at different speeds towards the same location. Or an alternate idea I've had it to try and run two lines of code simultaneously ( the movement for both turtles )  but I'm an intermediate programmer and I'm not too sure if that's even possible.Thank you for thanking the time to reply to my question 
You cannot move two objects simultaneously, you can only simulate it.This is what I gave my grade 10's as a hint on this same question.Not perfect, but it shows the concept.
So if the location is predetermined, and the speed of the turtles is something calculated ahead of time, you can have one loop that simply moves both turtles (at the same time, in the same frame) towards that point, where how far they move would be dependent upon their speed.
Another way to make turtles move simultaneously at different speeds is to use timer events.  Here I revise @dougc905's fun example to use timers instead:
