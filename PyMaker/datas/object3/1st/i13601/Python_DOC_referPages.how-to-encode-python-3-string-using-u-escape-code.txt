In Python 3, suppose I have Using encode givesMy question: how can I get encode() to return a bytes sequence using \u instead of \x?  And how can I decode them back to a Python 3 str type?I tried using the ascii builtin, which givesBut this doesn't seem quite right, as I can't decode it back to obtain thai_string.Python documentation tells me that \xhh escapes the character with the hex value hh while \uxxxx escapes the character with the 16-bit hex value xxxxThe documentation says that \u is only used in string literals, but I'm not sure what that means.  Is this a hint that my question has a flawed premise?
You can use unicode_escape:Note that encode() will always return a byte string (bytes) and the unicode_escape encoding is intended to:Produce a string that is suitable as Unicode literal in Python source code
