Here's my python 3 code. I would like to randomly select one of the cell variables (c1 through c9) and change its value to the be the same as the cpuletter variable.I'm getting a "Can't assign to function call" error on the "random.choice(cells)." I assume I'm just using it incorrectly? I know you can use the random choice for changing a variable like below:
Problem:random.choice(cells) returns a random value from your list, for example "3", and you are trying to assign something to it, like:which is wrong. Instead of this, you can modify the list, for example:Solution:You can use random.randrange().Output:
Random.choice(cells) returns a random element from cells, so if it returned element #0 and element #0 was the value "1", your original statement would essentially be saying "1" = "X" - obviously you can't assign the string literal to be something else, it's not a variable.  You'd instead want to get a random element #, and assign cells[rand_elt_num].You could get the random element number by something simply like:I think this is the same as what the other answer says, they just used random.randrange() instead.
