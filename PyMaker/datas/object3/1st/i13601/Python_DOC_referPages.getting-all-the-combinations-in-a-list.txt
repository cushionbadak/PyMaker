This question already has an answer here:How to get all possible combinations of a listâ€™s elements?                    24 answers                lets say I have a list [1,1,1,1].I want to iterate over all the possible combinations while every index of the list must contain a number from 1 to n.in other words, i want to make a for loop that will go over all the combinations.like: [n-35, n-5, 1, n], [1, 1, 1, n], [n, 1, n, n-19]. I hope you get the idea.does anyone has any idea how to do this?
see itertools.combinations_with_replacement. That should do it.
