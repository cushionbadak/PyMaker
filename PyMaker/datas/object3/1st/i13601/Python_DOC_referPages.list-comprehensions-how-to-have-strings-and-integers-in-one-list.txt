Natural Text
I apologise for the complexity of this question, but it is a massive challenge for me being very new to Python:I have an external file that stores lines of text: input.txtI read the content of the file into various lists in a new variable called input_data like this:The result for input_data is as follows:So I have one variable with 3 lists stored in it. How do I remove the ":" after 'min', 'max' and 'avg'?I have tried: Also, how do I keep min, max and avg as strings, but change the numbers in the lists to integers? eg.'min' string and all numbers integers
Just split on the colon then map the rest to int after splitting on a comma:Output:
To start with, I'd suggest split it differently. To keep the word and first value separated, convert the space to a comma so it'll split correctly. In this case, you could probably convert ": " to a comma so it'll automatically remove the colon.Then to convert all necessary values to integers, you could do it in loads of ways, but here's two examples:Alternatively if you didn't do the bit at the start and still have a colon, this is how you could get rid of it with a tweak to one of the above methods:And finally, this should hopefully work with your code:Or if needed, a slightly shorter version:Symmitchry's answer is probably a bit better though, splitting it into the two seconds didn't cross my mind.
Try that. First I just split the line using the colon :. The first part is the headers ('min', 'max' and 'avg'), which I add to my new 'row' of output data.Then I split the second part (the numbers) the exact same way that you did. I then used the built in function int to convert string numbers into actual integer values.I made the code very explicit so you should be able to understand every line!If you actually wanted to make a list comprehension, the (very ugly) direct translation of my code above looks like this:
