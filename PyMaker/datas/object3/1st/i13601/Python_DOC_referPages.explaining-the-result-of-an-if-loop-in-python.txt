Natural Text
I have a question regarding the following python code. Please note that I'm a beginner in python and trying to learn procedural programming and algorithms on my own.Whilst I was previously expecting the answer to 5, 4, 3, I now understand why its 5, 4. 
This is probably what you want:This will print:An if statement will test the conditions of entry once, execute the code inside and exit.A while loop will check the condition on entry, and execute the code while the conditions are true, then exit the moment the condition is false.The second print alpha became redundant in a while loop.
