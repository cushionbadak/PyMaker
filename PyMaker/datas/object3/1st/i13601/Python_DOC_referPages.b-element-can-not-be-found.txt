packed.txtsunscreen, towel, sunglasses, swimming goggles, sandals, water bottleThe B element can not be found in x for some reason. And it says I haven't packed it. Can you find what I did wrong??
Change withAnd add x = x.split()At the end of while loop.Here the complete version:Now, it works!Hope I helped you!
Very small change to code posted by vathek . Just change 'input' to 'raw_input'. There is difference between input and raw_input.'raw_input' returns string whereas 'input' tries run the value entered as python expression. Please refer to post for more info : What's the difference between raw_input() and input() in python3.x?  So, if you are using 'input' then you need to enter value on commandline with single or double quotes. If you use raw_input, then there is no need to use quotes.Output :
First of all, you should not make a list out of x. so just left line with input().Second. In  for i in f:  i is line, not a word. If you want to read words from line you have to doBut it's good practice to open files with 'with':Second argument in open() is 'r', this is the way to tell python we want to open the file in read mode. If you want to read about other modes go hereIf you really want to use classic way remember about close the file with 'file.close()'In your case because items in your file are separated by ','. we are using split(',') so now we have list of your items.Now you just have to check if item that you entered is on the list.after all code should looks more/less similar to this one:If you want to check multiply items at once add this after first line:And then change:to:And add this line 'item = item.split()' at the end of file after but within the while loop:  item = input('Check item: ')Sorry for any misspelling :). Hope its helpful :)
