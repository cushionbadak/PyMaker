Natural Text
I am envolved in a project and i want to make a system that the user inputs a string like "summer_photos" and then the python searchs in all the folders and files and subfolders all the way down the C: tree and returns the absolute path of the files containing the name inputed. If i input summer_photos it can return C:/User/Images/Summer1990/summer_photos.zipC:/User/Images/Summer1991/summer_photos.zipand etc.As i am a petty beginner in Python using Windows i thought asking the masters of programming arts in stock overflow would be helpful.
You can achieve it by using os.walk() function
The walk function in the os module might be a good place to start. And keep in mind that checking every file name in the entire hard drive will take forever; consider limiting the search to a user-specified directory :-)
