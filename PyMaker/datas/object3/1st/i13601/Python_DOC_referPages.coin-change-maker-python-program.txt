I am in a beginner programming course. We must do an exercise where we make a change maker program. The input has to be between 0-99 and must be represented in quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies when the input is divided down between the four. I wrote a code that involved loops and whiles, but he wants something more easy and a smaller code. He gave me this as a way of helping me along:He told us that this was basically all we needed and just needed to add in the dimes, nickles, and pennies. I try it multiple ways with the dimes, nickles, and pennies, but I cannot get the output right. Whenever I enter '99', I get 3 for quarters, 2 for dimes, 1 for nickles, and 0 for pennies. If anyone would be able to help me, that would be wonderful! 
I'm now sure about what you want to achieve. Using the modulo operator you could easily find out how many quarters, dimes, nickles and pennies.Let's just say you input 99.this would print out:
The actual trick is knowing that because each coin is worth at least twice of the next smaller denomination, you can use a greedy algorithm. The rest is just implementation detail.Here's a slightly DRY'er (but possibly, uh, more confusing) implementation. All I'm really doing differently is using a list to store my results, and taking advantage of tuple unpacking and divmod. Also, this is a little easier to extend in the future: All I need to do to support $1 bills is to change coins to [100, 25, 10, 5, 1]. And so on.Gives you: 
I hope this helps? Something like this but don't just copy it. Everytime you divide by 25 10 5 you must lose that part because it's already counted.At the end print what ever you want :).
