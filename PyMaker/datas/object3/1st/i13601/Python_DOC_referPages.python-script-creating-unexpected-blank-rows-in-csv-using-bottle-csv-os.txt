When opening a CSV file to be written to using a csv.writer, take care how you open the file.The problem is that csv.writer does its own handling of line-endings.  If a file opened with open is not opened carefully, the file object will also replace LF line-endings with CR+LF when writing data.  So when both are making these changes, the line endings in the output file can become CR+CR+LF.  Text editors will often interpret this as two line endings.The fix is to open the file in binary mode in Python 2, or with newline='' in Python 3 as recommended by the documentation for the csv module.  To do this, replace both occurrences ofwithif you are using Python 2, orif you are using Python 3.
