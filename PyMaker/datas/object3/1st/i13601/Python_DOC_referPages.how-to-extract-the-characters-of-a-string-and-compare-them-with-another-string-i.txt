I'm quite new to Python and could use some help:I have a a string that a user puts in. I want to break down this string into characters so that I can compare each position to see if that position matches another string that is also broken down into characters.What is the Pythonic way of doing so?Here's an example so far:
In Python, a string is a list of characters, accessible using an index inside square brackets. For example, the 2nd character in string1 can be accessed using string1[1], the 3rd string1[2].You can also iterate through the characters directly using in.Or you can iterate over the range and access the characters one at a time.
Maybe something like this:Output:By the way, you can iterate over a Python string like you would over an array since it has an iter method. And if you want to explicitely break down your string into characters, just call list(yourstring):
I'm assuming you're using Python 3.x. Since I don't know how Python 2.x works, you might have to double-check to see if the code works in your code as well if you're using Python 2.x.Furthermore, the question is a little vague, so I'm answering to the best of my ability.If you want to check to see if 'ham' is in 'eggshamspam', then you should use the line:To find the position of 'ham' in 'eggshamspam', do:You don't need to break it down into characters, but if you want to, the most pythonic way I can think of is:Take a look at the string docs online, or type in help(str) in the command prompt (or IDLE) to look at the in-code docs. You can also do dir(str) to fetch a list of methods the str object has.Good luck, and if I answered your question, a +1 would be great!
