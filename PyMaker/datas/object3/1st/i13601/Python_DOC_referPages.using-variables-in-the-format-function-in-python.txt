Is it possible to use variables in the format specifier in the format()-function in Python? I have the following code, and I need VAR to equal field_size:
You can use the str.format() method, which lets you interpolate other variables for things like the width:Each {} is a placeholder, filling in named values from the keyword arguments (you can use numbered positional arguments too). The part after the optional : gives the format (the second argument to the format() function, basically), and you can use more {} placeholders there to fill in parameters.Using numbered positions would look like this:but you could also mix the two or pick different names:If you omit the numbers and names, the fields are automatically numbered, so the following is equivalent to the preceding format:Note that the whole string is a template, so things like the Number string and the colon are part of the template here.You need to take into account that the field size includes the decimal point, however; you may need to adjust your size to add those 3 extra characters.Demo:
