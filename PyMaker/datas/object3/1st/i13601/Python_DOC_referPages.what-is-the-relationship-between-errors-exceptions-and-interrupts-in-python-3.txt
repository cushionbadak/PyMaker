In Python 3 there are many types of Exception. Some Exception names end with "Error" (for example, StandardError, OverflowError). Other Exceptions do not end in Error (eg. KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit).Are all Errors derived from the class Exception? Do all Exceptions interrupt program execution?Is this inheritance tree accurate?Errors -> Exceptions -> Interrupt
Docs:Exception: All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class. All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.So, SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt are meant to terminate the program (and you don't expect except Exception to catch them; if you want to catch them, you need to be more specific); GeneratorExit is explained in the docs itself.
In python all exceptions are inherited from BaseExceptionFor detailed inheritance tree see documentation
