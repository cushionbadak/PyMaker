there is a function keyboard in Matlab/Octave that stops execution and gives control to the keyboard.It would be useful thing to have around when I have a long running script and need to test a few things. Since Python is interpreted language I guess it should be possible.Is there such a thing in Python or I should use something more 'Pythonic'? :) 
You can use a debugger, such as pdb or ipdb.  Once you've acquired the module, just add the following line to your code where you want to stop it:You can use these commands to move through the code once you have control.
If you're not using an IDE, use the Python Debugger. If you are using an IDE, use your IDE's debugger.
