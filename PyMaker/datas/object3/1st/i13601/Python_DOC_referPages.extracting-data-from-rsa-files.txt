I have a folder labeled cstruct with several with 20,000 .rsa files. In each of the files I need to extract each row that contain cys values and write the to a new file. Is there a way in python to loop through these files in this folder and extract this information?RES SER A 102    17.74  15.2  17.22  22.0   0.52   1.4  11.89  24.5   5.85   8.6RES HIS A 103    17.32   9.5  16.53  11.2   0.78   2.2  12.22  12.6   5.10   5.9RES CYS A 104     0.00   0.0   0.00   0.0   0.00   0.0   0.00   0.0   0.00   0.0RES LEU A 105     8.67   4.9   8.67   6.1   0.00   0.0   8.67   6.1   0.00   0.0RES LEU A 106     5.72   3.2   5.72   4.1   0.00   0.0   5.72   4.0   0.00   0.0
Something like the following Python script should get you going in the right direction:
When you use the builtin open() command to open a file, and loop through it, by default Python loops over each line in the file:Depending on how your "rows" are defined, you might need to pull the relevant CYS substring out of each line after you identify the relevant lines.Just for fun, I compared the speed of this method (if "pattern" in line) to the speed of a regex approach, re.search(".*CYS.*",line).  For small files, on my laptop, the Python "in" operator was ~91x faster, on average (100 iterations).  Regex re.search run time: 0.093 seconds.  "in" operator run time:   0.001 seconds.  That was timed with the timeit module.  The timing data include file open/close overhead, so that difference is entirely due to the matching method.
