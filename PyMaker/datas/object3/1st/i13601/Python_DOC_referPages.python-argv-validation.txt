I need to check if the user is giving the input file and the name of the output, and I'm doing the following:Is there other way to check if the argv arguments are correct?
You'd use argparse:The argparse module makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line  interfaces. The program defines what arguments it requires, and  argparse will figure out how to parse those out of sys.argv.For example your main function could be rewritten asargparse will perform validation for you and display fairly helpful error messages if some of the required arguments are missing:Additionally, it will generate a help message
While it's a little more work, you might want to consider using argparse.You code would become:Running the program with no arguments:python demo.pyYields:Running the program with the -h flag:python demo.py -hYields:
Use argparse; ideally, use argparse.FileType to open files automatically from command-line arguments. If the arguments don't make sense as open files, you can catch the exception thrown.
You can also specify the option required=True to make the arguments mandatory. This will throw an error if the required arguments are not specified. Here is an example:For checking the path of the input and output files, you can use the following code:You can also look at my blog Techable for more information on argument parser in python.
