Using Python 3 on Arch Linux.Command includes:svn infogrep -IEised -eDespite my terminal ouput of 3 for the revision number, I cannot seem to get this value stored into a Python variable. It has something to do with my getting an object instead of the contents of that object I suspect. Any help would be appreciated.For completeness, I demonstrate how the parameter universal_lines can influence the output. Given that the svn revision on my system is 3:With shell=True, cwd=branch, universal_lines=FalseResult:With shell=True, cwd=branch, universal_lines=TrueResult:I tried reading the object, but that does not work either:Result:
You are not using the return value of Popen.communicate() here:You are referencing the (now closed) file object the subprocess module used to communicate with the shell. You are ignoring the value returned on the previous line altogether.Just use:when not using universal_newlines=True, orwhen you do. The data includes a newline, hence the str.strip() call.You could just use the subprocess.check_output() function, if all you need is the stdout output of the command:Last but not least, it may be simpler to have Python do the parsing of the response:
