I have been trying to make a python script that will play on Mac OS X and I have gotten it to work with a .py script in Terminal, but I can't stop it. I have been trying for weeks, os.kill(), process.terminate(), everything I could find on other StackOverflow questions. Here is my code, can anyone tell me the proper way to terminate this sub-process? (I believe I am using python 2.7)
You need to use subprocess.Popen() as you can assign the process handle to a variable and later kill it.The other method is to use os.kill() along with signal.SIGINT to kill the process, as seen here:We are able to access the PID (Process ID) and therefore we can kill it using os.kill(). signal is the module which contains codes for how to kill the process, e.g. send it the abort (SIGABRT), interrupt (SIGINT) etc.
