This is probably a silly question, and I'll probably end up deleting it once I figure it out, but I swear I recall reading, in the Python 3.5 docs, how to change the >>> on the Python interactive prompt, such as how calling help() will change it to help>. But for some reason, when I've gone back to try and remember, I just can't find the instructions to it. Does anyone know if this is possible, or am I just imagining things?Thanks
You remember correctly.  It's in the sys module (sys.ps1 & sys.ps2):Strings specifying the primary and secondary prompt of the interpreter. These are only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode. Their initial values in this case are '>>> ' and '... '. If a non-string object is assigned to either variable, its str() is re-evaluated each time the interpreter prepares to read a new interactive command; this can be used to implement a dynamic prompt.For example:
It's great to set it to either:a color for better visual aspecta blank or space for easier copy/paste operationsPaste this into your bash shell: Finally add this line to your ~/.bash_profile:export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pyrcEnjoy!
