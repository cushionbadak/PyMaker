This question already has an answer here:How to make full use of CPU cores with threading in python 2                    2 answers                I've always struggled with multi-threaded program. My current understanding is when i create the multiple threads, it will run parallel. But it is not happening.Here is code Ihave came so far.  Output:I except both thread should run in parallel. but it is not happening. Please help me understanding the multithread program, Since i am new to multi-thread program in python. Thanks in advance
You acquired a shared lock before printing in each thread. So of course they're not interleaving prints, the lock isn't being released while the first thread to acquire it sleeps, so the second thread is stuck waiting for the lock the whole time.If the goal was to protect only the time prints, not the loop of prints from start to finish, you'd change the code for run and print_time to:
By the way:CPython implementation detail: In CPython, due to the Global Interpreter Lock, only one thread can execute Python code at once (even though certain performance-oriented libraries might overcome this limitation). If you want your application to make better use of the computational resources of multi-core machines, you are advised to use multiprocessing or concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor. However, threading is still an appropriate model if you want to run multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.Python threadingWith or without the locks, you can't get true parallelism. You have to use multiprocessing for that.
