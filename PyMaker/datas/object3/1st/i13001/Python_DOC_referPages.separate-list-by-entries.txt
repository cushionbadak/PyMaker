I have a Python list that I know contains the entries 1, 2, and 7, e.g.,I would now like to get all of the indices of each entry, i.e.,The data array can be long, so efficiency matters. How do I achieve this?
You could use a defaultdict in order to collect indices of elements per group:
Though werkzeug is not really meant for this job, it will work well:
How about something more dynamic like this?This code will create an entry for each value it encounter and store it's index. Then you can lookup the dictionary to know the index of every value.While this code is less elegant than list comprehension, it has the advantage of iterating through the data only once.
You could use itertools.compress
