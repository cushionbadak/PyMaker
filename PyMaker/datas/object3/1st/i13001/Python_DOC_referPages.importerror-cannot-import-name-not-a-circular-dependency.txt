I have the problem on importing the class in the same package, and it seems not a circular dependency problem. So I'm really confused now.I declared an exception in exceptions.py and wants to use it in lexer.py:exceptions.py:and in lexer.py:It shouldn't be circular dependency since lexer.py is the only file has import in it.Thanks!!
exceptions conflicts with builtin module exception.Use different module name.
