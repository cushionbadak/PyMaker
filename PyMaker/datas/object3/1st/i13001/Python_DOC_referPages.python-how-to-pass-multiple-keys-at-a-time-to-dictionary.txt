I'm using csv.DictReader to read a .csv file.csv.DictReader has an iterator which returns each row as a dict and I know how to get single column values out using the title of the columns:But is there a way to get out a bunch of columns with one statement?I'd like to do and get a list of the values of those keys but it's giving me KeyError.I understand that it's trying to hash the tuple and that it's not what I want.I could create a list of DX and then use for el in key_list to index into the dict but I'm wondering if there's a more Pythonic way of doing this.
As described, the following approach should work nicely:Or a bit more concise:Tested in Python 2.7.9
Batteries included: operator.itemgetter. Create a getter object:Then call the resulting object on each row:Or calling explicitly if you hate map (or really want list of the values instead of the tuple an itemgetter returns for each call):
