Lets say that I have these two numpy arrays:How can I "mix" then to obtain the following:Does it exist a function like np.concatenate, np.repeat, np.tile which I can use or I will have to make my own one?
It's not the prettiest, but you can do this:You would however have to do the below in Python3:As zip no longer returns a list, but rather a generator (similar to range).Athough just for the record, it appears the fastest way is probably how John La Rooy suggested (using transpose then flatten):
Here's another one-liner:or similarlyor you could doendless possibilities!
from the itertools documentation:This is verbose, but has the advantage that it will take iterables of different lengths.
Try something like this:also read this heres more info about ithttp://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html
