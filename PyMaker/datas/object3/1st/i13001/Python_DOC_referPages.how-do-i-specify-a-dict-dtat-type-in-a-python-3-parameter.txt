I am trying to pass a dict variable into a function in Python 3 and then trying to iterate through the keys by calling the .keys() function. However I don't know how to specify the type of the parameter.The error I am getting is
I guess You ask about pep-484StockDict is a parameter name, dict is a parameter type.
It seems like you are just passing something wrong to the function. From the error it seems like you are giving it a function. Maybe you should put () behind the argument that is causing the error.Normally you don't need to specify a type. The function will take any type.If you want to check if the passed argument is a dict you could use: This is not very pythonic though. Just don't pass a non dict like object to the function. 
The problem is not in the parameter type. Python is happy for just a variable name and as the original code and then use the .keys method. The error was in a different part of the code I missed brackets on a function call and had set my dictionary object to be a function reference.
