I have some Python 3.5 code that looks approximately like this:I am trying to follow the principle described in the python subprocess documentation here, namely that in the case of a TimeoutError, I should kill the process manually, then complete the communication.In principle that sounds fine, but periodically (maybe every 1 in 50 times, very approximately), I get an error like this:Line 125 is the second communicate() line in my case.It would appear that this is failing because some stream underlying the process object has closed or terminated - perhaps sometimes by chance this happens between the kill() and the communicate()?. But if so, is there a graceful way I should be handling this? The Python docs don't appear to cover this case.
To workaround my_process.communicate() raising ValueError in the exception handler, you could read from the streams directly (simpler code path -- don't use it in the general case):On Python 3.5, you could use subprocess.run():Though it handles TimeoutExpired the same way as your code and therefore you can get ValueError anyway. If you get ValueError with this code; report the issue at http://bugs.python.org
Improved AnswerUsing an empty bytes object as return values for stdout and stderr could be a solution. my_process.communicate() reads the pipes for you. So better not to use a file objects here:Original AnswerCreating empty file objects for stdout and stderr could be a solution:
