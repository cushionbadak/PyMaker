I do not know much about python so i apologize if my question is a very basic one.  Let's say i have a listNow what i want to know is that if there is any way to write the following piece of code in python without using range() or xrange():The second loop is to access elements after the element i i.e., if i = 3, j would have to loop through from 4 to 10, so the pairs of numbers if i and j are printed would be (1,2)..(1,10), (2,3)...(2,10), (3,4)..(3,10) etc.I have no idea what to search for or what query to type on any search engine.Any help would be much appreciated.
This is what list slicing is about, you can take part of your list from i'th element throughfurthermore, in order to have both index and value you need enumerate operation, which changes the list into list of pairs (index, value)thus
It looks like you might want to use enumerate():
