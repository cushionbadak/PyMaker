Here is my code:I am getting this error: TypeError: unorderable types: int() < str()I need to be able to check the number in (listA[1]) to see if it is greater than 0 and less than 50999 and I can't figure out how to make it work.
If you haveyou can simply use a list comprehension to change it to a list of integers:which can then be compared with other integers.However, you shouldn't be using seven (or more) separate lists. Better do something like:and then access the sublists as lists[0] instead of listA, lists[1] instead of listB, etc.
You are comparing a string and an integer.You should do something like
Try passing it into int(). This will convert the string to an int.
