Is there a difference, in the way python does the comparing, between:andthat would make one preferred to the other?
Just complementing the comments above, here is the bytecode:Looking at the bytecode it seems like the difference is basically insignificant in terms of performance. When using the equal sign CPython still has to load 0 as a constant and the comparison process is slightly different. If you simply want the one with less steps, you can use the one without '=='.
