Natural Text
So I was learning Python on Codecademy recently, and I accidentally submitted thisas my code when it should have been this (the " > 0 " in the if statement was omitted). For some reason, the code above still passed all the given test cases.The original prompt asked for a function that would check if the fourth bit was "on". From what I know, the '&' operator should return an int value rather than a boolean value. So, my question is, why does the first program still pass all the test cases? 
Zero is considered as falsy value. Other number are considered truth value:0b1000 & input will return non-zero value if the input has the bit set. So the predicate will be considered true if that condition is met.See Truth Value Testing - Python documentation for more precise definition of truth value.
