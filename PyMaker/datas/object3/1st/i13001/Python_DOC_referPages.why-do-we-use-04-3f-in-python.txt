I have come across the following code.What does '%04.3f' represent in the code?
The format specifiers for most languages are derived from the c language.You can reference the full format list here.The format %04.3f specifies:%f => float value precision%.3f => float value with 3 decimal precision%04.3f => float value, with 3 decimal precision and 4 digits to the left of decimal. The 04 implies that the number will be padded with 0s if the value is less than 9999.
