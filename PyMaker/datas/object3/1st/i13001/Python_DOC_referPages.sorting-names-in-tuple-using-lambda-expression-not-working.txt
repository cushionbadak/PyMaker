I can't seem to be able to get a lambda function to sort a list of tuples by name(after being sorted by grades first).Here's the code:I'm running a doctest on it and it fails when it has to sort the students by name if they have the same grade. It just returns them without sorting them by name.I've found another post on here trying to do the same, and the answerer suggested the same thing i did, but it's not really working properly. Any help is greatly appreciated!EDIT:here are the doctests:
You're throwing the result away, and reversing inefficiently:sorted returns an iterable that is a copy of the passed in iterable, in sorted order. It does not sort the passed list.
sorted() doesn't change the list, but returns a sorted list. Either re-assign the sorted list to a:Or, better yet, sort a in-place with the list sort() method:
You can use the operator.itemgetter class.or You really don't need to convert the second element in your tuple to string also sort by second element is enough.
