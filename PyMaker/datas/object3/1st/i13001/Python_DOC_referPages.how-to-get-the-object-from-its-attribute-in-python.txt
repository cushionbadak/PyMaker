I want to do something like this:what I want is that when I perform I can get the object a that use this method by its attribute b.I can't pass any new variable to the function because this in implementation is a class written by other people that changing the input variables means changing a lot of stuff.Can anyone help?
Since it seems that you construct the B instance within the A constructor, then give your B instance a reference to the A instance:It is possible under certain Python implementations to sometimes find an instance using the gc.get_referrers, but as the documentation says, using it should be avoided "for any purpose other than debugging.":The first get_referrers call will find among others, the __dict__ of the A instance; this would probably be of type dict; we then go through all the objects of the dictionaries referring to self, and if any of these is of type A, and it has attribute b whose value is self, we return that object.Thus the clause print(a.b.getA() is a) shall print true.But seriously, don't use this code.
