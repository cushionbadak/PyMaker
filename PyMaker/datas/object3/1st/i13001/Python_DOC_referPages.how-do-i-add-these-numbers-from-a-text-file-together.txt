Natural Text
I have a file of numbers that are organized in different lines. I've been working on this since 8 this morning and I keep running into the same two problems:when I try to split the file by line, I can't do any math because it's a listwhen I don't split them up, nothing can happen because there is '\n' all over the file because there are multiple lines. The file looks like this:I basically want to add up all the numbers per line. So I want to add 6,7,3,7,35,677 together and so on. But the lines in the two "paragraphs" need to stay together. This makes the most sense to me but it doesn't work.I have no idea what's going on. I know i need to split('\n') but then I can't do any math. I can't convert to int either. Any advice?

Once you split, you need to convert the "text" type str or Unicode to integer, float, or decimal.
If you're on Python 3, remove the import line and replace imap with map
Something along these lines might help.
This will do what you want
