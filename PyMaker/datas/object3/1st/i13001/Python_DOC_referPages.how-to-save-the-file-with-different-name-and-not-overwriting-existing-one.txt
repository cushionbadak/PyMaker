I need to run a python script repeatedly over different data set. This python script test.py processes the data set, plot and save the result using the command.How can I ensure that when the same test.py scripts runs on another data set.. the new result.png doesn't overwrite my previous result? Basically before executing plt.savefig('result.png'), I need to check if result.png already exist and if does then rename the result to any other name like Otherwise, in the next post processing the file is overwritten.

You can use os.path.exists to check whether the file already exists, and if so, append a number. Repeat with the new file name until you find one that does not yet exist.Example-usage:
You can use tempfile.mkstemp available in the standard libraryNote: fi is an integer. In case you need a file object dowhereas filename includes the absolute pathname of the created file, e.g.Another solution is to use UUIDs, e.g.which produces something likePlease see the official docs for further info and parameterson mkstemp and uuid
