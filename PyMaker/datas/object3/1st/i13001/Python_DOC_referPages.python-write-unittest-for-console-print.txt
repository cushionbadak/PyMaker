Function foo prints to console. I want to test the console print. How can I achieve this in python?Need to test this function, has NO return statement : My test : 
You can easily capture standard output by just temporarily redirecting sys.stdout to a StringIO object, as follows:The output of this program is:showing that the redirection successfully captured the output and that you were able to restore the output stream to what it was before you began the capture.Note that the code above in for Python 2.7, as the question indicates. Python 3 is slightly different:
This Python 3 answer uses unittest.mock. It also uses a reusable helper method assert_stdout, although this helper is specific to the function being tested.Note that the mock_stdout arg is passed automatically by the unittest.mock.patch decorator to the assert_stdout method.A general-purpose TestStdout class, possibly a mixin, can in principle be derived from the above.For those using Python â‰¥3.4, contextlib.redirect_stdout also exists, but it seems to serve no benefit over unittest.mock.patch.
