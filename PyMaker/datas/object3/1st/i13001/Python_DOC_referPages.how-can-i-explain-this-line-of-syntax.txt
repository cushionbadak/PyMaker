I am learning python and have a very simple queryBasically  what exactly does this code below mean in englishdoes it mean compare all values in values to all values in othervalues ?
As @khelwood said, it simply iterates on two loops.It iterates through the values in values, assigning each value to the variable iInside such loop it does the same thing, iterating on the values of othervalues and assigning each value to the variable xYou can verify it simply adding a print statement inside the loop, that shows the values of i and xe.g. with an input ofit producesPlease make sure you understand how iteration works in python, reading the official docsand this SO Q&Aand more tutorials you can find on the internet.
