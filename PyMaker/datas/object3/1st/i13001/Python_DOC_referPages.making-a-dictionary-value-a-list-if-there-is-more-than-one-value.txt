Natural Text
I am generating a dictionary of dictionaries and sometimes there may be more than 1 set of dictionaries for each key.So if my current dictionary is trying to add an element with PointK = 24, and a dictionary {..., '24': {'MasterKey': '126', 'PointId': None}, ... }already exists, how can i make this dictionary like this{..., '24': {'MasterKey': ['126','132'], 'PointId': [None,None]}, ... }Workaround (kinda)So this solution only works if there is only a single duplicate, if there is more than 2 of the same ItemK's it wont work i believeAnyway to make this work when the dictionary has lists already formed for the two elements?
try this:the only down side is that MasterKey and PointId will always be lists even if there is only one
