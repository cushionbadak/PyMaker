Natural Text
I have defined this class:I work with a Socket and every time one client is connect I create an User object. I would like to save it somewhere and then be able to process its data, meaning read the file where it's saved.I don't know how to do that. I tried using a txt file but with the fields of the class User is to complicated and I would also like to have something more dynamic, likeWhat is the best solution for my case?
If your User class is really that simple, you can use Pickle:https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html(both Python 2 and 3 links included).
