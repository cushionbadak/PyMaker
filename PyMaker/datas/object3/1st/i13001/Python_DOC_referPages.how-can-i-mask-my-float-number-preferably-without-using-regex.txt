How can I format a float number to string, by using a mask?(I'm not proficient in regex, but if someone knows an one-line solution, why not?)Here is my problem:I have a float number like "6.88" and I need to format it using the following mask "00000000000.00"6.88 = "00000000006.88"14.3 = "00000000014.30"00.0 = "00000000000.00"I've already read the following post but I couldn't understood it:Format number number with specific mask regex pythonExample of my data:My not so efficient nor fast solution:convert from float to strsplit my string using the separator "."count chars before and after "."adapt my split[0] and split[1] to the mask, by using the length of these parametersdoneIs there an easier way to do this?
You'd use string formatting:According to 6.1.3.1. Format Specification Mini-Language,0 is the fill character.2 sets the precision to 214 is the width of the result string
Another example based on string formatting (not very nice or error prone):would yield: 00001.200
