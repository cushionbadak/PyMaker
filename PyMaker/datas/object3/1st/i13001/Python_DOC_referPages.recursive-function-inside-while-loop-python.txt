So I'm learning about recursion in Python and I have some code that finds the factorial of a number input by user.This code works fine. That is, it will ask the question specified, allow user input, and find the factorial of the number. So what I'm trying to do is to put that recursive function inside of a While loop so that after the program prints the factorial of the number submitted, it asks if the user would like to input another number.The issue I'm having with this code is that it will ask the user for an input number, find the factorial, and ask the question "Would you like to find the factorial of another non-negative integer? Y/N:" but when I run this in IDLE the line after the above question says "None."I looked through the Python documentation (section 4.6) and it mentions that the interpreter usually suppresses "None."Why, when I run this in IDLE, does it display "None" after the loop control question?Is there a way to omit the "None" and still use print()?
The reason why you are seeing the None is because you have a print inside your input: Remove that print
This line:print returns None, so you are inputing None into your factorial function, which then gives None as an answer.Should be:
