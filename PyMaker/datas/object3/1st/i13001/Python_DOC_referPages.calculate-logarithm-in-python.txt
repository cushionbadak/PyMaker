Natural Text
I am wondering why the result of log base 10 (1.5) in python = 0.405465108108 while the real answer = 0.176091259.This is the code that I wrote:Can someone tell how to solve this issue?
From the documentation:With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e).With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as log(x)/log(base).But the log10 is made available as math.log10(), which does not resort to log division if possible.
Use the log10 function in the math module.
The math.log function is to the base e, i.e. natural logarithm. If you want to the base 10 use math.log10.
If you use log without base it uses e.From the commentReturn the logarithm of x to the given base.  If the base not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.Therefor you have to use:
