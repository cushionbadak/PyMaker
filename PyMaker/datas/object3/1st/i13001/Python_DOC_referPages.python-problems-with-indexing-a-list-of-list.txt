I have this list of lists:mylist=[[1, 2, 4, 8], [16, 32, 64, 128], [256, 512, 1024, 2048]]Now I want to create a dictionary that assigns each key the value of the corresponding index in the list.In this case: correct_dict={0:1,1:2,2:4,3:8,4:16,...,11:2048}.I intend to do it with the following function:But this is what I get:wrong_dict={0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 16, 4: 32, 5: 64, 6: 256, 7: 512, 8: 1024}.So, len(correct_dict)=12, while len(wrong_dict)=9.Question: What makes me miss all the values that in the list are located in the third column?
Here's a corrected version of the function dictionarize3:You weren't referencing the correct parts. When trying to find the length of the whole array you were finding the length of one of he inside arrays, just a logic error.EDIT As pointed out by decltype_auto, it is not at all idiomatic to have an additional iterative variable which carries out the same function as one already declared in a for loop. I was answering so quickly that I didn't spot it! Has alternative and more efficient code:
That's a job for itertools.chainoutput:Question: What makes me miss all the values that in the list are  located in the third column?is a range that ends 1 before its argument; thus in your case one before 4 - 1 = 3 , thus at index 2, which skips the last elements with inner index 3.   EDITAnd that the outer loop appeared to work is just coincidence, because the outer list has length 3.what you needed is this:Your "i" is for the whole outer array, not for its first inner element! :) 
in your caselen(array[0]) = 4afterlen(array[0]) - 1 = 3range(3) = [0, 1, 2]and you work only with part of list [1, 2, 4, 8]Read about range
A dict seems very inappropriate here. A simple flat list would give you the same practical result:Here lst[0] is 1 and lst[11] is 2048.You can flatten the list like so:or:
If each list have the same length you can do it like this:

Easy task for dict comprehension and functional programming style:Explaining, you take the list, reduce it to a single list with all the values, enumerate it with the corresponding indexes and make a dict comprehension taking the index as key and the list number as values.
