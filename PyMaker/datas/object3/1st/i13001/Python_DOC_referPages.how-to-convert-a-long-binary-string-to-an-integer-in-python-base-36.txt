I have a bit string of length 128 and want to perform Bitwise AND on it. To do that, I want to first convert the bit string into a integer. However, python gives an error:My question is how can I convert a long bit string into an integer in Python? Or is there any other way that I can do Bitwise AND without converting the bit string into an integer?
int() takes a literal and base. What you are looking to do is convert the literal that is in base 2. The literal can be of any length:The python documentation for int() can be found here: Python2 Python3
If u want to create your function use functool.partialfrom functool import partialbase2int= partial(int(), 2)
