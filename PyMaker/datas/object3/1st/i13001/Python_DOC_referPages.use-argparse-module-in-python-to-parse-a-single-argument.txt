I used the OptParse module a few years back, and it seemed so easy, but seeing the argparse module, it doesn't seem intuitive to use. Thus, I'd like some help.I currently have (which isnt much yet):I'd like to be able to issue a command like python myscript.py --char 20 . This value for char flag will always be an int.If someone can please help, I'd greatly appreciate it! Thank you
This is how you add an argument, and retrieve it:You should check out the docs:https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmlAnd here's a tutorial:https://docs.python.org/2/howto/argparse.html
you need to add an argument to the parser object, and optionally specify the parameter type to be intif you execute this file withit should print 20 to the console
