Natural Text
I want to fill in a string with a specific format in mind. When I have a single value, it's easy to build it:but what if I have a long list of objectsand I want to construct the sentence in the exact same way:How would I be able to do that, given that I don't know the length of the list? Using format I could easily construct the string, but then I have to know the length of the list beforehand.
Use a str.join() call with a list comprehension* to build up the objects part:then interpolate that into the full sentence:Demo:* You could use a generator expression, but for a str.join() call a list comprehension happens to be faster.
