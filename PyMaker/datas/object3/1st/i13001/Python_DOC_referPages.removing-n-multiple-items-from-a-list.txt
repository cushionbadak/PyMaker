QuestionI want to remove items from a list such that I keep the first n items, and remove the next 2n items. For examplefor n=8, I want to keep the first 8, remove the next 16 and repeat this as necessary:a = range(48)Which I want to become[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]This is to pick out the first 8 hours of a day, and run a function on each hour.I've found it hard to phrase this in search queries so the answer is probably simple but I've had no luck!
You could just use a comprehension list:The above only create a new list. If you want to edit the list in place, you must explicitely delete unwanted elements, starting from the end to avoid changing indexes:
hours(8)Depending on how new you are you might have a hard time understanding this code, so I will try to explain a little:We start by creating a function which takes a parameter n which, for test purposes, we will be using 8 then we use a list comprehension to generate all our numbers (0, 48) and then delete the unneeded elements using the del statement, we are deleting from the nth to the n*3 element in the list. For example, if n were to be passed as 9 our use of the del statement could be translated as: del [9:27].Hope this makes sense.
This should be quite easy to understand
