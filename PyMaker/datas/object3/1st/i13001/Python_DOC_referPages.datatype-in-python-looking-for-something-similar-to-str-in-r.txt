I want to find the datatype of all the variables in a csv file in python. In R we can achieve the same using str() command .this gives an output like thisis there a similar way in python?
You probably want dtypes
An easy way to tell if a string represents a valid int is to simply attempt to convert the string to an int and catch the ValueError exception if it isn't a legal int. Similarly with float. Here's a brief demo in Python 2:outputHowever, normal Python code (generally) wouldn't use a function quite like that: it would assume that the data is correct and wrap the conversion code in a simple try: ... except ValueError:... else: block rather than using that crazy nested structure to test data before you're ready to process it. A sensible CSV won't have different datatypes in random positions, so your code shouldn't need to guess what type of data is in a give field. OTOH, not all CSV's are well-designed... :)
