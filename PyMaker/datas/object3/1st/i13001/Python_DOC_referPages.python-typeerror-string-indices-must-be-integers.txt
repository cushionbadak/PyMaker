I am new to Python! 
The problem you have right now is that during iteration in the list comprehension, the very first iteration changes the name dataset from meaning the dict you json.loads-ed to a key of that dict (dicts iterate their keys). So when you try to look up a value in dataset with dataset['identifier'], dataset isn't the dict anymore, it's the str key of you're currently iterating.Stop reusing the same name to mean different things.From the JSON you posted, what you probably want is something like:
The problem is that you are trying to iterate the dictionary instead of the list of datasources inside it. As a consequence, you're iterating through the keys of the dictionary, which are strings. Additionaly, as it was mentioned by above, you will have problems if you use the same name for the list and the iterator variable.This worked for me:
