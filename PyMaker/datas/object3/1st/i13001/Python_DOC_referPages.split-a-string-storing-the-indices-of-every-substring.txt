There is a cool native .split() in python, returning the list of substrings. Is there a native or, at least, not very nasty way to split by multiple delimiters and automatically get substring coordinates? Something like this:Of course, I can write some naive code myself. But my use case is much more complicated, it would be great to find something concise.
Using re.finditer:The pattern [^!?]+ to match characters that is not !, ?.used re.MatchedObject.group(0) to get the matched string.re.MatchedObject.start and re.MatchedObject.end to get the indices of matched parts.
