I have a really simple question. You know the formal grammar for Python on this link:https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/grammar.htmlIt says this is the grammar as it's given to the parser generator.Which generator does Python use? Also, does it output Python code?
If you want to parse Python code using Python you can use the https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html -- Abstract Syntax Tree module.
