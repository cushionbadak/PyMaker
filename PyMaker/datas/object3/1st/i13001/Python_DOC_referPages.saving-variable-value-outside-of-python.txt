I am new to python, been coding in school for about a year now, but I like to code when I get bored. I have made two programs but both are useless as I have to input each value of the variables every time I start it up. Is there anyway I can save the value of a variable externally so when it loads it will open up the file and assign each variable?
You should use the pickle module for that purpose:and for getting your variable back:If you have many variables to save, consider embedding them in a dictionary for instance.
Yo can use the shelve module its pretty simple it puts all variables into a dictionary then when your file reopens you can make shelve set the variables back. Here is a good example of using the shelve module.
To save data to a file, you could use Preferred in Python isbecause the file will be closed upon exiting the with block even if the block exits with an error, and without requiring the programmer to remember to close the file.Load the values back in with filehandle.readline() or readlines().You can also use the Python libraries json or csv to facilitate moving data into and out of files. If you have no need to inspect or modify the data in the file using another program (e.g. Notepad++ or MS Excel), you might prefer pickle or shelve.
