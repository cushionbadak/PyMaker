I am trying to run the following openssl command in python:This command is supposed to generate a fingerprint of the certificate. I am trying to capture the output through the file object. But when I read this file object, there's nothing in it. I have executed this command on the command line and it runs fine, generates the fingerprint. Could you tell me how can I get the fingerprint?  
You achieve this natively within Python using the OpenSSL module.
You can use two modules to establish what you want: subprocess and os.Using subprocess you can check for the output for the process using communicate(), which reads data from stdout and stderr until EOF.Using os module works fine as well, using both read() and readline() methods: (please note that os.popen() is deprecated)If you want to write the value to a file, that works as well, which you can verify by opening a file output.txt in your current working directory:The 77 notifies us that 77 bytes were written to the file, which you can verify by opening it in your favourite text editor.
