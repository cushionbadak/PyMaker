I really need some help with this code. I have to write code using the input file Unit 5 Dates.txt, containing dates in the form yyyy/mm/dd, read all lines into a list, find the earliest and the latest dates and print, then transform the date string into the form July 12, 2014 and print all dates. I have written the code and it's working fine, but I don't know how to transform the date into the form November 10, 2015.What your told me, I have do that, but it not working. What if i want to read it from a txt file name Unit 5 Dates.txt, that already have all the dates in it. For example, if you look at my code, I create a value returning function called get_list, and then I define it and open the Unit 5 dates.txt, file and read all the dates from the txt file.Here Iis what I have so far. I have have create a create a function called date_chnage and also I have define the function. But when I run the code it give me a error message.. Here is the error it's giving meFile "/Users/mohamedkeita/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/School/2015:2016 School/Python/Unit 5/KeitaM_Unit 5 copy.py", line 18, in main    changeDate = date_changer(dateList)  File "/Users/mohamedkeita/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/School/2015:2016 School/Python/Unit 5/KeitaM_Unit 5 copy.py", line 70, in date_changer    dateList = datechanger.datetime.strptime(datechanger, '%Y/%m/%d').date()TypeError: must be str, not module
Use datetime:Prints:You can use a datetime date for max and min as well:While I am using dates.splitlines() in the example, that could be another source -- such as a file. In the case where you have YYYY/MM/DD as digits in a string, you can also just use lexicographical sorting to determine min/max as well:If you need to convert or validate a date, use datetime.
