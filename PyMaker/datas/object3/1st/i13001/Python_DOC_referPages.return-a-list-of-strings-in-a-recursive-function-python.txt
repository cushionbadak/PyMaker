I'm trying to return a list of strings from the function Groups(s,k) where basically, the list of strings of 'k' elements from string 's' k>=0 and k<= len(s) and these elements in the these strings occur in the same order as 's' as shown below   Groups("abcde", 2) â†’ ["ab","ac","ad","ae","bc","bd","be","cd","ce,"de"] Groups("abcde",5) â†’ ["abcde"]Groups("abcde",1) â†’ ["a","b","c","d","e"]        I'm really sorry for my wording of the question as it's hard to understand but here is what I have so far:I would greatly appreciate any help:)
