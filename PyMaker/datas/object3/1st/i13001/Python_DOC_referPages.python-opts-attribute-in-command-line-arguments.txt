In the following code, I am trying to parse the arguments of the command line:When I run the code, I got:The command line is:Why does the opts have null values?
Testing this with only the actual arguments getting passed to getopt, I get the expected behaviour:Per the documentation:args is the argument list to be parsed, without the leading reference to the running program.If you also have 'python' and your script name in sys.argv, you need to slice more from the start of it. You could also consider switching to argparse, as suggested in the getopt docs.
Since I use Spyder, the problem was with the command arguments. The command must be:without python Practice5.pyIn the regular command line, it works fine with python Practice5.py
I'd suggest you use argparse; it's far easier once you understand.
