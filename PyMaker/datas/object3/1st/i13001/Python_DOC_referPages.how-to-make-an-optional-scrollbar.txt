Natural Text
The following code is meant to: ask the use to import a text file, store the lines of the file in a list then display that list on a label. My problem is when the user tries to import a text file which is really long. Right now, not all the text will be displayed if it is a long file. I'd like to know how to have a scrollbar/scrolling frame appear once the length of the file reaches a certain length.
Just use a scrolledtext widget instead of a label.  Is there some special consideration why this won't work for you?  You can configure it so the user can't modify the text, if that's the issue.  Just configure it with state=tk.DISABLED
I like this solution from PurityLake: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15227842/709998I think you might be able to at least modify it if your requirements are slightly different.
