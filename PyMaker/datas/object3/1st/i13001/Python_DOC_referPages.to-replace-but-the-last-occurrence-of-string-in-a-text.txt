This question already has an answer here:Python: replace terms in a string except for the last                    3 answers                Suppose I have this piece of text:I want all but the last and to be replaced with a comma:Is there an easy way to do that in regex? As far as I know, the replace method in regex replaces the strings all the way through. 
str.replace() method has a count argument:str.replace(old, new[, count])Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.Then, use str.count() to check how many and in the string and then -1 (because you need the last and):str.count(sub[, start[, end]])Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.Demo:
If you want a regex solution, you could match all the ands which are followed by another one later in the string.(?=...) is a lookahead which makes sure there is a match later in the string without including it in the actual match (so also not in the substitution).  It's sort of like a conditional on the match.
