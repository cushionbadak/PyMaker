I try to copy a file with pathlibI get this exception:... how to copy file with pathlib in Python 2.7?
So what about this?The problem is pathlib.Path create a PosixPath object if you're using Unix/Linux, WindowsPath if you're using Microsoft Windows.But shutil.copy() need string as arguments. So just use str() here, when you use str() function on a Path object it will return the original path.
The cause for shutil.copy() not working is that you are not using the latest Python, Python 3.6 shutil.copy() can handle Path objects (or subclasses thereof). That for older versions of Python this throws an error is because those implementations of shutil expect string arguments for copy, and not pathlib.Path type arguments. What you actually want to be able to write is:You can subclass Path to include such a method, and adapt the creation of my_file. I find it easier to just graft/monkey-patch/duck-punch it on the existing pathlib.PathYou can put this code anywhere you like, as long as it gets executed before calling the .copy method on any of the Path instances. The argument to .copy() can be a file or a directory.
Since Python 3.5, without importing shutil, you can do:For Python 2.7, pathlib2 provides the read_bytes, read_text, write_bytes and write_text methods.The file will be loaded in memory, so this method is not suitable for files larger than the machines available memory.As per the comments, one can use write_bytes and read_bytes to copy text files, but if you need to deal with the encoding at copy time write_text an read_text present the advantage of two extra parameters:encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the fileerrors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handledThey both have the same meaning as in open().
You can use pathlib rename method instead of shutil.move().
