This is incomplete. But the problem here is that I might get the same value again. How do I circumvent this situation?
You can use random.shuffle to achieve a shuffled list from the original list. But as it mutate the original list, make a copy of original list first.
You'd use random.sample. It will select the required number of non-repeating elements from arr:There's no need for the loop, since you can modify rand_arr via slice assigment.
What about using random.shuffle:If you want a smaller list, you can use slicing.
