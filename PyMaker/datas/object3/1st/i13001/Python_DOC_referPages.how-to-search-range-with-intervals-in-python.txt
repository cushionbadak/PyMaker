Natural Text
I've been given a project and although I've managed to get it to work, part of it looks very messy and I can't think of what I'm sure is a simple fix to it. My knowledge of programming is minimal so most Google searches for it have confused me and I don't really know how to define what I want. Anyone here is the code:I think you can see what I'm trying to do but I've had to list it as separate ranges each time, help will be much appreciated!
One option for shortening a lot of ors is to use any, something like:or just use arithmetic, if the values will always be integers:Alternatively, as you seem to have a regular pattern of ranges (i.e. between 25 and 76 in every hundred), you could use modulo (%) to strip away the hundreds:and add in x < 776 if that's a fixed upper limit
