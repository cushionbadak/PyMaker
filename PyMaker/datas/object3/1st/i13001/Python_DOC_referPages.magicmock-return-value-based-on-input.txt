Natural Text
I am trying to refactor my tests from flexmock to mock. Given the following syntax from flexmock:How can I rewrite this using Mock? In particular, how do I pin a return value to a spesific input using Mock?
You can use side_effect patch attribute to do it:I'm quite sure that you can find it little bit harder compared to flexmock's syntax, but what you need is more a stub than a mock. If you can design your test to be isolated and configure your mock/stub in some setup stage maybe you will find this syntax good and all mock asserts and patch options very powerful.
