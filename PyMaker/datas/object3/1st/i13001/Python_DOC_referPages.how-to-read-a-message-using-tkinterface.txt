Your code is close, but you're trying to read from the file name rather than the opened file object. Change your code to this:Better yet, use a context manager which will automatically close the file when you're done:The python documentation has a nice tutorial on reading and writing files: Python 2 - Reading and writing filesPython 3 - Reading and writing files Unrelated to the actual question, there are a couple problems with your code.First, there's no need for this statement:In this case, file_name is already a string since it is coming from an Entry widget.Second, the index 0.0 in the statement password_output.delete(0.0, END) is incorrect. Text widget indexes must be strings in the form of <line>.<column>, and lines start at 1 (one). The proper index for the first character is the string "1.0".
