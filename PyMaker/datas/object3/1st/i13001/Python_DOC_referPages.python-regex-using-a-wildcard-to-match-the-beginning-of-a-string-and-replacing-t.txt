I'm trying to match the beginning of a word and then replace the entire word with something.  Below is what I'm trying to do.Below is the regex statement I'm using.But this code gives me the following.
add* is ad '*d'. From the document:'*'Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match a, ab, or a followed by any number of bs.So it matchs ad or add or adddddd.... But it doesn't match neither add23khh234 nor add2asdf675(or something like these). You should use .+? or .*? here(not .*, that's greedy). Try something like this:Demo:
Try this
if you have mulitple patterns on one line
Short answerA quantifier such as * is applied to the previous token or subpattern. for example, the regex you're using add* matches a literal ad followed by any number of subsequent d.Meeting your criteriaYou need to match add at the beggining of a word, so use a word boundary \bThen you also need to match the rest of the word in order to replace it. \w is a shorthand for [a-zA-Z0-9_], which matches 1 word character, and that's what you need to repeat any number of times with *.CodeOutputideone demo
