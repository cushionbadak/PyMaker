I have a timestamp like:2014-01-01T05:00:00.000ZHow do I convert this so that I can easily get the month like "January"? And in general convert it to a nice format like:January 1st, 2014
You can use datetime module. datetime.datetime expects a time string and its formatting and returns a datetime.datetime object, on which you can call strftime() to format it according to your needs.There is also a python-dateutils module, which can do the same.
The strftime() method in datetime modulecan achieve this. It expects a string pattern explaining how you want to format your date.The above code prints something like "It is 12 Nov 2015"You can find more format codes at https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
