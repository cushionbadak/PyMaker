I am using subprocess module to interact with output of the  linux commands. below is my code.My program hangs while executing second subprocess i.e. I got to know that the reason of process hang is buffer redirected to subprocess.PIPE is getting filled, which blocks the process from writing further.I want to know if there is any way to avoid the buffer full situation so that my program keeps on executing without any hang issue ?
The actual issue is that there is a whitespace missing between the pattern and the filename and therefore grep waits for input on the standard input (stdin). "buffer full" (.communicate() is not susceptible) or p.stdout.read() (it fixes nothing: it loads the output into memory and unlike .communicate() it fails if more than one pipe is used) are a red herring here.Drop shell=True and use a list argument for the command:
As it says at https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate:Note: The data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method  if the data size is large or unlimited.Instead, use the file objects to read the text as it is produced:As long as no other pipes (e.g. stderr) fill up while you are reading, the process shouldn't be blocked.
