I have code that is like:How do I access Bar or Foo from f? f.__dict__ is of little to no help, but as repr(f) gives <bound method Bar.foo of <__main__.Bar object at 0x10c6eec18>>' it must be possible, but how?
Each bound method has the __self__ attribute which is theinstance to which this method is bound, or None(copied from here)More about bound methods (from Data Model):If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace)  through an instance, you get a special object: a bound method (also  called instance method) object. ... Bound methods have two special  read-only attributes: m.__self__ is the object on which the method  operates...So f.__self__ will get you the class instance:And type(f.__self__) or f.__self__.__class__ will get you the type object:You'd only use __class__ for old-style classes.
