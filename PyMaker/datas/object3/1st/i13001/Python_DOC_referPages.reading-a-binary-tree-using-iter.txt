I have a standard Binary Tree that reads like    1   / \2  3/ \ / \4  5 6  7I need to read the binary tree by importing my tree class, creating this tree, and then using a for loop to read it like: [4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7]I have already made the tree and my program will generate a like tree with any amount of numbers. My problem is in the method.def iter(self):So far I have:But when I run a for loop on the tree object like:for item in tree:    print("{}: {}").format(item.name, item.height())It only prints the first node in my try with a correct height.My question is basically, how to print this binary tree using recursion?
In Python >= 3.3, one can use the yield from x syntax for recursive iterators:Edit: Python 3.3 support confirmed.
Not tried, but probably rather something like:But check it first.
Next element from the collection should be returned by __next__(): What is the interface for python iterators? __iter__() should return an iterator, an object that defines __next__() method. yield is used in generator which is quite different concept than iterators, but you can use generator function (because it is an iterator), i.e.:
