I'm probably going about this in the wrong way but in this scenario how do I obtain the index of the random item in the list, and how to compare it to the index of the random item +1? i know if it was the last item in the list this would not work, however lets ignore that for now.
Instead of using random.choice to get a random list item, you could just use random.randrange to get a random list index.You could also make sure that way that you get an index before the last element, so there is always a next element you could compare it to:
