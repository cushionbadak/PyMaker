I have this code:which creates array from long int, and everything ok when i compile this code in my linux environment, Cython translates this l type into long int, but in some windows compilers this long int is a 4-bytes long.I want to create an array from 8-byte int (long long), but i don't know what is code for long long in Cython? I.e. what should i place instead of "l" at that line?And 2nd question: I used long(string) in Cython code before, to parse long from string, but what should i use now to get long long numbers from string?Updated: According to this https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html it's 'q', but seems that this solution will work only in 3.xUpdated: After @DavidW suggestion i rewrote that code to this:
If you're able to use numpy you can specify 64 bit integers quite easily.or equivalently(you can substitute a wide variety of array creation functions for zeros).To convert to a 64 bit int from a string you can just doI don't know of a good general solution if you want to only use the standard library.Note that nothing in this answer is actually Cython specific - it will work as just as well with pure Python.
