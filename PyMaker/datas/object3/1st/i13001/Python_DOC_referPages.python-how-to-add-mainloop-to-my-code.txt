I've been trying to figure out how to use how to place a mainloop() in my GUI so I don't need to have a while(True) anymore.  At the bottom of my code is an example of how I've been using this code. I know this is a lot of code to go through, so any help is appreciated
If I understand your question correctly, I would do the main-loop as:https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#a-simple-hello-world-programand then refactor a bit.Your current for tag in tags-loop can be done inside drawShape where you set the tags anyway. This will convert your program to be event driven.
