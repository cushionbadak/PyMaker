Natural Text
I am currently writing a program that will take in a text file, and then count the frequency of each word in the file, after lower casing every word and stripping its punctuation. Here is my code:I am getting the error: But I fail to see how it can be out of range. Neither index nor i go out of range as far as I can tell. I am new to Python and am having a lot of trouble with the 'for' loop syntax. Any tips would be much appreciated. 
In your code, word[index] indeed does not exist. What you should do instead is word.append(WORD[i]).
A better approach might be to use a defaultdict:This is a more pythonic way to count frequencies, rather than maintaining indexes.  The words are in d.keys() and their frequencies are in d.values()
