How do I make a function which can restart my entire program, without using a while loop......I have tried and tried again (many times) and have not been able to make it work with a GUI (tkinter)
You can use execl, which replaces the current process with a new process. You can give it the exact same arguments as the current process, effectively restarting your program:Pay close attention to the documentation: this function does not return, and it doesn't close any connections or open files. Make sure you prepare your app for an immediate exit before calling.
You can use os.execl for this purpose.There's a snippet over hereYou can find more information about those functions in the documentation
