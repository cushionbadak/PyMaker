I want to use unittest in python to check if a method returns object of the right class.Every example in the web shows tests for 'type' returned.For example, to check for  <type 'list'> or   <type 'type'> , we could use:What I am looking for is an example to check for <class'sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query'>Would appreciate any help. Thankyou.
You could use assertIsInstance(), presumably using isinstance() which is the recommended function for testing types. You could also assertIs() or assertTrue() combined with type() depending on the context:The assertion error of the test_assert_is(self) might lead one to believe the type of 1 is not integer however it's comparing the object represented by 1 and the object that describes the type of an integer. This is most likely why isinstance() is preferred since it's more verbose about what it's checking and less typing is involved, so in general less error prone.
This should work:You need to have import sqlalchemy in the file.
