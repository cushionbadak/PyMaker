I'am not able to cleanup the count_timer (sleep) below, when this counter is interrupted and finished by another timer event (the stop_future). Result:Update-1: cancel count_timer (wrapped in a future)Result:
asyncio.wait_for implements much of what you are trying to do. Combine it with asyncio.shield to prevent your Future from being cancelled when the timeout expires:Edit: In case it wasn't clear, this goes in the while loop, replacing the call to asyncio.wait.Update by voscausa: showing the codeWith:Result:  
You've configured wait() to return upon the sooner of the timer finishing or the user cancelling the loop. It sounds like you want to cancel the count_timer in the case that it wasn't the future that caused the wait call to return. You can learn this simply by asking which of the two futures is done.
