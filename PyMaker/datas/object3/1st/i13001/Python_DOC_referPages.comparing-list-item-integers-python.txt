Natural Text
I am writing a program which saves the last 3 scores in a text file for each user of my game. I have already written the code that saves it I am now bringing the data back into the program which will work out the users high scores . I also already have the scores saved in separate lists All users 1st score saved in 1 list all users 2nd score in another and the same for 3rd score. I am trying to put these in their own high score list so when I joint the lists with the names(in another list) I will be able to sort by score but will be attached to name. Bellow is the code I have written:By the way it is in a for loop for i in range 2 as their are currently only 2 users. I know I'm being incredibly stupid by having the or as it means only one event needs to be true for it to work but when I tried and it didn't work either. Please work along these lines as my tutor said 'I had the right idea' I also hope this helps anyone else which is comparing list items with integers in python as I couldn't find anything on the internet . Thanks,I await guidance
You want to use and, not or.You can also use a < b < c syntax instead of using and.What you should really do is use Python's built-in max function. A clean, single-liner instead of that 6-line if-elif block.
Probably not allowed for this assignment, but for others who need to do something similar, the easy/fast way to select the top 3 values from a large sequence of values is to use heapq.nlargest. If you have multiple sequences, you can itertools.chain them to avoid concatenating (avoid increases in peak memory usage). You can even attach the names (with zip and itertools.repeat) to each input sequence so the selected high scores include the associated user:highscores would then be a list with three elements (from highest to lowest score, ties broken by user name), each element being a tuple of the form (score, username).
