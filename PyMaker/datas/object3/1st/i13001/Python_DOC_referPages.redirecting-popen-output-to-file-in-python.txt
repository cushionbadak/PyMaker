I have seen lot of answers that stdout=file will redirect to a file. But I had a couple of queries.Why doesn't >file work.Is this fineIn my case I am trying to run a script in an infinite loop(which does not stop) and there is some other processes monitoring its output. Does the script keeps writing into it even after f is closed. If yes, how does it work?
Because subprocess doesn't allow use > to redirect neither output nor error message, from the document:stdin, stdout and stderr specify the executed program’s standard input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively. Valid values are PIPE, DEVNULL, an existing file descriptor (a positive integer), an existing file object, and None. PIPE indicates that a new pipe to the child should be created.  DEVNULL indicates that the special file os.devnull will be used. With the default settings of None, no redirection will occur; the child’s file handles will be inherited from the parent. Additionally, stderr can be STDOUT, which indicates that the stderr data from the applications should be captured into the same file handle as for stdout.And you should use the following code:Because you're using with, so no need close the file.
I think you must try,
