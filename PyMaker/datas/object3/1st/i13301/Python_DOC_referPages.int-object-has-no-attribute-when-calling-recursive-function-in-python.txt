Not sure what is wrong with the Python code below. Will appreciate any help. I have looked into here and here, but could not solve my issue.Code:Error

self needs to be the first argument to a class function.  Change to 
change your method signature to def factorial(self, n)instead ofdef factorial(n, self)because when you call a class method via object. python expects reference to the class object as a first parameter. in your case it's 'int'. which is not reference to the class object.
