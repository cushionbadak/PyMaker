I am really really new on python. I have three col and about 7000~8000 rows on the excel file. How can I calculate the mean and std for each col after importing the data to python.
You can use pandas to do this:
You should check out the functions in the Sheet class of xlrd.If you are using python 3.4+ there is a standard library module for statistics which will do mean and standard deviation. Check out the documentation here and decide whether you need stdev or pstdev. Otherwise here is a previous answer that provides some example code for the mean and standard deviation operations.
You can use numpy library for calculate the std of a huge number of values in a excel sheet.See this code below:import csvThe output of this code will show an array of stds of each column.
