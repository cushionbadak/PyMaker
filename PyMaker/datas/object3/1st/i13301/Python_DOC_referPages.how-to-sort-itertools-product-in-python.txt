This is Product from itertools:     But I wanna change to: --> Ax Bx Cx Dx Ay By Cy DyHow can I do that?
Change the order of arguments and reverse tuples product yields. It'll probably be more efficient than sorting, since it doesn't need to build intermediate list.Example:
You'll probably be most efficient if you swap the order of the product and then simply reverse each of the yielded items:Of course, this is a horrible name for the function (since we aren't really sorting).The advantage here is that you don't actually need to sort (which is an O(NlogN) processing step).  So this ends up being an O(N) algorithm  (where N is len(first) * len(second))
not overly elegant but it works:
