Natural Text
I'm trying to learn Python 3. This is an example I am trying to learn from. So here I define a function to read text. Open a file, read the contents, print it, then close.So this code runs well. The thing I don't understand, however, is why we write:print(contents_of_file), but not read(quotes). How come it's quotes.read()? As far I can understand both print() and read() are functions and I expected both to be used the same way. What am I missing here - please help?Is there a rule when to put stuff inside brackets and when not to?
print() is a function. read() is a method of the object bound to quotes. As such, read must be referred to by accessing quotes. Only then can we add parens to invoke it.
You've stumbled across the often argued definitions of functions and methods.read() is a method that belongs to quotes (which is an instance of a class, I don't actually know the name of which).  Technically, Methods belong to Objects, Functions are normally defined in a style that isn't strictly Object Orientated, or in global scope (like all C functions).It might be worth reading up on the OOP aspects of Python, this will likely help you understand it more.
quotes is a file object. I understand you don't yet know what is an object. But try printing quotes.This object has a function read() whose purpose is to read contents from the file. To call a function of an object, you have to write:As this is exactly what we want, we are just calling that function. So  we are writing:print doesn't belongs to any of these type of objects. So, we can call it without any object reference.
