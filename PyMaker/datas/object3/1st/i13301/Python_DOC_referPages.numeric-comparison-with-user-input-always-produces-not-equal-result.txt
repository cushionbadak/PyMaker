I want to get a number input by the user via input() and compare it with a specific value, i.e., 3.However, I have the impression my if statement doesn't work. The comparison is always False.
Python 3 input function returns string.Try like this
Some things you could do on your own to get to the root of the problem:Ways to get to know the type of the object:Unlike Python 2.x, the function input() returns a string object (and does not blindly evaluate the expression provided by the user):input([prompt]):If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. [...]This should give an idea how to fix it (compare numbers to numbers).For further reading:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#inputhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#typehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reprHow does Python compare string and int?Asking the user for input until they give a valid response
You can also try this as an alternative:Adding int will convert the variable to int data type. 
you should check your tabs (I recomend you to use four spaces, not regular tabs and not to mix them)
