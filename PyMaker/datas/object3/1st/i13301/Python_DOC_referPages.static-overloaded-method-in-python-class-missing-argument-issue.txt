I have a class db defined like so:So, as you can see, my class has two methods. Most importantly it has a static method Connect which internally tries to call a non-static method Connect. However, when I try to use my program, I get an error message:d.Connect()TypeError: Connect() missing 1 required positional argument ...It seems like the static method tries to call itself, however I want to make it call another non-static method. So, what am I doing wrong?
You redefined the Count method. Python doesn't support overloading; you cannot define both a regular method and a static method. You only have the staticmethod version because it was defined last, it replaced the non-static version altogether.If you need a method that alters its behaviour based on wether or not it is bound (static vs. a regular method) you have two options; either test the type of the self argument (it'll be an integer or an instance of the db class), or you'll have to build a custom descriptor object that can alter how your method is called based on the context; on an instance or on the class.Testing the type of self looks like this:If using a custom descriptor, you could build one that supports two different functions like the property object does:then use it like this:Quick demo of the descriptor:
