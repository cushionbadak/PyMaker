This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I have to create a calculator for a small piece of schoolwork and I ask for inputs for the numbers and the symbol that will be used:I want to know if there is any way I can make the int(input()) be asked again if they enter anything apart from an integer. I'm not really good with Python atm so apologies if I missed something obvious.Also sorry if this thread is a duplicate.
The canonical method in python would be something like:Note that if the user inputs 1.0 (or some other decimal that is also an integer), this will still throw ValueError (thanks  Robáµ© ); if you need to handle floats that happen to be integers, you could do val = int(float(val)), but that will also accept (and silently round down) floating numbers ... 
To know a variables type do type(var). So, basically what you need to do:
Try isinstance method (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance)in your case write a conditional, like,The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type  of an object, because it takes subclasses into account.
I'm going to assume Python 2.7 for this answer.I suggest first getting the input as a string, using raw_input, andthen trying to convert that to an integer.  Python will raise anexception if the conversion fails, which you can catch and prompt theuser to try again.Here's an example:and here's a sample execution, with inputs:On Python 3, you'd need to use input instead of raw_input; inPython 2, input evaluates the user input as a Python expression,which is rarely what is desired.
