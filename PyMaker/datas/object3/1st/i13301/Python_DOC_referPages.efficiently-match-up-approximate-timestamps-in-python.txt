I have two lists of timestamps obtained from two separate sensors, like so:I would like to efficiently extract the index in sensor of values that closest match each value in reference.In the above example reference[0] is an earlier timestamp than sensor[0] and should therefore be discarded. I would like the code to return [indexof(100000.00123), indexof(100000.9924)].The list of both reference and sensor timestamps is already sorted.My attempt is this:
of use  bisectyou can you bisect module, it will find for 100001.0 in reference     index 3 in sensor that is 100000.9924bisect
