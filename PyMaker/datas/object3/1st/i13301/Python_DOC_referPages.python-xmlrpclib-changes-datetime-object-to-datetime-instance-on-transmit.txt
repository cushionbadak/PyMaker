Messages exchanged between a client and a server using the xmlrpclib using Python 2.6.x creates a type of 'instance' on server side instead of type 'datetime'. On the client side I create a new results inwhen being send, the dictionary looks like this on the client side:but the incoming dictionary on the server side looks like this:printing the type and its string representation looks like this:We are using xmlrpclib.ServerProxy but changing use_datetime either to True or False does not make any difference at all.Why is this happening? I expected a tpye 'datetime.datetime' on the receiving side as well.
You have to convert the xmlrpc.datetime format to a python datetime.datetime object. The simplest way I have found to transform the object is: 
The use_builtin_types=True works for me. All datetime values have type <class 'datetime.datetime'>.Without this parameter all datetime were <class 'xmlrpc.client.DateTime'>The Python3 XML-RPC client documentation says: The obsolete use_datetime flag is similar to use_builtin_types but it applies only to date/time values.
