I have an xml file, with some data that I am extracting and placing in a numpy record array. I print the array and I see the data is in the correct location. I am wondering how I can take that information in my numpy record array and place it in a table. Also I am getting the letter b when I print my record, how do I fix that?Xml dataCode in pythonOutput
You are using Python3, which uses unicode strings.  It displays byte strings with the b.  The xml file may also be bytes, for example, encoding='UTF-8'.You can get rid of the b, by passing the strings through decode() before printing.More on writing csv files in Py3Numpy recarray writes byte literals tags to my csv file?In my tests, I can simplify the display by making the inst_rec array use unicode strings ('U20')producingandAs ASCII table displayIf you want anything fancier you need to specify the display tool - html, rich text, etc.with the added package prettyprint:producesIn Python3 I am still using the unicode dtype.  prettyprint will display the b if the any of the strings are byte.
To avoid printing b'xxx', try this:
