I have a list of ngram terms and I want to use the tests present in the NLTK toolkit to rank the terms. But in NLTK.collocations there are only BigramCollocationFinder, TrigramCollocationFinder, QuadgramCollocationFinder. What can I do if I have a 5gram, 6gram in the terms list?
In order to realise an NGramCollocationFinder you need to get rid of the multiude of i&x variables. To get rid of them you need to see that the pattern used are all combinations of a list of n items. The next step is to replace the variables with a dictionary using this combination as keys.Finally you need to build some logic to update each combination based upon the given w# variables if an index is present in the combination set.  It can be done, but I suggest doing it for n=3 or n=4 for starters, where you can verify the logic in existing classes. When these are correct, you can use it for larger n's.Finding the combinationsThere is a powerset() generator in the recipes section of the itertools documentation which you can use to realise the combinations1. Here the (1,2) tuple corresponds to the iix variable, and the (1,3) tuple corresponds to the ixi variable. So based on the tuple length, and the presence of the different indexes it is possible to replace all the i&x variables.Do tuple logicAnother tool you need to achieve your goal, is to be able to add to tuples. This is needed to extend/replace the arguments within score_ngram(). Here is a really simple example on how to add to a tuple:The rest, as they say, is left for you to implement. For some help on sections you need to analyze see my answer on the related question: "Transform QuadgramCollationFinder into PentagramCollationFinder".1 Thanks to Cyphase describing this in this answer
