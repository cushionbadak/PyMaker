Natural Text
With:I want to find the position of the keyword in the sentence. So far, I have this code which gets rid of the punctuation and makes all letters lowercase:I know need a piece of code which actually finds the position of the word.
This is what str.find() is for :This will give you the start position of the word (if it exists, otherwise -1), then you can just add the length of the word to it in order to get the index of its end.
If with position you mean the nth word in the sentence, you can do the following:This will split the sentence after each occurence of a space and save the sentence in a list (word-wise). If the sentence contains the keyword, list.index() will find its position.EDIT:The if statement is necessary to make sure the keyword is in the sentence, otherwise list.index() will raise a ValueError.
