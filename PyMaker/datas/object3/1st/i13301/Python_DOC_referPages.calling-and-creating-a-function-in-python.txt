Now suppose i create a program which uses multiplybyfive(x) in it, do i have to define it again in this new program or can i simply call it somehow?
You can import the python file which contains function multiplybyfive(x) into your new file. For example, if you write multiplybyfive(x) in file mathfunction.py file.You can use it in a new program by
