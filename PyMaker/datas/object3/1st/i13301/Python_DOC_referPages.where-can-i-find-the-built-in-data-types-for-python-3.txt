This is probably a really dumb question, but I'm new to programming and I want to understand how the in-built classes and their methods work. I've tried searching for builtins on my computer (I can't find it for some strange reason -- but perhaps it's that obvious and I just can't find it.), or is there something a little more low level going on there that I'm unaware of?If it is just in a builtin python module and I'm dumb, where can this be found?Thanks.
The most common implementation of Python is actually written in C. (Thus it is usually called CPython... not to be confused with Cython.) Thus, built in functions and classes are most frequently written in C. An example. As such, it's hard to get more detailed than the documentation without delving a great deal more thoroughly into the internals of Python and a language that you likely don't need or want to know at this point. The stdtypes documentation for Python 3 should include all of the detail you need for working with the language.
