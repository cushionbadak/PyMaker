I have a csv file with data like this:WHat I want to do is loop through my csv and add together the rows that have the same name, the string at the end of each row wil always remain the same for that name so there is no fear of it changing. How would I go about changing it to this in python?EDIT:In my code, the first thing I did was sort the list into order so the same names would be near each other, then I tried to use a for loop to add the numbered lines together by checking if the name value is the same on the first column. It's a very ugly way of doing it and I am at my wits end.
The pandas way is very simple:If you need to do further analysis and statistics Pandas will take you a long way with little effort. For the use case here is like using a hammer to kill a fly, but I wanted to provide this alternative.
