I found lot's of documentation about lists in Python. But I did not find an answer for the following case:I have a list like this: [False, False, False, VARIABLE, False, False].Does exist a way in order to get the VARIABLE value (is an integer) without a for loop on each element and using list comprehension? A kind of "which", in order to say: Select items in the list WHICH are not False. Important point, the VARIABLE will always be unique in the list. There is no possibility to have two VARIABLE in the list. EDITIn my case, the solution given by @AChampion is the best one. Thank you for this tip. I had to get the value of VARIABLE, which is exactly what I have with your solution.
You can use reduce (functools.reduce in Python3) if the integer is non-zeroYou can use a generator expression also hereAlso check the package first
