This question already has an answer here:What does << represent in python?                    4 answers                I tried to find answer here, but didn't find.What does ">>" and "<<" means in python?Examples in interpreter:Find usage here https://stackoverflow.com/a/14854406/4436022
<< and >> are the Binary Left Shift and Binary Right Shift respectively.The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.Example, Code: temp = 14 << 2The variable temp has a value of 56 because 14 (00001110 in binary) shifted left two bits equals 56 (00111000 in binary).The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.Example, Code: temp = -14 >> 2temp has a value of -4: -14 (11110010 in two's complement binary) shifted right two bits equals -4 (11111100 in two's complement binary).
It's bit shift, like in C.  Please read this link.Basically << 1 multiplies an integer by 2 in a fast way while >> 1 do a integer division by 2.  << n is like doing << 1 n times, so it multiplies by 2**n. In the same way, >> n do an integer division by 2**n.Technically, if you represent your numbers in binary (as computers do), << shift all the bits on the left and >> shifts all the bits to the right.Thus 3, represented in binary by (00000011) becomes (00001100) when applied with <<2.  (00001100) is the representation of 12.  Again, 3>>1 shift (00000011) to (00000001) which is 1, the same result as 3 div 2.
These operators are bit shift :>> shifts the bit pattern to the right - i.e. moves all the bits to the right - equivalent to dividing by a power of two<< shifts the bit patter to the left - i.e. moves all the bits to the left - equivalent to multiplying by a power of two :5 >> 2 = 1 :equivalent to 101 base 2 shifted right by 2 = 001 base 2 = 1and 1 << 2  = 4 :equivalent to 001 base 2 shifted left by 2 = 100 base 2 = 4
