Below is the snippet that is giving me 'Memory Error' when the counter reaches to about 53009525. I am running this on Ubuntu Virtual Machine with 12GB of memory. Both freq and trans store a type "State". Ant help is appreciated. Here is the error:...
It looks as though on each iteration you are appending a Python float inside two nested lists to trans_mat. You can check the size of each element using sys.getsizeof:On each iteration you are appending 2 * 80 + 24 = 184 bytes to trans_mat. After 53009525 iterations you will have appended 9753752600 bytes or 9.75GB.A very simple way to make this much more memory-efficient would be to store the results directly to a numpy array rather than in nested lists:For reference:
