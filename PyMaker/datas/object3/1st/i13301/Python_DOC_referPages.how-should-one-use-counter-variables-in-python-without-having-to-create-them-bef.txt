This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                Let's say I have to loop over something and keep counters of various characteristics as the loop progresses. Before the loop, I could create these various counter variables with initial values.Alternatively, I could create the counter variable when it is first actually used by using a conditional statement in the loop that creates the variable if it doesn't exist and then the variable is incremented.Is there a more compact or efficient way to do this?
Don't bother.  If you need a variable, define it.  It's going to happen one way or another.You can use a defaultdict, and then just increment various keys on the dict.  The keys will be initialized for you.  This is preferable to creating "variable variables".If you want to count something as you iterate over it, use enumerate.Both your counter examples could be easily derived from a single count this way.  (They could also just be derived from the length of the data).
