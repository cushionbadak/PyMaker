I have a python program defined by a function myFunc(m,n)Basically, the function contains two for loops.I would like to calculate the time elapsed for m,n=20,20I do it like this:The result is 0.0 almost always. Why?
Per the time.time docs, even though the time is always returned as a floating point number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.So if myFunc takes less than a second and you are using such an OS, then the difference between two calls of time.time could be 0.0.You could use timeit.default_timer instead of time.time. timeit.default_timer will choose the best timer (time.time, time.clock or time.perf_counter) for your system.Also note that the timeit module offers more accurate ways to test the performance of code snippets.
Because time.time() - time.time() will be 0.0 when myFunc doesn't take very long.
