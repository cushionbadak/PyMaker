Say I have a function in Python that uses a constant computed float value like 1/3.If I call the function repeatedly, will the value of 1/3 be automatically cached for efficiency? Or do I have to do something manually such as the following?
Find out for yourself! The dis module is great for inspecting this sort of stuff:As you can see, the 1/3 calculation happens every time. (Note: I changed 3 to 3. to force float division, otherwise it'd just be 0. You can also enable future-division, which actually changed the behavior, see edit section below). And your second approach:More information on the second can be found by inspecting the function object:You can see the default value is cached in there.EDIT: Turns out this is a little more interesting -- in Python 3 they do get cached (and also in Python 2.7 when you enable from __future__ import division):Switching to integer division (//) in either Python 3 or 2.7-with-future-division doesn't change this, it just alters the constant to be a 0 instead of 0.333.. Also, using integer division directly in 2.7 without future-division will cache the 0 as well. Learned something new today!
