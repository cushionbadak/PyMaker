Consider the following minimal program:According to my understanding of the documentation for the multiprocessing module, this code should execute mp_test() in a separate process, which means that it should execute in parallel with the main process. Therefore, I expect the following output:However, the actual output I get is this:Why is this? What changes do I need to make to get the result I'm expecting?
According to the documentation:In multiprocessing, processes are spawned by creating a Process object and then calling its start() method.So it seems you should call p.start(), which will in turn call p.run() in a separate thread, which should give the result you want.Calling p.run() directly skips the whole multi-threaded bit.
Try p.start() instead of p.run().
