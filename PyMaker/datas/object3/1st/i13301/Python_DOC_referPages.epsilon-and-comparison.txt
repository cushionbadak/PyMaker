I was wondering how I can edit this code to include a calculation that will allow me to print out the power of 2 as well, so that I can write the machine epsilon as 2^(1-t), where t is the number of bits in the mantissa, and would this match the theoretical number of bits in the mantissa of a double precision (python float) number in base 2?
Trivial solution to the first question:But I would recommend using sys.float_info.epsilon directly. https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.float_info.Second question: short answer: yes. Very long answer to all kinds of related questions: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html .
