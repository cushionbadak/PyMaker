This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I'm trying to code a software that can calculate variance in statistics, Im using lists in python, the problem is that python recognizes the input data as strings and not as integers (since they are numbers and i've got to calculate with 'em)which leads me to the following error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int' Here's the code so you can give it a look, it uses spanish words for variables (I'm mexican), but I hope that you can understand it anyway.
