I'm not asking about the easy merging of array like c = a+b (which would yield [1,2,3,4,5,6].What I am looking for is to join the contents of two arrays, so that the end-result would be as the following (given a and b written previously).How do I solve this?
IntroductionYou can zip together your two lists, forming a new lists that will contain two-element tuples (pairs), where each pair consists of the elements at the corresponding index, from the two lists.This in turn will make it very easy to iterate over each pair, and create a new list with the desired contents.Sample ImplementationIn your question you have written that the result should be [14,25,36] â€” implying that you are looking to concatenate the elements lexiographically, but then have the result still be ints.You could solve it in a easy manner using code such as;
You can use zip to match the appropriate elements, and from there it's just a matter of converting them to strings and joining them:

here is another possibility: the int-casing can also be done afterwards:
