I want to use imaplib in Python on Fedora.  I tried yum install imap but got Loaded plugins: langpacks, refresh-packagekit No package imap available. Error: Nothing to do.  How do I install imaplib?
imaplib is a built in package that comes with Python.  You don't need to install anything separately.  Even if you did, you'd more likely have to install a Python package with pip than a system package with yum.  Simply import the package and start coding.
