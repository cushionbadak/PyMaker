I'm creating a program in which the user enters a list of names and the computer then prints it out any names which have been duplicated. The code I have so far is:I get an error when it reachesHow can I fix this?
You can find duplicates by doing this (in place of your for loops)This is going to return a set of values that appears in the names variable more than one time. Output:Bob and Andy were entered more than once. George was not, thus doesn't appear in the set.
You can not assign to a string object, if you want to get the strings that have duplicates in your list you better to use collections.Counter which returns a Counter object, then you can extract the names that those count is more than one.
