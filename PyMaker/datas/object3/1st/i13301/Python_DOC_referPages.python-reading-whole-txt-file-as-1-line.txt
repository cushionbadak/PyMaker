Natural Text
If I have a txt file and it contains something like this:But there are "\n" between lines.And now if I want to make triplets out of them. Then is there a way to read the whole txt file as a line so it wouldn't give me:  I uploaded my whole code I have at the moment because none of the given answers seemed to help.That's the code I'm using to split the whole string into triplets:
Or as @PM 2Ring suggested:
You don't need to call readlines, just iterate over the file obejct rstripping each line:Or combine it with map:rstrip will also take care of whatever your line endings are, there is no need to pass any arguments.If you want the slices just call iter on the joined string and zip:If you have data that was not a multiple of 3 and you did not want to lose it, you could use itertools.zip_longets:On your sample input both will output:
Just read the whole file and remove new lines:You could also avoid reading the whole file into the memory and read from it iteratively while selecting triplets. You could even make this very lazy by using generator functions and function composition (this makes it very functional):
I dont know whether I have solved the question,but do test my code.I have just modified your code.As you mentioned in some comments you want to strip newlines in the middle of the file.So for this I didn't stripped it but I replaced '\n' with '', usinghere is the code :The Output in the triplets list :
