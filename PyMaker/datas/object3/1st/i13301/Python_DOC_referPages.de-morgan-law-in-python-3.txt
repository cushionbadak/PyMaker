According to De Morgan law:In Python 3.5 when I run:This returns:Question: why y is False?
Try adding some parentheses -- == is higher precedence than or.Here is the precedence table
Try this:It was evaluating first.
Operator priority is tripping you up. In Python, the == operator has higher priority than not. The expression not a == b is read as not (a == b) rather than (not a) == b, because the former is usually more useful than the latter.Therefore, your y should look like:And your x should look like:Then you'll get the right results. (Your x is also wrong, and is getting a True result for the wrong reasons: it's actually evaluating (not ((A and B) == (not A)) or (not B) which works out to (not (True == False)) or False which works out to True or False. But what you actually wanted was (not (A and B)) == ((not A) or (not B)), which works out to (not True) == (False or False), which works out to False == False. As I said, your x is getting a True result for the wrong reasons.)
