Yep! I know you cannot understand by the title. Take for example the below code.Excepted output.Any such feature supported in defaultdict, so that I can do that?Once the class of room 'something' is called, inside the class, I need a code so that, self.room is 'something' which is called!
The default factory of collections.defaultdict (any callable) does not accept arguments.If default_factory is not None, it is called without arguments to  provide a default value for the given key, this value is inserted in  the dictionary for the key, and returned.In other words, defaultdict does not pass any information to the default_factory.Subclass defaultdict to customize the default __missing__ hook to call the default_factory (Room class constructor) with missing key as a parameter:The constructor of Room will then look likeYou'll need to use mydefaultdict instead of defaultdict from now on. Example:While this works, I suggest you to re-think the way you store/access data.
