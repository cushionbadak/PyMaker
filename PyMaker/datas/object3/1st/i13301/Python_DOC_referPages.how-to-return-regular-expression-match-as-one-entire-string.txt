I want to match phone numbers, and return the entire phone number but only the digits.  Here's an example:But I want to use regular expressions to return only:But, for some reason I can't get the digits to be returned:But for some reason it just prints an empty tuple?  What is the obvious thing I am missing here?  Thanks.
You're getting empty result because you don't have any capturing groups, refer to the documentation for details. You should change it to group() instead, now you'll get the first digit as a match. But this is not what you want because the engine stops when it encounter a non digit character and return the match until there.You can simply remove all non-numeric characters:The range 0-9 is negated, so the regex matches anything that's not a digit, then it replaces it with the empty string.
You can do it without as regular expression using str.join and str.isdigit:If you printed r.group() you would get some output but using search is not the correct way to find all the matches, search would return the first match and since you are only looking for a single digit it would return 5, even with '[0-9]+') to match one or more you would still only get the first group of consecutive digits i.e 555 in the string above. Using "".join(r.findall(s)) would get the digits but that can obviously be done with str.digit.If you knew the potential non-digit chars then str.translate would be the best approach:
The simplest way is here:
