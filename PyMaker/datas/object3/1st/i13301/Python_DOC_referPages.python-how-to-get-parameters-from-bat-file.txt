I am calling this python script from abc.bat filehow to pass src_dir, dest1_dir, dest2_dir to python script from bat file and in python script how to get the passed parameters from the bat script. so that I replace the src and destination directory in the copy tree.
If you want to do something fast @AdamSmith's approach will be great.On the other hand, if your program will grow a lot on options or you want to create more elegant parameters such as:your_script --src-dir=src_dir --dest-dir=dest_diryou can use argparse which will do the job great.Even more, if you want to print something like this:
You can access the whole argument values list withthe first element is always the name of the file, so you're looking at sys.argv[1:]But is there some reason that you're using the distutils module for this? It's more often called from shutil
