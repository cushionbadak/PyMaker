I want to make a condition for when 2 of these variables are identical without doing...This is part of a poker simulation I'm making.(note: CPcard1 and CPcard2 belong to the first player and cards 1,2 and 3 belong tothe table. all cards where found with the same method as CPcard1 above) I just want to make the program identify a pair. I'm relatively new to coding and I'm a noob so any help would be much appreciated :) 
First, some notes about your setup: The way you select random cards is (a) cumbersome, and (b) incorrect. By randomly selecting a suit, and then a card from that suit, each suit has the same chance of being selected (1/4), even if there is just one (or none!) card left in that suit.Instead, I suggest just doing it the same way you would do in real life: Put all the cards in one deck, shuffle the deck, and pop cards from that shuffled deck.Also, instead of manually enumerating all the cards, you could use itertools.product:About finding pairs (or triplets, or quadruplets): The easiest way to do this would be to use collections.Counter. But also note that you do not really need the cards to be the same, as you do with ==! Instead, it is enough if the value is the same, the suit can be different.Here, card[:-1] will get the value from the card string, e.g. '10' from '10S'. You can then use counts.most_common to get the most common pairs (or triplets, etc.), if any.Example:
