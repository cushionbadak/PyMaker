Working on a class that has sub properties.  Is the below code a good practice / Pythonic?  If not, have any suggestion?GOALEXAMPLE CODE
In most of the common higher level languages, dot notation is used to indicate namespace.  The same is true for Python.  Take the following useless class for example:All it's doing is returning itself (an instantiated object of type UselessClass), which has access to all of it's own properties.The only issue with your code is, as GingerPlusPlus pointed out, you're making subprop shared between all instances of ExCls. This may be desired, but (based on the question), also may not be.  Here's an instance of why this is bad:As you can see, this isn't generally the behaviour you'd expect.  Instead, what you may be looking to do is:Overall, I'd highly recommend going back and reading up on Python's Classes, and how they work.
I would advice using the right tool for the job â€“ if I'd want my subprop to only contain some data, I'd use types.SimpleNamespace:or, it's close-enough immutable sibling, collections.namedtuple:If I'd want it to also contain some methods, I'd use simple, custom object:
