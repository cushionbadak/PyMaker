1) How do I convert a variable with a string like "wdzi\xc4\x99czno\xc5\x9bci" into "wdzięczności"?2) Also how do I convert string variable with characters like "Â±", "Ä™", "Ä†" into correct letters?I emphasise "variable" because all I've got from googling was examples with " u'some string' " and the like and I can't get anything like that to work.I use "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-" in second line of my script and I still crash into these problems.Also I was said that simple print should output correctly - but it does not.
In Python 2.7 IDLE, I get this output:Your first string appears to be a UTF-8 byte string, so all that's necessary is to decode it into a Unicode string. When Python prints that string, it will encode it back to the proper encoding based on your environment.If you're using Python 3 then you have a string that has been decoded improperly and will need a little more work to fix the damage.
