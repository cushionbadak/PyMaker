I receive an error when using python 3.3.2 (which is the version is school sadly) but it works fine on other versions e.g. 2.7.10 and 3.5This is the error
Looking at the screenshot I can see Python prompt at the bottom:This means the script is run in an interactive session (IDLE on Windows I guess). I haven't found any documentation, but other users have discovered that raising SystemExit in an interactive session does print the traceback.So you should check and ensure that you are not launching the script in an interactive session.Old answer:Looks like it's a bug (or a particularity) in Python 3.3.2. According to this blog post:If nothing catches the exception, then the python interpreter catches  it at the end, does not print a stack trace, and then calls exit.I tried to raise SystemExit('asd') and the program just printed asd, so looks like it's true.Either upgrade Python or try os._exit(1).
Not sure if this is what you want, but if you wanna exit use this:This exits the interpreter by raising SystemExit.
Why don't you use sys.exit()?sys.exit([arg])Exit from Python. This is implemented by raising the SystemExit exception, so cleanup actions specified by finally clauses of try statements are honored, and it is possible to intercept the exit attempt at an outer level.
You probably have an handler set for excepthook:https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthookYou should be able to reset it by doing sys.excepthook = sys.__excepthook__
