In Python 2.7, I have two lists of integers:I want to create a third list which indicates whether each element in x and y is identical, to yield:How can I do this using list comprehension?My attempt is:But I don't know how to complete it.
You are looking for zipBut you better add int call to get your desired outputelse you'll get a list like [True, False, True, False, False]As ajcr mentions in a comment, it is better to use   itertools.izip instead of zip if the lists are very long. This is because it returns an iterator instead of a list. This is mentioned in the documentationLike zip() except that it returns an iterator instead of a list.demo
