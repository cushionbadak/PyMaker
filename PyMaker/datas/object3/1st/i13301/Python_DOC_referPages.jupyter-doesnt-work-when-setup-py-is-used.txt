I tried to install Jupyter on my Mac (10.9). Since I'm using a computer at the university and don't have permission to write in /usr/local/bin, I downloaded Ipython from GitHub and typed python3.4 setup.py install --user on Terminal.Though I didn't get any error while installing, Jupyter does not launch when I type ipython notebook (ipython3 notebook or jupyter were the same) and I got command not found error.(I also tried to install via pip. However, pip does not work on my computer and I couldn't activate it using ensurepip.)
Why does pip not work? (insufficient privileges to write into system packages)?  Have you tried a virtual environments Creation of virtual environments? They are very useful for managing your environment so that you have local packages and a local bin folder for things like ipython:This will install into your my_venv environment.
