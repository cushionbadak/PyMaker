In the above it is likely that the height in metres will be entered as a float number (ie. 1.8) so having declared 'bmi = int' and 'height = int' will the end bmi still produce a float number if necessary? 
Yes. If you add a floating point to an int, then the int is promoted to a floating point before the addition takes place.
In Python, when you perform an operation with a float and an int that would return a float, Python will automatically handle returning a float.For instance:here we can see the bytecode instructions for adding an int and a float.The BINARY_ADD operation is what we're interested in digging into. From the source of Python 3.4 we can see the following operation:And following PyNumber_Add: To binary_op1 at this point, we could continue tracking down those arguments passed to NB_BINOP or hop over to the documentation of the C-API.From here, we have a pretty good reason to believe this is what we're looking for:This function is used by PySequence_Concat() and has the same  signature. It is also used by the + operator, after trying the numeric  addition via the nb_add slot.We can then hop back in and look for our nb_add call, ending up at a float_as_number variable.  Following that float_add will direct us to the following:where we can see that the passed arguments are passed to a CONVERT_TO_DOUBLE function.  From here, we can see the conversion if the value wasn't a float:
