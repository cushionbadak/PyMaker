The input() built-in function returns a value of type str. As is specified in the (doc)string right after the declaration of function get_input():You will need a type conversion.So, you must wrap it in an int() to convert it to an integer int.Then you can use comparison operators to evaluate if it is in the qualified range of accepted values :If you supply numbers this works perfectly:But if you supply a single character or a string (type str), you'll get an error:    This is beyond the scope of the question but you might want to look into it.Anyway, your while condition is setting me off..It seems that you might be using Python 2 with the print_function imported through __future__. (or else the comparison between different types would raise a TypeError in the while statement). Check your version of python python -V [in the command line] and:If using python 2 instead of input() use raw_input():If I am wrong and you are indeed using Python 3.x, use int(input()) as explained.
