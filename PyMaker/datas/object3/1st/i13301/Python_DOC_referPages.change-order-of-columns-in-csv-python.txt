I made a script, which reads a given input-file (csv), manipulates the data somehow and writes an output-file (csv). In my case, my given input-file looks like this:For my output-file, I need to re-arrange these columns (there are plenty more, but I think i might be able to solve it, when someone shows me the way)My output-file should look like this:Note, that here is a new column, that isn't in the source csv-file, but it has to be printed anyway (the order is important as well)This is what I have so far:Right now, even though it says "ARTICLE LABEL" first, the sku is printed first. My guess: This is due the order of the csv-file, since sku is the first field there... right?
As riotburn already suggested, you can use a DictWriter and its fieldnames argument to adjust the order of columns in the new file.Reordering a file could look like this:
If you use the DictWriter from the csv lib you can specify the order of the columns.  Use DictReader to read in rows from your file as dicts.  Then you just explicitly specify the order of the keys when you create your DictWriter.https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader
