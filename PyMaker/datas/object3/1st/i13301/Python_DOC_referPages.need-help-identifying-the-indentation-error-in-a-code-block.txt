Natural Text
I tried defining a function below (part of a longer code block), but came across an 'indentation error' identified at the 4th line.Could somebody please tell me what the error is?
Your indentation is a mix of tabs and spaces. The tab character might look like it's four spaces wide in your text editor/IDE, but Python can interpret it as anywhere between one and eight spaces. This can cause Python to become very confused. Replace the tab on your n -= 1 line with spaces.
