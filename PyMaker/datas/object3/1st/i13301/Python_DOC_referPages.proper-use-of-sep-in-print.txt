I am new at python, and I am having problems with the use of sep=.What I want to do is to not have a space between the number 25 and the .Here is my code and the error I get. I am running this code on MAC OSX El Capitan's Terminal.code:Output:
sep is an argument to the print() function, which requires you use Python 3 or use a special from __future__ import print_function statement in Python 2 (see the print() function documentation.The normal plain vanilla Python 2 print statement (which is what you appear to be using) does not support altering the separator used.Since the separator is always a space, you don't need to specify it here at all:If you wanted to print without spaces, use string formatting instead:If you are using a Python 3 tutorial using print(foo, bar, baz sep='') or similar similar syntax, get yourself Python 3 installed, or get yourself a Python 2 specific tutorial instead.
In python 2.x print doesn't take arguments because print is a statement and not a function. You can use the print() function by importing from the future module:As the first import of your .py file.And then call print (don't omit the parentheses!):Alternatively, Python 2 spacing can be added explicitly by adding it in the string to be printed along with the + operator that combines strings:Check your python version (by running python -V in your terminal) and read the right docs (Python 2, Python 3)
