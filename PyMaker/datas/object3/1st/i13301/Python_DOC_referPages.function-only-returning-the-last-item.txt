Why in the following function it returns only the last item?
Because you only returned one thing (lem is being recreated each time). If you want to return more than one thing, either concatenate the strings, return a list, or make it a generator function:In the generator case, you need to loop over the outputs (implicitly as in splatting with * or combining with ''.join, or explicitly with a for loop), printing the generator returned directly is mostly useless (it's going to be the repr of a general purpose generator, something like <generator object lem at 0xdeadbeef>).
On each iteration you reassign the value of lem.You need to save it to list (for example) before each iteration.And stop using built-in names such as file.
