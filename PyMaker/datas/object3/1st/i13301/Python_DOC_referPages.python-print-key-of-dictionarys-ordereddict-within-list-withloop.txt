I'm trying to figure out how to print a list, storeItems, that contains 3 OrderedDict(), and be able to print the key and value for each OrderedDict. I don't know how to solve this, and this is what I tried which gives me a TypeError: string indices must be integers.Things to noteI discovered doing for value in storeItems: print(value) will print OrderedDict([('Name': 'Auto-Enter', ...)]) for each line. print(storeItems[0]['Name']) outputs Auto-Enter. I seem to struggle to make this into the loop.I prefer for this to keep as close as you can to the original format of storeItems
Each element in storeItems is a dictionary (OrderedDict is just a subclass that tracks the insertion order), so just loop over the dict.items() method:
