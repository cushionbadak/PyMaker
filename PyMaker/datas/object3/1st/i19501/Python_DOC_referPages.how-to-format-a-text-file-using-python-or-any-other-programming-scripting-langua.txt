Natural Text
I would like to know how to format a text file using Python or any other programming/scripting language?current format in text file is like this:I want it to be like this (all on one line excluding some words etc.):
Assuming the format is always exactly as you described (word, pronunciation, empty line, "Defn: ", definition), it's a simple matter of string splitting and concatenating:The idea is to make a piece of code that can be easily invoked to fix text. In this case the function is called reformat and it works by splitting the given text into the three first lines and the definition, extracting the definition from the paragraph, and gluing together the word itself with the definition.An alternative solution is a regular expression, which is more fit to the task but can be harder to understand because of the strange syntax:This should work exactly the same as the other code above, but it's simpler, more flexible and can be ported to different languages.To use any of the above, just call the method passing the text as argument.To replace the text in a file, you need to open the file, read the contents, reformat using any of the functions above, and save back to the file:If you need to do this to all files in a given directory, for example, look into  listdir in the os module.
