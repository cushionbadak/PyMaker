I want to compare two lists of same lengthand find out the number of differences n, in this case it'll be n = 2, and also return an error if the length are not equal. What's the pythonic way of doing this?
The simplest way to do this is to use the sum() built-in and a generator expression:We loop over the lists together using zip() and then compare them. As True == 1 and False == 0, we just sum this to get the number of differences. Another option would be to use the conditional part of the generator expression:I can't really say I feel one is more readable than the other, and doubt there will be a performance difference.
One-liner solution that also produces an error if the length is not equal:Now try the input of different length:How it works: bool(x,y) returns True if elements are different. Then we map this function on 2 lists and get the list [False, True, False, True, False].If we put into the function map() the lists of different length, we get the TypeErrorFinally, the function sum() of this boolean list gives 2.
You could use sets. Cast both to a set, then find difference between the two. For example:This could be wrapped up in a function to check for length differences first.
