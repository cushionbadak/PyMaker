I just create a new aplication in python for registration.I save all the fields in database and user created successfully but the password is save same as it is we filled at the time of registration.How do I encrypt or use default functonality of python for password.Please suggest me?
To make offline password cracking more expensive, you could use bcrypt.If you are limited to the stdlib, there is crypt module on Unix: 
you should hash the passwords, the following code hashes the raw-input password according to your PASSWORD_HASHERS in settings.py
Don't implement such stuff yourself or you likely will do it wrong.For password storage, using some reversible encoding or symetric encryption or a simple hash from hashlib or even a randomly salted hash are all major FAILURES nowadays.If you are using django, use some strong algorithm provided by django (usually one of: bcrypt, pbkdf2, sha512_crypt).When not using django: use passlib - after reading its documentation.http://code.google.com/p/passlib/
Hash the password upon getting it from the user (and on registration) to encrypt it. Ref: http://docs.python.org/2/library/hashlib.html#module-hashlib
For actual encryption, you can try M2Crypto or PyCrypto. Those are probably what you are looking for; however, there are other ways to obfuscate your passwords for the average user:(if you would like to read some more answers as to what encryption method might suit you best, check out this somewhat related SO post: Recommended Python cryptographic module?hashlib will provide various hash algorithms (ex. "SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512"). A simple example: And this will print you the md5 "Somerandompassword":c5532f9e756b4583db4c627c8aa7d303 However, for (base64) encoding, for example, try:and decodingwill print: Somerandompassword
