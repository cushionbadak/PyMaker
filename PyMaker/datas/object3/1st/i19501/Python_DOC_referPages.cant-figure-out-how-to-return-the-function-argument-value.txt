new to python windows 7 python 3.3.0 I can't figure out how to return the function argument value. been looking around like crazy this is a class assignment, but I do have a easy script made to turn in, but im shooting to push my self. just need to know if im going in the wrong direction something. thanks
Firstly, your functions do not return anything. Look at adding a return statement to pass back a value. Here is a fairly simple introduction to functionsSecondly, if the function does return a value, you'd want to assign it to a variable, your code just calls the function without assignment.For example, this small program passes an integer to a function, which then doubles it and returns the new value, which is then printed.
