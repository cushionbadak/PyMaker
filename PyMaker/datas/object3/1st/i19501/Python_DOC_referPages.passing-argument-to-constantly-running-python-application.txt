I have a constantly running Python code on Linux, every so often outside data needs to be fed into this code so Python code can alter a file. How do I go about structuring Python code so it receives these arguments for further processing?I found some stuff on outgoing args, Running external program using pipes and passing arguments in pythonBut looking for in coming argsFlexible with how arguments get passed down
You need some kind of Inter Process Communication.For example, you can feed program's standard input. You can read it by reading from sys.stdin, but it requires the program that started your process to give its handle to another process.Another way is to create a socket of some kind. That's far more scalable, allows connecting to the program when it's running on another machine, and allows non-Python processes to easily communicate with your process.
