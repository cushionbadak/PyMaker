This might be a very stupid question, but i want to know how i can extract the RFC822.SIZE value from the double dictionary of the form:

The {...}[1] returns the sub-dictionary {'RFC822.SIZE': 2515, 'SEQ': 1}, and you can get the value out of this using ['RFC822.SIZE'].
By 'double dictionary' I suppose you mean nested dictionary, right?Well, when you access a value of the outter dict through a key (let's say, 1), it will return the corresponding inner dict, which values you can access... well, like a dict.Here's an example:Knowing this, you can condense all that code by accesing the value directly:This is some basic python (you use dicts constantly when coding on python) so I recommend (if you are planning to do serious coding on python) that you read some tuturial, at least the introductory one you can find on the python's doc page
You have a nested dictionary, so use nested lookups:Note the slight difference between this and the usage in your comment: your commment tries to index item, whereas this indexes sizeList[item].
