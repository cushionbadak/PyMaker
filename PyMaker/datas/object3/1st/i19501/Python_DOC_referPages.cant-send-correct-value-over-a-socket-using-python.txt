I'm new to using Python and sockets in general (only started yesterday) so I've been having a lot of issues trying to set up a TCP client and server. The issue I'm having is that I want to send a key from the server to the client. I know that the server grabs the key correctly as it prints out the correct key, however it has a 0 appended to it in a new line and when the key is sent to the client the only thing that is displayed is " b'0' ".I've made very little progress due to my lack of experience and after searching for hours I still haven't found a solution to my problem.Here is the server code:Here is the client codeAs you can tell from my code I'm using Python 3.3Any help with this issue is greatly appreciated.
os.system() does not return the process's output, but the return value (ie. integer 0).If you only want to read a file, do it manually:If you need process output, read the documentation for the subprocess module.
