Questionconverting hex to image and draw a text on the image, after that convert image to binary hex,but having the problem at here with open(img,'rb') as in_file:, how to convert img to hex?
The img object needs to be saved again; write it to another BytesIO object:then get the written data with the .getvalue() method:The PIL-for-python-3 landscape is rather muddled at the moment. The Pillow fork looks to be the best, maintained version out there at the moment. It includes fixes that make saving to a BytesIO object work. If you run into a io.UnsupportedOperation: fileno exception using the above code, you have a version that was not yet fixed, in which case you'll have to resort to using a temporary file instead.
