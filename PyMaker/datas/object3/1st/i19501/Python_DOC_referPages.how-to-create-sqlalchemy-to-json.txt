I have a sqlalchemy resultAnd I want convert this result to JSON, but how I can do it?  
It looks like your LabelsData object is a SQLAlchemy model. You need to serialize it before dumping it to JSON. Here's a short example that extracts all the columns from your LabelsData object and converts the results of your query to JSON:
From here and appearing to require simplejson. Hope that helps...UPDATE: on a second look, it's a dictionary, which you can dump by any of the json modules in python.
Looks like sqlalchemy already has onehttp://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/serializer.html
This blog post provided the solution I went with:http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2013/03/07/generating-json-from-sqlalchemy-objects/The strategy used was to include a .todict method directly to a Base mixin which iterates over the parent class's sqlalchemy columns. Alternatively, Nande's approach (https://stackoverflow.com/a/19602809/837575) to use sqlalchemy.ext.serializer works well if you're trying to serialize data over the wire but don't necessarily need it as json.
I add this anwser as it is a mix of @mekarpeles and @hd1. I mean I did not modified the sqlalchemy hierarchy of objects, just delegating to a simple JSONEncoder:If your models use not serializable classes (datetime for example) you have to add them to the Encoder :And then I use it with a jinja2 context filter :
https://github.com/TaylorHere/PythonSerializerthe link above can give you a hand , It's a small script that can simply serialize sql query result to list or dict ,just like this:
