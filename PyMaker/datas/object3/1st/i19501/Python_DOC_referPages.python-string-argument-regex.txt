Natural Text
I'm trying to take a regular expression as an argument to my python program (which is a string naturally) and simply match it against another string.Let's say I run it aspython program.py 'Hi.there'I'd like to be able to then take that input (call it input) and say whether or not it matches 'HiTthere' (it should).How should I do this? I'm inexperienced at regex.
From my understanding, you're looking for something like:Run this program with an expression as a first argument:Unlike, say, javascript, python regexes are simple strings, so you can directly use sys.argv[1] as an argument to re.search.
Python 3 syntax (Python 2, use print xxx instead of print(xxx)):Note that I'm using the anchors ^ and $ to guarantee that the match spans the entire input. ^ matches the start of the string and $ matches the end of the string.See the documentation for much more detail.
