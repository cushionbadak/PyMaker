I have 2 custom functions:I want to pass all months to them, and pass them another function as follows:How is it done in short way? Best Regards
So, first of all, we want to call f() and g() on each item of a list. We can do this with a list comprehension:This produces a list of tuples, but we want a flat list, so we use itertools.chain.from_iterable() to flatten it (or in this case, just a generator expression):Then we unpack this iterable into the arguments for x():Edit: If you wish to pass the functions ready to be executed with that parameter, without executing them, it's functools.partial() to the rescue:This would mean the parameters to x() would be functions that, when called, run f() or g() as appropriate, with the month filled as given to the partial. This can, of course, be expanded out in the same way as before.
