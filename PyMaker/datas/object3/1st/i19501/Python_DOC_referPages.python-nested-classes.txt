First of all, here's my test code, I'm using python 3.2.x:when I do:I expected to get the value of balance returned, instead I get the function "balance", why is this? It returns the value of balance when I do:So I want to know why this is and it would be great if someone could come up with a way to give me the value of balance in the nested version.
My version of your code, with comments:
There are several problems:You're using the name balance for both the data member and for the function.You're missing a return statement in balance().balance() operates on an instance of bank. There is no instance in a.bank.balance: here, a.bank refers to the inner class itself.
a.bank is the class (not instance) since you've never created an instance of the bank on a.  So if a.bank is a class, a.bank.balance is a method bound to that class.This works however:Of course, as you show working code without nested classes, It really begs the question about why you want to use nested classes for this.  I would argue that the non-nested version is much cleaner.
