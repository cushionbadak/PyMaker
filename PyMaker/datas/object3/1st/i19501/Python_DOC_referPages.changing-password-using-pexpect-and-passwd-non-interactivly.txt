I am trying to learn python to change users password non-interactively but nothing seems to be working.pexepect module of python seems promising, so I am just trying to use it.This tutorial is nice but it does not work.There's lots of code on Internet regarding this but none of them seems to work.And nor does my code:Error:EDIT : i changed pass to pa but not i am getting a lot and the password does not changes.
You can't use pass as a variable name. It's a reserved keyword.Edit:pexpect is waiting for the string "password: " but as you can tell from the error message passwd outputs "New Password: " (note the capital p) on your system.Instead of passwd.expect("password: ") you need to use passwd.expect("Password: ").
You can also use this to make your search case insensitive:
