I am confused why I have to use `.get('key') when trying to access an array of objects from a json file    
Your problem is that when the json module parses a JSON object, it returns a Python dict - which is a more suitable data structure in Python for the data at hand.This means you don't want to try and access the field on it, but rather access the item in the dict. The Python syntax for accessing items of dicts (or dict-like objects) is:So in your case:See the documentation for dicts for more information.The dict.get() function allows you to easily get a default value (which is, by default None) if the key doesn't exist (normally this will produce a KeyError. You do not normally want this behaviour (it is generally better to fail out sooner and see where the problem is, than get None value and have errors later when you try and use it).Also note that this is a good use case for the with statement, to ensure that the connection is closed properly. As urllib2 doesn't support context managers by default, we use contextlib.closing() to make one:
Because you have to use new_story['title'], but if this key wont exist, it will throw you exception
In addition to Lattyware's answer: in order to be able to access the dict using .some_attribute convention, you can use a trick:...although it do it if you really want to stick with "dot" notation. It just brings another complication to your program (apart of many other drawbacks, like story.title.somethingelse will not work in this simple scenario without some recursive initialization)You can also consider using namedtuple.
