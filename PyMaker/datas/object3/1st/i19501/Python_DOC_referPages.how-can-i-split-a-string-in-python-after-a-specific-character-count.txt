I apologize if this is a duplicate but I can't seem to find anything out there that involves splitting a string based on a character count. For example, let's say I have the following string:Now, I can split the string based on a specific character, but how can I split this string after the nth character, regardless of what it is? Something like this, only with a working syntax is what I am thinking:Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!UpdateI wanted to post this update since my question only approached half of my problem. Thanks to Martijin's answer below I easily sliced the string above. However, since the string I was making edits to was user submitted, I ran into the problem of slicing words in half. In order to fix this problem, I used a combination of rsplit and rstrip to break up the paragraph correctly. Just in case someone out there is facing the same issues as me here is the code I used to make it work:Now, I'm sure there is a more efficient/elegant way of doing this, but this still works so hopefully somebody can benefit from it. Thanks!
You are looking for slicing:Python strings are sequences, to select the first max_char characters, simply use a slice to select those, and for the second half select everything starting at max_char until the end.This is covered in the Python tutorial as well.
Just to improve on your final solution: you can use string.find(' ', n) to find the index of the first space after character n. If you want to split after that space (so that string1 ends with a space, rather than string2 beginning with one), just add one to it:
