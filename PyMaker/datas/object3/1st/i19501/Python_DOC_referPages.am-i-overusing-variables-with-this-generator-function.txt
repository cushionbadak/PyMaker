I have these two functions which work together.  The first generates the next prime number.  The second appends that prime number to a list of primes.  I feel like I am overusing variables in the second function when I basically say i = next(n) = nextPrime(primeList).  Is there a better way to write this?
Does this work out okay?
You can use itertools.takewhile to do most of the work for you:
This doesn't use two functions to do it, but here is the general (and I believe the fastest) method of generating primes up to 'n', using the Sieve of Eratosthenes:As Jack J pointed out, avoiding all even numbers makes this code faster.Then running the tests:Output:
