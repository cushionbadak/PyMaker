let say i got string(that is supposed to be a bytes):and i want to decode it but it say it got to be in bytes so i got to turn that to this somehowi am working on a chat client and when it sent the data(bytes), it turn into a string somehow when passing though the server and when it reach the other side, it can't decode itps: it is ENCRYPT, decoding that will give random number and letters, the client will decrypt itoh, and, i don't really know if the '=' sign is supposed to be there, when i got the data in a test between me and my friend, i got it like that string(the one on the top) with the error saying that it got to be in byte.part of the code in the client(just one line to show everyone, the rest is a secret):it mainly use ascii so i think this is right, right?more info:the message here is for getting the string sent from the other sidei don't know how i miss this, it str it before it send =.=well, it still need to turn it to bytes, how so i do that?
The following greatly works    Show how you encode string 
The problem is here:secretEncrypt(...) returns bytes, but then you do str(b"thereturnvalue") which does not do what you want:It is putting the string-representation (repr) of your bytes into a string, which is why your string starts with b"How best to fix this depends on the surrounding code.. Either:if the secretEncrypt function returns bytes, make Room.message accept bytes also (and remove the str(...) cast). Make secretEncrypt return a string, removing the need for the str(...) castLeast elegant solution: decode the bytes returned from secretEncrypt, turning it into a string. Something like this:Where whatever-encoding-was-used is the text encoding (likely utf-8 or ascii, but it is impossible to tell without seeing the rest of your code)
and i was right, no need to over think itthe string:just need to be split, eg:and that would get me a string without the b':then i just need to bytes it:which would get me the b' outside the string:ps: to everyone out there who say things about cracking my code, it got randoms mumbo jumbo things with the id dump into it, if you manage to crack it, it not much use and anyway, it just a chat client for a mini chatroom games for kids
