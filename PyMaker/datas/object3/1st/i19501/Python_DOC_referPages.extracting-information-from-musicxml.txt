I am new to programming and Python, but a lot of my current research concerns extracting data from musicxml files. I have a piece of music and want to extract the number of accidentals that occur in a piece that do not form part of the key signature. I have no idea how to do this, please could someone help? Here's an example of one measure from the musicxml file I am looking at:The problem translates to searching through the musicxml file and counting the number of times occurs where * is not (F or C) and also finding the number of times that * is F or C and is not followed by the <alter> tag.Any help or advice would be much appreciated! 
I can't help with Python details, but I have two MusicXML-related suggestions:1) Your question is phrased in terms of accidentals, but your code focuses on the alter element. The alter element is used for pitch alteration; the accidental element is what is used for written accidentals. Which one are you looking for? The duality between how much sounds and how it appears in notation is common in MusicXML, and important to understand for doing research with MusicXML files.2) If you are new to programming and Python, I would suggest using a higher-level toolkit designed expressly for musicology with good MusicXML support. You will move the problem domain up to a higher level which should let you make progress a lot faster. The obvious choice for this is the music21 toolkit, which is also written in Python. There's lots more information at http://web.mit.edu/music21/.Good luck with your research!
python has an xml.dom module that allows you to quickly navigate through xml files. If you have any experience with web development, it's very similar to javascript's document object model.output:
