I am getting a different output in python 2 and 3 when I execute same code for regular expression.Suppose this is the data that I want which is located somewhere in the webpage. So, when I run the below code in python 2.6, it works perfect. I'm getting exact output like above.But when I execute it in python 3.3 like:I'm getting the output of the match variable like:So, would you please tell me that why it's not taking whole string in python 3? Why it's skipping \x1epcofiowa@localhost\x1epcofiowa_pci\x1e each time? I want output like python 2.6.So, I am clueless at this moment. I'm waiting for your reply. Thanks.
Seems like \S behave differently in Python 2 and Python 3.According to Python 3 re module docs: -\S - Matches any character which is not a Unicode whitespace  character. This is the opposite of \s. If the ASCII flag is used this  becomes the equivalent of [^ \t\n\r\f\v] (but the flag affects the  entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit [^  \t\n\r\f\v] may be a better choice).Now, since \x1e (equivalent to U+001E, that comes after your \x1e\x1e5.5.30-log is a unicode whitespace character - reference to activestate, so it is not matched by \S in Python 3. Whereas in Python 2: -\S - Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the  class [^ \t\n\r\f\v].So, it only considers the ASCII character set for matching non-whitespace, and hence it matches \x1e.
