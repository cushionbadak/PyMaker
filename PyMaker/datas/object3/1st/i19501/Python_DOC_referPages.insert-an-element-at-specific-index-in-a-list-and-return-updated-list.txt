I have this:Is there anyway I can get the updated list as result, instead of updating the original list in place?
l.insert(index, obj) doesn't actually return anything, it just updates the list.As ATO said, you can do b = a[:index] + [obj] + a[index:].However, another way is:
Shortest I got: b = a[:2] + [3] + a[2:]
Most Performance Efficient approachYou may also insert the element using the slice indexing in the list. For example:For inserting multiple elements together at a give index, all you need to do is to use a list of multiple elements that you want to insert. For example:Alternative using List Comprehension (but very slow in terms of performance):As an alternative, it can be achieved using list comprehension with enumerate too. (But please don't do it this way. It is just for illustration):Performance Comparison of all solutionsHere's the timeit comparison of all the answers with list of 1000 elements for Python 3.4.5:Mine answer using sliced insertion - Fastest (3.08 usec per loop)ATOzTOA's accepted answer based on merge of sliced lists - Second (6.71 usec per loop)Rushy Panchal's answer with most votes using list.insert(...)- Third (26.5 usec per loop)Mine answer with List Comprehension and enumerate - Fourth (very slow with  168 usec per loop)
Use the Python list insert() Method. Usage:SyntaxFollowing is the syntax for insert() method −list.insert(index, obj)Parametersindex − This is the Index where the object obj need to be inserted.obj − This is the Object to be inserted into the given list.Return ValueThis method does not return any value but it inserts the given element at the given index.Example:Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
