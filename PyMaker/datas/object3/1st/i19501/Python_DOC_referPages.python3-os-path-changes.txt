I am using python 3.3 in Windows 7.The python file, main.py is in D:\my proj\$MY\1I wrote the following code in that file:So, When I run my program in cmd, it gives me output like:Now, usage.txt file is generating in the directory where my main.py is located means inside the 1 folder.But I have tried to modify the path that it should be saved in report folder as you can see the value of os.path.join.So, I want to save the generated usage.txt in the report folder instead of 1. What type of changes should I do? or what other modules do I need to use?I'm a novice user. So, please try to tell me in-depth or send me links from where I can get more knowledge or examples related to this. I'm awaiting for your reply.
Since p5 is the path to the report directory, this will open a usage.txt file inside that dir.
