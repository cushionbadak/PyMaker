If you for example write help(list), you will get help about the list object. If you write help(+), you will get SyntaxError: invalid syntaxWhy is this?
help is an ordinary function, so it takes arguments like any other function. help(list) is valid syntax: it passes the list type to help.However, help(+) is illegal syntax (+ is an operator, not an expression by itself). In this case, you can use help('+') instead to get help on the + operator.
This is because help is just a function - its argument must be a syntactically valid expression which evaluates to a value.
In some languages, you can actually just pass an operator around as a value, either directly (e.g., + is a normal function in Lisp) or with special syntax (e.g., (+) is the + operator as a normal function in Haskell). But that's not true in Python. The + operator can of course be part of an expression by giving it two operands (2+3) or one (+3), but there's no way to access the value of the + operator itself. (Partly this is because + is actually three different operators—unary add, binary add, and binary concat, so there isn't even such a thing as "the value of the + operator" without context. But the same is true even for operators that aren't ambiguous.)This is different from types and functions, as you can see:So, you can pass list or abs as an argument to a function—including help—but you can't do that with +.That's why Python has the operator module, to give you "operators as functions" that you can pass around:But that's not particularly useful in this case:Thanks…Fortunately, the help function has special code for dealing with strings. See nneonneo's answer for what you actually want here.
That's because + is an operator, it espects two operands,you could do this:since 1+1 returns an int, help would give you some informations aboutthe int datatype
