I have a simple question. I'm just wanting to know how I would have my program read the "input()" and see if there are integers or any kind of number in the string, and if so then print out a message saying so. Pretty much I just want to know how I would make sure that no one enters in a number for their name. Thanks!
Use the str.isdigit() method on strings, together with the any() function:.isdigit() returns True for any string that consists only of digits. This includes any Unicode character that is marked as a numeric digit or numeric decimal.any() loops over the sequence you pass in and returns True as soon as it finds the first element that is True, and False if all elements are False.Demo:
see if there are integers or any kind of number in the stringreturns True for strings such as "123", "123.45", "abc123".
Depending on the strings, regular expressions might actually be faster:My results are:(Note that the regular expression engine wins even in the case specifically designed for any to be fastest).  however, with longer strings, I'm willing to bet that any will eventually be faster.
