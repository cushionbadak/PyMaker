I just discovered heap (in real life and in Python) and now I'm trying to determine if a certain list of random numbers is in heap order.Problem is I'm not sure myself if I actually understand "heap" in practice even though I believe the definition provided makes sense.I found some practice problems that should help you write heap psuedo code.This is the problem and below it is my attempt at solving it:Write a function that checks whether a list of numbers is a heap or not: Given a list, it returns True if the numbers are in a heap order, and False if the numbers are not and have the programme return and print the answer.Example:returns True:the following list is in heap order: [0,1, 10, 2, 3, 11, 12, 4, 5, 19, 15]returns Falsethe following list is not in heap order: [0, 1, 10, 2, 15, 11, 12, 4, 5, 19, 3]Then there were 2 lists with a bunch of random numbers from 1 - 100 thrown in there, and some repeat. Can somebody please give me a hand?  Because I'm not really sure if I'm defining heap correctly the code is giving me a hard time as well!
The heap property (for a max heap) is that each node should be greater than or equal to its parent.  The parent of element i in a binary heap stored in an array is element (i - 1) // 2:Obviously because the heap is stored in array we don't need to check the shape.
