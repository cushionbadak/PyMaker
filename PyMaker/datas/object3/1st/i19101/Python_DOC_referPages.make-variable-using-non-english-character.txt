You cannot, at least not in Python 2. You can only use ASCII letters, digits and underscores in Python names (with digits only allowed as long as they are not the first character).See the Identifiers and keywords section of the documentation:Python 3 has expanded what is permissible. Anything that is considered a Unicode letter or digit is allowed, plus underscores (and numbers not at the start).
