Natural Text
I'm developing a interactive fiction game and up to now I do lines sleep just like this:I would like to make a single string like:And sleep two seconds each line, is there a way to do that? I've searched over Python 3.3 documentation and couldn't find anything helpful.
You'd need to split the text into lines to print. If you already have newlines in the text, split with str.splitlines():.splitlines() splits text on line separators, which can vary depending on platform.Otherwise you'll need to find the points where to split the text into sentences. Using a regular expression would give you the most bang for the buck:This uses a look-behind assertion to make sure that the text is split on whitespace that is preceded by end-of-sentence punctuation (., ? or !).Splitting on sentences otherwise ignores newlines:
Just turn your string into many strings, iterate over them and add some delay in each iteration.
