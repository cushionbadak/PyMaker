For example, sqlmap uses python sqlmap.py -h.This command above lists all available switches in sqlmap, and -h is a switch itself.When you are creating a python tool for use in terminal, what is the basic method to create a switch?A hello world example would be most appreciative!
These are command line options. You can use the stdlib argparse module for that.
The command line arguments a program was started with are exposed as a list of strings in sys.argv, with sys.argv[0] being the program name.Other, older standard-library modules to help deal with them include getopt and optparse. You should indeed be using argparse, though.
