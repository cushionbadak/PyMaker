I am trying to create a utility program, but after the user types in the passcode and goes to the main menu, the passcode is still there and is show right above it. I asked this question before, but users gave me a command instead of something the script does for you. I was wondering if there is something I can type into my script that can clear the python shell without having to directly type it into the shell.
You should use getpass to read passwords without echoing them, that's the reccomended way of reading passwords safely.
If you are using Linux:if you are using windows:Note: you should really not do something like this with passcodes for security reasons, but this does clear the shell
