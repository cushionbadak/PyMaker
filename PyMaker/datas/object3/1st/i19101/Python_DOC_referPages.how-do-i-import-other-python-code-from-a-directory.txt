I'm very new to python and I have a directory structure like this:In example.py I just tried:but that doesn't seems to be working.Where I'm making the mistake!
Do you have a __init__.py file in root/child/ directory? After creating this file you should be able to do this:or You can also import multiple modules from child directory like this:Read about modules and packages here.
If you want to import config.py with importing child you need to define child as a package.To do so you need to create an __init__.py file in your child directory.Check this about packages
Your directory should have init.py so that python will understand it is a package. So the directory structure would be like note, you should import root.child not child.
Create an empty __init__.py file in same directory with config.py. This is required for importing files like a package.Then you can import it.
