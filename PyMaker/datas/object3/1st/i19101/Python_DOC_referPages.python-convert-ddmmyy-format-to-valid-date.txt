I was trying to convert a date string to a valid date python format, but I got a erroneous date:How can I parse to a valid date, this date string?
If you read strptime() and strftime() Behavior in the docs, %Y means:Year with century as a decimal number [0001,9999]But you're giving it a 2-digit year, with no century.That's supposed to raise a ValueError. For example, if you try it with 2.5.6, 2.7.2, 3.2.1, or 3.3.0, you get this:ValueError: time data '300413' does not match format '%d%m%Y'But, thanks to a bug in older versions of Python, you might get garbage instead.If you want a 2-digit year, use %y, when means:Year without century as a decimal number [00,99].
As listed in the documentation, %Y is the code for a four-digit year. You should be using the code for a two-digit year, %y.
try:only change '%Y' with '%y'
