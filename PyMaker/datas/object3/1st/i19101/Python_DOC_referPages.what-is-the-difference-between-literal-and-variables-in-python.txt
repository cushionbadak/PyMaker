I'm a beginner user for Python, but I get confused between literal and variables.This is what I know about a literal: "a"+"b" And variables: sentence="a"+"b"
A literal is notation for representing a fixed (const) value.A variable is storage location associated with a symbolic name (pointed to, if you'd like).It's best explained in use:
In any programming language a Literal is a constant value, where as identifiers can change their values. Identifiers can store literals and process them further. Identifiers are name given to variables.1, 1.5, 'a', "abc", etc. are examples for literals. But in the statement x=123, x is a variable and 123 is a Literal.
