I need to build a generator and I was looking for a way to shorten this for loop into a single line. I tried enumerate but that did not work.
(Yes, adding Booleans to ints works exactly as if True was 1 and False was 0).The bool() call is only necessary if function() can have return values other than True, False, 1, and 0.
First, you can transform the string into an iterator over the function return values:Then you can map those to 0s and 1s:And then accumulate them:As the docs note, accumulate was added in Python 3.2. If you're using 2.x, you can copy and paste the "Equivalent to" recipe from the docs. (If you're using 3.0-3.1, you can do the same, but really, in that case, just upgrade.)
If you're using Python 3, you can do:Although I'd use Simeon Visser's answer. While this one may be short, it isn't immediately clear what the code does.
You could shorten it to:
