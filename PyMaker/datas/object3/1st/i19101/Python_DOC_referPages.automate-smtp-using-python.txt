Natural Text
I'm just beginning to use python to automate sending emails through gmail. I have gotten the whole process to work just typing directly into the command line, but now I want to automate the process (i.e. send emails at regular intervals). I have gotten the first part to work, where I get a connection with the SMTP server.Now I want to get it so that it will type and run the following commands within that connection:I have tried this using the write commands as well as the os.system command, but neither seems to actually insert the text into this window. Could someone with perhaps more linux and terminal skills be able to help with this? Also, it seems that the time.sleep doesn't work when all of these system processes are running. How can I get around that?
I would use the SMTP client implementation from the standard library: http://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplibIf you are using 2-factor-authentication, you need to create an application specific password to use.
You should look at the subprocess module to do what you want. You cannot just "os.write", you need to "write" to the process's standard input and output.etc.
