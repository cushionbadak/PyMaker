Natural Text
So I am querying a database that is called golfDB and it consists of one table called players with 5 fields:name (player's name)totalGross (sum of the gross scores from each round)totalRounds (number of rounds played)pars (total number of pars made)birdies (total number of birdies made)In this function below I am trying to find the player/ players with the most pars.  It turns out that there are two players, so I am trying to figure out a way to make this print out better because currently it is printing the print statement twice but with the different player at the end.  I want to be able to make what I have designated as players be a list of both players, and then somehow print the players in the print statement more coherently.  Any ideas?
You could store the players in a list, and use join in the print statement to show combine the list.If you want to make it more elegant you could use list comprehension.It would output: The player(s) with the most pars is/are player1, player2If you want to check the number of players so that you can format the text properly you could do something like this.
You could use str.join() to combine the names:This joins the names with commas between them.
