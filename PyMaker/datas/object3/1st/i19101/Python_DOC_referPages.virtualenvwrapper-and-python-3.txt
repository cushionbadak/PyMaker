I installed python 3.3.1 on ubuntu lucid and successfully created a virtualenv as belowthis created a folder envpy331 on my home dir.I also have virtualenvwrapper installed.But in the docs only 2.4-2.7 versions of python are supported..Has anyone tried to  organize the python3 virtualenv ? If so, can you tell me how ?
The latest version of virtualenvwrapper is tested under Python3.2. Chances are good it will work with Python3.3 too.
If you already have python3 installed as well virtualenvwrapper the only thing you would need to do to use python3 with the virtual environment is creating an environment using:Or, (at least on OSX using brew): Start using the environment and you'll see that as soon as you type python you'll start using python3
You can make virtualenvwrapper use a custom Python binary instead of the one virtualenvwrapper is run with. To do that you need to use VIRTUALENV_PYTHON variable which is utilized by virtualenv:
virtualenvwrapper now lets you specify the python executable without the path.So (on OSX at least)mkvirtualenv --python=python3 nameOfEnvironment will suffice.
On Ubuntu; using mkvirtualenv -p python3 env_name loads the virtualenv with python3.Inside the env, use python --version to verify.   
You can add this to your .bash_profile or similar:Then use mkvirtualenv3 instead of mkvirtualenv when you want to create a python 3 environment.
I find that running and in the command line on Ubuntu forces mkvirtualenv to use python3 and virtualenv-3.4. One still has to do to create the environment. This is assuming that you have python3 in /usr/bin/python3 and virtualenv-3.4  in /usr/local/bin/virtualenv-3.4.
This post on the bitbucket issue tracker of virtualenvwrapper may be of interest.It is mentioned there that most of virtualenvwrapper's functions work with the venv virtual environments in Python 3.3.
