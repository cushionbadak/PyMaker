I am python newbie and facing trouble with variable interpolation concept in pythonI have written a method to check the argument but it giving error while printing the line
First of all, re.match() returns a MatchObject instance, not an integer. The expressionwill always be True. Just use not:and:You need to remove the , from the print statement; the % operator acts on the string on the left hand side, but that does mean there should not be a comma in between:It looks as if you are trying to parse command line arguments. You could use the argparse module instead for that.
