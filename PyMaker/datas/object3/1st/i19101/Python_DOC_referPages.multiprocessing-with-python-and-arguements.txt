related to my last post (Which somehow got marked off and closed),I wrote some code to create a thread for a command handler for my python TCP listener. What basically happens is that I send in some data and it goes in the TCP connecter. Then the TCP connector creates another process and sends the data that it received through the process to the function in the command listener. I do not know what is going on. Please help!Says that:
target=CommandHandler.CommandHandler.commands() sets the target argument to the result of the invocation of the commands method. What you probably intended to do was to use that method as tharget, so you should use:Also the error tells you that you're trying to call an unbound method on a class, but you need an object to call it on, probably:but that's not your only issue:This loop will fail after the first invocation, because you can't restart an already started process.
