Hi I'm trying to extract some lines of text from a file generated from a program and write to another text file in a different format using python.Here is what I have so far:This adds all the text to a listWhat I have is What I need is Thanks
Some things aren't quite clear, like whether you need more parameters than just the "Detector Gain" ones or where the numbers come from (since they don't appear in your example).However, this might get you to where you need to be:Since the format of the data seems to be CATEGORY_1:KEY_1,VALUE_1,CATEGORY_2:KEY_2,VALUE_2... we break the data into fields at each comma with the split method.Then we loop through each field, looking for a : character, which tells us that we're reading a CATEGORY:KEY field.Once we have the CATEGORY:KEY field, we know the next field will be the associated value. So we add that to a Python dictionary, which maps keys to values. I chose the OrderedDict dictionary in case the order of the fields is important.At the end we read through the dictionary we constructed, looking for the "Detector Gain" fields. Then we print them to an outfile - you can see how we open it for writing with a context manager.If you're on Python 2 also do from __future__ import print_function.
