I see it used in sorting, but what do the individual components of this line of code actually mean?What's lambda, what is x:, why [1] in x[1] etc...Examples
lambda effectively creates an inline function.  For example, you can rewrite this example:Using a named function:In this case, max() will return the element in that array whose second element (x[1]) is larger than all of the other elements' second elements.  Another way of phrasing it is as the function call implies: return the max element, using x[1] as the key.
lambda signifies an anonymous function. In this case, this function takes the single argument x and returns x[1] (i.e. the item at index 1 in x). Now, sort(mylist, key=lambda x: x[1]) sorts mylist based on the value of key as applied to each element of the list. Similarly, max(gs_clf.grid_scores_, key=lambda x: x[1]) returns the maximum value of gs_clf.grid_scores_ with respect to whatever is returned by key for each element. I should also point out that this particular function is already included in one of the libraries: operator. Specifically, operator.itemgetter(1) is equivalent to your key.
This is the function.And here x is the list, in which we are adding x[1] i.e 2nd element of list to the sort function. So, basically we are adding every list's 2nd element (i.e x[1]) to the sort function.I hope you understand this.
From a reference for Python 3.7 (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html), The key is a parameter of list.sort() and sorted(). The first built-in function modifies a list in place while the latter accepts and return iterable.The key parameter can be defined as a function to be called on each element of list/iterable before comparison and sort, respectively. In this case, the inline function lambda x: x[1] is defined as a value of the key parameter. The lambda function takes input x return x[1] which is the second element of x. SupposedCan you guess what the result? mylistSort is then [[1,2,3], [2,5,6], [7,8]] from the sorted sequence of [8,2,5] which is [2,5,8]. The max() in your example is applied to just get the max value from the outcome of the sort function. I hope this post is helpful.
