I have found some answers to this question before, but they seem to be obsolete for the current Python versions (or at least they don't work for me).I want to check if a substring is contained in a list of strings. I only need the boolean result.I found this solution:From this code I would expect to get a True value. If the word was "der", then the output should be False.However, the result is a generator function, and I can't find a way to get the True value.Any idea?
You can import any from __builtin__ in case it was replaced by some other any:Note that in Python 3 __builtin__ has been renamed to builtins.
The code you posted using any() is correct and should work unless you've redefined it somewhere.That said, there is a simple and fast solution to be had by using the substring search on a single combined string:This should work much faster than the approach using any.   The join character can be any character that doesn't occur in one of the words in the wordlist.
You could use next instead:To show the string that contains the substring:
Also if someone wants to check if any of the values of a dictionary exists as a substring in a list of strings, can use this:It prints
