I'm having trouble printing a message after checking if variables are true or false. What I want to do is print variables that are true out of a selecton of variables. There must be an easier way of doing it than the below but this is all I can come up with. I need a better solution or a modification on the below to make it work.Here is my code:In this case, I always get the error and never any of the prints. The error always shows that one of the variables is true.Thank you in advance!
You are checking if a non-empty tuple is falsish - which is never true. Use any instead.any([minor, creator, nature]) returns True if any of the elements in the collection are True, False otherwise.
is a tuple. And it always evaluates to True in a boolean context, irrespective of the values of minor, creator and nature. This is what the documentation for Truth Value Testing has to say:Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while  condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following  values are considered false:NoneFalsezero of any numeric type, for example, 0, 0.0, 0j.any empty sequence, for example, '', (), [].any empty mapping, for example, {}.instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a bool() or len() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False.All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are  always true.Your non-empty sequence falls into the "All other values" category and so is regarded as being true.To express your condition using plain Python logic, you need to write:As @Volatility points out, the any() utility function can be used to simplify your code and make it read more clearly.
any feels like overkill here:
