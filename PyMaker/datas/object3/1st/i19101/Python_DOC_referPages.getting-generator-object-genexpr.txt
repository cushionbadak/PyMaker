I have 2 lists:I want to do the following math to it:Multiply 0.49 by 1.91 (the corresponding values from first_lst and second_lst), and multiply 0.52 by 2.03 (corresponding values also). I want to do that under condition that values at position 0 in each corresponding tuple is idential so -2.50 == -2.50 etc. Obviously, we do the same math for remaning tuples as well. My code:Generates however some object:Can you help me fix the code?  
You need to use tuple() or list() to convert that generator expression to a list or tuple:Working version of your code:
Considering that your first_lst and second_lst are defined as follows.The following list comprehension may be useful.
There are 2 issues to look at.The original code will generate the error:and <generator object <genexpr> message is mentioned.     1) Let's fix the the code with minimum amount of changes by creating list comprehension:2) In the original code, the bracket after first_lst ) is misplaced. If we place that bracket after the sec[0] instead of list comprehension we get generator expression. And that will cause the <generator object <genexpr> message: In terms of syntax, the only difference is that one uses parenthesis instead of square brackets.Note: If needed, there are two ways to convert a generator object to the list:2a) Use asterisk (*) operator to unpack object to the list2b) Use explicitly list()
