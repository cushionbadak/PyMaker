Natural Text
I have a list with some book names and their authors, but I want it to look organized, so I want it to take the book title, then complete it with spaces so it ends up with 100 characters, independent of the length of the book title. It would, then, add the book title.So far I've tried this:When I tried it in the python shell it worked pretty well, but when it takes the titles from the list, it doesn't work, why is that?
use string method : str.rjust(100)
While str.ljust()/str.rjust() are good, simple solutions if this is all you want to do, it's worth noting that if you are doing other formatting, you can do this as a part of string formatting:From the docs.
while this might not really be the answer to your question, you could just useand be done with it.
Besides from the unexplained failure, you have some really complicated code where you don't need it:range(0, i) can be written as range(i)You can write the for loop better:You can multiply a string: 'a' * 10 == 'aaaaaaaaaa'And, like @DhruvPathak said, you can just use ''.r/ljust().
