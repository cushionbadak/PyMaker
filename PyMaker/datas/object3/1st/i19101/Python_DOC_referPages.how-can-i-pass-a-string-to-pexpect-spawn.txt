I want to ssh to another node on my network as part of a larger python script, I am using pexpect which works when I do something like this:I want to replace the address with a variable so I can cycle through addresses in a list however when I try:It doesn't work as using address in this way is invalid syntax. What is the correct syntax for this?
session=spawn('ssh root@' + address)  to concatenate the strings
