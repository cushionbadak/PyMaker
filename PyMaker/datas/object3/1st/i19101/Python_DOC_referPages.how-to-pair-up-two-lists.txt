This question already has an answer here:How to merge lists into a list of tuples?                    8 answers                I'm a bit of a Python beginner so I apologise if this is a very basic question.I have two lists of data which are obtained from:I would like to create a loop which would take the first item in "xs" and the first item in "ys" and print them out. I would then like to loop back and repeat for the second item in both lists and so forth.I had thought something like:Or But neither of these seems to give the desired result.
Use the zip function, along with tuple unpacking:In your case, depending on what you need the xs and ys for, you could have iterated through the csv.reader directly:The zip(xs, ys) line was effectively reversing your xs, ys = zip(*reader) line.
Use zip:
For a one line you can use combination of map() and lambda(). Look here if not familiar to this concepts. But be careful, you must be with python 3.x so that print is a function and can be used inside the lambda expression.output
