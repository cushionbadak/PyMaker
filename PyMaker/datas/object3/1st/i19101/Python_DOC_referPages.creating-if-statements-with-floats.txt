Natural Text
I am trying to create a conversion program that automatically copies converted text to windows clipboard. I am trying to make it so that if the user inputs a number that is taken out to 2 decimal places or less it copies the converted results taken out to 3 places to the clipboard. If the user inputs a number that is taken out to 3 decimal places or more it copies the converted results to the clipboard taken out to 4 decimal places.
