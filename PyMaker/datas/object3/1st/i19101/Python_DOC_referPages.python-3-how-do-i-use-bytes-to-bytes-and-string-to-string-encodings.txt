Check out the bytes-to-bytes and string-to-string encodings in Python 3:http://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings (Search for bytes-to-bytes)How do I use these? I've tried using them in .encode and .decode but it didn't work.
Accessing them through the codecs module by a non-alias name seems to work, in Python 3.2 and above:Using an alias name ("base64"), Python < 3.2, or bytes.decode all seem to fail.
