I want to do multiple comparisons for a logical condition in python but I am not sure of the right way round for the and and or. I have 2 statements. Statement 1:Statement 2:Is or-ing the two ands the correct way to go about it?Thanks.
Looking at statement 1, I'm assuming you mean:In which case, I'd probably write it like this (using chained comparisons, docs: python2, python3):You can use an analogous form for statement 2.Having said that, I cannot make your comments in the question's code match up with my interpretation of your conditionals, so it's plausible I don't understand your requirement.
