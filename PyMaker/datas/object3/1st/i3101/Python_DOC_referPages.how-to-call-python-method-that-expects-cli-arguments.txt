Not really sure how else to phrase this,But I am converting a bash script to python, and I am trying to call a method in a python library that typically is called via the CLI. That method uses argparse and expects 2 arguments when it's called.I'm not sure how to call this method and provide the two arguments when calling it from a separate python script.What I've tried:Any help is greatly appreciated!
That function is almost certainly calling the Argparser.parse_args() method with no Python arguments:This takes the arguments from the sys.argv list, taking all elements except for the first.sys.argv is just a list, so you can set your own:Preferably, if you can alter that project or suggest changes, you should (ask to) update the main() function to take arguments:You may need to consider the possibility that the script is not designed to be imported into another program (it may alter global state that other parts of your program rely on, or it could end with sys.exit() and thus close your program unless you specifically catch the SystemExit exception. It may be easier to just run the script with as a child process instead, using:
use sys.argv - it contains the arguments passed to the py script.
