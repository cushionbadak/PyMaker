This might be more information than necessary to explain my question, but I am trying to combine 2 scripts (I wrote for other uses) together to do the following.TargetString (input_file) 4FOO 2BARResult (output_file) 1FOO 2FOO 3FOO 4FOO 1BAR 2BARMy first script finds the pattern and copies to file_2My second script opens the output_file and, using re.sub, replaces and alters the target string(s) using capturing groups and back-references. But I am stuck here on how to turn i.e. 3 into 1 2 3.Any ideas?
This simple example doesn't need to use regular expression, but if you want to use re anyway, here's example (note: you have minor error in your pattern, should be A-Z, not A-A):Prints:Note: If you want to support multiple digits, you can use (\d+) - note the + sign.
Assuming your numbers are between 1 and 9, without regex, you can use a list comprehension with f-strings (Python 3.6+):Reading and writing to CSV files are covered elsewhere: read, write.More generalised, to account for numbers greater than 9, you can use itertools.groupby:
