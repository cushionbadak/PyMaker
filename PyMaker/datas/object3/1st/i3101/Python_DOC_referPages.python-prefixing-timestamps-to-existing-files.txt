Natural Text
I'm trying to make a python script that will find the Last Modified timestamp of an existing file and rename the file with that timestamp as a prefix.  For example: myfile.txt 2018-07-22 to: 2018-07-22 - myfile.txtHere is the code I have so far - which falls short of solving the problem.
To rename the file there is a function called os.rename(src, dest) which will allow you to change the name of the file.
