I have tried numerous ways but how do I input a matrix something like thismy approach is as shown below:Where n is the order of matrix of size n by n .I need to input coordinates of another cell in each cell .Eg: At (1,1) we have (2,3) then it should redirect me to the cell row=2 and column =3 where the coordinates are (3,1) and so on until an ending condition is met.I am using 1 based indexing here. When I do as above it takes '2,3' as a string and when I use int(j) it gives an error showing that 2,3 cannot be an integer. Can anyone come up with an approach ?  
As @RafaelC mentioned, it's unclear what you want int("2,3") to return. I think though you want to do something like the following:matrix=[[j.split(',') for j in input().split(';')]for i in range(2)]If you do want each of the pairs to be a tuple, you can just wrap j.split(',') in tuple.
My example will make a matrix 6x6 from the data. Each cell contains a pair of numbers:Prints:
From what I understand, you want to fill the matrix starting from (1,1) and jumping to the next position written on this location. This should do it:If you only enter the index for 36 iteration, you will get something like this:    You can see there is the following loop:
The ast module seems to be relatively unknown, but may give you what you're looking for. Admittedly, I'm not 100% sure I understand what you want, but the following code might provide a solution, or at least be helpful.The output was:[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 1), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 2)]  [(4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 4), (1, 4)]  [(1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 5), (5, 5), (2, 1), (1, 5)]  [(6, 2), (6, 1), (2, 2), (5, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5)]  [(3, 2), (3, 3), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4)]  [(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 6), (1, 6)]
