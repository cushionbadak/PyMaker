I am using Python 3.6.5 Anaconda. I do not know what I am doing wrong. Any ideas?File Mappe1.csv contains:The python code for opening Mappe1.csv looks like the following:The printout is "A" only. "B" and "C" does not get printed which leads me to the conclusion that the file was not read correctly.Are there any python/windows settings required to allow Python to read a file?Thank you for your help!
You need to supply to csv.reader file object, not file.readlines(). If you want to print Bs, you need to seek to the beginning of file, similar with the Cs.Prints:
csv.reader takes a file object as first parameter, not a list which is what file.readlines() returns.So your line:should be:your for loop to print('B') should be:your for loop to print('C') should work fine like it is although it is worth noting that you could directly set csv_file_list = list(csv_file). And you should reset your file to the first line with:
I use pandas for reading csvs when working with data. The code is very simple, and outputs the answer into a pandas DataFrame. import pandasdf = pandas.read_csv('C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/General/DesignUploader/Mappe1.csv')df
In your code, you are only printing A, B, or C. Try printing the whole line instead. You will see that the row in cvs_file is an object where we are only accessing one part of it. From the docs, see the example:From this example, try:instead.Finally, you will want to change the way the files are being read. Your cvs_files is using delimiter of ;. Try that instead of the dialect. And your file does not actually have any property row. You will need to
