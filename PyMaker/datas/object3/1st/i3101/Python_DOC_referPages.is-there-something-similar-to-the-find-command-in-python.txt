On Linux there's a command called "find" where you can search for specific filenames. Is there any way I can search for a specific method when using dir()? For example, when I do:The result is:Can I do a dir(a) | find iter to get the result ____iter____? Is there any quick way to do a search in this way in Python?
dir(a) returns a list of names in a, so you can use a list comprehension to print out only the ones you care about:You can make this a function if you want to search easily:
Have a look at the glob() function in the python pathlib. It select files based on a pattern.
