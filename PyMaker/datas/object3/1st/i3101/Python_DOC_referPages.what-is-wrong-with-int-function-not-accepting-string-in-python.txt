I am relatively new to programming and I would like to test the base conversion ability of the int() function.When I write:it displays this. However, if I use:it displays a value error, invalid literal for int with base 2: '3'What is going on? This does not allow me to use int(str(a),2) for example.I'm using Python 3.7.0 if this helps. I'm very frustrated with this problem.
The error message invalid literal for int() with base 2: '3' tells you what is wrong: In base 2, the only valid digits are 0 and 1. If you're trying to parse a string in base 2, 3 is an invalid digit.If you want a binary string from an integer string, you can use one of the the following:
From the documentation:if base is given, then x must be a string, bytes, or bytearray  instance representing an integer literal in radix baseSo you need to supply a string representing an integer in base 2 with this call, i.e. a string with only "0" or "1".
