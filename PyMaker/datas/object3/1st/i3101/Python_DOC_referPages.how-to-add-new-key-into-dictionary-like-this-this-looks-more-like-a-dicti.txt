I would like to add new key into the dictionary list. Example:"label" : [] (with empty list)I tried to use loop into "seed" and then to "argument" then use .update("label":[]) in the loop but it won't work. Can anyone please give me an example of using for loop to loop from beginning then to add these new "label"? My prefered goal: ( to have extra "label" within the dictionary according to my input)Example:I am new to dictionary so really need help with this 
If I understand your problem correctly, you want to add 'label' to dict in Argument where there is no label. You could do it like so -Where x is your dict. But what's x[0]['Next']['seed'][0]['Argument']:?Let's simplify your dict -How did we reach here?Let's see-I hope that makes sense. And to add more dictionaries in Argument Now your dict will become -
First things first: access the list of dict that need to be updated.according to your given structure that's l[0]["Next"]["seed"][0]["Argument"]Then iterate that list and check if label already exists, if it does not then add it as an empty list.This can be done by explicit checking:or by re-assigning:Full Code:Output:
You have a list with one nested dictionary. Get the list of the inner dicts, and iterate. Assuming your initial data structure is named data
