I just can not figure it out how to easily do it in python:now I want the output to beprint(myArray[0:3]) -> "this is a test"print(myArray[4:7]) -> "this is another test"Is there a feature in python that allows this without iterating over the whole array within a for word in myArray ...What I get is an index in a loop which only tells me up to which word I should "print" it.I prefer a python "exclusive" variant, which is short and simple, best case a one liner and it should need as less memory as possible (fast even for thousands of attempts)
It seems like what you actually want is to join together some sublist in your list of words.
You can try join(), I hope this is the solution you are looking for
I guess you have to make it myArray[0:4] and join function... 
You need to use the string method join(). This method applies to a separator. For instance:Will output:
You were close.For python 2.7:For python 3.x:
just use the  join()
As the other guys have said, you can always use join:However, I don't understand why you can't use this formatIn terms of efficiency, the latter option is better, and it is just as pythonic as the former.When you 'join' the array, you are implicitly interating over it, and when you finally display the necessary elements, you are iterating again.
as friends have told you can use join in python:which puts what you call join on it (here "") between elements as seperator and returns as string.one good way is just remove ending space from your array and do like this:
