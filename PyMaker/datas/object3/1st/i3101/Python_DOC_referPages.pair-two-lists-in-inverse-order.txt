What I want to do is to choose one item in list A and another one in list B, pair them like:I use two for loops but it doesn't work:I inputted [1,2,3] and what I want to get is 124,but I got 661.Edit:Sorry, the example I gave above is not so clear.Let us think about A[1,2,3] and B[6,5,4].I want output [5,7,9], because 5 is 1+4, 7 is 2+5, 9 is 3+6
You only need one loop if you want to search in same list back and forth or different list with same length (i and len(lst)-1-i).Try not use build-ins such as sum, list, tuple, str, int as variable names, it will give you some nasty result in some case.Output:for A = [1, 2, 3] and B = [6, 5, 4].You can use a list comprehension:Or the zip() function and a list comprehension:Result:
What you are trying to do is turn a list of digits into the according number (and add 1). You can enumerate the reversed list in order to pair a digit with its appropriate power of 10:You can apply that to your other example as follows, using zip:
You can do this without a loop:zip() - creates pairs of all elements of iterables, you feed it A and B reversed (via slicing). Then you sum up each pair and create a list from those sums.map( function, iterable) - applies the function to each element of the iterablezip() works when both list have the same length, else you would need to leverage itertools.zip_longest() with a defaultvalue of 0.Output:
