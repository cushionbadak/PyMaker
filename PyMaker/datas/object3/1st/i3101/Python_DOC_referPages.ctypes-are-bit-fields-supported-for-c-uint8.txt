I was playing around with some ctype-structures and found out something interesting that got me wondering about my implementation. A MWE is as follows:Whose output is:9, 0 ,9Which was something that I was not expecting. By turning bf.y into a c_uint16, I get what I would have expected from the beginning: 9, 9, 9.Having a glance to the documentation I see that bitfields are only possible for integer fields, which doesn't really specify that c_uint8 are not supported. I then referred to the available tests, where I see that no c_uint8 or c_char is included. However, trying to use a c_char throws a TypeError, whereas c_uint8 doesn't throw.Could someone just clarify what is going on? Are bit fields just not implemented for uint_8? Or am I just using it wrong? Any type of clarification is highly appreciated!Thanks in advance!
Note: Mac OS X python 2.7 and 3.6 have the same outputso... for some reason you can't use the 8 bit types signed or unsigned and divide them with a bitfield ... I will look into docs for the "why"outputs: (1, ', ', 63, ', ', 3) which is cool, dropping the 2 top bits: 255 - 128 - 64 = 63and prints: (1, ', ', 255, ', ', 3) ok... saneBut,prints: (1, ', ', 0, ', ', 3)
