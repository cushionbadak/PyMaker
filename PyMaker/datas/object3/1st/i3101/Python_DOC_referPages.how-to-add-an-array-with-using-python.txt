Given an array a = [1,2,3,[4,5]] using Python 3, how can I add all the elements in the array?The above code did not work. Also in the case, if you're given an array with an unknown amount of arrays inside arrays, How can those numbers be calculated?

You need a flatten function. Here is one:which you can then use in sum, for example:
You can use functools.reduce to sum this nested listIf the list can be more than one level nested, you have to use a recursive approach
You can use the closure property for finding sum of infinite nested list.likea = [1,2,3,[4,5]] ----> 15a = [1,2,3,[4,5, [6,7, [8, 9]]], [10, 11, 12, [13, 14, 5]]] -- > 110
