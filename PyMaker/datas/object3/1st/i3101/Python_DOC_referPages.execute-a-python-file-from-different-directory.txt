I try to understand how to split up python files belonging to the same project in different directories. If I understood it right I need to use packages as described here in the documentation.So my structure looks like this:with empty __init__.py files and Now I expect that when I execute B/fileB.py I get "Hello from A", but instead I get the following error:What am I doing wrong?
Your problem is the same as: Relative imports for the billionth timeTL;DR: you can't do relative imports from the file you execute since  main module is not a part of a package.As main:Output:As a module (not main): Output:
One way to solve this is to add module A into the path of fileB.py by addingto the top of fileB.py.
