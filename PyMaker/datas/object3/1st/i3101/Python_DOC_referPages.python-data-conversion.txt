I am looking for a python solution to convert an input file and read it as it is into a program written in PYTHON3.My input file consists of the following data:I have tried the followinga) datafile = open("infile.txt","r").read()   Error message: TypeError: string indices must be integersb) datafile = open("infile.txt","r").readline()   Error message: TypeError: string indices must be integersc) datafile = open("infile.txt","r").readlines()   Error message: TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strBy the way, I am new to Python.
one solution will be:as suggested by Evgeny, you can use json module as well:
You should be aware of the concpet of dictionary by now in python.The below code will help you. Assume the name of your file to be file1.txt Now as mentioned by someone in comments you should use json libraryNow printing read will give you dictionary of your datawill print your dictionary{'g': ['w', 'x', 'y'], 'c': ['g', 'c', 'a'], 'e': ['f', 'a', 'b', 'c'], 'd': ['d', 'a', 'g'], 'h': ['a', 'c', 'e'], 'b': ['d', 'c']}Note :- Dont forget to import json. import json Important This is rather simple question. Kindly refrain from asking such questions and gaining downvotes for them
