I'm trying to apply genetic algorithm for 8 queens puzzle. I've coded whole algorithm but it keeps getting stuck when it finds solution with 6 unhit queens and can't get over it. I feel like there's some diversity problem but I can't figure out what to do with it. My question is what is wrong with this realisation and why it keeps getting stuck on 6 unhit queens and can't make a final move? I've already examined every bit of code and I think there's some misinterpretation of algorithm itself evolved. That's why I attached whole code. So I hope that someone would tell me where I did wrong. Thanks in advance.
One problem with your code is the way you use Python function random.randrange(). The documentation says that randrange(a, b) will return a random number x such that a <= x < b (note that b is not included). When you write something like i = random.randrange(0, 7) you will get a random number from the semi-open interval [0, 7), while what you (most likely) want is the number from closed interval [0, 7], because board size is 8x8. So check all calls to randrange(), fix them if they are incorrect and see whether it solves the problem.
