Please, I want an easier and simplest way for extracting every first elements from the keys of this dictionary:I want to get something like this:This is what I did: I want an efficient way of doing that
Your s is a list of nested tuples. But you could easily create a dict from it, by passing it to the dict constructor. But if you actually have a dict you can efficiently extract the 1st item from each key tuple using operator.itemgetter. outputHowever, you probably should not do this, unless you're using Python 3.6+, because in earlier versions dictionaries do not preserve insertion order, so there is no guarantee that the items in a are in the same order as the items in s. If you don't actually have a dict, but you just have that s list, then your code is perfectly fine.
