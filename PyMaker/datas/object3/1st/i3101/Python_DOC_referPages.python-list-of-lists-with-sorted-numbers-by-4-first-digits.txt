I have a list which contains numbers and I want to create a new list which contains separate lists of all numbers with the same 4 first digits.Example: make l2 from l1how can I create l2 from l1?I tried iterating over the elements of l1 but w/o success!!Still not know how to proceed..
You could create a dict as intermediate result and then convert this dict back to a list.You also need to convert your integers to strings first.
You could use itertools.groupby after converting the list elements to strings and using the first for digits as keys:EDIT: Frieder's solution is pretty much how this is implemented behind the scenes.
