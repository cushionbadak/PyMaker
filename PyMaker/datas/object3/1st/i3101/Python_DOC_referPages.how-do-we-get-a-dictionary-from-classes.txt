this code does not run as I want it to:
You mean by this:Output:
You can just use the special attribute __dict__ of you class:Output:
You can use the __dict__ attribute to get a dict of all the attributes of an object.This outputs:
This question is a bit ambiguous.If you're asking for the simple attributes for instances of simple classes, this is exactly what the vars builtin is for:While we're at it, it's pretty weird to call a parameter self when you're not writing a method; let's call it something different:But there are a lot of things this won't pick up, including:Properties.Any attributes of a __slots__ class.Class attributes.Dynamic attributes from __getattr__/__getattribute__ and __dir__.If you want as many of those as possible, that's what the dir builtin is for. But dir just returns a list of names; you then have to look each one up:This is pretty close to "every whatever I could do an obj.whatever with".But that's probably more than you want. It'll include private members, and bound methods, and special stuff used by the Python interpreter. You have to decide exactly what you want to filter out, but once you have a rule, it should be easy to implement. For example:If you want to get fancier, look at the inspect module, which has helper functions for this kind of filtering.While we're at it, if you have a good reason for doing this on some particular set of classes, you might want to design those classes to be easier to convert to a dict—and to be able to customize how they're converted.For example, if you build your classes with @dataclass—or with the third-party attrs library, which is more powerful and doesn't require Python 3.7—it's trivial:The dataclasses library built the __init__ method for me, and also the __repr__ method, and the other stuff needed to support things like asdict, so I didn't have to write anything at all.
