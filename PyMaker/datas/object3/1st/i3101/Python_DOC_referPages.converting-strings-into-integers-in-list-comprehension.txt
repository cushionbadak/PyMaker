I am trying to write a function which takes the file and split it with the new line and then again split it using comma delimiter(,) after that I want to convert each string inside that list to integers using only list comprehensionHow the data looks after splitting with comma delimiter(,)How do I convert each string inside this output as integers and assign it to a single list using list comprehension.
str.split() produces a new list; so splitted is a list of lists. You'd want to convert the contents of each contained list:Demo:Note that you could just loop directly over the file to get separate lines too:and skipping an entry in such an object could be done with next(iterableobject, None).Rather than read the whole file into memory and manually split the data, you could just use the csv module:The above is a generator function, producing one row at a time as you loop over it:You can still get a list with all rows with list(read_csv("US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv")).
