This question already has an answer here:Removing item from list causes the list to become nonetype                    2 answers                I have this code:When I run it, this is what I get:So it appears that the "4" was removed from the list as specified in the condition of the if statement, yet the if statement did not end up being "True" since the print statement did not print to the console. Why is it that the if statement is false?
myList.remove(4) does not return True or False depending on whether the remove operation was successful or not.Instead, it returns nothing (i.e. None) if successful and raises a ValueError otherwise.Thus, translates towhich is False
From the docs:list.remove(x)  Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It is an error if there is no such item.So .remove() either returns None or raises a ValueError, hence it equates to False in your code. Here is a link to the relevant docs for further reading.
The remove function doesn't actually return anything. So, the if statement if checking for a value, doesn't get one, which means the if statement results in a false.This will result in the following when the code is executed
Because .remove, like del, it doesn't return anything. So, it implicitly returns None, which is evaluates to False in a Boolean expression.
The .remove method for lists returns None when the item was found, and throws an error if not.Here is one option:
