as the title says, I have several folders, several .ppm.bz2 files and I want to extract them exactly where they are using python.Directory structure imageI am traversing in the folders as this:`then I get this error``
The tarfile module is for tar files, including tar.bz2. if your file is not tar you should use bz2 module directly.Also, try using os.walk instead of multiple listdir as it can traverse the treeThis will uncompress all .bz2 files in all subfolders, in the same place they are. All other files will stay the same. If the uncompressed file already exists it will be overwritten.Please backup your data before running destructive code
