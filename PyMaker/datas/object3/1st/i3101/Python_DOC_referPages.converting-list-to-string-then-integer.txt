I have a list with 1550500 numbers, and all of them with quotes.Example: list('100', '150', '200', '250') etc...I need to sum all the numbers, but before that I need to convert it to INT.List Name: trip_listMy code:Error message:What am I doing wrong? I am new to coding...
Python has a map function, this takes a function and an iterable. There is also the sum function, which returns the sum of an iterable.You can use this:Note that the map function does not return a list, it returns a generator. To convert it to a list, use (this may take a while as it requires iterating over the entire list, and yours is quite long).The error with your code is converting your list to a string, that is, So when you try to iterate over the string, the first x is [ which is not a number (thus the exception).As a sidenote, using list(map(int, a_list)) is faster than [int(i) for i in a_list]
You have to convert each element to int:The code above uses a generator, what is more efficient in cases when you just have to iterate in a list. The last line convert to a list again properly.But, as you said, if you already have a list of strings, you can just do:If you know numpy, you can do too:
