I have a list of class objects my_rectangle:Using the class attributes (x_centroid and y_centroid) which give the coordinates of the centroid, I wanted to order this list, using as an order left-to-right then top-to-bottom (normal English reading order)?Say I have:And I want to order it to get:Which is a representation of the text:
Generating a sorted list is the specialty of the builtin function sorted().Sorting using multiple values can be accomplished by providing a key function, which key function returns the values as a tuple. The resulting list is then sorted according to the lexicographical ordering of the tuple.
You can make custom classes sortable by defining a __lt__ method. This takes care of the < operator which is used in default sorting.I'm defining centroid as a property, so that it will update if you change any of the other coordinates after initializing a Rectangle. You will get this output if you use the data from your question.
