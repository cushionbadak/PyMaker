Natural Text
I have an origin file (fo.log) like below:And a destination file (fd.log) like below:Both files have the same number of lines (that could be millions of lines), except for the title line of the origin file. Thinking about memory usage, I don't want to read all lines to memory.After processing my script, I would like to have the destination file (fd.log) like below:which means that I took the last information of each origin file line and appended it to the corresponding destination line.Correspondence between lines from one file to another is just the line position and there is nothing to do with the information on it.The closest script I could do is written bellow and it correctly prints the information I want.
For small enough files you can prepare the file contents as a list or a string and then write it to the file, e.g.:For bigger files consider using a backup file as stdlib's fileinput module does.
