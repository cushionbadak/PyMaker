This question already has an answer here:Why does (1 in [1,0] == True) evaluate to False? [duplicate]                    1 answer                I noticed the following strange behavior:How is the first expression parsed? Both placements of parentheses yield different results.(Python 3.6)
From the docs:Note that comparisons, membership tests, and identity tests, all have the same precedence and have a left-to-right chaining feature as described in the Comparisons section.in and == are membership and comparison operators respectively.From Comparisons:... expressions like a < b < c have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematics:[...]Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).
