I would like to test the batch_write method using unit test. I want to mock the batch_writer(). I have seen usage of  mock_open used to mock file open methods. But I don't really understand can i mock this streaming batch_writer() call.
I came across this issue as well this is how i solved it.Now i can pass my mock test class in place of the batch_writer to mock calls or check params. I know this is an old question but it is one that I struggled with and wished someone would have posted a code example if this is easy to do. If there is better easier way using patch that anyone has please post.
