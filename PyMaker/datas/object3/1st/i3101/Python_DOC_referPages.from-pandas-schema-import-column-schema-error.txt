I'm running python 2.7 and trying to get program working with pandas.  The following error message is received when importing Column.  Looks like it might be an issue with the :-Error Message:File  "/Users/coxda/faDataValidation27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas_schema/column.py",  line 8      def init(self, name: str, validations: typing.Iterable['validation._BaseValidation'] = [],  allow_empty=False):                             ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
The syntax error is because the package uses Python 3.5's type annotation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.htmlThe package documentation does not specifically mention Python 3 is required, but the syntax it uses suggests Python 3.5+ is required, or, since the package is in pure python, you could edit the column.py source and should be able to remove those type annotations and then successfully import the classes. Reference: What is the colon inside the parameter mean in python? [duplicate]
