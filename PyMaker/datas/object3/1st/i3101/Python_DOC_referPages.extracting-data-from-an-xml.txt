This question already has an answer here:How do I parse XML in Python?                    14 answers                I've looked at several examples and haven't been able to edit one to fit my needs.. I'm trying to extract the maker and model tags from a file but no matter what previously answered question I find I can't get it to work for me. Edit- It's probably not different. What's different is my level of understanding of python. Trying to edit the scripts provided in the different answers already on Stack, I've been unable to successfully get the thing to work. 
try bs4...?for multiple entries, just loop through them with find_all()getting data through a file:without importing any modules:this is for the 'maker' tag only, it might be beneficial to split these up into separate definitions and iterate through them
Take a look at the python docs.
