This question already has an answer here:Python: Length of longest sublist? [duplicate]                    2 answers                Convert Python sequence to NumPy array, filling missing values                    5 answers                I often create a list of lists with varying length of inner list, for e.g. to represent a bunch of sentences of varying lengthI need these to be converted to numpy matrix. To make all inner lists of same length I pad a dummy element at the end and make all inner lists equal the maximum length.Is there any compact way of finding the max length of inner list?I usually do it by writing a for loop and keeping track of the max length but I do it so often that I feel the need for a better way.
Using max function:You will get the longest list, if you need the actual length just use len again:Here you have the live example
And order it:
you can do it like the following:
Using map and max, you find the max length of the sub lists easily
To convert your list of lists in a numpy array, you can try the following snippet. The fourth line pads your data and the fifth line creates the numpy array.
