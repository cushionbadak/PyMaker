I'm trying to run a code that can read a specific line of data from a csv file in python.How could I take an input and then use that to select and print that specific row?
A filter should do the trick, something like Explanation:Filter take an itterable (here reader) and will apply for each element of the itterable the lambda you give him and will return a new list "filtered". If the lambda return True the element will be returned in the filtered list.A lambda is basically a dwarf-function (wiser, nerdier people will correct me on this over simplification but you get the idea) that return the one and only line you gave him.So my lambda just does the operation "selected_details in x" that will return True if selected_details is in x and else False, you get the idea.
You can iterate over each line and check if the user inputted data is in line.Ex:
You could use next with a default value.This will return the first row where the idx index equals value or None if it is not found:Sample usage:A more descriptive approach would be to use csv.DictReader so that we can search based on the column name:Usage is very similar to the previous approach:
