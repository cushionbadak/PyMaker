I need to make sequence of random strings, which increase(decrease) for alphabetic oder. For example: "ajikfk45kJDk", "bFJIPH7CDd", "c".
The simplest way I can think of isreverse = True makes it descending
The simplest thing to do is to create N random strings and then sort them.So, how do you create a random string? Well, you haven't specified what your rule is, but your three examples are strings of 1 to 12 characters taken from the set of ASCII lowercase, uppercase, and digits, so let's do that.So, just do this N times, then sort it.Putting it together:This should be simple enough that you can customize it however you want. Want case-insensitive sorting? Just add key=str.upper to the sorted. Want some other distribution of lengths? Just replace the randrange. And so on.
There's a lot of ways to do that, and this an easy and simple example to do that in Python 3 using Ascii char codes:-
You can use the chr() Python 3 function in a loop while generating random number in the ASCII category range you want.You can find all the ASCII categories here or on Wikipedia.For exemple :More information about the chr() function on Python 3 official documentation.
