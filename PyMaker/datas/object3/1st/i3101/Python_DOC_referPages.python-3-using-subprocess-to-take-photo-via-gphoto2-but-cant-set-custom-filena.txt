everything works fine while I do it via  terminal but when I use python script it doesn't.Command:gphoto2 --capture-image-and-download --filename test2.jpgI'ts all good.But when I try to do it via python script and subprocess nothing happens. I tried to do it like:and:While I use only  --capture-image-and-download it works fine, but I get filename that I don't want to. Can you tell me what I do wrong?!
On the command line, quotes and spaces are consumed by the shell; with shell=False you need to split up the tokens on whitespace yourself (and ideally understand how the shell processes quotes; or use shlex to do the work for you).Unless you are stuck on a truly paleolithic Python version, you should avoid supbrocess.Popen() in favor of subprocess.run() (or, for slightly older Python versions, subprocess.check_output()). The lower-level Popen() interface is unwieldy, but gives you low-level access control for when the higher-level API doesn't do what you want.
