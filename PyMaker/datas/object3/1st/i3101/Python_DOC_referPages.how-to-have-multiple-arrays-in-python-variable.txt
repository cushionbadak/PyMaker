Right now I have a small script that writes and read data to a CSV file.Brief snippet of the write function:Then brief snippet of reading the file:I'd like to just skip the CSV part all together and see if I can just hold all that data in a variable but I'm not sure what that looks like. Any help is appreciated.Thank you.
...no point in me saving data to a csv file just to read it later in the scriptJust keep it in a list of lists...It might be worth saving each row as a namedtuple or a dictionary
