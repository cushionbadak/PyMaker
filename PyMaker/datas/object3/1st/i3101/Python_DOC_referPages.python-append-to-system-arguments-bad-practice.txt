I'm parsing system arguments in my Python project using sys.argv. At some point i had to modify the script after having written the logic that parses system args. I added a line the basically appends a string to sys.argv so the logic that parses it won't be changed - sys.argv.append('some string here')Is it a bad practice to modify the system arguments after they have been created for the program ?
It is bad  practice to modify sys.argv in Python and it's equivalent in other languages.In these situations I recommend a parsed_args variable which has all your parsed data from sys.argv, any default values that you would like to set, and any modifications that "middleware" would make.
In my opinion in such case it would be better to first parse those arguments using argparse. That way you can get Namespace object, that can be modified and much easier to maintain than hardcodingsys.argv.After that you can modify Namespace any way you wantSmall example:
