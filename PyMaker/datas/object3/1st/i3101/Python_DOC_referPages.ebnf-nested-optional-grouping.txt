I'm observing the python grammar listed in the manual and considering the outputs of their form of EBNF, specifically with varargslist: Though I'm specifically interested in this section: Which I interpret as:I realize that bothAre valid options in this form, but does this include:as well? The wiki page for EBNF statesbut does this group everything within the square brackets as one entity that may appear only once, or is the option selective, for example:
Ifis then non-terminal2 representswhich is nullable by definition. (That is, it might be empty.)So, strictly speaking, once you've done the transformis not a valid outcome. The parse must bewhere non-terminal2 has matched an empty string.But the actual parse logic is more likely to want to use the formulationin which non-terminal2 has been eliminated as a distraction from the resulting parse. In this case, since the 0-or-more repetition can be 0 repetitions, correct outcomes would includeand so on.
