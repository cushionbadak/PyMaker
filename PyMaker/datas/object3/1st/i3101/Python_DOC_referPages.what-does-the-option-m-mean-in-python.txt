What does the -m mean?From python manual page:-m module-name  Searches sys.path for the named module and runs the corresponding .py file as a script. py -m venv env will tell Python (the Windows version uses py) to use execute the venv module and create a virtual environment that will be stored in the env directory. From virtualenv documentation:Virtualenv has one basic command:$ virtualenv ENVWhere ENV is a directory to place the new virtual environment.What's the difference of venv and virtualenv?venv and virtualenv are just shorter versions of virtual environment, meaning that venv is the same as virtualenv -- there is no difference.
