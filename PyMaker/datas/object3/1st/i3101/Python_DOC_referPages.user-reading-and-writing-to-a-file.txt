i am trying to write a program that if a user press 1, it reads the file, if 2, it write to the file and if 3, it erase the file. Unfortunately, the code stop working after the first input from user. Is it possible to write a function for that?
Python3 does not have separate raw_input() and input() functions for returning ints and strings. It only has input(), which returns a string. You are attempting to compare the output of input() (a string) to an int, for example on this line:The solution is to use the int() function to get the types right, i.e.More readingSource 1Source 2
The problem is that your user input should be an int. Use this instead :=>"user_input = int(input("Please select one: "))"And also you cannot write an integer to a file so use this: => "readfile.write("user_input")" or convert your user input to string before writing to the file.
