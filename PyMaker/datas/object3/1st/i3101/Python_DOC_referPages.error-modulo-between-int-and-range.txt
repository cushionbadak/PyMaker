I tried to create a mini-program that counts how many primes there are until some number (the input)When I ran my program, I got an error:I didn't understand how to correct my program.
the problem is with the following linewhat you are trying to do is to apply modulus between an integer and a range. which is not defined by default. you can implement this by overloading the __mod__(a, b). But, by default, you can do this between two int's or floats.
The problem starts herei % range(2,i)The variable i is a integer. range(2,i) is a list or a generator, depending on what python version you are using.You cannot get the remeinder of dividing a number by a list / function.
The error tells you that you cannot use the modulo operator with operand of types int and range, which make sense.I think list comprehension can help you, if you don't know what it is, Wikipedia can help you with the theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension) and Python.org with the practical (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions).You should try this instead:This code uses a list comprehension to count the number of divisor of i and if this number is 2, it appends i to the list primes.
