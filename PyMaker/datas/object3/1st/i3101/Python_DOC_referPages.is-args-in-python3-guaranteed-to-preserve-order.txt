In Python3 i can use * to accept any number of positional arguments.A sample demonstrating this:Would thus print:What I'm uncertain is, if the order of positional arguments stored in args is actually guaranteed to be preserved? Can I trust that if I call a(1,2,3,4) then args is always (1,2,3,4) or is this just a side effect of an implementation detail?While trying to look into this, I saw that order in **kwargs is preserved since Python 3.6 and this is specified in PEP-468 how ever I didn't find any mention of *args in this regard.
definitely, it preserves Order because *args take/consider the argument as a tuple data type.in Python tuple have its Order, always.Only dictionary is the one data type which will not follow the order in python
