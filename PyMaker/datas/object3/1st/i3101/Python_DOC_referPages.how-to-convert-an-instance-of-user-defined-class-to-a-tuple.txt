I have an imaginary class:And I would like to be able to convert it to tuple using built-in constructor:*I know I can to it manually, by implementing a method like astuple(). I would like to, if possible, achieve it by calling tuple constructor.
You can achieve desired functionality by defining __iter__() method in your class:Output:If you want (keys, values), you can store your items in dict:Prints:__iter__() is part of Python Datamodel. When you implement this method in your class, all functions and syntax constructs that expect something iterable will work with your class without change, that includes parameters in tuple().
