I have a project named tweetme which has two apps account and tweets,i have serializers.py file in both of the apps to serialize data. So when i try to relative import the serializer class from account/api/serializers.py to another app tweets/api/serializers.py, the relative import shows error.1- 1st i tried full path from src.account.api.serializers import UserDisplaySerializer, it gave error in console that ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'2- Then i tried from ...account.api.serializers import UserDisplaySerializer,its showing error ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package.So what am i doing wrong? How to do relative import properly?@editadding init.py in srcStill same error persisting...[![User Serializer class in account app][4]][4]
Seems you are missing __init__.py in src folder.From the python docsThe __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.Remove all relative imports used from your project/app and use absolute import, becauseAbsolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured Update - 11. Change in /tweetme/src/tweetme/urls.pyCommented out two lines, because of their urls.py doesn't have any valid patterns2. Change in /tweetme/src/tweets/api/serializers.pyChange from src.account.api.serializers import UserDisplaySerializer to from account.api.serializers import UserDisplaySerializer
