Consider the dequeue=[2, 3, 4, None, None, None, 1]. It is circular and has suppose that 1 is the front of the dequeue and 4 is the back of the dequeue, knock on wood, we should have these indices stored under the variables front and back, their values being 6 and 2, respectively. How can I print the values between the indices front and back, that is, [1, 2, 3, 4]. Better yet, and more specifically, I was hoping to find a way to make a string that would more specifically look like [ 1, 2, 3, 4]. My code is as follows, but I don't believe it is time efficient and, moreover, within the larger chunk of my code, I'm not sure this method is working. def str(self):Where self.size=the number of nonempty entries, self.capacity=the total number of cells in the array, self.contents representing the contents of the array, and self.front and self.back representing the indices of the front and back of the dequeue.
Do you want to use the built-in deque? If so, it supports standard iteration making a list comprehension quite pythonic:If it is not a built-in deque, why not add iteration support to your type to allow the above method (and probably many other methods).
