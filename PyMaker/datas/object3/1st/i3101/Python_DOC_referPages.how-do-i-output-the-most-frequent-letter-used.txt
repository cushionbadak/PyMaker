This question already has an answer here:How to count the most frequent letter in a string?                    6 answers                this code outputs the letter and how many times it is used however how can i modify it to also find and print the letter used the most? 
If you're looking for an easy to read solution that is close to what you wanted to implement, that could do the trick,Basically it returns any letters with the most occurrences. Take note that this take care of the cases where more than one letter have the same number of occurrences.EDITAlso note that I added if word != " ": because your initial code would consider a space as a word which is probably not what you want. 
You can just sort the letters by values and then to write last member of that sorted array:Sample input/output:
So to find the maximum used word from the dict x, you could use operator like -But this will give you only one of n number of words having equal, i.e. max value
Maybe you would want to use "defaultdict()" from collections    What it does is even if you don't have the key in dictionary when calling it by keys,    it won't cause any errors
