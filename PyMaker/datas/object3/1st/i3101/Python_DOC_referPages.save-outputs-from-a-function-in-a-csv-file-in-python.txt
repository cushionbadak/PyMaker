So I have created a function which takes in input from the user and then displays the required output. The function is: def getname(name, place)Then the other code follows. In the end the user is asked name and place. The function searches the dataframe which I have imported and displays the result as the info of that name.I would like these outputs to be exported to a csv file. Not really sure of how to begin my code in this case.Thanks for the help!!
