I'm a python beginner trying to make a game of blackjack, and have been continuously getting multiple keyerrors regarding this codeThe error occurs when I try calling the function like thisto try and use the 'rank' function in class 'Card' to apply attributes to a new 'card' variable
random.choice takes a list (or tuple) in input (it needs integer-indexable objects).So just convert rank dictionary (the values, it is) to a list then pick a value: like this (I've created a new function because the rank(rank) bit made no sense, you don't need a parameter to pick a card:list(rank.values()) is required in python 3, dictionary values are no longer of list type. Maybe you want to pre-compute this list to save computation time.
