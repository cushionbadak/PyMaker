I am using cProfile try to profile my codes:However, the results are too long and cannot be fully displayed in the Spyder terminal (the function calls which take the longest time to run cannot be seen...). I also tried saving the results using cProfile.run('my_func()','profile_results'), but the output file is not in human readable format (tried with and without .txt suffix).So my question is how can I save the profiling results to an external file which is human readable (like in a .txt format with all the words properly displayed)?
Updated. You can get output of profiler using io.StringIO() and save it into file.Here is an example:Run our script and open test.txt. You will see readable result:Also I can recommend to use dump_stats + pstats.Stats. Here is an example how to use it. Structure of files:example package - let's imagine that this is some kind of application logic. Now let's run server(python3 test_ex.py) and open http://localhost:8083/test. After a few seconds you will see long json. After that you will see profile_dump file in project folder. Now run python live interpreter in project folder and print our dump using pstats:Also you can easy sorting results:Hope this helps.
Expanding upon the previous answer, you can dump everything out to a .csv file to sort and play around with in your favorite spreadsheet application.
You don't really need StringIO, as a file qualifies as a stream.
