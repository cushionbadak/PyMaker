Natural Text
Lets say I have this piece of code:Python points at where the invalid syntax is, but doesn't tell me what is it that I am missing. Note that this question is not about what I am missing. I do know that there is a : that I am missing at the end of the range() function. I am asking why Python isn't specific about the missing :. Is there anything else that can come after the range() function in terms of syntax?
According to the Python documentation:The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:Then, after the in you can put any iterable. Specifically answering your question, after the range(), you can put a comma and pass any object, or you could also keep passing as many objets as you want separated by commas.
