My Python app contains a subfolder called Tests which I use to run unit tests. All of my files are in the parent folder, which I will call App. The Tests folder contains, say, a test.py file. The App folder contains an app.py file and a file.txt text file.In my test.py file, I can make my imports like this:Say my app.py file contains the following:Now if I run test.py, I get the following error:How can I fix this? Many thanks!
Assuming the file is located in the same folder as your script:Explanation:__file__ is the path to your scriptos.path.dirname get's the directory in which your script sitsos.path.abspath makes that path absolute instead of relative (just in case relative paths mess your script up, it's good practice)Then all we need to do is combine your parent_dir with the file, we do that using os.path.join.Read the docs on os.path methods here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.htmlA more explicit version of this code can be written like this, if that helps:
The open function looks for the file in the same folder as the script that calls the open function. So, your test.py looks in the tests folder, not the app folder. You need to add the full path to the file.or move the test.py file in the same folder as text.txt
