This question already has an answer here:Convert floating point number to a certain precision, and then copy to string                    7 answers                Consider I have the below list of float values. I import the locale United States to convert my comma decimal separator to dot decimal values. I cannot use the float format function before i convert it into dot values, since python don't accept comma values as float values. And when i also tried to use the float format function after i get the tuple of dot values, I wont be able to do so because tuples are immutable. I am need of all the tuple float values with a decimal precision of 2. It will be really great if someone can help me with it.expected output :Here is my code with output at every line output:output:
Use a list comprehension. Replace the , then convert to float then round that value.
