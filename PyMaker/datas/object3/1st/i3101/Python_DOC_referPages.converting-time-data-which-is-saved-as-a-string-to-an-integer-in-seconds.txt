This question already has an answer here:Plotting dates on the x-axis with Python's matplotlib                    2 answers                I have some time data that I read into a numpy array as a string. It's in the formatI want to be able to plot this cleanly over an indefinite amount of time, let's say the data goes for 4 hours. How can I convert this into a reasonable form to plot? I am not sure what form would be best so suggestions would be helpful. As you can probably tell I'm a noob, my boss and I appreciate the help!
Unlike time.strptime, datetime.strptime can parse such strings, including microseconds, and you can convert the result to a number (seconds since midnight):And use it like this:This should be safe even in the presence of DST changes because strptime merely parses the time, and does not attempt any such semantic conversions
