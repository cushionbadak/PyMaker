Apologies if the question is a little vague, I'll edit it if necessary.I'm creating a chess game in Python with Tkinter and want to add a chess timer.When a player moves a piece the move() function is called, causing the piece to be moved to the correct square and the turn switches (from black to white and vice-versa) - turn is a list ["W", "B"] that keeps track of whose turn it is.Called when a player selects a square to move to:To time each move, I want to measure the time between consecutive execution of the move() function (i.e. time between turn switches).To summarise:How can I measure the time between consecutive executions of the same function?EditFrom the answers I can see that my question was misunderstood, I'm sorry for not clarifying:I'm not looking to measure the time it takes to execute a function (the move() function). I am looking to measure the time between consecutive executions of a function. The answers given here assume I only want to measure the execution time of the function from start to end. You cannot assume that the move() function executes again immediately after it has finished; it is called by clicking a button so there may be a delay (thinking about the move) before the move() function is called again.Any help would be greatly appreciated.
You can use time module of python. If i understood your question properly, Something like this can be done:
