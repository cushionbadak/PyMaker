Let's assume that I get number as string or hex or int and I want to convert to integer. I'm looking for a more generic form.for example,if I write:int('0x10',16) then int('0x10') will throw exception.if I write:int('10') then int('10',16) will throw exception.Do I need to check type with instanceof ?
If the string represents a valid hex, it is prefixed by 0x. So, you could just check value.startswith('0x')
You need to specify the base (docs), when using int() on a hex value:
