I am trying to make a function in python that creates dictionaries with custom names. The code I am using so far looks like this:The problem that I am having is that whenever I use the function, no matter what I put down for P, for example:It creates a blank dictionary with the name 'P'. is there a way to make it create a dictionary with the name Party1?
It looks like you're confused with how variable names, and strings, and objects interact withing Python. When you have the function PCreate(P) you are saying that when the function is called, it will take on parameter, and within the function that parameter will be called P. This means that if you have the function,and call it three times,you will get the output:This is because the parameter P has no explicit type in Python. So, when you called your function with the argument 'Party1' the values looked like thisSo you didn't assign {} to the variable with the name Party1, you overwrote the local variable P with a new empty dict.I think you probably do not want to be doing what you're doing, but see this answer for more information on setting a variable using a string variable as its name.What I recommend you do is create a function that returns your custom dictionaries, and assign the returned value to your custom name.If you need the reference key to your new dictionary to be stored in a string, then you're in luck because that's what dictionaries are for!You can first create a dictionary that will be used to store your custom named dictionaries:and when you want to add a new dictionary with a custom name, call this functione.g.would leave you with two dictionaries accessible by dictionaries['Party1'] and dictionaries['Party2']
