Does anyone know how to properly install tensorflow on Windows?I'm currently using Python 3.7 (also tried with 3.6) and every time I get the same "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-gpu (from versions: )No matching distribution found for tensorflow-gpu" errorI tried installing using pip and anaconda, both don't work for me.Found a solution, seems like Tensorflow doesn't support versions of python after 3.6.4. This is the version I'm currently using and it works.
Tensorflow or Tensorflow-gpu is supported only for 3.5.X versions of Python. Try installing with any Python 3.5.X version. This should fix your problem.
You mentioned Anaconda. Do you run your python through there?If so check in Anaconda Navigator --> Environments, if your current environment have got tensorflow installed. If not, install tensorflow and run from that environment. Should work.
Check whether you have a CPU or GPU, if your system doesn't have GPU, then it will generate error.If you are going to install tensorflow using Windows command prompt (assuming python is already installed), then just run the following command. Go to the root directory, preferably 'C:' drive then runFor GPU-    pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpuFor CPU- pip3 install --upgrade tensorflowIf you are using Anaconda, then open Anaconda Navigator->Environments->Select 'All' from the drop down menu and then search TensorFlow. If you are using CPU, then select 'tensorflow', else for GPU select 'tensorflow-gpu'. Then click Apply.Screenshot of Anaconda Navigator-In case you are not familiar where to look.
I had the same problem that yours, happened that I had python at version 3.7. So for installing the Tensorflow with the GPU support I used:py -3.6 -m pip install tensorflow-gpuat a Virtualenv ambient. You can see the documentation behind on this website: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html I think that this solution is better than downgrade the Python version.
Actually the easiest way to install tensorflow is:install python 3.5 (not 3.6 or 3.7) you can check wich version you have by typing "python" in the cmd.When you install it check in the options that you install pip with it and you add it to variables environnement.When its done just go into the cmd and tipe "pip install tensorflow"It will download tensorflow automatically.If you want to check that it's been installed type "python" in the cmd then some that ">>>" will appear, then you write "import tensorflow" and if there's no error, you've done it!
As of November 2018, Tensorflow is not supported for Python 3.6.4+What to do:Downgrade Anaconda's Python from 3.7 or 3.6.5+ to 3.6.4a. Open Command Prompt, find your Anaconda environment, and change your directory where anaconda or where pythonExample path and cd:cd C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\binb. While in anaconda3/bin in your Command Prompt, source activate your base Anaconda environmentsource activatec. In your Command Prompt, downgrade your base Anaconda environmentconda install python=3.6.4d. Install Tensorflow pip install tensorflowFurther reading:http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/#how-do-i-get-the-latest-anaconda-with-python-3-5
Unfortunately, tensorflow can't installed correctly on python 3.7 and last version of anaconda: so, the best and effective way to do this is to downgrade your python to python 3.6.7 use the next steps:1- download the latest version of Anaconda use Anaconda prompt with administrator privilege 2- conda install python=3.6.7 (need a long time)3-conda install tensorflow4- conda install keras5- conda install numpy
