I am working on a POST request using requests library.My post requests is working fine if I am using carriage returns in my payload, such as this:But if I format it to make the payload look pretty the request is not working:I am getting 500 Error using the second payload. First payload works as expected. Any ideas? 
Most likely, you just need to create a JSON string from your structure using the function json.dumps first:And then use the data variable instead of your original payload.
