If I have a package foobar, I want it to tell pip/setuptools that it also provides package vendor. So that when I later install another third party package that depends on the vendor package, it sees that foobar is installed, and therefore won't install the vendor package. Is this possible?
There is no such ability. pip is a rather simple package manager and doesn't have features from advanced package managers like rpm/deb/etc. It has neither "This package also provides…" nor "This package obsoletes…" nor "This package is incompatible with…" Alas!The only way is to upload to PyPI a vendor package that consists of a single setup.py that lists foobar as a dependency.
