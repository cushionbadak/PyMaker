I'm trying to print a formatted layout of a list. I've got the main part down but I can't seem to get the numbering right.Here's the code:Basically I want to print the items and price in the format:{number}. {item} {price}\nSo the results should be:It should work if I add more items into the dictionaryBut I do not know what to replace n with: I've tried using lists to do thisAnd it works just fine but I need it to work for dictionary so do I find a way to index a dictionary like a list or is there a better way to do it?Thanks in advance!
You almost have it right. You can adapt your code to use dict.items()But I would recomend using str format, and joining using \n
This is one approachOutput:
Make it readable using itertools.count.
