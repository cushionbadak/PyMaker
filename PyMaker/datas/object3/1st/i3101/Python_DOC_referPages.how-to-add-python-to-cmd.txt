The Chinese words read 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file.I followed instructions on the Internet to solve this and did the followings. However, python is still not recognized. My computer runs windows 10 and my python version is 3.7. I am a complete novice in programming. Your help means a lot to me. Thank you in advance. (C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Python3.7) 
Since Python 3.3, the installer automatically installs the py launcher on your path, and since 3.6, it doesn't put python itself on your path unless you enable a checkbox in the installer.And that's fine, because you usually want to use py rather than python anyway. See Python Launcher for Windows in the help.If you really need python on your path, the recommended solution is to just re-run the installer, select Modify, and click the checkbox. If you want to do it manually, you can, but it really isn't necessary. See Finding the Python executable in the docs for details.
You probably did not add Python to PATH Look for your installed Python inside C:\Program Files folderTake note of the path of Python Adding python directory to PATHRight click on This PCThen click on PropertiesAt the pop up window, look for Environment VariablesAt the first box look for PATH, double click it and press ADD. Add both C:\Program Files\Python37 and C:\Program Files\Python37\Scripts inside. Now try again
