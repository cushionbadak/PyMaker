still returns <class 'str'> instead of int. Then, what does typing.cast do here? 
From the documentation (emphasis mine):Cast a value to a type.This returns the value unchanged. To the type checker this signals that the return value has the designated type, but at runtime we intentionally donâ€™t check anything (we want this to be as fast as possible).The "casting" only takes place in the type-checking system, not in reality.
