I came upon this code in a tutorial:Which I take to mean that if the code encounters something other than a row, just skip and continue. Is that correct? What defines 'not row'?
This allows you to skip over empty lines in a CSV file.not row just means "row is falsey".In Python, the following things are falsey:FalseNoneNumeric zeroesEmpty containers(Of course you can write your own class with a __bool__ method that does anything you want—but by convention, it should follow the same rule.)This is all explained in Boolean operations in the docs.--The rows iterated by a csv.reader are lists. (And lists are containers, so they're falsey iff they're empty.)An empty line produces an empty list; a line with text but no delimiters produces a list of one string; a line with delimiters produces a list of two or more strings.This is covered in the csv module docs… but not really all in one place.
row is just a variable name in this context. When you do if row, you actually checking if there is any content to the variable that python considers to be True.Take a look at this answer from Patrick Haugh in which he highlights lots of examples of what is Falsy in python.To illustrate in a minimal example:yieldsBut if you doThen output isand thus basically the empty row is filtered out.
