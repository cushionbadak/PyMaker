I started writing my first Discord bot, but I ran into a little problem. Why is my code not working ?On the idea this command writes to users of the server on behalf of the botError:I am quite a beginner in python programmingI tried to create a new bot, but got a new errorIts full code of bot w/o token.
The message in message.server is the message command, which doesn't have a server.  (That's what the error is telling you)  You should pass the invocation context into the command with pass_context=TrueThis takes advantage of a discord.py converter to do the name lookup for you
