This question already has an answer here:String with 'f' prefix in python-3.6                    5 answers                I was taking the fast.ai course and came across this snippet of code (in Python 3):This returns the list of the files in the directory data/dogscats/valid, like I expected. However, I don't understand what purpose the "f" in front of '{PATH}valid' serves. When removed, the code throws a "FileNotFound" error. Why is the "f" there? It's not even part of the string? I know this might be an elementary question, but it's something I'd love to understand.Thank you in advance!
It's new in Python 3.6, introduced in PEP 498, and it's called an f-string for formatted string literal. There are many ways to do similar things in Python; the oldest is the standard string interpolation using %, then the string .format() method, and now f-strings, for e.g.:It can be more than just a substitution of values however, as you can actually evaluate expressions as well:From the docs on f-strings:A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.
f-string is really an expression evaluated at runtime, not a constant value. In Python, an f-string is a literal string, prefixed with f, which contains expressions inside braces. The expressions are replaced with their values.So, f'{PATH}valid' gets evaluated to data/dogscats/valid.
