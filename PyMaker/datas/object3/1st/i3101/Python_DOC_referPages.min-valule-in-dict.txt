my function return a dict {1: 10.0, 2: 9.0, 3: 2.5}so i did try a = {1: 10.0, 2: 9.0, 3: 2.5}but gettingcan someone explain me how can I get a value that is minimal in this dict?
You are getting this -Because min expects an iterable. Look at the docsBut for i in a.keys() gives you int and you can not iterate over an int object. Pass a list like -
One of these should do it
Sure, you are trying to get the min value of an int.In fact in your code you're doing:you must insert the dictionary and not its value in the min function (which takes an iterable argument)so you can do:But in fact you pass the keys arguments.If you want the min value of the dict values, you should do:
If you want the key for the minimum value, min takes a key function which is used for the comparison. You can pass a lambda which will compare values instead of keys:Or, more tersely, and using a dictionary lookup instead (which may be slightly less efficient):
