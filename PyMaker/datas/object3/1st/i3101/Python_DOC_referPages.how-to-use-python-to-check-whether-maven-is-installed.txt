I'm writing a python script to build a project with multiple technology stack. I need to check whether all prerequisites are ready and Maven is one of the prerequisite.Normally, the Maven tutorial will ask the user to set an environment variable M2_HOME and add %M2_HOME%/bin to the path. It's easy to check the environment variable with code below,However, if the user doesn't set M2_HOME as an environment variable but adds pache-maven-x.x.x\bin to the path, it can still be thought as Maven being installed successfully and I think the latter is more comprehensive. So, here comes the question: How can I use Python to check whether Maven is installed?In my view, it's possible to launch mvn as a process from Python and check what the output is, for example by calling mvn -v. Any other suggestion? 
You can use the shutil.which commandedit:For python2.7 you can use distutils.spawn.find_executable instead:

You can use the terminal command which mvn, if the response is mvn not found then you should install it.then compare the output
