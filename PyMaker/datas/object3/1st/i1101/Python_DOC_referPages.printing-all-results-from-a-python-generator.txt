I have made a generator function which search a csv file using a keyword and I want to print the results if there is something. How can I do that without using the print(next(gen_results)) over and over again?I have tried a try-catch statement for the stopIteration, when there is no matching of keyword with a contact but I want a more concise solution.I expect the output to be a statement as 'Nothing Found',if there are no contacts with the keyword. In case there are contacts with the keyword, it outputs all the listings.
There are several methods to consume the generator - unsing next() only consumes (the next) value of it.Generate file:Use it:etc. Output (several times):The "best" one if you do not reuse the generated values is probably print(*the_generator,sep="") or the more explicit:You may also want to read here: Using yield from with conditional in python
Please try this 'the_generator' is an iterate object and 'for' loop needs an iterate object to run. The output of the program will :

You could put the 'not found' test in the generator itself:Otherwise I think the simplest is to list the generator, and check for an empty list.  By itself the generator mechanism does not count the number of yields.
