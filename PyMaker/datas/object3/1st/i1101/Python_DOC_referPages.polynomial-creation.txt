I'm having problems with an exercise in python, I have to create a function that based on a list will give me a certain polynomial equation for example if given [1,2,3] generates x^2 + 2x + 3 and if given [2,2] generates 2x + 2. My idea was to make a function that alters a lambda 1 term at a time as shown bellow but I'm not able to make it work. Any suggestions?The error I get is: NameError: global name 'x' is not defined.Changing it to changes the error to TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'function' and 'int'.
You can not extend a lambda like this. The variable you use inside the lambda only exists in it - that is why you get the first error (NameError: global name 'x' is not defined. on x**cofLen)). If you supply a global x, this still wont work, because you can not add an integer to a lambda. Instead of incrementally building a lambda, you can use a reversed list of coefficients and enumerate() them to get a solution. Enumerate gives you the index into the list which translates to the "power" of x you need. Solution composing the function and calculating one x of it: Output:How does the reverse enumeration work?which are then sum( x**idx*v for idx,v in enumerate(coeff[::-1]))-ed.Example for x==5:
