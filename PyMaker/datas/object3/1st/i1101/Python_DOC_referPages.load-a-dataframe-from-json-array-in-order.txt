You can construct a single dictionary and then feed to pd.DataFrame. To guarantee column ordering is preserved, use collections.OrderedDict:With Python 3.7+ dictionaries are insertion ordered, so you can use a regular dict:
A little hacky, but does work?(assuming )
Or merge the list of dictionaries (source) and convert the result to a dataframe:For me it's more clear and readable.
