In my project I'm using flask I get a JSON (by REST API) that has data that I should convert to a pandas Dataframe.The JSON looks like:I get the JSON and extract the data:and then I convert the data into a pandas dataframe:the result looks like this:This is not the original order of the columns. I'd like to change the order of the columns as in the dictionary.help?
Use OrderedDict for an ordered dictionaryYou should not assume dictionaries are ordered. While dictionaries are insertion ordered in Python 3.7, whether or not libraries maintain this order when reading json into a dictionary, or converting the dictionary to a Pandas dataframe, should not be assumed.The most reliable solution is to use collections.OrderedDict from the standard library:
Just add the column names parameter.
Assuming you have access to JSON sender, you can send the order in the JSON itself.likethen create DataFrame with columns specified. as said by Chiheb.K.if you cannot explicitly specify the order in the JSON. see this answer to specify object_pairs_hook in JSONDecoder to get an OrderedDict and then create the DataFrame
