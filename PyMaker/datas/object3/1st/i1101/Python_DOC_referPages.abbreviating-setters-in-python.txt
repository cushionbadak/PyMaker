I'm new in python. I have this class User, which I only need the username near the "self" in the init expression. I'm changing the first_name using the add_first_name, and the last_name using the add_last_name . It's possible to abbreviate this in order to avoid repeating? To something like this (pseudo code):In which I would call something like: add_parameter(self.first_name = "Jonh") in order to avoid repeating
I guess I will throw my hat in the ring for this since no one else has mentioned using @property. It's as easy asNow you might think that this is incredibly verbose and you're right! But there's two reasons for that. The first is that in Python it's unusual to have getters and setters (not to say that there's never a place for them). The second reason that this seems pretty verbose is because it actually does something much nicer than just creating get_first_name or set_first_name. It allows you to do:which will invoke the getters and setters for you automatically without you needing to actually write out the full function call. Is it purely syntactic sugar? Yeah sure, but since getters and setters aren't standard in Python it also helps others follow your code a bit more easily.
you can directly set attributes, without any setters, or getters.
The best way is to just directly access the attributes:You can also use the __getattribute__ and __setattr__ methods to control how the attributes are accessed:Just change "#Set attribute" and "#Get attribute" with your code to set or get the attributes.
