I'm trying to write a function that as soon as it receives a number it will inform the user if its already inside the list, like so:But I don't know how to search if its inside a a list of dictionaries, how can I do that?
We create a list of all the values of the nested dictionaries and search them.
A bit more efficient than the other answers since it will stop as soon as it finds a first match (and also supports the case where these dictionaries will have more key-value pairs):
You should use the safe dictionary method get(). Here is how you can solve this... 
You could use any:As a side-note do not use id as a variable name it shadows the built-in function id. If you want to search for a given value inside the dictionaries this will do as suggested by @DeepSpace:Output
