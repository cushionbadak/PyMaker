Lets say I have a bunch of strings, and they can only be in the following formats:Let me explain. The strings are sometimes divided using the # or $ character. However other times, they are not.I want to remove the part that appears after the # or $, if it exists. If it was just one special character, that is #, I could have done this:But how can I do it for the 2 special characters in a quick and elegant way? Also assume the following things:Only one special character can appear in the string.The special characters will not appear in any other part of the string.Thanks.
If you want to avoid regex, one possibility would be:
Regular expressions.
Use regex!
Use re.split() for it.
Use replace before split:Output
You can use a for loop to split by an arbitrary number of delimiters. Regular expression is typically less efficient than Python str methods.
I think you can use a list to maintain the special characters that can be used and for every of them check if is present in the string, when you find one execute the splitting process and retrieve only the left part like so:Now this approach has some disadvantages but is the simplest in my opinion. The problem is that if you have more than one string you need to nested loops.
