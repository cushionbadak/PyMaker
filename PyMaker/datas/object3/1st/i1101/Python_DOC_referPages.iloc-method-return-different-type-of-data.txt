I have a dataset 30 obs and 2 columns i used code below to create independent and depend dataset for a single linear regression.So each dataset is expected to be a 1 column array.But the return X is a 2d arrary and returned y is a 1d array what is the reason for that?So to put my quetion in one line:what is the difference betweenand When I use:When I use:
:-1 represents a range1, while -1 is a scalar. Ranges are 1-dimensional, while scalars are 0-dimensional. Think of a line versus a point; a range is a line while a scalar is a point. This is reflected in how Pandas translates a range vs scalar when indexing.Therefore, the following are equivalent for a dataframe with 2 columns:Using a scalar will remove the extra dimension. You can do this in a couple of ways:In fact, :-1 is syntactic sugar for a slice object: slice(0, -1). In practice, the simpler syntax is preferred unless you need to pass slice objects around.
