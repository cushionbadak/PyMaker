Use a dictionary!
You can use globals():Or use a dictionary.
You are looking for eval() operator this will result 5so you can evaluate strings with eval(). However you should not do that. Since eval is like an evil operator. They will cause security issues in your program. You should use dictionaries for your purpose.then you should call trees["A1"] this way you will be write more pythonic and more proper code.
