I have Vehicle class. I want to rename it to Rover. I know we can create another reference variable, but I don't want the name of the class to be same anymore.Played with __name__, but no success.Expected:Vehicle class renamed to Rover without file handling and within the program.
In the comments, you have a (very slightly mangled) quote from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html:This provides semantic for importing and renamingHere's the actual quote, with a bit more context:As in Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming.What this is talking about is the fact that we can have a Python library with a class in the library:Then, in some other Python module, we can write:which is mainly useful if we're also going to do:and then write code like:I personally prefer to write:but both ways are allowed, and which to use is something of a matter of taste, rather than correctness.
