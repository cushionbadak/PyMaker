As simple as this:
You could use a list comprehension:OutputThe above is equivalent to the following for loop:As an alternative you could use map:Output
Try this simple and direct way with a list comprehension.Alternatively, you can fix up the string so it becomes a "list of strings", and use literal_eval:
you can use map and split to convert.Example:output
You can also use map like this:
Given: l='2,3,4,5,6'Lazy way: output=eval('['+l+']')Lazy way with Python 3.6+ (using fStrings): output=eval(f"[{l}]")
