As a starting developer in Python I've seen this error message many times appearing in my console but I don't fully understand what does it means.Could anyone tell me, in a general way, what kind of action produces this error?
That error occurs when you try to call, with (), an object that is not callable. A callable object can be a function or a class (that implements __call__ method). According to Python Docs:object.__call__(self[, args...]): Called when the instance is “called” as a functionFor example:x is not a callable object, but you are trying to call it as if it were it. This example produces the error:For better understaing of what is a callable object read this answer in another SO post.
The action occurs when you attempt to call an object which is not a function, as with (). For instance, this will produce the error:Class instances can also be called if they define a method __call__One common mistake that causes this error is trying to look up a list or dictionary element, but using parentheses instead of square brackets, i.e. (0) instead of [0]
The other answers detail the reason for the error. A possible cause (to check) may be your class has a variable and method with the same name, which you then call. Python accesses the variable as a callable - with ().e.g. Class A defines self.a and self.a():
The exception is raised when you try to call not callable object. Callable objects are (functions, methods, objects with __call__)
