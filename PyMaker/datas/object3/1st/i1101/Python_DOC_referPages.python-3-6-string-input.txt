I'm using the Raspberry Pi 3 and controlling three LEDs with Python.I could say I'm good with Python. Here's my code:I have a function called led() that takes two arguments, color (g, y or r) and state (on or off). In the while loop, leds_col asks for the color in the console and leds_stat for the status.Now what I'm trying to achieve is rather than asking for the colour in a different line and the status of the led in another line, is to combine them two. So for example I'd write on the console:And it would turn on the green LED.I know i can just use an if statement like:if led_input == "g, on":  GPIO.output(27,GPIO.HIGH)But I'm sure there's a better way to do this.
Use string.split():If invalid input is given, this will continue to ask until inputs are valid.See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response for more ideas on input validation.Unrelated - but you can optimize your led-function:by using a lookup dictionary: see dict()
This approach might help. By taking two inputs with a space in between. You can split the input based on a space or any other character. It will then place the color and state into two different variables.Alternatively, you can also use comma or any other character as a separator between the color and state.
str.split() will be able to split your single line input into two (or more) variables:
