Natural Text
for e.g : string = 'AbcDEfGhIJK'I want to fetch a list with :['A','bc','DE','f','G','h','IJK']I am trying to think of a logic for doing this, but so far no luck.EDIT : I don't know regex, so I just used loopsThis is what I came up with, It doesn't give the last 'IJK' though 
You could do that using itertools.groupby:Here, groupby will group the characters that give the same output for islower()
You could use a regex:OutputThe idea is to split the string on lower case letters '([a-z]+)', but keeping the splitting pattern.
