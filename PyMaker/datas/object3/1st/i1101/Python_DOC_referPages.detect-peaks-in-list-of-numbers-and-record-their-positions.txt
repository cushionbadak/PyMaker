I am trying to create some code that returns the positions and the values of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.For example, the list arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0] has a peak at position 3 with a value of 5 (since arr[3] equals 5).The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks (in the context of a mathematical function, you don't know what is after and before and therefore, you don't know if it is a peak or not).My issue is with plateaus. [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] has a peak while [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] does not. When a plateau is a peak, the first position of the plateau is recorded.Any help is appreciated.
I suggest you use groupby to group contiguous equal values, then for each group store the first position, example for [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] it creates the following list following list of tuples [(1, 0), (2, 1), (1, 4)], putting all together:Output
You can use the same algorithm with the plateaus as well if you can preprocess the data to remove the repeating numbers and keep only 1 unique number. Thus, you can convert the example [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] to [1, 2, 1] and apply the same algorithm.Edit:The Code:Output:
Here is a fairly simple generator function. Just loop and maintain the necessary state: i (last index of of "growth"), up (true if last value change was "growth")
A shorter script could be: Output:
