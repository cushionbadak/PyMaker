I am having some problem with permutations! I am a really big noob when it comes to python so any help would be appreciated!Lets say I have a list that ranges from 1-6 in a text file, so e.git looks like (1,2,3,4,5,6) I want to open said .txt file and calculate all possible combinations of N of those 6 numbers up to N=4.when i use itertools permutations it outputs the numbers like this, which i don't really want, since i can only get all combinations of one number of numbers at a time - But I want all possible combinations of N numbers with N ranging from 1 to 4, including repeats such as: So I want it to have repeats, have combinations with a different number of members, however not go past 4 combinations of the number. I am really struggling with this concept! If anything doesn't make sense don't hesitate to ask me :)
will yield:
