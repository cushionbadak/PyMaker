Given a list of n (un-ordered and possibly repeated) elements, I want to count the number of elements, i, such that their successor, i+1, is also in the list. This is a problem a friend gave me that I can't find an optimal solution for large n (100,000) with element values up to 1,000,000,000. Below is my current approach with a randomly generated list, that take a long time to work.
Use a set:OutputThe lookup time in a set is O(1) versus a list that is O(n). The approach using a set is O(n), your current implementation is O(n^2).
