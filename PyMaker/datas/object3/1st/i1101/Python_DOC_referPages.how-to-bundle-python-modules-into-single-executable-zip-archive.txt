Its been quite a while since I wrote any serious python code so I'm sure I'm just missing something stupid...I've written several modules and would like to bundle them into a single executable zip archive. I seem to remember this being a relatively trivial process and thought I had it working but after a few additions, renaming directories/files, etc. I'm unable to make heads or tails of the steady tide of errors.While researching the question, I came across a number of hits for packaging with the preverbal Cheeseshop (pip), py2exe, py2app, etc. However, I have no intention of redistributing my code online and don't necessarily need to bundle the entire python environment. What is the easiest and simplest method for bundling my modules into a single cross platform (mostly unix/linux/mac environment) executable?Example Structure:Contents of __main__.py :I attempted to create a zip archive of the ProjectRoot but when executing the archive I get the following:What am I doing wrong?
Try using the zipapp module:â†³ https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html
