I need to obtain the output shown below from FASTA file, but wihtout using BioPython. Anyone have an idea?This is the code using BioPython:The FASTA file looks like this:I need to obtain the following output:I've tried that, but I can't obtain the same output.
These code will work:
This seems to work. It uses the regular expression re module to recognize header lines and get the total length of the following nucleotide sequence. This value is used to determine the number of following lines of data to read and concatenate together.Because it actually parses info in the sequence headers, it should be able to handle sequences of any length.I don't know what the official total number of bases there can be per line, but it appears to be 60 in the sample fasta file, so that has been hard-coded into the code.Here's a variation that uses a collections.Counter to count the number of all the bases at once. This might be faster that using the sequence count method separately for each oneâ€”and therefore useful if you have a large number to process.
