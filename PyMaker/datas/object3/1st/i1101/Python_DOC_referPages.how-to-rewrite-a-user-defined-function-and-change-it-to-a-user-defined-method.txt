I have a user defined function in the code below. Is there a way for me to re-write it with different syntax where I don't use brackets around the variable I want but rather have the function as a method such as .printfunction. Is there a way using classes and methods to rewrite the function as a method rather than a user-defined function?The desired output needs to be xY . 
I'm not sure what version of python you are running on but this one works for me.
Thanks to the advice from @grayson and @Patrick Artner. I am able to answer my question
