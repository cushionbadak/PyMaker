For some reason, on a Sunday morning I felt like I needed the following for a scientific library I'm writing:Basically instead of passing arguments like polarity='POSITIVE' and checking strings, and also because I'm using type hints, I wanted it to be strongly typed and I wrote the above code.Does it make sense, is there a much easier/cleaner/better way to achieve the same result?
Your solution works, but is there a special reason not to use an enum?
