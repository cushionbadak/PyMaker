For the last part #print(new_path), the output is "None". Can one explain me in detail the reason for the occurrence of this error. Thank you in Advance.
os.chdir operates by side-effect and always returns None. If you want the current working dir after a chdir you must ask for it.
That is because os.chdir() does not return any value. Below is the fix.
os.chdir() returns None in all cases.  If you want to know which directory your program is currently in, you must call os.getcwd(). Additionally, if you want to make sure your program switches back to the original working directory safely, you could use a contextlib.contextmanager:Which will show the following behaviour:Explanation of context manager:Which switches to the directory in the try block, does something with the changed directory(in this case just print it), then switch back to the current working directory in the finally block when the context manager exits. The FileNotFoundError exception is also raised in the except block if the directory doesn't exist, and yields None from the generator.
