I am teaching myself python and I am trying to implement the regular expression to obtain a timestamp from an application log file ( I normally use grep, cut and awk for this )My logfiles contain many lines started with date and time nextI normally use a simple grep command grep "14\:03\:16" mytextand this expression works "14:03:16", so after researching I came up with this regex:Where res is one of the lines aboveThis does not find anything whereasCaptures the date.Why the character : is not found? I have tried to use \: as well and it also does not work. Thanks in advance.
re.match tries to match the regex from the beginning of the string.From the docs:If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the  regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object.  Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this  is different from a zero-length match.When you didthe regex actually matched the date, not the time (because it is at the beginning of the string):If you use re.search then you will get the expected output:
