I'm new to python and threading. I was wondering if there is a way to check the number of worker threads. For example, if I have 10 worker threads, I would like to wait for all ten threads to finish before moving on. My current program is reading a file line by line; therefore, I don't want to continue without processing each line. My Code:
sounds like a job for a multiprocessing Pool, for example:will cause myfn to be executed on each line and arrange for the results to come back nicelyâ€¦there are various gotchas around this, but it's often easier than doing it yourself!
If you do not keep track of the threads currently running, you can do this which is not very efficient, but should get the job done.
