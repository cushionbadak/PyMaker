I am trying to test the function map with the method append and got a wrong output.CodeExpected outputActual output
Built-in map works on each value in an iterable. So your function should include logic which can be applied to each sublist:Alternatively, you can use statistics.mean from the standard library:
map returns one output object for each object in the input sequence. Your input sequence has 4 objects, so the output has 4 objects. They're all same since your function always returns same numbers_tmp object. To fix the problem stop using global variables in map.
