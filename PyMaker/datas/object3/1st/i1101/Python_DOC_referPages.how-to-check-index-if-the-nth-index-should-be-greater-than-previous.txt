I want to run a loop from 0 to 1000 i want to print numbers which is lower than previous digit "ex:123 3 is greater than 2 and 2 is greater than 1 so print 123" i tried from 1 to 100 and how to check for 1000 or greater numbersi tried to convert int input to list and checking with 2 digitsFrom 1 to 100 no problem i want to check three digits to like 1<2<3 if correct print i my code only check last two digit how do i check for three and four digits 
Printing all numbers that are lower then the one after:You can simply remember one digit and print it if the next one is bigger:Output for 12354:This prints all numbers that are lower then the next one.Checking if numbers are "in ascending order":To zimply check you can use zip(). Characters '0123456789' compare in this order: '0'<'1'<'2'<'3'<'4'<'5'<'6'<'7'<'8'<'9' - no need to convert it to an integer, simply compare the characters "as is":How does this work?It makes tuples from the number and number shifted by 1:and ensures all first elements are smaller then the second element using all()Example:Output (reformatted): There is no need to compare via sorting which takes more computation.Test all numbers from 1 to 1000: You can create a list of all "increasing" numbers from 1 to 1000 using the IsIncreasing() function:Output:
You could create a function that verifies if the digits of the number are sorted:OutputNote that sorted(s, key=int) sorts s (the string of digits) according to int value of each of the digits, by using the key parameter of sorted. This function works independent of the number of digits.In case it must be greater than strict you could do:Output
