I am designing a deck class that has init() method with initially has an empty list. Then I append my cards to the list. I am trying to create an x instance and access the shuffled version of the deck of cards. I know there are many solutions posted already. I just want to understand with my logic I am able to print the address of the card elements and not the deck itself. While trying to debug ,I am not understanding whether print(x.cards_in_deck) is printing the location or the x.shuffle... .Any good reference for Pycharm debugging will also be highly appreciated.
The first print statement will print the value of the instance variable "cards_in_deck" on your Deck object. The type of variable is a list, so when it's printed, it'll look like:The second print statement will call the shuffle_cards method on the Deck object, and print whatever that method returns. That method returns the result of calling random.shuffle on the list. That result is a new list, that would be the shuffled cards.Now, each of these print statements is printing a list object, which is what the text above looks like. If you wanted to print each individual card, you would need to loop through the cards, similarly to how you loop through your lists when initializing the deck. So, you could do something like:This would print each card's name on a new line each.EDIT: I did not see you were using __str__ and not __repr__ in your Card class. When printing a list, Python uses the __repr__ method to determine what to put in the spot in the list. See: Confused about __str__ on list in Python
If you print a list, any item in the list is printed using it's repr(). You can define what is used by specifying the __repr(self)__ method of your class - you may also want to define the __str__(self) method of your class. If you do not specify a "special" repr and str python will create default ones for you which may not print what You want it to.See: Difference between __str__ and __repr__?Both should return a string - what you are not doing, you return a list for your Deck class which violates the contract of these method's:Doku:__str__(self)__repr__(self) Both descriptions say:The return value must be a string object.  and give some more informations on them.Fix:Output:Debugging:  https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDebuggingTools    (or use an IDE with buildin supoprt for debugging ....)https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html
