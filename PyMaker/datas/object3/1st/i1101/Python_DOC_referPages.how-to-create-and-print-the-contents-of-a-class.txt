I am creating a class structure in python for a city, that stores the name, country, population and language for a city, all of which are input by the user. The information shall then be printed.I think that I may be successful in storing the information within the class structure (although this may be wrong as well), but I am unsuccessful in printing the information. Currently, I am receiving the error that int object is not subscriptable.The contents of the class should all be displayed at the end of the program, but at the minute my program crashes due to the error - int object is not subscriptable.
you can always implement the method : __str__(self) of an object , and then when you just print it with : your __str__(self) will be called and you can return from it whatever you want to print.for example: and this what will get print, i think it is more efficient and well coded to work like that and not creating a function that print each class attribute separately. 
The cause of your error is quite simple and obvious: you defined the function as displayUserArray(UserArray, num) but call it with displayUserArray(numOfUsers, userArray) - IOW you pass the arguments in the wrong order.This being said, almost all your code is wrong, you obviously don't get the difference between a class and instance and how to use a class to create instances. I strongly suggest you read at least the official tutorial, and check a couple other tutorial and/or example code on the topic of classes and instances.
