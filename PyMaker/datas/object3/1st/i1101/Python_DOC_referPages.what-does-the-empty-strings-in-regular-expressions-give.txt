I have this following line of code for which I'm not quite sure the output would be. I have found out that sys.path has the first index as an empty string. I think this means add path1/path2 to the sys.path but not sure why do I need ' ' for? I'm using python 2.7. Thanks!
re.findall(pattern, string) finds all the occurrences of pattern in string.The string is in this case built by using .join() and result in one big string with all list entries from sys.path joined by a space.You need this space because otherwise all paths in sys.path would be joined together into one big path string...
the ' '.join(sys.path) part joins the paths into one string delimited by ' ' then the .* parts in your regular expression in findall() matches this whitespace delimiter as well. so you can do this instead:in case your paths also have whitespaces (this is better):
Should actually rather than concatenating the pathnames and then matching should match on each pathname seperately:If you want strings and the locations of the matches in each string that has a match one could useBoth of these are safer as they don't assume an in-band delimiter.
