The + operator can work in multiple contexts. In this case, the relevant use cases are: When concatenating stuff (strings, for example);When you want to add numbers (int, float and so on). So when you use the + in a concept that uses both strings and int variables (x, y and z), Python won't handle your intention correctly. In your case, in which you want to concatenate numbers in the sentence as if they were words, you'd have to convert your numbers from int format to string format. Here, see below:
The problem is when you print the output (print("The sum of " +x+ " and " +y+ " gives " +z )), you are adding strings to integers (x, y, and z).Try replace it with
