I want to save my default gateway in a variable for future using, like printing it, or send a ping to it....I want the code will work on Windows and Linux, so I worte this code:But the dgw variable is not saving my default gateway...python 2.7
It is because os.system does not return the stdout.you should use a sub process.
Firstly, os.name for Windows is 'nt', and Linux it is 'posix'.This is also highlighted in the documentation:The name of the operating system dependent module imported. The following names have currently been registered: 'posix', 'nt', 'java'.If you want to target more specific platforms, using sys.platform is the better option. Secondly, using the netifaces module works well for Windows and Linux:Which you can can install with pip install netifaces. The benefit of this approach is that you don't need to differentiate approaches between Windows and Linux.
