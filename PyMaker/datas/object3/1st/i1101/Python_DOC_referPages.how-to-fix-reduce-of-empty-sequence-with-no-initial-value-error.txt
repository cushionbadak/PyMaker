When I am trying to find factorial using below code, it is working for all numbers except '0'. When I give the input as 0, below error is displayed. Can some one help me to understand and fix the errorExpected result: When input is given as '0' 1 should be displayed as outputActual result: Below error is displayed
In Python 3, at least, reduce() has an "initializer" parameter, which "is placed before the items of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the sequence is empty" (documentation). So use an initializer of 1. You can also simplify your code by using the multiplication operator in the operator module.You should understand your error now. The error message says that you tried to use reduce() on an empty sequence with no initial value. Putting in the initial value of 1 solves that.
