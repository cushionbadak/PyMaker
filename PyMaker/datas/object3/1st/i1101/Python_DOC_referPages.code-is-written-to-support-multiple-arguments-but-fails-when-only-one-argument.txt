My current code uses a variable "word", so word = sys.argv[1] + sys.argv[2], which works great when I have two arguments, but when I only have one argument then i get IndexError: list index out of rangeI am writing a program that Defines words by pulling the info from dictionary .com. I am following very closely a video tutorial because I am just trying to learn how to get a basic dictionary to work, (long term goal being write a translation app that is independent of google translate api or anything like that). I have a code that works in that it pulls the definition when you type in the word, but not when you type in 2 words, examples will be below. SO I added an argument, which worked for 2 words but no longer works for one word.Expected results:Print word, part of speech, and definition.I.e Define the word (being a single argument) "Proper"Also Define "Self Control" (two word argument)
This is a good use-case for slicing. You want everything after the first argument in the list, so as a slice this translates to [1:]. So just use:For example:
Slicing:You can use list slicing to avoid the error:or List slicing works even if the slice index is larger then the amount of elements in the list.Testing:The other way to handle it would be to test first then append:Error handling:Try it and handle the error if it happens (see Ask forgiveness not permission below)Readup:Understanding Python's slice notationlen() check"Ask forgiveness not permission" - explaintry: except:
