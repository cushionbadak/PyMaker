I have a selenium bot doing actions on a social network. I would like it to stop after he does a certain number of actions (10 is for the example). I initialize variables this way:This is the part performing and counting actions:And this is the loop I've tried to make into main:However the bot never stops, even when counter_var reaches 10.Do you know how to correct it?
Currently it's impossible to give a concrete answer to your question, due to the lack of code given, but it looks like the problem is because the action() method doesn't check self.counter_var while the for loop within it is executing.Something like the follow might work. Adding yield to the action() method turns it into a generator function, which makes it iterable. When that is done it will effectively "pause" at that point each iteration of its for loop, and would allow the caller to inspect the current value of self.counter_var (or anything else it wanted to do each iteration).Here's what I'm suggesting with a few explanatory comments:
