Problem StatementGiven a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.ExampleGiven [1, 2, 3] and k = 5, return True since 2 + 3 = 5.This is what I've tried to do:I'm getting an error when I run it, and I can't understand why.
Output
You could also do itertools.combinations, little shorter than @bitto's solution:
You misses an n inside len(). The error TypeError: len() takes exactly one argument (0 given) tells you exactly what is wrong (if you fix the indentation problems of your code postet above).You can streamline your code by using itertools.combinations. If you add some parameters to a function, you can generalize the problem searching as well - to get all combinations of n numbers from your list that add up to your targetvalue.Get all of them:Output:Doku:itertools.combinationsany()unrolling (complex) list comprehensions
The logic of your code is correct (It's unnecessarily complex as you can see by comparing with the above answer, but still correct ;)....)Just check your indentations and put for j in range(i+1, len(n)) in the 3rd line of your code...you forgot the 'n'!! You need to give atleast one argument to len.
You can solve your solution this wayThis is solution but need to be customize as you want
