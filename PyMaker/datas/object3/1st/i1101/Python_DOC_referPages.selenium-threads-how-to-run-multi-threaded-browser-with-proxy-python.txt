I'm writing a script to access a website using proxies with multiple threads but now I'm stuck in multiple threads, when I run the script below, it opens 5 browsers but all 5 use 1 proxy, I want 5 browsers to use different proxies, can someone help me complete it? thank you  Here is my script :(Wish everyone has a happy and lucky new year)
Dominik La≈°o captured it correctly - each threads processes the file from the beginning. Here's probably how it should look like:
( I personaly think that a problem is there that when you start a program, it will go to new thread, which will go throught the textfile from beginning, becasue you aint deleting them )I have cane across the same problem, when I was doing the same thing as you do now. I know you would rather want help with your code, but I am in hurry to test it and want to help you ;) , so here is a code that works for me ... There is even task killer for a chrome ( you just have to edit it to firefox )If I were you, I would start the thread after opening the file, cuz it looks liek you are opening the same file from 1st line everytime the tread startsHope it helps :)
