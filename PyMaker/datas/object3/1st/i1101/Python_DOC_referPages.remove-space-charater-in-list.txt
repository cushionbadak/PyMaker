How do I go about removing the space (' ') in this list? As far as I know, pop / remove method works with slices but the space character changes position depending on the input. 
A conditional comprehension will do:If you have to mutate the existing list object and not just rebind the variable, use slice assignmentIn case you want to remove any string that consists solely of whitespace characters, you can utilize str.strip()Note that rebuilding the list from scratch is often better performance-wise than repeatedly calling del, pop or remove as each of those calls has linear complexity since all the elements after the deletion index need to be shifted in the underlying array.
you can do by using del function that delete the element from the list.Code :Output :
Below is the functional approach to achieve what you want:                   More pythonic list-comprehension approach:                       
Just to remember of itertools:
