I'm working on a project in which a continuous stream of data is coming on the serial port through Arduino in which I have to extract my required information.I have include "AA" in the beginning of my required data and "55" at the ending.Arduino Serial Monitor output - Arduino code-PYTHON CODEI want the python code to extract my information by detecting the "AA" at the beginning and "55" at the end.
Assuming you need to extract the information from the serial output, which starts with "AA" and ends with "55", you can make some modifications to your python code like this:Suppose the serial output is like:This piece of code will only print the outputs which start with "AA" and end with "55". That is the first two cases.We are checking whether the length is greater than 4 because the information will be contained within "AA" and "55".Important thing to note here is the string slicing operator. You can read it up here. It basically returns a  part of the string, within some indices.
