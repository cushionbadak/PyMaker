Is it possible to extend the approach discussed here to nested defaultdict? EDIT:As per comment, the default is updated from the original None to lambda: None. However, the following still doesn't work as intended: dd["b"]["e"] raises a KeyError instead returning None. How to convert all nested dict's to defaultdict?
You could do:Output
collections.defaultdict isn't the ideal tool for this purpose. To specify None as a default value for a nested dictionary, you can just iterate your dictionary recursively and use dict.get to return None when any key at any level is not found:
No errors again. No matter how many levels  nested.pop  no error alsoyou can change to any value if you want.
