Here is the string ds = 'Java; Python; Ruby; SQL'I have used slip function to split each language and found the count of one language.if I want to find if any of 2 languages occur in a string it's returning zero.example: in the above variable as both java and python are present it has to return count as one.
You could so something like this, instead use a dictionary to store the counts of each language:OutputA more pythonic approach will be to use collections.Counter:OutputOnce you have a mapping-like object with the counts of each language, iterate over the key, value pairs and output those with count above 1, for example:OutputNote that the input string in the above example was slightly modified to include Python twice.
The problem is that you should be splitting by "; ", so you should have:A simpler approach would be:
