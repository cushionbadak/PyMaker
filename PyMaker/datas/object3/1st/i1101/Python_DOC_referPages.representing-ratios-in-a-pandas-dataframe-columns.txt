I am trying to represent ratios in dataframe column. However, the formatting I am getting is totally horrendous when I am just able to use  a print function and print what I want. The true problem is representing it in a correct format.what I have done is create the Greatest common divisor, apply it to my dataframe now I want to what I want is a ratio column that looks like this:The main problem for me is representing something with the colons. 
It's not clear how you derive 3:2 and 4:5. But note you can use NumPy (via np.gcd) for calculating the greatest common divisor, since these operations will be vectorised. Alternatively, you can use the fractions module with a list comprehension for conversion to strings.Let's assume we start with this dataframe.np.gcd: vectorised calculationThis solution is partially vectorised. The calculation itself is performed column-wise. String construction, either via concatenation or via f-strings and a list comprehension, uses Python-level loops.Fraction + str.replace + list comprehensionSolely with row-wise operations, you can use a single list comprehension:The result is the same in either case:
