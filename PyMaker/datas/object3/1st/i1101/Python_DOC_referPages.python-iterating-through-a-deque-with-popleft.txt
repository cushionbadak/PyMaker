This question already has an answer here:How to check if a deque is empty in Python?                    1 answer                I've been looking for the best way to iterate through a deque while using popleft to use the first element and reduce the queue for each iteration. I essentially want to popleft the first in the deque, run some code using this value and then do the same process until there are no more values left in the deque.The best I've found online is using a try and catch block to capture an IndexError:Surely throwing an exception isn't the best way to do this. I'd be catching any IndexError occurring in the while loop as well, which isn't ideal. Using a for loop doesn't work as I'd be modifying the deque during the iteration.What's the best way to do this?
You can either use while mydeque:... as @slightlynybbled suggested orwhile 0 < len(mydeque):... what is basically the same.
You can put the try/except within the while loop; that way you can make sure it only catches the IndexError thrown by  poplefthttps://pymotw.com/2/collections/deque.html
When mydeque is empty, it resolves as False in the while loop.Additionally not sure where the popleft is coming from.  I have used pop(0) for this same purpose.This will run through all values in mydeque.
