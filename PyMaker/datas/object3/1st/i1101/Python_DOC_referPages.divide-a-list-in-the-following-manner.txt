This question already has an answer here:Iterate over all pairs of consecutive items in a list                    6 answers                I have this list I want to make another list of tuples like  this: Is there a built-in function that i can use? 
You can use zip and list comprehension. listt[1:] starts from the second element. This is done because in your first pair, you have the 1st and the 2nd element. zip creates pairs and then you iterate over them and use () to store them as tuples.A piece of advice: Do not use builtin names as variables. list in your case.Benchmarking performanceBased on @prashant rana's comment, I compared the performance of zip with his approach taking a list 1 million times longer than the original list. Below are the results: zip turns out to be faster
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)]
There's no builtin function, but python makes it very easy to make your own. Here you go:
