Assume that I have a matrix:And I want to getb = [0,1] because the inner lists of a at position 0 and 1 contain values that are smaller then 3. c = [[2],[0,1]] because the [2] nd element of the first sublist in b is below 3 and [0,1] because the first and second element in the second sublist in b is below 3. I tried :It only returns the original matrix.How do I get b&c in python?
You can leverate enumerate(iterable[,startingvalue]) which gives you the index and the value of the thing you iterate over:Output:Doku:enumerate()any()
