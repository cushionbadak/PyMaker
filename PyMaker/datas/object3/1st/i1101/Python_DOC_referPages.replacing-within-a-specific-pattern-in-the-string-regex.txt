I wish to replace character '/' when occurred in a certain pattern (preceded and followed by a character) with "".Example"a/b b/c" should be replaced to  "ab bc""a/b python/Java" should be replaced to  "ab python/Java"While, I know how to substitute using regex re.sub("/","","a/b python"), the problem is, that substitution needs to be done only in specific parts of the string.Any help here will be appreciated.Thanks
This simplifies and expands on Code Maniac's comment:You can replace a found pattern using re.subAs pattern r"(\b\w)\/(\w\b)" you define a word boundary + 1 word character followed by \ followed by 1 more word character followed by a word boundary. You capture it as 1. and 2. group - the \ is not captured.You replace each match by the captured groups before/after /.Output:Test: https://regex101.com/r/WI0Wg3/1
What you might do is to first match the pattern with a 1+ characters, /, 1+ characters between double quotes. Then because the pattern matches, you could split the string and check if then item has a string length of 3.If it does, use map and replace the / with an empty string and reconstruct the string.Match the full pattern:Regex demo | Python demoFor example:Result
