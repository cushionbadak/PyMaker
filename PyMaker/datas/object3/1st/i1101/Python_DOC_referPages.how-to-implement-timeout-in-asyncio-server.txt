Below is a simple echo server. But if the client does not send anything for 10 seconds, I want to close the connection. If the client sends a message, it works fine. But the other case, when client is silent, it does not workWhen client sends message:When client is silent after opening connectionThere is no task complete, timer cancelled, writer closed. What is the issue with above code? Is there a better way to implement timeouts?UpdateFigured out the problem, Looks like the task was actually cancelled, but the exception got silently ignored, Fixed the problem by catching CancelledErrorSecond part still remains. Is there a better way to implement timeouts?Update2Complete code using wait_for. The timeout code is no longer needed. Check accepted solution below:
Is there a better way to implement timeouts?You can use asyncio.wait_for instead of timeout. It has similar semantics, but already comes with asyncio. Also, you can await the future it returns to detect if the timeout has occurred.
I use the following code when making a connection. I'd suggest using wait_for similarly for your code.
