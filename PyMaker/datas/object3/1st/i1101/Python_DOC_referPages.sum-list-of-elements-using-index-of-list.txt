This question already has an answer here:Sum of float - 'float' object is not iterable                    6 answers                I am trying to find the sum of the kitchen(18.0) and bedroom area (10.75)but when I try to run the code it says this :      TypeError: 'float' object is not iterableAlso I observed that when I used other functions like min,max it works just fine can anyone explain me the reason for this?
You need to use a dictionary, not a list, for this kind of thing:Then you can sum them like so:Dictionaries allow lookup by key. Check the docs for more.
In Python sum(iterable[, start]) requires iterable as first argument. Consider just wrapping your arguments in a list like:
Is better if you use a dictionary:Output
The sum() function adds start and items of the given iterable from left to right.sum() Parametersiterable - iterable (list, tuple, dict etc) whose item's sum is to be found. Normally, items of the iterable should be numbers.start (optional) - this value is added to the sum of items of the iterable. The default value of start is 0 (if omitted)float is  not iterable
Can replace sum with add operatoror with sum
