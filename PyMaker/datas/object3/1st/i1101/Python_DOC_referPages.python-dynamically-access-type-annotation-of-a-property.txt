Given the following class:How can I dynamically access the type annotation of test_prop either from the class or an instance?The following does not work:
You need to get the property object itself, without doing the dynamic lookup.  The inspect module has a function, inspect.getattr_static for that. Then we can use signature to get the signature of the fget attribute of that object. That's where property objects store the function they use to do the dynamic lookup.  The other two functions of a property are stored in the attributes fset and fdel
