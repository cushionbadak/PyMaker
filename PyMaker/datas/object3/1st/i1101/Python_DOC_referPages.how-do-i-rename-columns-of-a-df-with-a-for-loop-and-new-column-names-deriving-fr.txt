I made a dataframe from a bigger dataframe with a for loop and and the group by function. The multiindexed dataframe has the name 'Area' for all columns and the second level for all columns is called 'mean'. I am indexing the columns by iloc and wanted to give them names based on a different dataframe. Could you help me out? If you have a completely different approach I am thankful too, of course.I get the following error message:'TypeError: zip argument #2 must support iteration'
You can't iterate over an integer, but you can iterate over a range object, e.g. range(len(index_df.index)). But, in any case, = in Pandas is used for assignment, not for renaming, unless you combine it with pd.DataFrame.pop.If each column of num relates to a value in index_df['amount'], and the relation is aligned by integer position, you can simply use assignment:And that's it, no manual iteration involved.
