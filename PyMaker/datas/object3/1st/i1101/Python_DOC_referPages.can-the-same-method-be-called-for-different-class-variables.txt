I'm trying to call the same method for a different variable as shown in the code.In the example, I'm trying to get the double of a value by sending the name of the variable.I've tried different approaches and none seems to work:I expect the output to be 6 and 18
You can't do it like this. When you call l.teste(a), the name a refers to nothing, you'll get an error.Even the a and b you used as parameters in __init__ stop existing as soon as __init__ exits, and can only be accessed from inside __init__.What exists, though, is self.num and self.float. You can access them dynamically using getattr, like this (note that we pass the name of the attribute as a string to getattr):
There are several problems in the codeit's class, not Classas defined num and float are instance variables, not class variableslast three lines are not part of the class definition, so they need to be unindentedfloat is poor choice for property name (i.e. it imply that type is float, yet this is not enforced)val is not property of the class, but argument to teste() method. Thus you don't need self. when reference it.Although I am not sure what the purpose is, you can achieve  what you want withNote the difference between teste() and testb()
