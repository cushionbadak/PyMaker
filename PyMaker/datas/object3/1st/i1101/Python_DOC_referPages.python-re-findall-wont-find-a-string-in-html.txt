re.findall won't find a string in html. Here is my code:When I print(html_source) I get the html, which by sight contains "preview.aspx?id=1692003076". re.search also failed to find the string. I have another re.findall in my code, and it works fine:Any idea why it doesn't work?
Note that the "?" is a special character in regular expressions. You need to escape it.
Try escaping your special characters in your regex: ., ?. Or, use html_source.find("preview.aspx?id=1692003076") to find the first instance of that specific string.If that doesn't work, post a sample of the HTML in your question so we can reproduce this problem.
