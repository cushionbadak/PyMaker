I am trying to process a .wav file with the Azure Cognitive Speech Service. I am using the script below. I get an exception that says "type object 'AudioConfig' has no attribute 'FromWavFileInput'" when I try to setup the wav file by calling AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput(). The documentation says the function exists, at least in the .net library. Does FromWaveFileInput exist for the cognitiveservices-speech python library? How can I process an audio file with python?
Indeed as you said. I searched for the keywords AudioConfig & FromWavFileInput on GitHub repo Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk, there is not any Python codes about it except for Java, C#, and C++.So per my experience, there are two workaround ways to do it.Wrap the C++ codes as a Python extension module, or communicate with C++/Java codes.Directly using Speech service REST APIs with requests, it's simple for Python and Azure Speech Service.
