The intent is to show the result of several observations withoutunnecessary digits i.e., to display a value with thenumber of significant digits that is consistent with a givenuncertainty.For example, if computed mean=123.45 and err=0.0012345 then theexpected output may look like 123450 ± 1.2 (× 10-3) wherethe following rules are used:the error always has one or two significant digits. Two if the firstdigit is 1 (ignoring the leading zeros)the mean value is rounded to drop uncertain digits except for thelast one ("stop the mean at the same decade as that of the first significant (non-zero) digit in the SEM"). Trailing zeros are added to display the precision corresponding to the error if necessary.How it might be used in Python:The question is how to implement the round_to_uncertainty(value,uncertainty) function expressing the rules 1 and 2 above.Note: the terms error, uncertainty are used loosely in thequestion. See the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). Here's a related question for R.
decimal module could be used to manipulate the decimal representation of the numbers conveniently:Example:The input 123.45, 0.0012345 is reported as 123450 ± 1.2  (×10-3).  And 8165.666, 338.9741  translates to 82 ± 3 (×102) according to the rules from the current question.
