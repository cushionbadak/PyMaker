I'm trying to rename the files in a directory that have the substring "Episode.26" by truncating the words before and after the substring e.g. 'The.Vision.of.Escaflowne.Episode.26.Eternal.Love.1080p.Dual.Audio.Bluray [BC6DDF99].mkv'The value to be found will always be Episode.## (## two digits)Desired result: Episode.26.mkvCurrent result: Episode.26.Eternal.Love.1080p.Dual.Audio.Bluray [BC6DDF99].mkv'I removed the first n characters using python; but, I don't know how to isolate 'Episode.26' efficiently
If your filename is always separated by periods then split() might be sufficient:This should split the name after your needle ("ndl") grab the episode number and rename the file; it should also handle filenames that include spaces in addition to periods or if "Episode.26" is at the end of the string (eg. Some.Movie.Episode.26 [BC6DDF99].mkv).Result:
If u'r sure there's two digits after "Episode.", then u can code like this. Otherwise, i'm afraid u should use re or split to get what u want.
You could use regular expressions, capture the episode number and file extension and create the new name using such data:CodeThis way is more cleaner and flexible. REs are very powerfull. Let me know if this worked for you.
in your code, you can use search instead of match and remove .* at the beginning of re
