Natural Text
I was wondering how I can have a changing variable from a function.I attempted:before realising that I needed to run the MyText variable again which I'm not sure how to do.I intend to call this text by running something along the lines of print(Text.MyText) which doesn't update after running Text.AddMoreText()I then tried:What I didn't know was that the return function preserves its value so when I ran print(Text.MyText) Text.AddMoreText()print(Text.MyText) it displayed the same text twice.
I think you want something like:This makes .my_text a dynamic property that will be re-computed each time .my_text is retreived.
