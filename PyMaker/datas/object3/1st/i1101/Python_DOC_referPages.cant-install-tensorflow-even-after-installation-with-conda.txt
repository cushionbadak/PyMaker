Hello Stackoverflow people. Merry Christmas!I'm having trouble with installing tensorflow.I'm using window 10 and I installed tensorflow with this code. After finishing all installation, I checked if it's installed successfully at the anaconda promptIt printed out "Hello, tensorflow" very well. But after that when I tried to import tensorflow or keras on my jupytor notebook or spyder, it threw error.The version of python is 3.7 so I tried to downgrade it.But still, it doesn't work. What should I do? I just guess downgrading didn't work well, cause I still can see 'Spyder(Python=3.7)' at the right top of the spyder window. Please Help!
I think you just use another version of Python so you can use this command to get the path of tensorflow, for some platform the default pip is for Python2, so maybe you will get:Also from the doc Work with multiple versions of Python installed in parallel .You can try this:On Linux, Mac OS X, and other POSIX systems, use the versioned Python commands in combination with the -m switch to run the appropriate copy of pip:Appropriately versioned pip commands may also be available.On Windows, use the py Python launcher in combination with the -m switch:If you have a broken pip on Anaconda, you can follow these steps:Find pip folder under "../Anaconda3/Lib/site-packages/", delete it manually.In Anacoda prompt do : conda uninstall pipInstall pip using your familiar way. E.g: conda install -c anaconda pipHope this helps.
