This question already has an answer here:What is Truthy and Falsy in python? How is it different from True and False?                    4 answers                I am a bit confused with if/else statement. Why the code always prints True while it should be False.I have tried with different variables like i =10, i = 'a', i = 25. And it will be False if i=[]This is my code:i =1if i:    print Trueelse:    print False
In your code you say if I: True. But your not comparing it to anything.  You need a comparison operator. Like if i == 1 otherwise the if statement will just be true IF I has a value by default
