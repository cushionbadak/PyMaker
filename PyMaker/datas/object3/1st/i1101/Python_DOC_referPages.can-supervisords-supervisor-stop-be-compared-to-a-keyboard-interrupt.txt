I have a python script and the script is run in background as a supervisor job.If I were to give the command:$ sudo supervisorctl stop myscriptWhat's going on behind the scenes?If I had not handled the exception, will this be considered a graceful shutdown?
While your question is not fully complete-at its most basic, not exactly. If you mean how Python handles the Exception, it really depends on how you are calling the command and handling any codes or errors from it. All python Exceptions should inherit from BaseException, but you shouldn't catch that normally and instead catch Exception or some form of subprocess.SubprocessError (which inherits from Exception).However, if you mean how supervisorctl handles this internally, it probably has similar logic to what you are expecting: sending an exit signal for the process to handle. As you seem most familiar with Python, the signal library may be insightful for you.
