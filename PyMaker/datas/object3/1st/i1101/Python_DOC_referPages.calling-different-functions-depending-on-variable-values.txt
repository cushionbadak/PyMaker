I have 500 floats in total and i want to run if statement on each of them and call a function accordingly My code is something like this:I want a better more efficient way of doing this otherwise i have to write if statement for all the variables
You should take tutorial(s)to learn about python coding - this question is very basic as python goes.Create a function that checks the variable and prints the correct thing:Output:You can shorten your code further by using a list of tuples and a loop over it:Doku:functions tupleslistsloopsstring formatting
It would be much easier to do what you want if the data wasn't stored in a bunch of separately-named variables like x1, x2, ... x500, as you indicated in a comment.If you had the values in a list like this:Then they could all be processed by a single function called repeatedly in a for loop as shown below:You haven't indicated the source of the data, but I suspect it's being generated by an automated process of some sort. If you have control over how is done, then it shouldn't be too hard to change things so the values are in suggest form of a list.
