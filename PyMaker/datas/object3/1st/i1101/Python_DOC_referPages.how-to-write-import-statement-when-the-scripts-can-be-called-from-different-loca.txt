Consider the following directory structure:start.py depends on a1.py and a1.py in turn uses a function called some_func which is present in a2.py. Moreover, a1.py is also a standalone script and can be called independently. Now this gives rise two cases:Case 1: (Standalone script)I would import some_func as followsfrom a2 import some_funcCase 2: (Called from start.py)from scripts.a2 import some_funcMy Question: What is the pythonic way of combining the two use cases?Possible Solution?: Is this recommended or not?Note: I am using python 3.x
Pythonic way is create a package from your code and then use intra-package references in your code: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.htmlAlso you will be able to use absolute paths (from package name) after packaging your solution and installing it, like:
