This question already has an answer here:Starting Index of Arrays in C# and VB.Net                    3 answers                I'm trying to simulate Monopoly on Python but when I try to have dice roll a random number between 1 and 6.When rolled, and one of the dice numbers is 6 it comes up with a Indexerror: list index out of rangeI tested if it was the number 6 by printing the numbers.And all of the numbers came up alright but I did not see 6 once.Any ideas why?
You get an indexing error because your generated index ranges from 1 to 6 and your list's indexes start at 0 and go up to 6:You create a random index to index into a list of numbers to get a number from it ... that is far too complicated. You do not need the list of numbers - you can create the number you want directly.To get a random integer useTo get one element from an itertable useTo get a random number between a and b you can also useTo get multiple values from an iterable useYou can find the whole random documentation here: python.org: module randomrandom.randintrandom.choicerandom.choices
