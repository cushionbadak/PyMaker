Only in Python 3.7 using subprocessing methods run, Popen etc. or even using os.system() The PowerShell Script I'm calling seems to terminate before completion.  I have a much more complex script, but I have been able to simplify both the Python script and PowerShell script to exhibit the issue.  The PowerShell Script is also shown below.Here is the Python code:''' subprocess truncates output '''This is the Python script output showing no errors:This is the entire contents of the result.txt file after execution using the Python script above.This is the PowerShell ScriptThis is the normal output of the script when run from the PowerShell Command or when using Python 2.7 to launch the PowerShell script.I should note I have tried dozens of methods to launch the script with the same results.
Did you try to run the subprocess without using a shell? Like so:Alternatively, if you prefer to make use of the PowerShell, why not use it to redirect the output into the destination file (simple add a redirection to the end of the command; ... > c:/output.file)
Thanks for looking into this.  I uninstalled Python 3.7.2 and then installed 3.6.8 and it works as designed.  I have not determined if the problem was 3.7.2 or something to do with the installation.  I will investigate.Again, thanks for all your help and suggestions.
