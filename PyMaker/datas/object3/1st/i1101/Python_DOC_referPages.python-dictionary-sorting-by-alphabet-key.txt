This question already has an answer here:How can I sort a dictionary by key?                    25 answers                I'm trying to sort this dictionary a by the key alphabetically. I'm looping through in order, but the dictionary c at the end isn't sorted. I don't understand how python assigns the order of the dictionary key. Why does it maintain the original order? and how do I sort by key alphabetically? I'm using python 2.7
In general, dictionaries/hashtables/hashmaps are unordered. To sort it, you might want to first convert it into a list of tuples or something ordered, then sort on thatAs of python3.7 dictionaries are now insertion-ordered
