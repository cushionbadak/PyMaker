I wanted to display an image from a NumPy array, but I got this error: I would like that you help me to solve this error.
Your way of creating the numpy array is wrong. You should rather create it as:Then it will work. Since, you are overwriting the empty numpy array created with normal array.This will work.
The problem is that you are not creating a numpy array:when you do that arry becomes a list of lists, hence the error:AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'array_interface'You should do this instead:Note that the above specifies the dtype of arry to be np.uint8.
