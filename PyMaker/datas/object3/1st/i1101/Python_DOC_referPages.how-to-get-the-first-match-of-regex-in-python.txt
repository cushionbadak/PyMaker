I have a string:Data="a" Chain="Y" Classification="" Coreentity="N" createdAt="2018-05-05" name="DM_KING" Hour="23" Sub="N"I want to extract DM_KINGI don't know how to match the first occurrence of " after last " that is after name, I've written regex code as:Data=.*name=\"I expect code to return DM_KING,DM_KING could have any length
You can use this with re.findall.See demo.https://regex101.com/r/HrvZYo/1
You can use this regex name="([^"]+)"This regex searches for name=" then groups whatever found after that except a " and stops capturing after it sees a ". Then you can print whatever got captured in group1.Python code,Prints,
I believe this should work:
If you're going to get more values from your input string, this would be a great place to use a named group:This prints:Explanation:name=" matches the characters name=" literally (case sensitive)Named Capture Group "name" (?P<name>[^"]+)Match a single character not (^) present in the list ["]+ Quantifier â€” Matches between one and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)" matches the character " literally
If your Before and after the string is certain i.e Hour appearing after the name,This should work like charm for any length name :
Try this regex
str.index(sub[, start[, end]] ) gives the index of substring "sub" from position "start" to "end" in string "str"
