I am trying to feed a dictionary by using .send(). And my code snippet is belowAnd I believe I am handling the exception properly but still I am getting StopIteration exception.Am I not handling that exception properly or am I missing something ? ANy help greatly appreciated. 
Your coroutine exits after first send/yield. That generates a StopIteration and you cannot handle it in the coroutine itself, but only when invoking send. From the docs:The send() method returns the next value yielded by the generator, or  raises StopIteration if the generator exits without yielding another  value.I guess you want to keep the coroutine alive accepting as many sends as you want until an explicit close:Please note that now the GeneratorExit exception is caught.
