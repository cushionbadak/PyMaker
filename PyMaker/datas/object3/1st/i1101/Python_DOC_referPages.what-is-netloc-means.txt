I'm learning to make login function with Flask-login, and I'm facing with this code in my tutorial that I'm following:But I'm not sure what's the code above that I commented means..?, especially in netloc word, what is that..?, I know that is stand for network locality, but what is the purpose on that line..?
From RFC 1808, Section 2.1, every URL should follow a specific format:The netloc is what the first level domain (FLD) represents, which comes before the path, and after the scheme. For example you have the following URL:Here, www.example.com is your netloc, while index is the path, search is the query parameter, and src is the value being passed along the parameter search.Now coming to your code, the if statement checks whether or not the next_page exists and whether the next_page has a netloc so that the user could be redirected to index (default) page of your site.
