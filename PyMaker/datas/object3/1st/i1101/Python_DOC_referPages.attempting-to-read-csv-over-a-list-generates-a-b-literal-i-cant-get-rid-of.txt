Natural Text
I have a list of countries with corresponding .csv files. When I attempt to read_csv iterated over the list with a for loop, I get an error.I tried generating an empty dict first and making a dict of dataframes, I tried using decode, I tried using item = r'{}.csv'.format(file) instead of just item = '{}.csv'.format(file).This should give me a number of dataframes starting with a dataframe named algeria. Instead I get the error "FileNotFoundError: File b'algeria.csv' does not exist".
This code may help you
