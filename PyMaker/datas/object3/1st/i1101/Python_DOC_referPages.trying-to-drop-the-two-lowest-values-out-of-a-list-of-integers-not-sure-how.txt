Setting up a D20 game for discord using the discord.py rewrite. Setting up the 'dice' for stat initialization and wanted to change some stuff up, instead of doing random.randint(1, 10) + random.randint(1, 10) I wanted to 'roll' 5D6, then drop the two lowest valuesI've just started researching how to do this, I can't find any examples for python logic that look useful, figured I'd ask the question.This is where I've gotten so far, I need to figure out how to drop the two lowest values, so I can continue the line and add the remaining three values of dice togetherActual: None at the momentExpected: dice will return a value not less than three, but no greater than 18, that value will be applied to the first value of values, function will iterate through the list until complete and return values as a list of six integers not less than three but no greater then 18.
The built-in min() function can be used to isolate the lowest number.Something like this would suffice for dropping the two lowest values out of your list
The standard min function returns the lowest number in a list. The standard remove function removes the item with a value of x (not the xth item) from a list. Combining these two, all you need is this:
Another approach is to use the tools provided by the heapq module. The heapq module provides heaps, data structures whose first element is always the smallest*.  To get the result that you want, heapify your list and pop twice to remove the two lowest values. You could also use the heapq.nlargest function:* Technically this is a min heap; it's also possible to have max heaps, where the first element is the largest/greatest.
