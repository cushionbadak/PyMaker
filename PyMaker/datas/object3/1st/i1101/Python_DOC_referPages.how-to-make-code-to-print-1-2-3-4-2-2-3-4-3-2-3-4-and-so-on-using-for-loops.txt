If you are using python 3, this is the answer(tested):Or if you are using python 2, use this (tested):More info here: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-print-something-on-the-same-line-in-Python
You can solve this by manually printing the measure you are currently in - followed by the remaining beats:Output:The * are manually printed, the others filled in by the for-loopYou can read more about printing in one line here: Print in one line dynamicallyPython: multiple prints on the same line Print several values in the same line with commasDoku: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#printYou can also create a generator that counts measures on its own (I'll mark the measure-number with * manually):Output: The generator gimme_measure has it's own measure counter which is initialized to 1 and incremented each time you generate a new measure using the generator - if you do not reset the gimme_measure.measure to some other number it keeps counting upwards any time you print another generated measure.You can even chain different bpm together:Output:
