The program that I've been trying to do isWrite a program that asks the user to enter how many numbers are to be averaged. The user can then enter the numbers. The program outputs the total and the mean.I've tried for i in range, lists and both of them always end up in ("int" not subscriptible) or ("print" syntax's).

You are first assigning an empty list to x:And then you assign a single int (twice):1: x = []2: x = first user input3: x = second user inputWhat you want to do is append the user input to the list in x.Either like this:Or like this:The [] in the second example are required to add (+) lists together as you can not add a list and a value but you can add two lists in terms of appending one to the  other.You could also use list comprehension:
You can use the Built-in function sum() to get the sum of elements in a list.Output
