I'm having trouble processing input from user.Input: C6H12O6Expected output: ["C",6, "H", 12, "O", 6] I'd like to check if the symbol corresponding to the atomic elementis valid which is already stored in my db. But I'm having trouble getting an array output as so.More importantly, other outputs of chemical formulas need to work as well but so far only some cases are working using O(n^2)How can I do so in native python 3.6 ?
You can leverage itertools.groupby using str.isdigit() as grouping criteria together with some list comprehension / generator comprehension and integer parsing to get your output:Output:This works by grouping the string into groups of str.isdigit() == True and str.isdigit() == False - and parses the found groups to integer if possible. To work properly - elements that occur one time need this specifier as well: 'C1H3C1H2O1H1' to be seperated into "chemical" elements correctly - if not it will be split as ['CH',3,'CH',2,'OH'].To split off "correctly" spelled Elements from each other (f.e. "H2SeO4") you can post-process the result:You can use regex as well - a solution using re.split() can be found in the question Split digit and text by regexp
This will separate the numbers and alphabets into different elements of a list.OutputBut this is not perfect. For example 'CO2' will be split into ['CO',2 ]NOT ['C','O','2 ] 
Here's another solution using itertools.groupby and operator.itemgetter:
