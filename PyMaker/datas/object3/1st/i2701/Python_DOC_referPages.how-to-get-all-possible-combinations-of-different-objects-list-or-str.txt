it's more like a general question and I'm not sure if any algorithm exists for what I have in mind and if it exists what its called ...let's say we have three objects (list)what I want to do now is create new lists with all possible combinations such asand even futureso I'm looking for an algorithm to mix/combine/add/remove stuff in a logical framework. I know python has but in itertools lib and combinations method but it doesn't seem to offer all combinations.is there any known algorithm/lib for path and combinations between objects?Thanks 
You don't seem to want combinations. You want Cartesian product, and, probably, permutations (it's a little unclear from your description). For the Cartesian product, you need to do something likeFor the second part of your question, on every element of the list built by the previous example, you can use itertools.permutations.
