I have a bunch of unused steam keys and I'm trying to write a small python script to search for the best prices of every game I own on some of the cheapest steam keys sites. At the moment I've tried as an example to find the best prices on g2a. The script runs almost fine (yes, sometimes returning a single price doesn't exactly return the price for the game I own, but that is not the main problem). The problem is that it seems I can't correctly search for a webpage whenever part of the name contains special characters. I've tried to remove special characters but the problem is still there. Any advices? This is my script:A version of it including the list of the games is here:https://repl.it/@PaoloVeronesi/g2a-prices
You should not be doing these string "quoting" manually - there is a special set of library functions available for that in Python - quote() or quote_plus() from urllib.parse module:Or, even better, would be to switch to using requests package that would just do the quoting implicitly and under-the-hood.
