I am trying to combine .lower() and .replace but im struggling.here is my code snippet...this looks for user issuing the command 'rename account 1' and then in the same string adding the new name eg. 'rename account 1 account 2'the trouble is if a user inputs any capital letters, eg. 'Rename Account 1' the command is not recognised.What I normally to do is use the .lower() to change the input string to all lowercase and then match the command which is all lowercase. The problem is if I do that, the .replace can only be all lowercase as well.I can do this...which solves the problem of the input, but adds the problem of the output being all lowercase.How can I isolate the 2 things in this case?I am new to python and learning on the fly, so if the answer is obvious please forgive me.Thanks
You can use re to replace a string case insensitively.Result:The re.I flag is short for "ignore case".
