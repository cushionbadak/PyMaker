Unlike @strava answer, you don't actually have to extract... zipfile gives you excellent API for manipulating files. Here is a simple example of reading each file inside a simple zip (I zipped only one .txt file):output:Using this example you can easily elaborate and read each one of the files, search the text for your string, and write it to output file.For more info, check printdir, read, write, open, close members of zipfile.ZipFileIf you just want to extract and then use pd.read_csv, that's also fine:
Here it is a script that does what I suppose you need — please note that we DO NOT need pandas if we want to simply match a string against a line's content, it'd be different if you want to match on a specific field, a numerical value etc — hence I am not using pandas...
You could try extracting them first, and then treating them as normal csv files
