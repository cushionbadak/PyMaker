I have a custom class in my Python code, that handles k-means clustering. The class takes some arguments to customize the clustering, however when subtracting two values from a list passed to the class, I get the following error:Here is the code of my custom class:I append the KMeansClusterer as well, because sum_squared_dist is filled with values of there:  I cannot imagine why '-' should be unsupported, I trie to subtract two list values of type integer and 1 and a integer variable.
KMeans.fit() returns a class instance, which implies calc_custom_params() returns a class instance, so your list sum_squared_dist does not contain integers, the elements are objects of the sklearn.cluster.KMeans class.
Python cannot automatically subtract classes. You need to implement the __sub__ method on your class for python to know how to handle subtracting these classes. You can find the full reference here https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html
