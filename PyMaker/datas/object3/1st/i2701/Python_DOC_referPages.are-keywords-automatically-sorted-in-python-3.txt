I am studying Python3 tutorial on keyword arguments and couldn't reproduce the output due to the following code:What I got was a sorted dict:So I tried without calling cheeseshop(): It looks like in version 3.5, the keys are automatically sorted. But in version 2.7, they aren't:and I have to sort it in 2.7 to agree with 3.5.So the statement in the tutorial: "Note that the order in which the keyword arguments are printed is guaranteed to match the order in which they were provided in the function call." should be only applied to version 2.7, not 3.5. Is this true?
Following the comments from @Ry and @abamert, I upgraded to Python 3.7, see link1 link2 and link3 for steps on how to build it from <3.7> source code. One note is that the Python default for Ubuntu 16.04 are versions 2.7 and 3.5 in /usr/bin. After the upgrade, 3.7 resides in /usr/local/bin. So we can have three  versions coexistent.As they said, do not rely on a particular version for the key order since the behavior of versions 2.7, 3.5 and 3.7 is different from each other: <2.7> order is random, but consistent/repeatable.<3.5> order is random and inconsistent.<3.7> order is preserved as entered and thus consistent.         Use OrderedDict if you want it to be sorted. see below.For example:
