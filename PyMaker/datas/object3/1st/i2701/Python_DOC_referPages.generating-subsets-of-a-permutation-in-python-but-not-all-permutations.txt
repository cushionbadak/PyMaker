I have a list L = [1,2,3] and I want to calculate the product of all combinations, but only once -- that is:I've seen a number of posts talking about using itertools, permutations and combinations, but these return results including [1,2,3], [2,1,3], [3,2,1], etc, which is not what I'm after. (I'm using Python 3 if that is useful to know)NB Very aware that this could be failure of my search skills, and I just don't know the precise term that I'm looking for. 
What you want are all subsets. It turns out itertools recipes offer a neat way to generate the powerset of an iterable.ExampleOutput
You want the powerset of your set. itertools has an example of how to find it.https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html
