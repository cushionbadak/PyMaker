You are using \s that matches any kind of vertical and horizontal whitespaces. If you plan to just match spaces and tabs, replace it with [ \t].Besides, you should consider escaping dots in your pattern (they are all outside of character classes) to match literal dots, else, they match any char but a line break char.Also, you do not need a capturing group around the whole pattern, you may always get the whole match via Group 0 (that you may access when iterating all match data objects returned with re.finditer).So, you may useSee the regex demo.You may use re.findall(pattern, s) to get all matches as a list. Or, if you need a list of tuples containing specific submatches, wrap those parts with capturing parentheses. E.g., to capture the number to one group and the measurement unit into another, use (\d(?:[\d ,.]*\d)?)[ \t]*((?:carpet|sft|feet|sqft|yard|gaj|feet|s\.ft|sq\.ft|sq feet|fq\.ft\.|sq\.ft\.|pt|crpt|ft|sq\.mt\.|sq\.mtr|sq\.mt|plot|sf|sfqt|acer|gj|vigha|anna|gunta|sq|gunthe|guntha|bigha|sqd|sqm|sqyd|area|acre|square|yrd|sq\.yard|sq yd|sq\.yd|sq\. yd\.|gaj|sqt)s?). Note I revamped \d(?:[\d \t,.]*\d)? * into (\d(?:[\d ,.]*\d)?)[ \t]* to make sure the spaces after the number are not captured.Python demo:Output:
