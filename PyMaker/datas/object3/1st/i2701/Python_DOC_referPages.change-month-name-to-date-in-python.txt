I am trying to change month name to date in python but i m getting an error:My CSV has values such as October in it which I want to change it to 10/01/2018Any help would be appreciated
Can't you just write a function mapping to each? In fact, a dictionary will do.
As an elaboration of the answer by @AdamSmith, a better way to define a mapping between names and dates is to use the calendar module that already has a list of names:
The whole point of passing a format string like %m/%d/%y to strftime is that you're specifying what format the input strings are going to be in.You can see the documentation, but it's pretty obvious that a format like %m/%d/%y is not going to handle strings like 'October'. You're asking for a (zero-padded) month number, a slash, a (zero-padded) day number, a slash, and a (zero-padded) (two-digit) years.If you specify a format that actually does match your input, everything works without error:However, that still isn't what you want, because the default year is 1900, not 2018. So, you either need to replace that, or pull the month out and build a new datetime object.Also, notice that all of the strings that strptime knows about are locale-specific. If you've set an English-speaking locale, like en_US.UTF-8, or C, then %B means the English months, so everything is great. But if you've set, say, br_PT.UTF-8, then you're asking it to match the Brazilian Portuguese month names, like Outubro instead of October.11. Since I don't actually know Brazilian Portuguese, that was a pretty dumb example for me to pickâ€¦ but Google says it's Outubro, and when Google Translate did so ever lead wrong one?
I'm assuming the data is mostly in the format you have specified (mm/dd/yyyy) but some outlier rows have month names in them.Without adding any extra dependencies:then
