Natural Text
I have huge text file which consists of random letters from A-Z and I want to extract some characters out. The tricky part is that given the following input:and the pattern VAJ, I want to extract each match until the end of the string. I want the following output:
You can use str.find() to find the index, where your pattern occurs. You can then slice the string accordingly. An implementaion could look like this:You can use it with find("AFVAJFLDVAJPQDVAJDSNJKVAJGHD", "VAJ").
This calls for regular expressions with sub-group matching.( https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/re.html#match-objects )My test file data.txt:Python code:Ouput:Hugeness of the file is not a problem with this code, as long as the longest line fits a few times in memory it should be OK.
