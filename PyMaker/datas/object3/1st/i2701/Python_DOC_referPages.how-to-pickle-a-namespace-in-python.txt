Is there a way to save and load an entire namespace using pickle allowing me to perform something like this:Allowing to open a new python prompt and performing the following code:
If your intention is to 'freeze' a particular code version of the modules you use I suggest taking a look at Python Virtual Environment (venv). Otherwise, as jasonharper suggested - it is very unlikely to work well (particularly with modules like NumPy which are complex amalgamates of Python code and binary libraries). venv would help you deal with that particular problem too.
I think that I get the question.  You want to be able to restore all variables and interact with a shell in a different interpreter or at a different time.  The easiest way to do this is probably to use a notebook like jupyter or ipython.  These allow you to save all commands run and reconstitute them.  Sorry for it not being a direct answer, but I think it may "equivalently accomplish" what you specified.
