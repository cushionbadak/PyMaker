I tried to have models.UUIDField without dash, by using default=uuid.uuid4().hex (Instead of default=uuid.uuid4())However, the resultant result still come with dash.May I know how to have models.UUIDField field without dash?. I would like to store in database without dashes, and use it without dashes.
Are you using PostgreSQL by any chance? The UUIDField may be using the native uuid type for the column. It stores it efficiently using only 16 bytes (without dashes). If that is the case, it is not storing the dashes, only showing them when you select. The good news, is that in python code, you are getting a UUID object, so you can do self.api_key.hex() to get a string without dashes.
Use CharField field instead of UUIDField,
