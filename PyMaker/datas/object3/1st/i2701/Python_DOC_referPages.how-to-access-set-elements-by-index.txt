I was working on recommendation system (RS) in python when I came across a serious problem: I couldn't access the set without changing its order.e.g. Once I changed a set to list the order gets change. (In recommendation, system order is very important.)final_prediction=set(df_final)-set(df1)e.g.Here df_final and df1 both are categorical variablesAlthough I used other approach, I had to scratch my butt's to change the code because it was giving perfect results using set thing and all other things were just working fine. I was in the final phase of my RS, but because of the set order I had to take other approach.How do we access an set without changing the order?
set is an unordered collection. For an ordered collection, you can use list or tuple. You now have a few options. Your choice should depend on whether you expect repeats in df_final. If you have no repeats, you can use a list comprehension:If you have repeats in df_final, then you need unique items with ordering maintained. For this, you can use toolz.unique, which is equivalent to the unique_everseen recipe found in the docs:
The lists, the first one is orderedThis works but it's O(NÃ—M)This has a setup cost but it's O(N), if both lists are long...
Since you need ordered sets, I recommend using the ActiveState recipe the Python documentation recommends in the "See also:" at the very end.If you put the recipe's code in a separate file named orderedset.py, it can be imported as a module and used like this:
