Use setattr to set the attribute's name to a variable:Output:However, although this works, I would consider dynamic creating of instance attributes bad practice. Instead, you should use a dict to store these classes:And the output is the same as if you had used attributes.
You could create a method like so:Where None will initialize the values for you. If you want to create key-value pairs, you can create a dictionary:It's generally better practice to do this in the __init__ method (I think it's a PEP standard, SO can keep me honest here), but that's a kind of hacky way to do it
