I'm learning numpy package, and I've found this code example:The thing I'm unable to understand is the dot notation:in contrast with, for exampleI understand what add and reduce do, but what is add? What is reduce?
"Reduce" is a general concept, and I found a decent definition at https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduceApply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.Numpy's ufunc reduce is documented at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ufunc.reduce.htmlReduces aâ€™s dimension by one, by applying ufunc along one axis.So np.add.reduce(a) (also known as np.add.reduce(a, axis=0)) will call np.add on a[0] and a[1], then add the result to a[2], etc. until it incorporates all len(a) elements. Result: array([5, 7, 9])np.add(x, y) is basically x + y. np.add.reduce(a, axis=0) is basically np.sum(a, axis=0).np.add.reduce(a, axis=1) adds a[:, 0] to a[:, 1], then adds result to a[:, 2], and so on.`Result: array([ 6, 15])
