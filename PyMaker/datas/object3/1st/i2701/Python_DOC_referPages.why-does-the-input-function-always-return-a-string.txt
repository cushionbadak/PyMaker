If I have such a simple codeit gives me - class 'int'But if I have this:And I type 1, it gives me class 'str'Tell me please - why is it so and how should I write a program so that it defines a variable I enter correctly as int, str or float?
What you input to your program is always of type str. if you want Python to deduce the type of the input itself, use data = eval(input()) or, for more safety:
The built-in function input always returns a string, regardless of whether that string might be comprised of solely numerical characters. If you are sure the result can represent a number, then convert it:Now the type of varry will be int, assuming this conversion doesn't raise a ValueError
You have to convert it to int using int() method
