The SituationI am trying to install apache-airflow using pip into a conda environment. I am not able to, since setup.py egg_info keeps failing:Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in  C:\Users\joshu\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-3efyslfh\apache-airflow\message when I run pip install "apache-airflow[s3, postgres]" I ran this in Windows cmd, then did all the steps again as admin in cmd (shift+enter when opening cmd). Steps I took1)  I first created a conda environment and installed pip and setuptools into the environment:After this setup, running pip install apache-airflow gives me the error at the top of this pageOther steps I tookInstalling apache-airflow on my system (no conda environment). This works, but I'm looking to have it contained in an environment.Upgrading setuptools:code:I've also tried upgrading pip then running install -- no luckUltimately I would like to have airflow and related packages I need for my project in a conda environment.
The error appears to be because async is a reserved keyword in Python 3.7 and this package has not updated their setup.py script. You can use Python 3.6 until the package is updated
I ran into the same problems. Apache Airflow 1.10 is incompatible.My solution was to build the source code. I got the latest source code via git. This command creates a wheel file in the dist directory.Then you install
