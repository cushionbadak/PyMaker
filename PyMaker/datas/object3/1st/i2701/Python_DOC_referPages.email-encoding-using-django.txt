Natural Text
My webapp stores Hebrew text in a Postgres DB and later sends it as an email.I can see that the text is stored well in the DB, but when sent as an email it look like gibberish:×¢×•×‘×“ ×™×§×¨, ×–×”×• ×˜×¡×˜ ×©×œ ×”×”×ª×¨××•×ª ×”× ×©×œ×—×•×ª  ×‘×¢×‘×¨×™×ª.I'm using urlllib to unquote the text from the DBand EmailSender to send the email:What can be causing that?
It's probably happening because the source text is in UTF-8, not in ASCII. You should take a look at Useful utility functions.There you will find the smart_text() method, which I think will solve your problem by converting your email_content.You could also use the encode/decode approach.Read Standard Encodings and try:email_content.encode("your_encoding").decode("utf-8")
