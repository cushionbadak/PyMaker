I am trying to print this pattern using print() function in python3.the following are the two ways I implemented this.numeric approachstring and list comprehension approachthe pattern is printing right but when I am submitting this to online judge it do not accept.it expects to remove that extra space after the 0.PROBLEM: In both of the code snippet I am unable to remove the last line extra space. I do not know how to achieve this Pattern and also not to have that extra space after the number at the end of each line.
The problem appears to be the expression gap * (y - n) + str1 + " " + str2.strip(). For the first line, str is null, so you have str1 followed by a space, followed by nothing, which means that you have a space at the end of your line. The solution is to add the lists together first, then join:BTW, an alternative to list(range(n - 1))[::-1] is  list(range(n-2,-1,-1)).You can also combine list comprehensions with various tricks, such as [str(e) if e < n else str(2*n-e) for e in range(2*n+1) ]
