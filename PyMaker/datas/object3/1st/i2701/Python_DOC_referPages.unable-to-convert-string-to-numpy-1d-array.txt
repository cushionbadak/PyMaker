For facial recognition, we need to read vector from mysql DB and convert to 1D array for recognition.The following object is retrieved from mysql which is stored as JSON format in mysql.it is returning array([], dtype=uint8)It tried all the below options but could not get itConvert string to numpy arrayConvert string array to numpy array
Try thisb = str(s1) # converting to string as your input is stringoutput = np.fromstring(b[1:-1],sep=',') # using b[1:-1] to get the string alone by slicing square braces ([])print(output)check the doc for more info
If, as in your example, the string representation precisely reflects that of a regular Python list, you can use ast.literal_eval before feeding np.array:The docs explain types accepted by literal_eval:Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python  literal or container display. The string or node provided may only  consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes,  numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and None.So we are effectively converting a string to a Python list, which np.array can then convert to a NumPy array.If you are keen on using np.fromstring, note that open and close square brackets must be excluded:Note, as above, you will need to read as float first (the default) before conversion to np.uint8. In this case, you should expect all 0 values.
