I have a flask server that is sending a dictionary to the frontend. I'm trying to sort the contents of the dictionary in the UI.Here is how the dictionary is structured.The relevant snippet from the UI that isn't what I need to sort looks something like this. Note this works just fine, no errors, but it isn't sorting the data.What I want to do is to sort this dictionary when displaying it, obviously dictionaries have no ordering in python, by the weight. Desired output would be the data being displayed like this:I've tried to use do_dictsort filter, but it gave me an error because of how the data was organized. How do I sort this in the UI?
why don't you send the sorted dict to the front end..now you just have to loop.here's how
