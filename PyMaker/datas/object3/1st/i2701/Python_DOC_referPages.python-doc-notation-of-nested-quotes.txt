Natural Text
I'm reading python doc of string literals, and see:what do these nested quotes mean? Why are they necessary?
Taken directly from the paragraph below the lexical definition: In plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching single quotes (') or double quotes ("). They can also be enclosed in matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally referred to as triple-quoted strings).In my opinion their notation is a little messier but they're attempting to show the reader that the triple quotes (single or double) act as a literal in the Python grammar.For clarity, let ƒ = """ and ∆ = ''', then we could rewrite that expression in the grammar aslongstring      ::=  "ƒ" longstringitem* "ƒ" | '∆' longstringitem* '∆'Then you would write a python docstring likeor Instead of the normal,Of course this is a ridiculous example but I hope you get the point.
