I want my raspberry to play a random audio file from a folder, everytime I press a button I connected with a GPIO. I already wrote a slightly different version of this program, but unfortunately it always plays the same file, everytime I press the button, so I have to restart the program to get another sound.Here's the complete program:
Load all sounds and append them to a list.Then call random.choice with this list as the argument to pick a random sound out of the list and play it.
