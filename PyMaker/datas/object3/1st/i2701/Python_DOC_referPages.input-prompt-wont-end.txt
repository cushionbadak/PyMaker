Running Python 3.6.5I'm very new to python. When I run these lines separately in the terminal, I get exactly what I want. When I run the python file, the input prompt 'ideal weight?' won't end after I submit a number. It keeps repeating 'ideal weight?'. I'm trying to find the combination of numbers from the 'weights' set that will sum up to the user input.   Can someone help explain what I'm doing wrong. Thank you!
Not sure whats wrong with your terminal. Consider using argparse instead of input:Then call it from command line with --weight or -w:
