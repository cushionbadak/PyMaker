This is sort of a followup question to one of my previous questions.  I have some dictionaries where I need to look at every value they contain and if that value is a datetime I need to format it a specific way.  I also need to be able to recurse into nested dictionaries and lists.  This is what I have so far:This works great for dictionaries and nested dictionaries, but not so much for lists.  So in the above example fix_recursive would correct SomeDateField1 and SubDateField4_1, but not SubDateField3_1, SubDateField3_2, or SubDateField3_3.  Also, as I don't know what the input will look like before I get it, I am trying to create a function that could get values in listed nested 3 or 4 levels deep.And suggestions would be appreciated.Thanks!
You need to differentiate between looping over a list and a dictionary
Flow your current route, added list support to recursive function.Why use fix_time, for serialize and deserialize? Use JSON or pickle, no need to convert datetime.
