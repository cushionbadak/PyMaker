This question already has an answer here:Create a “with” block on several context managers? [duplicate]                    5 answers                Just started working with Python today, so if I'm doing something crazy here please let me know. I have been working to simplify a block of code so that I can more easily reuse it. My goal would be to just update one set of variables during each reuse. The last working code I had is this:This saves me a ton of time from my original code but still requires a fair bit of editing. So I was thinking I might be able to use a for loop but I got stuck about halfway through. Here's what I have so far, but I am stumped on how to proceed from here.
If you are using python 3.3+, there is ExitStack which you could use to manage all the context managers. All opened files will automatically be closed at the end of the with statement.And files will have all the handles to open files that you could use to create your model.
