I have a string which should be a 3x3x3 array. Just looking for an easy way to convert this back to its 'truth' so i can access the values. It is Newline, [ ] and what i thought were tabs but are either 7 or 6 spaces.... separated. I saved an array into a pandas DataFrame thinking it would work but gave me this:I have tried .split('\n') and various other separators and combinations with little success.Looking for array (#'s just example):Thanks!
A rare use for eval():EDIT: as pointed out eval is insufficient for what you're asking.  What I eventually got working was built off json and numpyYou can easily replace numpy.array() with pandas.DataFrame().
You could try using the json library included in Python.Specifically you would need to use the json.loads() function. Remember to still split the string with \n using the str.split()Here's an example on how you would use it:
