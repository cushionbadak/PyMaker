User provides input with spaces: So I need to create 'row' list into the below. The list is divided into sub-lists based on whitespace:
You can use str.split to split by whitespace:Alternatively, using a list comprehension:
You can usestr.split to split the input on spaces to give a list of sub-strings.E.g. '123 456 789' would become ['123', '456', '789'].Then use a list-comprehension to convert these strings into lists of characters with the list() constructor (as you are already familiar with).Making the final code:

Try this:Output:
