Given this string 'www__ww_www_'I need to replace all the _ with CHARACTERS from the following string '1234'. So the result is supposed to be 'www12ww3www4'What is the right way to do this? Because this seems like the most inefficient way.
You may use a string iterator and a generator expression with a ternary inside of it:
As pointed in the comments, you can use the str.replace directly:You can use also the regex replace for that:see here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
Consider splitting the pattern string by the underscore and zipping it with the string of inserts:zip_longest is used instead of the "normal" zip to make sure the last fragment of the pattern, if any, is not lost. A step-by-step exploration:Speed comparison:This solution: 1.32 µs ± 9.08 ns per loopIterator + ternary + list comprehension: 1.77 µs ± 20.8 ns per loopOriginal solution: 2 µs ± 13.2 ns per loopThe loop + regex solution: 3.66 µs ± 103 ns per loop
You can use an iterator in a replacement function for re.sub:This outputs:
