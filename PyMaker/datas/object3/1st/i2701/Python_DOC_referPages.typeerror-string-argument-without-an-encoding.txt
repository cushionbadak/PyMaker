I want to upload compressed gzip of Json into Google Storage.I have this code:The create_jsonlines(source) is a function that returns Json Newline Delimited.Running this code gives:The Python docs says the format is: bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]]) I'm not sure I understand it as there is no example of how to use it.I tried also This gives :I'm running Python 3.5
You are not using the bytes function correctly. Check this:You can try:
Probably you are only one step away from the answer.   See bytesarray() and bytes for the function usage.(May need to change python version of the document)And it says Notice that square bracket indicates that parameters can be omitted, not array type of python language.So you should use bytes(create_jsonlines(source), encoding='utf8')
