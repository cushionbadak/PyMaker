The website I learn python on doesn't explain the dictionaries well so I resort to this.What I'm supposed to do is find the average of the 3 of these room's temperatures over how many days the user types(maximum is 3). Each day has 4 temperatures over 1 day. When I run this code, it doesn't produce any temperatures for the 3 rooms. temps1.txt activates only when 1 is typed by the user in the input question:temps2.txt only activates when the user enters 2 in the first question(this is used alongside temps1.txt):temps3.txt only activates when the user enters 3 in the first question(this is used alongside temps1.txt and temps2.txt):Am I able to produce a code to do this but with no imports of the sort? Also one more thing, am I able to assign variables to 'for in' statements and 'if' statements?
Lets split data file creation and processing to make this a minimal verifyable complete example - answer:With this demo data we start the user input and calculation. We read all needed data from 1 to 3 files into one dict and output it:Output:If you input anything beside 1-3 you either get a new input prompt (if int inputted) or a message and a new prompt (if no int given).
