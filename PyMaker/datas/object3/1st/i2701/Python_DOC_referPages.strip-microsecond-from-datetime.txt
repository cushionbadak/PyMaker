For a given timedata - 2018-06-01 06:36:40.047883+00:00, I want to remove microsecond and strip the value after '+'. Most of my dataset contains values like 2018-06-04 11:30:00+00:00 without the microsecond part. How to have a common date time format for all values?
I'm answering your question with an assumption that the type of the data is a string.If you are facing problem in handling in different formats like "2018-06-01 06:36:40.047883+00:00" and "2018-06-04 11:30:00+00:00" you can use split().Learn more about split() at hereLike,The output of the above script is,
Let's say you have a mix of different formats that looks like this:Corresponding output:You wish to get to a common format by removing microseconds and anything after +. In short, you want something that is in Y-M-D H-M-S format.Currently, let me assume that your column is in string format. So, we now convert this to a datetime format and then replace the microseconds part with 0 and get rid of it. Output:
Another way to achieve that is by using str.split:
