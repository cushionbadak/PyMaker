I'm working on plotting some time series data; I have a very long time series (~68k lines). I've got a small helper functions that grabs a small subset by slicing the list, performs some analysis, then plots the resultsThe resulting plot is zero-indexed because I pass in only the sliced subset. I'd like it to be absolute indexed. How do I dynamically change the labels?Here's something similar to what I'm looking atThe problem is that my graph x-axis ranges from 0 to (end - start), not from start to end. I'd like to change the labels dynamically, so they're correct for any size graph I'm looking at, and correct if I pan or zoom
You need to include the range of set of x values that pairs with the calculated set of y values, otherwise matplotlib will default to base zero for the x axis:something like this, maybe:As the xdata may be only implied in your dataset, you will need to construct a set of x values: under certain circumstances, (original x data starts at zero, are integers, and increment by one being the simplest), you could use this to substitute:Check out slice to construct more sophisticated sequences
