Can anyone explain this code a little. I can't understand what n does here? We already have taken N = int(input()) as input then why n=len(bin(N))-2? I couldn't figure it out.
n counts the number of bits in the number N. bin() produces the binary representation (zeros and ones), as as string with the 0b prefix:so len(bin(n)) takes the length of that output string, minus 2 to account for the prefix.See the bin() documentation:Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed with “0b”.The length is used to set the width of the columns (via str.rjust(), which adds spaces to the front of a string to create an output n characters wide). Knowing how many characters the widest binary representation needs is helpful here.However, the same information can be gotten directly from the number, with the int.bitlength() method:The other columns are also oversized for the numbers. You could instead calculate max widths for each column, and use str.format() or an f-string to do the formatting:
