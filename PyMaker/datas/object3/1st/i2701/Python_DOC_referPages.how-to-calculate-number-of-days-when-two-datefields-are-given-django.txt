models.pyThe above are the two date fields which are defined in my models.py.views.pyThe above code is my trial on getting the number of days.Here, my model is Leave and my form is LeaveRequestForm. In my HTML file to get the number of days I use {{ from_date|timesince:to_date }}, this works but i want to deduct this number of days from a number.base : I'm working on a leave-management project. If a user asks a leave for 5days and he is eligible for 10days. His balance leaves should be equal to 5.How do I achieve this with the views?
use property in model asand in your template you could  use it as {{ leave_object.date_diff }}
In your case, d2 - d1 is a timedelta object which has an integer property days.So you need to write days = (d2 - d1).days in your python code, and you will get an int which you can subtract from whatever you need.
