Natural Text
when i attempted to call out the concordance function with the search_term being 'and', the result not only returns 'and', but it also returns words that have and in them such as 'demand'. How can i change my code so that it only returns 'and'?
as mentioned in the comments: you could try to use the re module. here i try to match your search_term only if it is surrounded by characters that are not in [a-zA-Z0-9_] (not sure if that suits your intentions best...):
