Hi I'm a bit stuck on a syntax error I'm not sure if it's a indent error or incorrect usage of except discord.NotFoundThis is the error I get in the console This is how I'm using the exception and wanting to handle the error in my code, here is snippet. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong here so your help would be appreciated. Edit adding try statement:
The issue is because the try statement is in the wrong place. It should look like this:You also need to delete the return statement after this line:
The except block tells python what to do if the associated try block fails. You don't have a try block, so it's throwing a syntax error.
