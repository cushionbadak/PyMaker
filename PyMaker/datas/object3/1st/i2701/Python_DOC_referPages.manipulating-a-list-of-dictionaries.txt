Natural Text
I successfully imported from the web this json file, which looks like:[{"h_mag":"19.7","i_deg":"9.65","moid_au":"0.035"},{"h_mag":"20.5","i_deg":"14.52","moid_au":"0.028"},etc ...I want to extract the values of the key moid_au, later compare moid_au with the key values of h_mag. This works: print(data[1]['moid_au']), but if I try to ask all the elements of the list it won't, I tried: print(data[:]['moid_au']).I tried iterators and a lambda function but still has not work yet, mostly because I'm new in data manipulation. It works when I have one dictionary, not with a list of dictionaries. Thanks in advance for other tips. Some links were confusing. 
Sounds like you are using lambda wrong because you need map as well:Each lambda grabs a record from your list and you map your function to that.
Using print(data[:]['moid_au']) equals to print(data['moid_au']), and you can see that it won't work, as data has no key named 'moid_au'.Try working with a loop:
using your approach to iterate over the whole array to get all the instances of a key,this method might work for you
In which exact way do you want to compare them?Would it be useful getting the values in a way like this?
