I am trying to print the first and last item of all the lists inside my list of lists num_list. But this is just printing 3,30,300 and skipping the 1,10 and 100.What is a good way to solve this problem?
Use indexing.Ex:Output:
You don't need to use range to achieve your task.Anyway, even if you would like to, there is a mistake in your code in the lineBy definition and returns the first value which is False, otherwise if there is not, it returns the last value in the expression.Thus, in your case it only returns range(2,3).Indeed, returnssince bool(range(0,1)) and bool(range(2,3)) are both evaluated as True.This is why they are both non-empty sequences. Indeed bool(range(2,2)) would be evaluated as False being empty. For more details see the documentation.You should rather write something likeusing itertools.chain.
range(0,1) and range(2,3) returns => range(2,3)
