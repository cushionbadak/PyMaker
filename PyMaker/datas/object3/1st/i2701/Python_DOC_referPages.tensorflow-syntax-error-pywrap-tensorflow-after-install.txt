I've setup a virtualenv and using pip installed tensorflow via sudo pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.10.0-py3-none-any.whl. However, when I open a python shell to test the install I get the following error:I've searched around but can't find a straightforward solution to this. Any ideas? Thanks!
async is a reserved keyword in Python 3 (here's the full list).Look like you aren't the only one running into  this problem, there's an active thread on the tensorflow github issue tracker addressing it that dates back to July: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20517
