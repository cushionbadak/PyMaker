I am trying to understand how this program works step by stepthis code doesn't print anything so what's the actual value i contain, does it contains garbage value.
range(2, 2) is an empty sequence. Ranges are half-open, so range(2, 2) means "all integers >=2 but <2", of which there are none:So, when you iterate it, you get an empty iterator:So, for i in range(2, 2): loops 0 times, never even getting as far as assigning anything to i, much less printing it.So i contains whatever it happened to contain before this for statement:â€¦ or, if it didn't contain anything, there is no i variable:
for i in range(2,2)  result is empty list []the code as following:for n in range(2,11):    for x in range(2,n):        if n % x == 0:            print(n,"prime")            break    else:        print(n,"not a prime")the result:2 not a prime3 not a prime4 prime5 not a prime6 prime7 not a prime8 prime9 prime10 prime
