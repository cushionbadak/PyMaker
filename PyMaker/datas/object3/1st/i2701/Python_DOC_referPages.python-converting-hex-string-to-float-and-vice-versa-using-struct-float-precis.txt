When testing my library, Construct, I found out that tests fail when numbers are built then parsed back to a float. Should floats not be represented exactly as in-memory floats?
Floating point is inherently imprecise, but you are packing a double-precision float (binary64) into a single-precision (binary32) space there. See Basic and interchange formats in the Wikipedia article on IEEE floating point formats; the Python float format uses double precision (see the standard types docs; Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C).Use d to use double precision:From the Format characters section:format: f, C Type: float, Python type: float, Standard size: 4, Footnote: (5)  format: d, C Type: double, Python type: float, Standard size: 8, Footnote: (5)  For the 'f' and 'd' conversion codes, the packed representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32 (for 'f') or binary64 (for 'd') format, regardless of the floating-point format used by the platform.
