This question already has an answer here:Why does Python allow mentioning a method without calling it?                    6 answers                My file is not being closed properly and I cannot figure out why:output:Shouldn't the output return None?
For one, you need to call the close method:Then, what will result is a closed file, not None.Finally, the usual way to handle files in Python is using with-statements, which take care of closing the file for you:
You have to call     open_sample_file.close()
