Natural Text
I use the python example from https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html.every thing is right until I added one line import pyodbc in the 'multiply.py' file. PyImport_Import will return null if i add this line,and PyErr_Print() show that no module named pyodbc.but actually, i have install pyodbc with pip,and i run 'multiply.py' with no problem on command line.Is something wrong?
I would recommend installing everything again, because your problem is very strange and I nobody was able to explain it.
