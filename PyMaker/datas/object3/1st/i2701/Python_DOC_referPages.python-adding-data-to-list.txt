I am learning lists and trying to create a list and add data to it.This generates Error.Why cant we add members to lists like this, like we do with arrays in javascript.Since these are also dynamic and we can add as many members and of any data type to it.In javascript this works:Why this dosent work in Python and we only use append() to add to list.
mylist[0] = 'hello' is syntactic sugar for mylist.__setitem__(0, 'hello').As per the docs for object.__setitem__(self, key, value):The same exceptions should be raised for improper key values as for  the __getitem__() method.The docs for __getitem__ states specifically what leads to IndexError:if value outside the set of indexes for the sequence (after any  special interpretation of negative values), IndexError should be  raised.As to the purpose behind this design decision, one can write several chapters to explain why list has been designed in this way. You should familiarise yourself with Python list indexing and slicing before making judgements on its utility.
Lists in Python are fundamentally different to arrays in languages like C. You do not create a list of a fixed size and assign elements to indexes in it. Instead you either create an empty list and append elements to it, or use a list-comprehension to generate a list from a type of expression.In your case, you want to add to the end, so you must use the .append method:And an example of a list comprehension:
