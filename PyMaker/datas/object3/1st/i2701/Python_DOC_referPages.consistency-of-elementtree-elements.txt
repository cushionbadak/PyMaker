Natural Text
I am using xml to describe bounding boxes and intend to filter out some elements of the xml files. A typical xml might look like:I am applying some checks on the bbox coordinates and if necessary remove the object containing the corresponding bbox.I was accessing the coordinates using something like:but it seems awkward and ugly so I switched to:which seems a little better. obj came from objs = tree.findall('object') so it could be even optimized by applying the same indices to the the root, like:xmin 580My question is whether the indexing system is consistent and will work as expected in every xml file. Meaning that it will return the elements in the order they where written in file for example. My xml files is expected to have the same order of elements. In other case a check on obj[4][0].tag should be applied to verify I am working on the expected element.
I think the indexing system is consistent. But accessing elements by index can be confusing and easy to get wrong.My suggestion is to use findtext().
