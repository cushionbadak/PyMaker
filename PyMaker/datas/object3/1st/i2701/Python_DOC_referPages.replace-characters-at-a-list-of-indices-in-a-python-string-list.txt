I have a dictionary as follows:I want to change the string stored as the value of the dictionary for key 's' at positions 4, 6, 7 and 10 to h, k, p and r. The way I can think about it is in a loop: Output: This works fine but my actual s_dict file is about 1.5 Gb. Is there a faster way of replacing a list of characters at specific indices in a string or list?Thanks! 
Here is my take on your interesting problem:
as an option of solution you can use s_dict['s'] = '%s%s%s' % (s_dict['s'][:pos], char, s_dict['s'][pos+1:]) instead of do list and join
