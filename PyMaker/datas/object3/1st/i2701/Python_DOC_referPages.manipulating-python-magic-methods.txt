I have more of a background with data science libraries or calling methods and attributes from classes. I am experimenting with manipulating magic methods. I am having a difficult time getting bool types and returning their opposites. I did something with str and datetime objects that worked but can't seem to to the same with __cmp__, __lt__, __eq__ or `gt'. Here is my code:This prints the following:As you can see, the results are the same as not using the class at all. I added an __init__ method to print using Opposite and it only prints that if I instantiate the object with something like a = Opposite().I would like to enter something like a > b, a < b, or a == b, and return the opposite boolean value, True, or False, as an exercise. I tried several things such as placing the methods under the __init__ method I created, which didn't work either. I read on this and still don't quite understand how to do this with booleans, integers and floats for that matter. The way the methods are above is how I was able to turn datetime objects into strings with __add__, __radd__ and __rsub__ methods.Thank you for your help. EDITThanks to your help, I have a better understanding and have completed my small experiment with this code:This prints the following:
If you mean that you want to return the negation of the boolean resulting from the comparison you could do something likeNote that in the comparison self._x < other._x you are using the __lt__ method of the int class.
