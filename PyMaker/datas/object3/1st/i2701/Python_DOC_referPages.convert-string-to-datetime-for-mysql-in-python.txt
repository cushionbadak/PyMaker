I want to convert my date into DateTime object for MySQL.My string format is: Mon Aug 27 04:47:45 +0000 2018Expected Output: 'YYYY-M-D H:mm:ss'
Refer section 8.1.8here
If you are using python 3, this solution would work -But for python 2, you might get a ValueError: 'z' is a bad directive.... In that case, you'll either have to use something like pytz or dateutil. The table that you need to look for all these conversions can be found here Edit: You can't have Expected Output: 'YYYY-M-D H:mm:ss' if you convert your datetime string to datetime object. Datetime object has it's own format. Above gives you a string of the format that you want
You can use date_as_dt_object in a raw query or an ORM. If used in a raw query pass it as a string like:Check out this list for Python's strftime directives. http://strftime.org/
