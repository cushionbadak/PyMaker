Natural Text
Hi i am trying to create a function to count the word occurence in a list of text to produce the result as ['a','1'], ['b' ,'4'] , ['c' , '5']......this is what i tried to do but its not working and i have not learn the count function yet.Am i on the right track or is there another way?  Edited : Im trying to figure out how do i use the function call in the way that word_frequency(word_list,3) will give me the top 3 word occurence like ['c','3'],['b' , '2'] , ['a' , '1']. Any help or input will be appreciated!
Maybe try dictionary.
I am on mobile so I can't check but I believe you've names the wrong list when checking for the occurrence in your result list:Correction:
As suggested by gilch we can use Collection.Counter and split to make list
This pairs them using tuples, which is probably fine for your purposes, but if you want them as lists of strings, And if you prefer them alphabetical instead of in frequency order,
