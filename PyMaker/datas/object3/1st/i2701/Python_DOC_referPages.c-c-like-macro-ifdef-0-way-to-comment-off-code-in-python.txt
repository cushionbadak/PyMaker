In C/C++, using the macro like below to comment huge blocks of code is common.Is there an equivalent way to comment off blocks of code in python?
Is there an equivalent way to comment off blocks of code in python?No. Python has no preprocessor, and its translation phases are different of those from C. Please refer to Python's documentation.I recommend simply appending some #- string in front of every useless line (and also use some version control system like git to keep older versions; then you might not even need to comment out big code chunks, since they are kept by your version control system). Good editors (like emacs) have facilities (like its rectangle operations) to easily adding a string in front of many lines.BTW, commenting out (or #if 0-ing it) a large piece of code is bad practice (even in C or C++), it makes your code unreadable. So don't do that!If you use git, adding a small comment like is IMHO much better than keeping and commenting out hundreds of useless source code lines, and that is why I think that commenting out many lines of code is almost always a mistake.
