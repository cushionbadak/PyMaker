I was reading python dunder method and came across that the we can have our own definition for built-in method like len(object)So I created a class otherclass which has definitionAnd it does print len of the object and further inspecting I also found len dunder method is available in otherclass object using dir    I am wondering how python display the value for dir(object) as there is no dir dunder method in the result of dir(otherclass)
I mean for me (python 3.6) dir(otherclass) prints The iteresting one is __dict__. So this holds all the methods/attributes specific to that object. However, where do all the others come from? Well, from the superclass:object.__dict__So dir looks for a __dir__ method, then looks at __dict__ (or __slots__) and then recursively looks up the method resolution order (available as otherclass.mro()) at each class in turn.
The answer is in the Python Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dirIf the object does not provide __dir__(), the function tries its best to gather information from the objectâ€™s __dict__ attribute, if defined, and from its type object. 
dir is a built-in function. When it is passed an object it uses the object's __dict__ (if defined) and its corresponding type object to attempt to display attributes.Note that built-in dir can result in strange outputs if __getattr__ has been overridden in the object.Read more:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dirAddressing comment:Apologies, I don't have enough reputation to comment.All objects in Python implicitly have a bunch of special attributes, one of these is the __dict__ attribute. In Python, classes are objects too. Therefore your otherclass class already has a __dict__. In your code, try:In the output you'll see some of the output corresponds to the output of the dir call.Edit 2:Like I said, classes are objects in Python. They implicitly have all of the methods objects have. Try:and you'll find dir in there.
