I am new to python so please excuse me if I am asking something simple. I am experimenting with the import function. I would like to know if import a module,  can I make classes from that module. Here is my code for the module:and here is my code for the script which I want to import my module:I keep getting: NameError: name 'Parent' is not definedAgain, excuse me if I am getting it all wrong but why cant I simply create a class from the module I just imported?
With import test, only the name test is made available in your script, and you can refer to Parent as test.Parent.If you want to refer to your class simply by its name Parent, you should use from test import Parent.
