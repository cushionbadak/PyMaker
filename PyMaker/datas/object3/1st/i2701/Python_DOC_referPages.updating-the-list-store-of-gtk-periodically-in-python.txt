I'm new at phyton programming and developing gui interface has gtk framework and serial port. It has a treeview whose liststore model. I could the insert new rows easily. I'm using the serialport recive callback in different thread from main gui thread avoid to not miss any data. After the received a new data, it should update the treeview. However, since the serialport is in different thread, I don't know how to update the list. Please help me to do this.the gui class:the serial port class:
I believe that your problem is more related to threading + GUI, than GTK.  As far as I know, when you modify the liststore that is the model for the treeview, the latter should be updated instantly. So, there should be no problem there.  A fundamental principle when working with threads and a GUI, is that you should only update the GUI from within its own thread (main loop). So what you need to do, is have your worker thread (serial port connection thread) send the update to the main GUI thread and let it update the treeview. The update can be scheduled with the GLib.idle_add function to let GTK do it when most convenient.  Now, to communicate between threads, you could use the queue module.  I don't quite understand your code. So I'll write a simple example (using gtk3 PyGObject, since you didn't specify).  I hope this helps.
