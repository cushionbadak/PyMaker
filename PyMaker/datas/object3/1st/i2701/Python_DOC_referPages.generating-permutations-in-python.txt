I want to implement a function, generate_perm(m,n), where it takes two arguments, one is for numbers to permutate (m) and second is to what the sum of the permutation must equate to (n).generate_perm(2,5) should outputandgenerate_perm(3,5) should output:EDITi havent gotten far
One simple recursive approach without any libraries:
Consider a list l = [1,2,3,4,5]You can get all the permutations with itertools.permutationsand then filter themoutputs Looking at the second example you give, I think what you want is a product, not permutations:and which works also for the first case.
