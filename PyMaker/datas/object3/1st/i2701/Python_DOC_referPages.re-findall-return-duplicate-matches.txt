I construct such a pattern objectI tried:It return double matches.If I keep the enclosing (),How could avoid the duplicate?
Remove the extra set of parenthesis from the regex:YieldsYou were getting a list of tuples because, as the findall documentation states:If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group.So, if you want a group but don't want a capture group use (?:PATTERN) instead of just (PATTERN) as noted in the regular expression documentation.
