I have this following list of integers:What would be an efficient way to multiply elements of each subset of consecutive integers? To clarify further, I would need the output to include the results of the following multiplications: 2*3 , 3*5, 2*3*5, 13*17*19, 7*11*13*17*19, 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19*23 and all other possible combinations of consecutive primes. The output should NOT include 2*5 or 5*7*13 etc. 
You can do this using itertools.accumulate.outputOr if you want the results sorted in numerical order:output
