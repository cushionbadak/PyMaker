I'm working on a script that uses zfill to add leading zeros to numbers matched from a regular expression in Python 3. Here's my code:The output I expect is for the first number to be padded to two characters in width and the second number to be padded out to three characters. For example:Instead, I'm getting:Why is there one less zero than expected?
You're zfilling the constants used for your back-reference which are two characters already (\ and an int), leaving no space for an extra zero for the first character, and just one space for the second character.You can instead pass a function as your replacement to re.sub and do the zfilling in there:The zfilling is now done at replacement time, not before, as in your code.
