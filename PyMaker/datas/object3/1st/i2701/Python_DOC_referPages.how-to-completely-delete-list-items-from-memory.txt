I need a way to completely delete list items from memory.The point is that even if an object is in more than one list, when I delete it it will no longer be available in any list and it will be completely deleted from memory.I tried del, but it doesn't work:but the value of a [1] is still in memory and b != NoneHow do I delete it completely from memory?
In Python, assignment operator binds the result of the right-hand side expression to the name from the left-hand side expression.So when you define thisa is an object and the b is another object. When you are defining b = a[1] it gives the same reference since the values are the same. but when you are deleting the a[1] simply it disconnect the connection between the a[1] and the value. but still, b is connected to that value so it remains.Link that visualizes evverything
