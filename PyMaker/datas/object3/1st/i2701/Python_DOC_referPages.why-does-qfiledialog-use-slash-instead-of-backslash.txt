Why "\" and "/" are mixed?os.getcwd() emits backslash string.On the other hand, QFileDialog emits forward slash string.Why?ExamplePlease execute this sample code.Result (on my occasion)from os.getcwd(): J:\from QFileDialog: C:/Users/******/setup.py
This is because QFileDialog uses forward slashes regardless of OS. This makes it easier to write path handling code.You can use os.path.normpath to converts forward slashes to backward slashes in a path on Windows.
