So I wanted to write this:But this way:How should I write it in a proper way?
or is a boolean operator. It calls bool over the left argument and see if the result is True and if it is it returns the left argument, otherwise it returns the right argument, so you cannot do x % (1 or 2 or 3) because this evaluates to just x % 1 since 1 or 2 or 3 == 1:Whenever you have multiple conditions you can try to reduce them using any or all.We have that any([a,b,c,d]) is equivalent to a or b or c or d while all([a,b,c,d]) is equivalent to a and b and c and d except that they always return True or False.So for example:Equivalently (since 0 if the only false number the == 0 is equivalent to not):Equivalently:Keep in mind that (de Morgan law: not a or not b == not (a and b)):Note that using a generator expression makes any and all short-circuit so not all conditions are evaluated. See the difference between:And:In the last example the 1/0 is evaluated before calling any.
