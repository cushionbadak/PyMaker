I am using tastypie_mongoengine for the REST Api in Django.models.pyapi.pyI am getting the following error : How do I resolve this issue?
Well, from Django 1.9 onwards, SortedDict has been removed. Check this link for reference.SortedDict is deprecated as of Django 1.7 and will be removed in Django 1.9. Use ​collections.OrderedDict instead. Available in Python 2.7 and 3.1+You can replace SortedDict with ​collections.OrderedDict as mentioned in the link by making changes to the library code and some other changes as given in this Pull Request submitted here. But fair warning, this might not work as the Pull Request was not accepted so far and has failed the build test.Another option is to downgrade Django to either version 1.8 or 1.7 till django-tastypie-mongoengine can release a stable version which will work for Django 1.9.
