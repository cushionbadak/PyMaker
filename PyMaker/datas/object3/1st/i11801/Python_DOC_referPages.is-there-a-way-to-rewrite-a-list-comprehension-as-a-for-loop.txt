I have a line of code like this:I remember my teacher saying that we should start new lines when there is 'for'so, is there a way to write this code that looks like:or something else?
You mean to extract a boring old regular for loop from a list-comprehension?Becomes:This would be useful if you wanted to add exception handling, logging, or more complex functions or behaviors while you iterate over your data.For instance:But generally speaking the list-comprehension is a totally legitimate way to write that.
You have to create the empty list first, and then append for each iteration.
That list comprehension would translate to:
Little bit dirty, but a good alternative for splitting collection to subcollections of a fixed size.
Do not use len(iterable) in the while dealing with indices. Use enumerate() for that. It yields (index, item). This is efficient and pythonic. The idea that you should make a newline while using for loop is probably idiomatic to some other language, C, C++ e.g. But not in python. List comprehensions come fro the Haskell world of FP. So that's elegant as they come.
