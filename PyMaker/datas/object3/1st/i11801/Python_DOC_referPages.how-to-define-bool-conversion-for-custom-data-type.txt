Natural Text
I'm extending Python with a new type, and looking New Types section of Python manual I don't see anything for bool conversion. How do I specify how my type is converted to a bool?For instance in the example below native numpy type to is interpreted as Python bool somehowLooking at bytecode, this corresponds to POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE but this doesn't seem useful for tracking down the conversion logic.
In the Python documentation, under Special Method Names, you can see that the .__bool__() method does exactly this.If you are still stuck on Python 2.x (condolences!) then the method name is __nonzero__ instead of __bool__.
