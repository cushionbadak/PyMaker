I have installed the 'script' package and launch atom editor in terminal.I imported 'numpy' and 'pandas' like this,the autocompleting works.When I ran it by CMD+I ,'numpy' was successfully imported but 'pandas' failed:I can run this scrip in python3.5 shell.So I've surely installed 'pandas'.When I import other libs it shows the same error.How can I fix it?OS X 10.11
please make sure that the module pandas does exist in the search path sys.path.
just found an alternative solution for the cited problem, see[How to fix Python Numpy/Pandas installation?User sjs wrote:If you're like me and you don't like the idea of deleting things that  were part of the standard system installation (which others have  suggested) then you might like the solution I ended up using:Get Homebrew - it's a one-line shell script to install!Edit your .profile, or whatever is appropriate, and put /usr/local/bin at the start of your PATH so that Homebrew binaries are  found before system binariesbrew install python - this installs a newer version of python in /usr/localpip install pandasThis worked for me in OS X 10.8.2, and I can't see any reason it  shouldn't work in 10.6.8.I had the problem that atom-runner within atom editor did not recognize pandas after installing it via pip. This is obviously a consequence of using Homebrew in combination with bash and python.For my case, I edited .bash_profile and changed PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:${PATH}" to PATH="/usr/local/bin/python3:${PATH}", and exported this path.After, I reinstalled pandas using pip install pandas, and rerun the .py script that contained import pandas as pd without any problems in atom.
