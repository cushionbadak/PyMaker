To run a command in python, for Windows, I do:where lsCommand is a list of strings that make up the bash command.  This works, except when it contains some input with spaces in it.  For example, copying + changing a name:  To try and do cp "test 123" test123:fails because it thinks I am trying to do cp "test" "123" test123.  Error (doing google storage stuff):  Then I try  Same shit.  Any ideas?
cp is not an internal command and therefore you don't need shell=True (though you might need to specify a full path to cp.exe).The internal interface for starting a new subprocess on Windows uses a string i.e., it is up to the specific application how to interpret a command-line. The default MS C runtime rules (imlemented in subprocess.list2cmdline() that is called implicitly if you pass a list on Windows) should work fine in this case:If you want to use shell=True then the program that interprets the command line is cmd.exe and you should use its escape rules (e.g., ^ is a meta-character) and pass the command as a string as is (as you see it in the Windows console):Obviously, you don't need to start an external process, to copy a file in Python:
for Ubuntu:for Windows:Thanks for info that I don't need shell=True.
