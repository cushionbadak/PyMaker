In Python, how would I get a certain number of characters around a substring?For example, here's my string:Let's say I wanted to add four characters away from 'ax: Fur', on both sides, into the output, so it would be 'ad Max: Fury Ro'.If the substring to look for was 'Fury Road' in string, then the output would be 'ax: Fury Road', and it would ignore that there's nothing to add on the right side.
str.partition comes in really handy here:You could also just return before in the if statement instead of raising a ValueError.  That would return the string unchanged.  Usage:
you could also get the string before and after the substring with .split() then return parts of both:it is worth noting that in this case if sub is not actually a substring then the first line will raise a ValueErrorbut you can get the exact indexes for splitting it up like this:In this case string.index(sub) will raise a ValueError if sub is not in string.
