I am attempting to insert the string '**" in between values in a set. As well as eliminating the {} in the print of my set.Thank you in advance for all help/advice.My output is supposed to look like:My current code is:And my current output is:
You could just use str.join method in order to create a string of an iterable of strings with specified separator between items:Note, that str.join accepts an iterable of strings, so you have to convert each number to string using map(str, s).In order to add ** at the end of the string, you could just use + as string concatenation operator:You should also note, that the order of set elements is not specified. In order to print the elements in the ascending order, you should manually sort them:
What I get is that you're trying to print a delimited sequence. You can use the str join method and the map function to solve this. Map is converting each element inside of your set to a string equivalent value. The join method returns a string where the elements of a sequence have been joined together with some str separator. You can use + to add the final ** to the end of your string.
You could use a for loop that iterates through random_set and then appends all of the items into a list, then print the list joined with '**':This would print it in the format you want.
