I'm new to Python and in the process of rewriting an old Python script, I came across these lines:Does this check if value1 and value2 are in the list?I googled how to do that and the answers show different approaches, and I didn't see any suggesting using the above code. Is this doing something else? Should I keep it or change it?
(value1, value2) is a tuple.  Your check is seeing if that tuple is in the list.  For example:If you want to see if every item in the tuple is in the list, use all() as mentioned by @apero:
You could use all:all evaluates to True only when all the values match the condition, in this case "being in the list". This is a really useful builtin method because it will stop evaluating as soon as 1 of the values does not match the condition. This technique is called short-circuit evaluation.It behaves like if <test> and <test1> and <test2> .... : which evaluates each test one by one, from left to right and returns False as soon as one of the test doesn't pass.
Another one, using sets:
if you want to check if any of the values are in the list:what you are doing now is checking if the tuple is in the list
