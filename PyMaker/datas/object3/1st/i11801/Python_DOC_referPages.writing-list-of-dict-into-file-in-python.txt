Natural Text
I am having trouble in dynamically mapping the dictionary values while writing the db output into a file. Scenario:I am trying to do like below.Any Suggestion!
Here's a way to write out the data using a dynamic list of headers:
You're writing delimited text, so you should be using the csv module. It happens to have a DictWriter object that is perfect for this.
Use python pandas.OUTPUT: mytables.csv|C1|C2|C30|1|2|31|4|5|6
