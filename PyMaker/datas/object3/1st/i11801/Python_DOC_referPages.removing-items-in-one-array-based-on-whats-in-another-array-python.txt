I'm trying to make a function that removes items from all_cards based on whats in the iss_answer array.  My iss_answer array will change often in my program so I can't just type all_cards.remove('Professor Plum','Dinning Room','Rope').
Why not fast list comprehension- Just change the word case to match both list if needed and strip leading and trailing spaces after all use list comprehension.Output-But if you do not need to maintain order, since a set is an unordered data structure, of the element in output list you can use answers  as @bakkal and @Saif Asif  mentioned.
