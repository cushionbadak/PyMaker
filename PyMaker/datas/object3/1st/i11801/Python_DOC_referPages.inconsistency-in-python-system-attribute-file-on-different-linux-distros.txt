I am dealing with weird problem. Consider this simple code: now when I run this code on my laptop, where I have Fedora 23 OS, the output is: running the same code on Ubuntu 15.10:can anybody explain me why? Am I missing something? 
You probably don't want to purely rely on the __file__ attribute, but you ensure you have a full path abspath:
__file__ is defined by the argument given to Python that tells it what your file is.  For example, let's say you are in a folder called Here.  You could say python ../Here/here.py, and __file__ would be ../Here/here.py.  If you ran the same file with just python here.py, __file__ is here.py.  When you run the Python file in the same directory without using either an absolute path or a weird relative path, the file will not have any directories mentioned.  That means that os.dirname(__file__) will be blank.  If you want, you can get the absolute path with os.path.abspath().
