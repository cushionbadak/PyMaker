I can't figure out how to transfer str to bytes in Python 3.This is the client code:This is the error I get:
This is because ":" is an str (string) object. You could just do b':':but you might find it simpler if you used str.format().encode() 
In the lines.sendto(alias.encode() + ": " + message.encode(), server.encode())": ", which is a string, is being concatenated with two bytestrings (we know they're bytestrings because .encode() is called on them.  This is an error in Python3, but it can be fixed by calling .encode() on the string.The second parameter to Socket.sendto should be an address.  The exact type of the address depends on the socket's family.  In this case you have correctly defined address as a tuple (server = ('127.0.0.1',5000)), but you are erroneously calling .encode() on it.Try changing the line to:s.sendto(alias.encode() + ": ".encode() + message.encode(), server)and the error will be fixed.
