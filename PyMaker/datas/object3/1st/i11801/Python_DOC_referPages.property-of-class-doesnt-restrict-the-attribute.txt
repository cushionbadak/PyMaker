So i made a class and want, that attribute hp stays always between 0 and maxhpIn theory making hp a property should give me the wished result: Somehow it doesnt work though.Is there way to link attributes for and back? So i have stored the position of the unit class object. At 2 places, once the attribute position which contains a [x,y] array and the other time its stored in 2 attributes x and y and each contains a int. Changing self.x or self.y should changes self.position and the other way around too.
In your __init__, the line self.hp = self.maxhp should be self.__hp = self.maxhp. That way it's only set/get in the @property methods.You would handle postion, x and y the same way as you've done for hp. Use _postion, _x and _y internally to correspond to the values in the getters and setters; and set all of the _prop values in the setters of each. Using position as a an example:Similarly for x and y, though I think you should only do it via position:Btw, the hp setter can be re-written as follows:
Another problem is in hp.setter. The second if statement should be replaced with elif because when hp is less than 0, self.__hp is set to 0 in first if and then, without elif, it is set to a negative value in else:
