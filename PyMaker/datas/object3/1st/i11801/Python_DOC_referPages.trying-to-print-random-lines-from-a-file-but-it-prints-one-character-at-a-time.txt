This is probably something so simple. I'm scripting something to print random lines from a file but it prints one character at a time. Here is the code.Any help is definitely appreciated. I'm a beginner so it honestly is probably something simple.
The problem here is that random.choice will return a string. And in effect you are iterating over a string. What you should do is call split() after you call random.choice so you end up with a list of words instead of a string. Then your iteration will work as expected.Also, you really should not iterate like this:Change your iterator: Also, it would be good practice to get used to using context managers when handling files. e.g.:So, your final solution would look like:
random.choice will return only on element at a time, you have to use shuffle instead:
A couple things, first thing is readability:Now, Will just give you a random line in the file, it won't give you all the lines in a random order.You can shuffle the array with a simple callYou can also keep randomly taking items out of the array until it is emptyThis answer may be helpful: randomly selecting from array
