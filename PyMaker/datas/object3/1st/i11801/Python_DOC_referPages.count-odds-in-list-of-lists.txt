What would be the shortest way to count the number of odd numbers in a list of lists like this with arbitrary dimensions, not necessarily 5x5:I tried, but i'd guess there's shorter:
If you always have one level of flat lists inside the main list you can use an inner loop to flatten, summing the result of  each i % 2 which will be 1 for odd and 0 for even numbers:Or use itertools.chain to do the flattening:If you had arbitrary nesting, recursion would be an easy way to approach the problem:
The numpy way of counting for a contrast:l[l%2!=0] returns all the elements that satisfy the condition l%2!=0 and len() counts it.PS : This of course assumes that the list_of_lists is rectangular. For a solution that allows different length for each inner-list, see Padraic's answer.
