It's possible to slice a python list like this:However, when passing the index as a string, an error is thrown:How can I specify a list index as a string? What data type is 0:1 in list[0:1], really?
n:m is syntactic sugar for a slice. You could split your index string, convert its parts to integers, and create a slice from those.Works just the same with three parts:If you want to allow for "blank" parts, the conversion gets a little bit more involved:
Why not just convert your slicing string into integers by splitting on :, and then using them as slicing indices.
You can use exec() for this.The print is needed only to see the output. You can assign it to a variable and call the variable afterwards instead.
