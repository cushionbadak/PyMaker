I can't understand why the following code does not produce my debug message even though effective level is appropriate (output is just 10)while when I add this line after the import: logging.debug("Start...")it produces following output:so even though "Start..." is not shown, it starts to log. Why?It's on Python 3.5. Thanks
The top-level logging.debug(..) call calls the logging.basicConfig() function for you if no handlers have been configured yet on the root logger.Because using a call to logging.getLogger().debug() does not trigger that call, you don't see any output because there are no handlers to show the output on.The Python 3 version of logger does have a logging.lastResort handler, used for when no logging configuration exists, but this handler is configured to only show messages of level WARNING and up, which is why you see your ERROR level message (10) printed to STDERR, but not your DEBUG level message. In Python 2 you would get the message No handlers could be found for logger "root" printed instead, just once for the first attempt to log anything. I'd not rely on the lastResort handler however; instead properly configure your logging hierarchy with a decent handler configured for your own needs.Either call logging.basicConfig() yourself, or manually add a handler on the root logger:The above basically does the same thing as a logging.basicConfig() call with no further arguments. The StreamHandler() created this way logs to STDERR and does not further filter on the message level. Note that a logging.basicConfig() call can also set the logging level for you.
The root logger(default logger, top level) and all other logger's default log level is warning(order 3) in all 5 log levels: debug < info < warning < error < fatal in order. So at your first logging.debug('starting...'), you haven't set the root log level to debug as following code and you can't get the starting...output. see python logging HOW TO for detail
