I have a dictionary, with a name as a key and a list containing scores as the value.I'm trying to sort the lists in the values and then sort the whole dictionary by the values - making it so it's sorted by the highest score.Here's the dictionary:I'm trying to use code I'v found from other places of stackoverflow, but I've not found a question specific to this yet.I'm probably making a mountain out of a molehill with this, but I am genuinely stumped.
Just itemgetter(1) will not do the sorting.  You need to write your own key for this:Here is a helpful tutorial for sorting dictionaries by keys/values that was recommended by spectre-d
