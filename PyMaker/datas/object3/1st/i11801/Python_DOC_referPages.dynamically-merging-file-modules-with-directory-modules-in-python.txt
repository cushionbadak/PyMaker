Given a directory with the following structure:and the following file contents:foo.pyfoo/bar.pyfoo/bar/baz.pyI would love to be able to do all of these things from some other file:i.e. as if the definitions in each file were "merged" with the module definitions comprising the directory with the same name. How can I accomplish this in a dynamic way (whether involving __init__.py or otherwise) that won't require me to manually specify each path?When I place empty __init__.py files in each directory and attempt to perform the above imports, I receive the following error:which seems to me to suggest that the foo.py file has been overridden by the foo directory so that the definitions in foo.py are not visible.
try doing:with the folder structure you show I'd expect the result to be something like:But when you add an __init__.py to the foo folder it would instead be:with python packages you cannot actually import a folder so what ends up happening is that you import the __init__.py file from that folder instead of the foo.py so all you need to do is move the foo.py into the folder and rename it to __init__.py and you can then import foo or from foo import Foo the same way as you have it set up now.
