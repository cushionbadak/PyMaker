Natural Text
I have a string - a sample would be the below:I want to pull the IP address out of it but not the last octet. I want to pull 192.168.1. out of it so it can used later.I think I need to use split, but am not sure on how to achieve this.
Simply use split().
You can use Regular Expressions.EDIT: Changed from match() to search() since match() only looks at the beginning of the string.Also, assuming you want to do this for more than one string, you can use the findall() function, instead, which will return a list of all the matching groups of your regular expression.
