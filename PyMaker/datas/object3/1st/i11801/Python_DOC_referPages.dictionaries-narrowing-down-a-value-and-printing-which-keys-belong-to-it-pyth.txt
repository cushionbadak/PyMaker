I know that in order to get a value you can just do : d[k] or d.get(k) etc. I'm looking for an output the following for this:
You'll want to iterate through (key, value) pairs, accumulate matches to a list and then return that list.A list comprehension gets the job done nicely:

You can also inverse your dictionary with :and then
