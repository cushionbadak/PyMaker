I have a dataset with two Boolean arrays. The first boolean array indicates which data points have an error attached to them and is used to specify whether or not to turn on the error in an MCMC routine. The second array indicates whether or not each data point has a measured length. How can I index the Boolean_error array by the Has_length array, so that I will have a list comprised of objects with Has_length == True with either Boolean_error == True or Boolean_error == False?Here's an example of what I'm trying to do:
Here you go. That does exactly what you need.The zip() function takes 1 value from each iterable every time, and the list comprehension filters out the false Has_length, and takes the Boolean_error for those that are True.Another, more efficient approach would be to use itertools.compress() like so:
You could just write a function to do this.
