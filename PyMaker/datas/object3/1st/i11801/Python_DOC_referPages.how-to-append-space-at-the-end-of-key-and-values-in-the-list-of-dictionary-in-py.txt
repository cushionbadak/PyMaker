I want to append space at the end of each key and value in the list of dictionary. I know this sounds odd but i have a requirement which need this kind of list of dictionaries. Any suggestions!Example:So here i need to append 10 space at the end of key and its value.also my list of dict always varies so my_list and position_list will change every time, so no way i can hard code the keys and the space specified. 
You can simply do this:This outputs:EDIT:If you want your keys and your values to have the same spacing, simply use this (positions[k] instead of postions[v]).
I don't know why you need this. It violates PEP 0008Anyway one way to do this is using using the str.format() method to format your key/value pairs. But first you will need to convert your "position_list" to a regular dict. Then iterate over the list of your dicts and format the items.
