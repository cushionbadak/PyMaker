this code will do this:now func(1) = -1/2what if I want to modify g(x) (and not f(x)) so that is there a way to do this?thank you Edit: f(x) can be any function that possibly returns a negative number 
You are looking for a function wrapping another function. This can be done in Python using decorators.Given your function f(x), let's say you'd like to receive the negative function value. And f(x) might be any function with any number of arguments. And possibly you don't really know f(x) at all.Python's standard library comes with functools.wraps, which can be really handy in this case:Now the function g(func) returns a wrapper wrapping func post-processing its output:This works with any function func with any number of positional or keyword arguments.

for a generic application :f(1) is now  0.5.  You change the return value without changing the body neither the name.
