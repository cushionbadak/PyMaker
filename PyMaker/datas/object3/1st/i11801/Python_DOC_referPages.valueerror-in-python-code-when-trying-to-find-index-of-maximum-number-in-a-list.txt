Given a list of length n, I need to find the index of the biggest number in the list in a time complexity of O(log(n)) without using python's inbuilt max method. Below is my attempt, however I get the erroron the linewhen I run my code. Feedback on my code and alternative solutions would be appreciated.
You can simplify your function find_max_number a bit:Alternatively, you can go for the index directly:
Just use Python's max instead to find the greatest number in the list, then use .index() like you were to get the index.CodeOutIf your not allowed to use max:Initialize greatest_num to n[0] to cases where max < 0. This works by going through each element in the list, testing if it greater than the current greatest number, and if it is it sets the greatest number to the current number.
