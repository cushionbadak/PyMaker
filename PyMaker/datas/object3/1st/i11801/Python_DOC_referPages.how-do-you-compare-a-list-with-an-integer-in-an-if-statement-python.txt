I am trying to minus 5 for every index in the list that is over 20. Thank you for your help :)
Use a list comprehension to build a new list with the changes applied to all values over 20:The expression v - 5 if v > 20 else v uses a conditional expression to produce either v itself, or v minus 5 subtracted if it is greater than 20.Demo:You don't really need to test beforehand; a test to see if there are any values over 20 in the list would require a full traverse of the list anyway; the list comprehension would produce a copy of the list with no changes made if there are no values over 20.If you must test, use the any() function with a generator expression; this at least then aborts iteration when one such value is found:
You apply a list comprehension an subtract five from every element for which the condition that it is larger than twenty is true.This is equivalent to, but a little faster than:
You can use a for loop and enumerate to do this.Using list comprehension:If you want to create a new list:
