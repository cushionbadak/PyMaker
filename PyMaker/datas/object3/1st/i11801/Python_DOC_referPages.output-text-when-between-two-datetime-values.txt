Natural Text
I am making a program that determines what period in school you are in; the schedules differ on certain days so you can just run the program instead of finding out what schedule you are on. I am using the 'DateTime' import; but the problem is certain classes may start at let's say 7:45 and end at 9:50. The way I am programming the two times contradict each-other so the text wont be displayed.here is the snippet of code:It was determined previously in the program that we are on schedule 'A' which starts at 7:45AM and ends at 9:50AM. In short I want it to display the message whilst in between those two times. 
Use datetime for this task:
you can try this:
As I commented your logic is off because you don't allow for minutes other than anything in the 45-50 range, your are using datetimes so stick to comparing datetimes.time's seeing if the hour and minute are within the range 7:45-9:50.
