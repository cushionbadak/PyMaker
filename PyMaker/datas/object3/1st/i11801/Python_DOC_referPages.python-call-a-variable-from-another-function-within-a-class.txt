I am very new to Python and OOP in general. I have a very easy question thou that just won't be working for me. I have a class with several functions.Why will this just tell me that it does not know a() or b()I guess I am missing some important basic knowledge.ThanksThe Actual I am refering to:So if use the prints it actually goes fine but when it gets to self.post_new_token() it runs all this function again.There is no error coming but if I use the prints to see whats happening I get it like this:Why is it printingagain?
You need to use self  if you want to call an instance method or access a name (instance variable) from  other instance methods.
Instead of:I would try:
Let's look at this case first:When you instantiate a class:And then try to see what a or b are:Notice - it says bound method of an instance of Test. These methods are bound to an instance - you can only use them with that instance. Incidentally, have you ever wondered what self was and why you always have to pass it in to instance methods of a class? Did you know you could rewrite your class like this (not recommended, always use self for this, just doing this to illustrate the point).And it would work the same way? If you also added print instance to a, like so:And tried printing out the method a and calling the method:This was just to illustrate the point that these methods are bound to an instance, and to use them you need to use that specific instance, thus:And when calling c you would again, use the instance - test_obj.c()
