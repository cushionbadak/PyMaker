I need to get an output like this, if possible using a single for loop.Is there an elegant way to do this ? For the context of my problem, I actually have two lists A = [1,2,3] and B = [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Note that list B is twice the length of list A. I need to create a new list by appending each element in list A with two consecutive elements in list B. So this should result in list `C = [(1,1),(1,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,5),(3,6)]
You can use itertools.chain and zip(A, A) to "duplify" A, then zip with B:


You are searching for the zip function to iterate two lists.
Yes, you can use zip(), i.e.:
