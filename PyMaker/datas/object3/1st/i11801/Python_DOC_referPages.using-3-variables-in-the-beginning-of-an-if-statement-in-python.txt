I have a web page that displays all of the accounts. Underneath it, I have the option where they can have the table highlight certain rows depending on the Balance column. My question is if I can create an if statement where the first line contains only variables (including the greater than, equal to, etc option).My original set up is that they would select from a drop down menu if they want >, >=, =, <=, or < and then the second part is they would put in the amount. I am guessing the if statement doesn't like that I have an option for them to select the operator.Here is the code for the form part of my web page:And here is the code for my function:I planned on importing my function page. I have tried adding the variables inside the function (def high_bal(opt,bal)) as well as trying onClick on the submit button and onSubmit on the form. I've also tried just making the form redirect to the function page and removing the function name so it is redirecting to a page that will go ahead and do the function without it being called.Screen shot of my web page design:Thank you for your time and help!
