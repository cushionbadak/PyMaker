Natural Text
I want to delete all the lines in a file smart.txt and then add some strings of my own. smart.txt contains alot of lines.I triedI am getting an errorcannot figure out because smart.txt is present in the same directory.Any suggestions?
You need to use 'smart.txt' instead of smart.txt when you're opening the file.So you would change f= open(smart.txt, 'r') to f= open('smart.txt', 'r').Also you should use with open('smart.txt', 'r') as f to automatically close the file when you are done with it.Tutorial on file io: link
