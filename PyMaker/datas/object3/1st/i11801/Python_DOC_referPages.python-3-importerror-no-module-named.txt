make sure your folder tests contains __init__.py Below code appends the path of your project project to sys.path in test.pypython will go through to search the modules and files in your project
Make sure project/ is in your PYTHONPATH, put and __init__.py file in the project/ directory and then you will be able to call from project.app.stamp import Timestamp.
