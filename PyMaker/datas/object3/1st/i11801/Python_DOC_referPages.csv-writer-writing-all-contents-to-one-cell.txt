EDIT: Solved thanks to @ayhan. If you are from Poland use semicolon instead of comma as a separator.I have a list of lists that looks like this:csv.writer writes each list into one cell instead to 3 separate ones.My code looks like this:I've also tried this method:And it also doesn't  work. My other issue is that each row is separated by an extra empty row and I don't know how to get rid of it. I know there has been similar questions but no solution is working for me.
You need to specify the newline to prevent the extra row from being added on each iteration. Also naming your variable list is a bad idea, since it's a built in type.
Slayer's code worked for me here is the US, but if I changed my Windows Region and Language settings to Poland it doesn't and I was finally able to reproduce your problem.According to @ayhan this is because of a bug in Excel where it expects ; to be the delimiter when reading and saving csv files in locales where , is used as the decimal separator (decimal mark) such as it is in Poland (and most of the rest of the world).Probably the easiest work-around is just specify the delimiter Excel expects in your region when you create the csv.writer object, as shown below:Contents of file.csv after running the script:Afterwards, if I open it in Microsoft Excel 2013, with my Windows Format and Location set to "Poland" in the Windows Region and Language control panel, I see the following (which is now correct):UpdateA way of doing it dynamically would be to have the script determine what delimiter to use based on the current locale settings and pick something different if there's a conflict â€” although hardcoding ; should work any place that doesn't use it as the decimal mark (and I'm not aware of one that does).Since we now know what was causing the issue, I would also take out the for loop Slayer introduced and go back to the version of your code that used writerows().
