When a user inputs a command using:Is it possible within python to make it so that the case in which they enter the command does not matter?eg:Can I make it so that if they enter "continue" (in lower case) this section of code will still work? Thanks in advance for responses!
I would suggest sticking with a single case when checking. So you should use "continue". Keep it all using a single case (in this case lower case), by using either lower() or upper() to control the casing, to ensure your conditions are matched exactly as you expect.
