I have created a while-loop (below) that accesses each element of the list and prints its square. Now, how would I change this program so that it replaces each element by it's square.  For example: If x = [2,4,2,6,8,10], then x would be changed to x = [4,16,4,36,4,64,100]
You can set it in the while loop:It isn't a good idea to use eval(), though.  You should use ast.literal_eval():
You would almost do the same thing, except with a for loop:You could also set it in the while loop:
List comprehensions are your friends.
