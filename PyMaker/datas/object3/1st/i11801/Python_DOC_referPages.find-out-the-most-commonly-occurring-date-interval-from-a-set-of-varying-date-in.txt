Natural Text
I have a CSV file with a column that has varying date ranges for a million records. For instance, I have something like this:2004-2016; 1980-2016; 1991-2006; 2000-2012; 1998 - 2011If I want to find out the 3, 5 or the 7 year range that is most common in all these records, how will I do this in Python? It doesn't matter if a few records are eliminated but I am trying to find out which 7 year frequency or a 10 year frequency is most common for all the ranges. Can someone help?
You can use a collections.defaultdict of collections.Counter to handle this. The defaultdict is used to group the date ranges by the number of years, and the Counter keeps track of the counts of range strings for that number of years:If you want to know the most common range string with year range 12:Not sure how you want to handle cases where there are multiple range strings representing the same year range with equivalent counts.
Parse file; get 2-element tuples: ((2004, 2016), (1980-2016), ...).Transform it to differences: (12, 36, ...).Create Counter object with this sequnce and call most_common method.
Split your sequence into individual ranges. Assuming you call the resulting sequence diff.
