In Python 2.7 I get the following results:In python 3.5 I get:So, OK I look at the Python docs and find out that in Python 3.5, files are of type io.IOBase (or some subclass). Leading me to this:But then when I try in Python 2.7:So at this point, I'm confused. Looking at the documentation, I feel as though Python 2.7 should report True.Obviously I'm missing something elementary, perhaps because it's 6:30 PM ET, but I have two related questions:Why does Python report False for isinstance(fin, io.IOBase)?Is there a way to test that a variable is an open file which will work in both Python 2.7 and 3.5?
From the linked documentation:Under Python 2.x, this is proposed as an alternative to the built-in file objectSo they are not the same in python 2.x.As to part 2, this works in python2 and 3, though not the prettiest thing in the world:
For python2For python3(Edit: my previous solution tested for io.TextIOWrapper, it worked only with files opened in text mode.  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#class-hierarchy which describes the python3 class hierarchy).
