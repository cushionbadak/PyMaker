I'm currently learning how to use subprocesses, for this (and some other) reasonsI've bought a book to learn how to work with subprocesses. It's a good bookand I'm not having troubles understanding it. In my book they start to explainhow to execute shell commands as subprocesses.I had a programming problem I had for ages, and with the subprocesses, I couldbe able to solve it but I need to execute a function callback as subprocess.I have this code to echo something but it's a shell command:I want this callback to be executed as a subprocess:I just tried out to execute this callback like this (it was a simple naive idea):but this gives me the following error:The strange thing is, that it does execute the callback, but then it raises this error!What did I do wrong?  Did I forget something?
the subprocess module is not suitable for executing python callbacks.  you want to look at the multiprocessing module instead.  the first few examples with Process and Pool seem to do what you want.
