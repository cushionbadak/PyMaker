I want to write a function which will find out the length of a list based on user input. I don't want to use the in-built function len(). PLease help me. Function which i have written is working for strings but for lists it is failing.
You probably need to initialize your variable j (here under renamed counter):This could also be done in one "pythonic" line using a generator expression, as zondo has pointed out:
It's quite simple:1 for char in string is a generator expression that generates a 1 for each character in the string.  We pass that generator to sum() which adds them all up.  The problem with what you had is that you didn't define j before you added to it.  You would need to put j = 0 before the loop.  There's another way that isn't as nice as what I put above:It works because reduce() calls the lambda function first with the initial argument, 0, and the first character in the string.  The lambda function returns its first argument, 0, plus one.  reduce() then calls the function again with the result, 1, and the next character in the string.  It continues like this until it has passed every character in the string.  The result: the length of the string.
