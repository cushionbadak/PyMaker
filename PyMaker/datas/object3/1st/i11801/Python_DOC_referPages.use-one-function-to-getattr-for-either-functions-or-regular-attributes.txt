I have the following code:This is because calling with "length()" didn't work (AttributeError, no attribute length())Is there a shorter, more maintainable way to make functions like this? Thank you.
Solution 1You can make length a property:If you really want to use your function:If you cannot change the source of thing directly, you can do after importing the class:Here:Solution 2Alternatively, you can check if the attribute is callable:
Decorate those methods with @property, which you feel should have semantics of data rather than a method.So this is a getter. There is also a setter @property.setter, where you can do t.length = somedata instead of something like t.set_length(somedata)
