I am rewriting a threaded process into a multiprocessing queue to attempt to speed up a large calculation. I have gotten it 95% of the way there, but I can't figure out how to signal when the Queue is empty using multiprocessing.My original code is something like this:And the queue function like this:My new code is somethings like this:And the new queue function:I have been reading the docs and Google, but can't figure out what I am missing - I know that task_done / join are not part of the multiprocessing Queue class, but it's not clear what I am supposed to use."They differ in that Queue lacks the task_done() and join() methods  introduced into Python 2.5â€™s Queue.Queue class." SourceBut without either of those, I'm not sure how the queue knows it is done, and how to continue on with the program.
Consider using a multiprocessing.Pool instead of managing workers manually. Pool handles dispatching tasks to workers, with convenient functions like map and apply, and supports .close and .join methods. Pool takes care of handling the queues between processes and processing the results. Here's how your code might look like using multiprocessing.Pool:
