so I've been trying to learn Python and I have this little app to conduct an English test. But I want to take the 'score' and put it into a file but not as a string but as an integer. Then I also want to take it out as one.Also along the way I sometimes will create files if the 'name' is new so I want to check if the file is empty and if so to put a 0 in there. Any tips?And of course if you have any other criticism I would be happy to hear it :)
It's likely easiest to just write it as a string and then read it back as a string:Later:However, if there's a reason you want to write it in binary (say to obfuscate the score a bit) there are many options. While it's definitely possible to say, write it using standard integer encoding, I typically just go with the pickle module if I want to serialize data:Later:I like this approach because it works for serializing any kind of data, not just integers. See this post for some leads on writing or reading in full binary, if that's what you truly seek:Reading a binary file with pythonFinally, since you asked for other feedback: if I were implementing this and I wasn't expecting a huge data set, I would just store all of the scores in a dictionary, then pickle and unpickle that dictionary to a single file as necessary.
If you want to persist the data, using a dict and pickling would be a good approach, you can use a single file and use the name to lookup the user, like your own approach though you will have problems if two users have the same name so you might want to think of how you would make each user choose a uniqe identifier:
