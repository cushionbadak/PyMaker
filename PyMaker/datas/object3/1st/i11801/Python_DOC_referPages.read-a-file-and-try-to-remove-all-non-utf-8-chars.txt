Natural Text
I am trying to read a file and convert the string to a UTF-8 string, in order to remove some non utf-8 chars in the file string,but I got the following error,Update: I tried the code as suggested by the answer,but it didn't eliminate the non utf-8 chars, so how to remove them? 
Remove the .decode('utf8') call. Your file data has already been decoded, because in Python 3 the open() call with text mode (the default) returned a file object that decodes the data to Unicode strings for you.You probably do want to add the encoding to the open() call to make this explicit. Otherwise Python uses a system default, and that may not be UTF-8:For example, on Windows, the default codec is almost certainly going to be wrong for UTF-8 data, but you won't see the problem until you try to read the text; you'd find your have a Mojibake as the UTF-8 data is decoded using CP1252 or a similar 8-bit codec.See the open() function documentation for further details.
