Ok, so I have Python code at the moment which does something like this:But what I actually want to do is check if the number is not in range. I've googled and had a look at the Python docs but I can't find anything. Any ideas?Additional data: When running this code:I get the following error:I also tried:Which returned the same error.
If your range has a step of one, it's performance-wise much faster to use:Than it would be to use the not method suggested by others:Proof:And this is not even taking into account the time spent on creating the range.
This seems work as well:Exact answer to the original question would be if not 1 <= plug < 5: I guess
Use:It will print given line whenever variable plug is out of range 1 to 5
value should type casting in integer, otherwise not in range gives strange result.
