This question already has an answer here:Taking String arguments for a function without quotes                    2 answers                I am trying to define a simple function which checks if what the user placed into the arguments equal the letter B (No reason. Just made it B.) This is my code:However, when using the above code, by typing in:  I get an error stating:  How would I go about to fix this without changing how the overall code works. I want to be able to make this code work by placing the letter into the argument (if that is possible).
You can't use a plain B as a value in Python. The syntax will always see that as a variable reference. Since you haven't ever assigned anything to the name B, you get a NameError exception.The str() function can only work on values; it'll work on an integer for example:You could create a string value with a string literal expression:Passing that to the str() function is a no-op (the same string value is returned again):but it'd make your function work nonetheless:Note that any method you'd use to get user input, would return a value anyway. The input() function for example, returns an object (value) of type str:You may want to read up on getting and validating user input, see Asking the user for input until they give a valid response
B is a name (the Python word for a variable); and 'B' is a string with one character.Since you didn't define B, Python is telling you that you are trying to pass a name that isn't defined.Note the quotes 'B' make a difference here. You need to pass a string, like this:You should read up on the string type.
