I was going through Google's Python instructions and it quotes: The commands above are the simplest way to run python programs. If the  "execute bit" is set on a .py file, it can be run by name without  having to type "python" first. Set the execute bit with the "chmod"  command like this:Where it proceeds to give me this code to run on my terminal: However when I type in ./hello.py, I get: So is this something to do with me using Python 3 when this could be a command for Python 2?  EDITI just realised that this can only be run on a Linux/Mac. How does one go about doing this on a Windows? 
You need to associate the file extension with Python properly. This should happen by default if you install system wide (which requires administrator privileges), but if you're using a third party distribution, it's not guaranteed, and it may require a reboot even so.For more details running Python on Windows, see the Python on Windows docs. It looks like if you omitted the launcher from your Python install, it won't have registered the file extensions; it may be worth reinstalling properly to fix that.Otherwise, if you can't get file extension associations working, just run:or starting with 3.3 and later, you can use:which lets you provide an argument to py.exe to change which installed version of Python to use (if desired).You wouldn't use ./hello.py on Windows at all, because that's the wrong directory separator (Windows sometimes allows forward slashes, but in DOS prompts, that looks like trying to launch a program named . with the switch /hello.py). You'd use plain hello.py (Windows always searches the current working directory) or .\hello.py if you want to be explicit.
Do you have a shebang as the first line in hello.py?something like:#!/usr/bin/env python3
