My query is to fetch each item in the list compare with the key of the dictionary and fetch its value.Code:The error I am facing is the element from the list is:which is not matching. Is there a way to do this?
give try-except a shot and bypass any mismatches without generating an error. Use the search functionality of dictionaries - myDictionary[KeyToSearchFor] ouputs the value, if any.output, notice no match on 'e'
Assuming your list being [["a","b"],..] and dictionary being {"a,b":val1,...}
