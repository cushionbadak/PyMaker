Natural Text
I am having some trouble in extracting data from a list of dicts based on the position defined in my configuration. Scenario:I am getting a list of dict from the vertica table (thru some method call) and I need to write those data (key as header and value as the data content) in the file, so that I can upload that file to sftp for some other purpose. ExampleMy configuration defined in such a way that "Table" data will start from 0 to 10, "Column" will start from 11 to 25 and then "DataType" will start from 25 to 35 in the file. Also if there is not enough data to fill the defined range then need to pad with space after the data till it reaches the specified field length. So I expect output like below. Here the list is dynamic in nature. I know I have to use seek(), but bit confused. Any Suggestions?
