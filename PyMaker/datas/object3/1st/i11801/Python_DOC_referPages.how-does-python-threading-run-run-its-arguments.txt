I have a python threading problem. I have been looking around for more than a day and it doesn't get any better, so I thought of asking for help. I use python3.4.The first question is what would be the difference between:and I'm using toBeProcessed +'/robots.txt' at some part in the code. If I used the above method, it doesn't give me errors -but it still doesn't work like it should, not all the threads does run. While if I used the below method it tells me it unsupported operand type(s) for +: '_thread._local' and 'str':Note that I do have this declaration toBeProcessed = threading.local().The second question is about the rest of the code, only two threads do the work, the rest of the thread -whatever was their number doesn't work.Full code:not url is initialized like this url = [] and this is how i run my threads,     myThread( spider, (url,maxPages) ).start
You are doing it wrong. You need can't concatenate an instance of local with string. You need to store an attribute on your local instance like this:Also you should consider to use super() in your __init__ method.
