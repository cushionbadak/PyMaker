I'm about a couple weeks into learning Python.With the guidance of user:' Lost' here on Stackoverflow I was able to figure out how to build a simple decoder program. He suggested a code and I changed a few things but what was important for me was that I understood what was happening. I understand 97% of this code except for the except: i += 1 line in the decode(). As of now the code works, but I want to understand that line.So basically this code unscrambles an encrypted word based on a specific criteria. You can enter this sample encrypted word to try it out. "0C1gA2uiT3hj3S" the answer should be "CATS"I tried replacing the except: i += 1 with a Value Error because I have never seen a Try/Except conditional that just had an operational and no Error clause. But replacing it with Value Error created a never ending loop. My question is what is the purpose of writing the except: i += 1 as it is.'Lost' if you're there could you answer this question. Sorry, about the old thread
The purpose is to advance i by one, skipping the current character in case the cast to int fails, i.e. if elist[i] is not a digit.
There are a couple of errors, than can occur inside the try-Block:i is out of index, because the while loop runs one index to far.elist[i] is not a number, which leads to an ValueErrori = i + int(elist[i]) + 1 gets to big, and the next index access leads also to an IndexErrorIn either way, the except-clause will ignore the next character. And the loop goes on.An correct implementation wouldn't need any exceptions:
