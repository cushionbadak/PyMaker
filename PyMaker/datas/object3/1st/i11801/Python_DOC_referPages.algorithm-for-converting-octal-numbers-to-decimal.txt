I have a list of octal numbers that I want to be converted to decimal. Here's my class with what I've done so far:I read in the numbers from a file, that works fine. But I don't think that my dec_convert() function actually works. It just keeps running and doesn't finish. It looks completely terrible and hard to read, so I was wondering if there was a simpler way of converting each octal number in the list to a decimal number?
Here is an easy solution that uses the built-in int() constructor rather your dec_convert() function.
Yes, you could use list comprehension:and with:The first code fragment is a simple list comprehension that calls self._convert_to_dec on all elements in `self.numberList. Not much magic there.The _convert_to_dec is more complicated: we first calculate the amount of digits and store it in n. Next we define a generator that enumerates over the characters and binds i to the corresponding index. The generator multiplies each element with the corresponding power of 8 and the digit. This is a generator, so no real list is constructed.By running this through sum we obtain the sum which is the requested result.Or as @TomKarzes says, you can use int with a given base (in this case 8.
