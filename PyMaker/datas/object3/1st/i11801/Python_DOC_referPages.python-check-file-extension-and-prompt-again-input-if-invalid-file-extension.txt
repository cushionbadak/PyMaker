problemDoing a while loop to validate file extension. If a file extension is not .exe or .bat, ask user input again. I am looking for a solution without using import endswith break functions.code
You don't need a loop[no breaks, no imports, almost no code...]As noted by ShadowRanger my code, that uses set notation for the membership test, is suboptimal for Python versions prior to 3.2.  For these older versions using a tuple avoids computing the set at runtime, each and every time the function is executed.
To follow Asking the user for input until they give a valid response and using os.path.splitext() to extract the file extension:Without break:Without break and without any imports:Without break and without any imports and without endswith():
