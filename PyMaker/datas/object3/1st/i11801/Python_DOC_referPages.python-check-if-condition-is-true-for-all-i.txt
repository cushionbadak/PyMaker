I would like to see if there is a Python equivalent to the mathematical concept of "for all" (cf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols), for example to check if some condition is True for all instances being evaluated.For example Assuming:I would like to check if each letter in 'piza' is in 'pizza', and conversely if each letter in 'pizza' is in 'piza'.Is there a way of achieving this with something such as a for loop?e.g. for letter in word1:
In the example problem you provided I'd just use set to check if a string contains each letter from another string:In a general case I'd use all as others suggested.
Using a generatorWe can use a generator coupled with Python's all to achieve this easily.Or ExpandedExpanding the one-liner makes it a little bit easier to see what is going on. The function continues until it has gone through all of the letters in word1 and checked to see if they are in word2. If the function finishes the for loop, it means that all of the letters in word1 are in word2, so it returns True. If one letter of word1 is not in word2, it returns False.Output
Non matching elements will be added to the generator making it non empty, so the condition fails
