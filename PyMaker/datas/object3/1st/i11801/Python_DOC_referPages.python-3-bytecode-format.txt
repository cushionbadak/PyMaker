Natural Text
I want to read a .pyc file. However, I cannot find any documentation on the format.The only one I found does not work for Python 3 (although it does for Python 2):marshal only consumes one byte: \x00, which indeed is not a valid first character for marshall (as a comparison, the first byte of Python 2 bytecode for the same empty module is c)So, how can I decode what comes after the header?
Try this. It worked a while back. They added another int32 in v3.
Have you looked at the dissembler?https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html
