I wrote a program with Qt and I embedded a .py file in it to do some work.On my computer which has the Python interpreter installed, the program can run correctly, but when I run it on my roommate's PC, which has NO Python interpreter installed, the program crashed. The part which is written with Qt runs well but when I push a button to call .py to do some work, the program crashes.I think the problem is that I haven't put the std library and some other key files of Python into the folder of my program, but I have no idea what files should I pack into it.So if the problem is really what I thought, what should I do to solve it? Namely, which files of Python should be packaged into a program to run on the PC with no Python interpreter ?Thanks in advance.------------update------------------As for the code of Python, it's just a hello-world for test and learning. I copy the whole Python34 folder into the program and the question has been solved:). Though it may not be a right way, it works.
Python's documentation has a reference manual for the C/C++ API.The file I believe you're referring to is Python.h, though I'm no expert on this. It's considerably easier to embed C than C++, and this gives some of the more simple examples. As far as I know, you shouldn't need to worry about the interpreter for compiling to an executable.
