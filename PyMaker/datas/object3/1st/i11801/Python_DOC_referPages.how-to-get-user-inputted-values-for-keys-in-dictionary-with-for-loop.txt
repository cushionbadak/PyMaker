I am trying to simplify this code that calculates total weight lost and average weight lost per month:Can I do this using a dictionary or list? Something like this:I know this is completely wrong but I am thinking there might be some way to do something like this. So that I can iterate through the Keys in the dictionary and get the user to provide the value without having to write the same line of code for 'week1' 'week2' and 'week3'. But not only that I want to repeat the function for every month the user says they were trying to lose weight and then calculate the totals.
You don't need a dictionary if you're not using the values.  In this case, you could just use a tuple or list like so:Even simpler might be something like this:
Considering that you want to ask about three weeks, then you can simply create a loop that will ask the user that many times. With a slight modification to your string, you can make this very simple without even needing a dictionary, by doing something like this: So what we are doing in that method now is iterating starting from 1, and asking the user to enter a number for each week. The string was changed slightly, so now we are going to use each number from the iterator of the loop to output which week number we need an entry for. For each entry, we just keep the running sum going. Then return the final result.From the above solution, the things that were used can be read about below: range formatAfter reading the comments in the question, I wanted to add a small variant of the answer to help clarify the comment made by Blckknght that takes a fixed number as a parameter to the method, and will ask the user that many times.So, if the user stated they wanted to enter how much weight they lost for 10 weeks, for example, then we are going to loop 10 times to get the entries, and we can do that, my changing the method around a bit to make it give it more context, and take an argument. So weeks() can now be defined as: Now, the method will take a parameter called weeks and we loop over that number:Demo: The next modification you can make for this is error handling. You can look to see how you can modify this method to make sure it only takes an integer, and what will happen if it takes a non integer value. Look at exception handling too, to understand how to handle these errors that could come up. 
If you need to use the dictionary to keep track of the weight per week (i.e. maybe you need the values later to perform some other calculations) you can do something like thishowever if you just need a sum of the total weight lost then you can use one of the other answers.
You can use this ..
