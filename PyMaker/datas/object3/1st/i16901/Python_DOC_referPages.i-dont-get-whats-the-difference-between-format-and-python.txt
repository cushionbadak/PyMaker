Confused newbie here. What's the difference between using:ANDBoth work. 
Actually there's a huge difference. The former use string's format method to create a string. The latter, pass several arguments to print function, which will concatenate them all adding a whitespace (default) between them.The former is far more powerful, for instance, you can use the format syntax to accomplish things like:It is similar to printf style formats used in earlier versions of python with the % operator: (ie: "%d" % 3) Now str.format() is recommended over the % operator and is the new standard in Python 3.
format() allows to convert the same object into a string using different representations specified by format_spec. print uses __str__ or __repr__ if the former is not defined. format() may also use __str__, __repr__ if __format__ is not defined.In Python 2 you could also define __unicode__ method:There is also ascii() builtin function in Python 3 that behaves like repr() but produces ascii-only results:See U+1F40D SNAKE.format() uses Format Specification Mini-Language instead of running various conversion to string functions.An object may invent its own format_spec language e.g., datetime allows to use strftime formats:
The former is more convenient. Imagine if you have lots of parameters, you'll end up with something like this:This is a pain to both read and write. So the format method is there to help you write cleaner and more readable strings.
