I want to know whether both of these are a list or not. In python, are both of these lists?Is y a list?
x is a list, but y is a tuple. The parentheses to define a tuple are optional in most contexts; it is the comma that defines the value, really.You can test this yourself with the type() function:Tuples are immutable; you can create one but then not alter the contents (add, remove or replace elements).
No.  The first is a list and the second is a tuple:As a note for the future, if you ever want to see the type of an object, you can use the type built-in as I demonstrated above.
