I am saving a list to a csv using the writerow function from csv module. Something went wrong when I opened the final file in MS office Excel.Before I encounter this issue, the main problem I was trying to deal with is getting the list saved to each row. It was saving each line into a cell in row1. I made some small changes, now this happened. I am certainly very confused as a novice python guy.Thanks!UPDATE:The full_list look like this: ['1,2,3,"MEM",...]UPDATE2(APR.22nd):Now I got three cells of data(the header in A1 and the rest in A2 and A3 respectively) in the same row. Apparently, the newline signs are not working for three items in one big list. I think the more specific question now is how do I save a list of records with '\n' behind each record to csv. UPDATE3(APR.23rd):original file
Importing the csv module is not enough, you need to use it as well. Right now, you're appending each line as an entire string to your list instead of a list of fields.Start withNow header_list contains all the headers, and input_lines contains a nested list of all the rows, each one split into columns.I think the rest should be pretty straightforward.
append() appends a list at the end of another list. So when you write header_list.append(header), it takes header as a list of characters and appends to header_list. You should writeThis would split the header row by commas and headers would be the list of header words, then append them properly after header_list.The same thing goes for AA_list.append(input_lines[i]).
I figured it out.The different between [val], val, and val.split(",") in the writerow bracket was:[val]: a string containing everything taking only the first column in excel(header and "2013, 1, 2,..." in A1, B1, C1 and so on ).val: each letter or comma or space(I forgot the technical terms) take a cell in excel.val.split(","): comma split the string in [val], and put each string separated by comma into an excel cell.Here is what I found out: 1.the right way to export the flat list to each line by using with syntax, 2.split the list when writing row The wanted outputPlease correct my mistakenly used term and syntax! Thanks.
