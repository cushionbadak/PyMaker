If I have an inheritance hierarchy of exception classes, and in a try block if I want to attempt to handle a more specific (derived) exception before a more general one, do I just put the except statement for the derived class above the one for the base class?Is this how I would do it?I have tried it out, and it works, but I'm surprised I am unable to find any documentation about this.
Check out the documentation of the try statement in the Python language reference. The relevant bit is:When an exception occurs in the try suite, a search for an exception handler is started. This search inspects the except clauses in turn until one is found that matches the exception.
