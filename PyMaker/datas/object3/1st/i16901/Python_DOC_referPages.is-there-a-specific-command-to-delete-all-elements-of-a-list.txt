This question already has an answer here:Delete all objects in a list                    4 answers                I know that you can simply:but is there a faster way with a single command like:or something along those lines?
One way I can think of:Or another way can be assigning None to the list, the garbage collector will free up the memory eventually.("list" is not a good name for a list in python, it's already a type)
You can use del and Explain Python's slice notation:
Yes, you can do del myList[:].  (Don't use list as a variable name, it blocks access to the builtin type called list.)
