This is how far I have got with this but I am not sure how to call the procedure again:
A few comments:new_salary is 200000 checks identity (whether the two things are the same object) not equality (whether the two things have the same value); you want new_salary == 200000.That still won't work, because new_salary, like everything you get from input, is a string; you can fix this with new_salary = int(input(...)).Your code doesn't actually change the salary in the dictionary Chelsea_Salaries_2014; to do that, assign the new value back to the dictionary Chelsea_Salaries_2014[search_input][1] = new_salary.What values are you checking for? Should the value be updated if the new value is less than or equal to Â£200,000? If you get warned that it's ridiculous, should it be updated anyway? You need to think more carefully about what the logic is. For example, I think your first check should be <= 200000, but then you never reach the check for <= 100000.I think you want something like this:You can now call this repeatedly, like:Once you have that working, you might want to consider some input validation in change_salary - i.e. does the user always enter an integer for new_salary? Is search_input always a valid key? What if they only enter part of the name?
