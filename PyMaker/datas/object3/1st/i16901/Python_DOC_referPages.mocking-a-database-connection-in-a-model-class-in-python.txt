I have written a Model class which wraps some RethinkDB functionality in an object. Part of it looks like:Now, I would like to test whether the save() method does what it is supposed to do. Since I am using a database connection for this operation, creating and removing a connection before the test is expensive and useless, since I only need to test that the correct methods on the r object are called. Obviously, mocking is the solution to this, but I am facing some difficulties in what and how should I mock the r object. I admit I am new to mocking concepts.So, in my method that tests save(), how can I test whether the update()/insert() have been called with the right arguments, and also, how can I assign some return values to them?
so, you need to mock r:I'm assuming you can extrapolate from there
