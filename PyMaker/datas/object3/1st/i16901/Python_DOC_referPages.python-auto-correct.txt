Natural Text
I have two files check.txt and orig.txt. I want to check every word in check.txt and see if it matches with any word in orig.txt. If it does match then the code should replace that word with its first match otherwise it should leave the word as it is. But somehow its not working as required. Kindly help.check.txt looks like this:and orig.txt looks like:http://pastebin.com/XJeDhY3G
There are two problems with your code: when you loop over the words in f, each word will still have a new line character, so your in check does not work you want to iterate orig for each of the words from f, but files are iterators, being exhausted after the first word from fYou can fix those by doing  word = word.strip() and orig = list(orig), or you can try something like this:Or shorter (without that final double loop), using difflib, as suggested in the comments:Also, remember to close your files, or use the with keyword to close them automatically.
