I have a class A made by someone else, that I cannot edit:Now I'm trying to inherit my own class B from A, and have x as a property instead of an attribute.Is this possible?I already tried:But as I expected, it's not possible: AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'x'Is there any other method, some workaroud maybe?
No, you cannot use super() for anything other than class attributes; x is an instance attribute, and there is no inheritance mechanism for attributes.Instance attributes live in a single namespace; there is no 'parent instance' attribute namespace.You can still reach the attribute in the instance __dict__ object:A property is a data descriptor, meaning that it is looked up before the instance attributes are consulted (see the descriptor howto), but you can still access it directly.
