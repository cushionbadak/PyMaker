Natural Text
I have the following python script. How can I log the outputs of each command separately, i.e. one file per each command containing that command's output?
Just set stdout parameter to a corresponding file:To redirect stderr output from a child process, you could set stderr parameter. If stderr=subprocess.STDOUT then stdout and stderr are merged.ExitStack is used to close the files and wait for already started child processes to exit even if an exception happens inside the with-statement e.g., if some command fails to start.
