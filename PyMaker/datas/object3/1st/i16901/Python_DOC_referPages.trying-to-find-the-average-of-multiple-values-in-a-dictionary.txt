New to python here. Trying to get find the average of totaled up keys in a dictionary.I've managed to grab the total of all values for each key, but I'm not certain how to find the average of these new values.
You already store a count with each list of values; simply loop over the dictionary items (key-value) pairs and use the last element of the value lists:This uses the last element of each values list as the row count, and uses a list comprehension to produce an average value for each of your columns. Some other remarks:you evidently have a CSV file; consider using the csv module instead. you never called the f.close() method; you merely referenced it. However, you should consider using the file object as a context manager instead. The with statement ensures that the file is closed for you when the block is exited:
You can convert the values to a list, then sum, and divide by the length of the list:Since the values are lists, perhaps you can get the average for each list:
