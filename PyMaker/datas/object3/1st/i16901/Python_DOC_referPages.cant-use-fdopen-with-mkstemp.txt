I am not able write to a file opened as rw by fdopen from the handle returned by mkstemp.Curiously, I can read from a file opened rw:If I open the file in one mode or the other then things are just fine:
rw is not a valid mode.If you want to open the file with updaing mode (reading/writing), use w+ or r+ mode.(See open documentation: mode parameter of os.fdopen is same as open.)
