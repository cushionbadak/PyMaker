I'm trying to put together multiple tuples but do not know how.  I know how to create a tuple, but I'm not quite sure how to put them together.  I want to keep on appending (not actually appending because I don't want a list).  I'm pulling a string out of each line and putting all of the tuples together  What I want returned
The tuple in your example can be created like this:However, because tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation) sequences, you will need to create a new one each time you want to "append" to it:This is why it would be best to just use a list, which is a mutable (can be changed after  creation) sequence that has an append method:
the easiest way to do that may be this
