I'm trying to pass a list of arguments with argparse but the only way that I've found involves rewriting the option for each argument that I want to pass:What I currently use:and I would like:Here is my code:
Use nargs:ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line  argument with a single action to be taken. The nargs keyword argument  associates a different number of command-line arguments with a single  action.For example, if nargs is set to '+'Just like '*', all command-line args present are gathered into a list.  Additionally, an error message will be generated if there wasnâ€™t at  least one command-line argument present.So, your code would look likeThat way -t arguments will be gathered into list automatically (you don't have to explicitly specify the action).
Being aware, you asked for argparse solution, I would like to present alternative solution using package docoptInstall it first:Write the code:Run it to show usage instrucitons:Call it with your parameters:Btw. if you do not need the -a option, you shall directly allow passing the arguments. It makes usage simpler to the user.
