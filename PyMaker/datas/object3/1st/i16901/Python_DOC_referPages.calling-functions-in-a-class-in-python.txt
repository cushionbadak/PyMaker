Suppose that I have the following in a single .py file:where ProcessGraph is a driver class.  When I typeI get this errorCould someone explain how to fix this error?
Try this:
Just decorate them with @staticmethodOutputs 'hello'. staticmethod vs classmethod
ReadGraph is in the namespace of the Graph class, which is why you can't call it as a high-level function. Try this:The @classmethod decorator will let you call ReadGraph on a class without creating a class instance.
create a instance of Graph class.
