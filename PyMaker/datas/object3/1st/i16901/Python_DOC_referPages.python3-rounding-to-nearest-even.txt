Python3.4 rounds to the nearest even (in the tie-breaker case).But it only seems to do this when rounding to an integer.In the final example above, I would have expected 2.8 as the answer when rounding to the nearest even.Why is there a discrepancy between the two behaviors?
Floating point numbers are only approximations; 2.85 cannot be represented exactly:It is slightly over 2.85.0.5 and 0.75 can be represented exactly with binary fractions (1/2 and 1/2 + 1/4, respectively).The round() function documents this explicitly:Note: The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. This is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions can’t be represented exactly as a float. See Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations for more information.
Martijn got it exactly right. If you want an int-rounder to round to the nearest even, then I would go with this:
To answer the title... If you use int(n), it truncates towards zero. If the result is not even, then you add one:
