I'd like to run the doctests from this file, and it's not clear to me out to accomplish it:README.md:(aside: can anyone help me get this to highlight as markdown?)
As an alternative to doctest I wrote mkcodes, a script that pulls code blocks out of markdown files so they can be tested in a separate file.Here's my actual test script using mkcodes:
You can run doctest on your README on the command line using:The -m parameter tells Python to run the following module as a script. When run as a script, the doctest module runs the doctest.testmod function on the following file. Lastly, the -v parameter makes doctest run in verbose mode; if it's turned off, doctest only produces output if at least one test fails (and will produce no output if everything is successful).
