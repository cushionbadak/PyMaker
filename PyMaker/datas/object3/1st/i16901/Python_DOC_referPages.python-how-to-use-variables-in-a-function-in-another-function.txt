I'm creating a game in python so here's what I got...I read another similar question that said doing "pile1= print(initGame())" will return the variable "chip" in the "initGame()" function, but when I run it it looks like thisWhen it should look something like thisSo my question is how do I get the "chip" variable to work in my other function?EDIT:
The return from a print is None you need to store the value and print it seperately, i.e.:Instead of:Try:
You're using a print statement with a nested call to initGame() function and you're assuming that the print() will return something to the variables pile1 and pile2.Try this:Edit #1 (in reply to comments):In order to test this portion of code (only), create a new .py file and put the following into it:Does this behave as expected?Edit #2 (in reply to new comments):You should not call the initGame() function (the one that i've commented), as it's already called inside displayPiles(). You should also rename it to initPile().
