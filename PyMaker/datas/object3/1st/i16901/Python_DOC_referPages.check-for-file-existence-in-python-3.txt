This question already has an answer here:How does using the try statement avoid a race condition?                    3 answers                I would like to know how I could check to see if a file exist based on user input and if it does not, then i would like to create one.so I would have something like:then I would like to check to see if file name exist.If file name does exist, open file to  write or read, if file name does not exist, create the file based on user input.I know the very basic about files but not how to use user input to check or create a file.
You can use the os module:Like this By os.path.isfile():Or Using os.path.exists():if the file doesn't exist :(return False)And you can write a simple code based on  (try,Except):
To do exactly what you asked:You're going to want to look at the os.path.isfile() function, and then the open() function (passing your variable as the argument).However, as noted by @LukasGraf, this is generally considered less than ideal because it introduces a race condition if something else were you create the file in the time between when you check to see if it exists and when you go to open it.Instead, the usual preferred method is to just try and open it, and catch the exception that's generated if you can't:
