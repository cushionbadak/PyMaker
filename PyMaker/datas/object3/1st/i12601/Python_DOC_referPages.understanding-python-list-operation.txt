I am new to python. i am learning some basic stuff. I was doing some operation on python list like this three_lists=[]*3 when i execute this piece of code it gives me only one empty list like this[]. Why it is not giving me 3  empty list? some what like this [],[],[] 
It says right in the Python docss * n or n * s equivalent to adding s to itself n timeswhere s is a sequence and n is an int. For exampleThis is consistent with other sequences as well, such as strIf you wanted a list of 3 empty lists you could say
it doesn't multiply lists it's multiply items inside the listfor example
The rules of arithmetic(operators in programming) still apply, you can't multiple with '0' or empty value and get something different, you get the original value that you had before.
