Natural Text
I've made a fully functioning main menu with buttons where one button take you to the game and another button that takes you to the instruction page.However, in my instructions page I can only write a one line sentence. If I add multiple lines it shows squares in the middle.What I want achieve is to write a multi-line paragraph onto the screen for displaying some instruction, game information, etc.Here es a screen shot of my current game GUI:And this is the relevant code I have so far:
The render() method of a pygame.font.Font object can only blit single line text, as stated in the documentation.To work around this you have to adapt your text_objects() function to draw each line of the passed in text string separately onto the appropriate position:Create a new surface onto which the whole paragraph will be drawn. To fake a transparent surface use Pygame's set_colorkey() method. 1)Split the text into several lines of characters using Python's built-in splitlines() method.Compute an optional offset value if you want to align (e.g. center) the text vertically inside the paragraph surface. Loop (i.e. enumerate) over the split lines:Render the current line of characters onto a dummy surface. 1)Calculate the position of this line to fit into a paragraph style.Blit the dummy surface onto the main paragraph surface.Draw the paragraph surface onto the main screen or return it with other parameters.Now itÂ´s time implement this:If you want to center each line in the text, don't set the x-coordinate of the currentPostion to 0 but use the following calculation:or right align:1) Please note that setting the antialias parameter to true when rendering a line, can have bad effects because of the set color-key of the paragraph surface!I hope this helps you :)
