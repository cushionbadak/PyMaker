Natural Text
I keep getting this error. I have tried commenting it out but each 'def' has an error. I did look at each previous questions regarding this issue. As far as my understanding my indentation is correct. Please help, this is the first time I have received such an error. (was following a book's code) 
The error would be before the definition of the function. Are there any codes defined before your function. I am able to get the output for the above program. The executable code is given below for your reference.
