Problem: Create an list from a given a string of numbers from 1-9 and such that every number in the string is inserted into the mainlist and every following smaller number will be inserted into a sublist until finding a greater number than the preceding which then will be inserted onto the normal(main) list and continue.question: ex. string = '654976' expected result = [6,[5,4],9,[7,6]]  actual = [6,[5,4],[5,4],9,[7,6],[7,6]] <= why is sublist is repeated?I also did try to use a split method on the string but it didn't help much, or didn't exactly understand how to use it. Hope it is clear. Thanks in advance.
You're appending sublist for each number in sublist once. You have to move the append(sublist) outside the if:or a bit more sophisticated:
It's because of your continue statement. After each iteration ofYou expect your sublist to be reinitialized with the codeBut with your continue statement, you are skipping that step (and so you are adding the same list a second time on the next iteration). Make sure you reinitialize your sublist at the beginning of each loop:
The reason you are seeing each sublist twice is because your are adding the sublist to the mainlist each time you find an element that is lower than the previous one.Also, after the for loop you should check if there is a non-empty sublist that has not been apended to the mainlist.Try with this instead:
Here's another solution using itertools.groupby and "static" variableswhich producesBasically, group_f returns an alternating sequence of True/False upon every subsequence.groupby uses it to group the original input values into groups, therefore splitting the input sequence into subsequences.create_inner_list uses those to form a new list, appending the first element of each group and the remaining elements as a list.
How about this?:
