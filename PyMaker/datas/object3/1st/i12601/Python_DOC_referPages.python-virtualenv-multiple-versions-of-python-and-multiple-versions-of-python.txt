I am looking to set up Python's virtualenv. I am doing this since I need to run some python files written with:a. Python 2.7 and also need to run some files that were written for python 3.4b. two different versions of:NumPy - NumPy 1.9.3 and NumPy 1.10.0Matplotlib - Matplotlib 1.5.0and Matplotlib 1.41I need to run all these files on the same Windows system (Windows 7 64-bit).Currently:I currently have Python 2.7 installed with NumPy 1.9.3 and Matplotlib 1.5.0. I have set up and used virtualenv using the following procedure:I have added C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts to my path. I have not yet installed Python 3.4.My problem:I need:2 different versions of Python2 versions of NumPy and MatplotlibQuestions:Do I need to create a separate virtualenv for Python 3.4 using the same procedure as I did for Python 2.7 above? Or is there a different method that is required for that?How do I install separate versions of Python packages to a virtualenv?
Yes you do create 1 virtualenv per interpreter.In it you can install matplotlib and numpy.You can create 2 venv with python 2.7 for testing differents versions of matplotlib and numpy, and make the same scheme with python 3.X 
Under windows I would definitely do it through anaconda/miniconda.Regardless of which version (py3/py2) you install, it can create venvs for py3/py2.For example:
