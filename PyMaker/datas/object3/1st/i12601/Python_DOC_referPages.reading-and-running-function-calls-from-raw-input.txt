I'm trying to read function calls and values from raw_input and run them on a list. i've made a list that i'm calling the functions on, and a list to hold the raw_input. My issue is getting the function calls from the list called cmd to be called on the original list, called 'l'. for instance, if the value of cmd[0] is 'append', and the value of cmd[1:] is [6,7,8], i want to call 'l.append(6,7,8)'. this is where i keep getting the error, on the % string stuff.print(l.'%s(%s)' % (cmd[0], cmd[1:])) 
Just printing out the function to STDOUT does not call it. Consider using Pythons built-in function exec() which supports dynamic execution of Python code.To use exec() just pass a string to it, which is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed. Your string consists of an object l, a method append() which is stored in cmd[0] and the methods arguments args held in cmd[1:]:Hope this helps :)
