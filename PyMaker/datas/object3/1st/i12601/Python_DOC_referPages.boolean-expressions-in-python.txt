I have a Python script I'm running that tests for the conjunction of two conditions, one of which is easy to verify and the other hard.  Say I write it as easy_boole and hard_boole in Python.  Will the interpreter always check easy_boole first and then return False if easy_boole == False?  Is the interpreter optimized in general to resolve these kinds of statements as quickly as possible?
Yes, both and and or are so called short-circuit operators. The evaluation of an and expression ends as soon as a value is falsy, the evaluation of an or expression ends as soon as a value is truthy.You can find the relevant documentation here.Here is a piece of code with which you can observe this behavior yourself:So with that in mind, always use easy_boole and hard_boole.
Just open up a REPL and try:That means that Python indeed evaluates boolean statements lazily.P.S. It's a duplicate
From Python Documentation:The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is  returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is  returned.So as long as x is False, the expression will be evaluated to False
Yes, python evaluates if statements lazily. For example, in following code:Python interpreter will first check f() statement and if f() is False, it will immediately jump on else statement.
