This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I have been struggling to troubleshoot a program, and I believe it comes down to this statement:I am reading a file using readline() and I'm struggling to fix the code in my function. For this while loop, I want it continue with these conditions:- line is not equal to '\n'OR- line is not equal to ''Why doesn't this statement represent the above situation?
You have to readas The empty string evaluates to False in a boolean context, so your expression is equivalent towhich is equivalent toYou either need to write the expression like @houcros suggested, asor as I would suggest, aswhich I think is easier to read. In your particular case, for this particular program, a simplewould suffice, too - if line consists only of whitespace (check if that is what you actually want), line.strip() will be '', which evaluates to False as already mentioned. 
While you say you want "line is not equal to '\n' OR line is not equal to ''", I think you really want "line is not equal to '\n' AND line is not equal to ''".  Otherwise, your condition is trivially true (because line cannot both be equal to '\n' and be empty).Therefore, I believe the condition you are looking for is:or equivalently,
I believe it should be
