I want to check if an array in Python contains incrementing elements, incremented by one each and starting with 0. So, e.g. [0, 1, 2, 3] should return "valid", whereas e.g. [0, 1, 3, 4] or [-1, 0, 1] should return "not valid". Is there an easy way to achieve that in Python? Maybe an built-in function?
If the problem is truly as you describe it, this can be solved trivially using range, like so:
How about using all :So you can put this into a function, this way:
I think it can be solved via a one-liner in a functional manner:given True for x = [0, 1, 2, 3] and False for x = [0, 1, 3, 4]Explanation:makes a list of differences between successive elements, obviously we want to have all -1...Then we use filter to select those elements which are different from -1, if there is at least one, it is not a incrementing elements and so the length of such filtered list > 0If yes, i.e. there are just -1, the field is empty and we get length of 0.
