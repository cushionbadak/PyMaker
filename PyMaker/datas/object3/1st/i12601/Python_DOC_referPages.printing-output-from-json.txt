I am still new to python, and brand new to json. I am trying to go through output that is in json. I am not yet sure which fields will need to be printed out, but I do know that two of them will be needed.How could I change:to print out say, field one, and field two? I figure if I can print field one, and two, I can play around with it until I find the right fields. I imagine this is a derp level question, but being able to print specific fields is what I need to be able to do. 
json.load is returning python obj (https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load) so depending on content of 'out.json' it can be either dict, list or few other types.In case of dictionary you can go with data['key'] or if it's list go with data[index] - where index is 1,2,...For looping use for ie for list:of for dictionary:
You could have find it easily in  python's json documentation.Here data is a dict type object. You can get any value by using the corresponding key like this:But it will throw a KeyError if the field key is not present in the dict. For avoiding this issue you can use the get() method.This will return None in case of missing key.
