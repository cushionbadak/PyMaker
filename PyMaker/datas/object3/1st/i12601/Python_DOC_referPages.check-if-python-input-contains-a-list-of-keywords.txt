Natural Text
AKA the correct version of this:I tried what's showed above but it says it cannot use lists, it must use a single string. Same thing if I set the array to an object/variable. If I use "or" it doesn't seem to work altogether.
If the goal is just to say if any of the known list appears in userMessage, and you don't care which one it is, use any with a generator expression:It will short-circuit when it gets a hit, so if hi appears in the input, it doesn't check the rest, and immediately returns True.
You can do:if you are looking for multiple words as well
You can also compare multiple elements using Set:But be careful to use split(), once it will not avoid ponctuation. So, if your userMessage is something like "hi, hello, greetings." it will compare the words against ["hi,", "hello,", "greetings."]
