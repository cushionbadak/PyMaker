Python str class constructor in Python3.5:Does it mean that the default encoding is utf-8?
Yes, that means that the default value for encoding is 'utf-8'. Also you could check this on: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encode
It is an additional initializer for str objects that is used when an object of type bytes (or byte-like) is supplied (indicated by the prefix b'text'.It's default value is utf-8 because the default encoding for Python 3.5 is utf-8 (and it rocks).It simply means that if a bytes object is passed in, the encoding utf-8 is going to be used by default and the errors=strict means that encoding errors will raise a UnicodeError. It essentially issues a call to bytes.decode().You can of course change these if you wish and use another encoding (like latin-1) or another level of errors.
