I have created a quiz and I would like to create a timer so that it displays how long the user has taken for each question?I want to implement the timer beside each question but I can't find help anywhere as I want the timer to reset after each question
The simplest way to time how long it takes to do something is take the time before you do it and take it away from the time after you do it.In python, there is a time module. time.time() gives you how many seconds it has been since the epoch (1 January 1970).You can even do it for multiple things at a time and store the timings in a list. The total time taken would be the list's sum.
You could use sleepLike,Sorry if this doesn't work, I came up with it on the spot
