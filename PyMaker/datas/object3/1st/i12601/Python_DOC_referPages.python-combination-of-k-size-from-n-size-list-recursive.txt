I need a recursive function that makes all possible permutations of a given list and length, with replacement:I found the code below, but it gives only the combos; it doesn't repeat an element,, such as [222] [322] etc.
This is called cartesian product. You can use itertools module for it:
You have three basic problems:(1) In your recursive call, you chopped off the chosen elements.  Instead, pass them all through to the next level.  Replacewith(2) You restricted the number of elements you'd consider, such that the elements are in non-decreasing order.  Remove the line(3) Finally, you've restricted the return list to the length of your input list.  This means that with only 2 elements (such as [2, 3]) you cannot return a choice list of 3 elements (such as [2, 3, 2]).  Remove the offending code:The resulting program appears to do what you want, returning:
