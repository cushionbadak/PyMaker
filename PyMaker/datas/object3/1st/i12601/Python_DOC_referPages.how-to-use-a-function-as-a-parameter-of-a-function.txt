Say I have a function sum(x,y) which returns x+y. Another function adder(s,...) which takes s as a parameter.I want to find the number of parameters of s in adder:I get the error:What's wrong? How do I get the number of parameters of s in adder()?
The method is called .getargspec(), not .getargspecs():Note that the method was deprecated in Python 3.0 in favor of .signature() method.
