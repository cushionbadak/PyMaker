It's telling me that the virtualenv command not found, doesn't anyone know what the problem might be?
If you use mac os x then the path may not be included in PYTHONPATH variable, so you need to append it with the actual path of  modules.
Virtualenv seems to be less 'friendly' so I would recommend venv instead.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
