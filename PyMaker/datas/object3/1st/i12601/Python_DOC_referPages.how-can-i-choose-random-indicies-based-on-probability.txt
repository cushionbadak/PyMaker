I have a list of numbers and I'm trying to write a function that will choose n random indices i such i's likelihood is percentages[i]Function:accumulated_s will just generate a corresponding list of probabilities. I'm expecting results like this:The problem is that this is not returning n indicies. Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong? Thank you so much!
Once you've found the right range of probabilities, you're done; break out of the inner loop to generate the next value, or you'll act as if all probabilities above the correct threshold were matched as well:Also note, if you have a lot of values in the set of probabilities, it may make sense to use functions from the bisect module to find the correct value, rather than scanning linearly each time; for a small number of entries in percentages, linear scanning is fine, but for a large number, O(log n) lookups may beat O(n) scans.
