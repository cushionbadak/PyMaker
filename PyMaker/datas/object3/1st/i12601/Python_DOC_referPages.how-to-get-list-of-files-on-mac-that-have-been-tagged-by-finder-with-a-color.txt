I'd like to tag some files on my Mac with Finder under a certain color tag, and then be able to get that list of files using a Python or bash script. Is it possible to get the list of tags associated with a file via the command line or a Python script?
It's possible.But you'll have to rely on xattr, xattr-lib should do the trick.Some examples have already been made on how to use the xattr command line tool, those can be found here:https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/110662/possible-to-tag-a-folder-via-terminalGet file's "get info" attributes in mac using pythonHow can I add OS X "tags" to files programmatically?I hope these help you out.In worse case you could use a tool called tag:This in combination with say subprocess.Popen could solve your needs.
Late to the party here, but this is something that has been bugging me too â€” and I eventually came up with a run-round for tech-shy people that requires no line-command coding, just ordinary Finder commands and SimpleText. Try the following:open a Finder window containing the tagged files and Select Allright-click on the selected files to get Contextual Menu and choose "Copy [x number of] files". If it doesn't say "Copy [x number of] files" but just "Copy [filename] you've accidentally deselected the files; reselect all, and try right-clicking again.open SimpleText. Make sure that it is set to use Plain Text and NOT Rich Text. (Menu Bar: Format>Make Plain Text/Rich Text). If it is set to Rich Text, this technique will not work: you will get a document containing the actual files rather than a list of their names!paste. This should paste a list of the filenames of all selected files, one per line, in the order in which they appear in the Finder. Hurrah!Hope this works for you. It changed my life.
