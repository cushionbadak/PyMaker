Natural Text
I wrote a script for backing up my Neo4J DB.At the end of the backup process and email is sent to the DB AdministratorThe email received without the message_body.This is the code:Any idea why?
MIMEMultipart takes as a parameter to the constructor a multipart subtype.You were using the subtype 'alternative'. The alternative subtype allows the email to be sent with HTML and text.You wanted to submit an email with text and an attachment, so you need to construct MIMEMultipart with the subtype 'mixed'.For more details about these subtypes, you can look at the MIME Wikipedia entry on Multipart messages.
