i have to make a python compiler using javacc and i have a problem with python scopes how can i check that how many lines of a code is in a different scope?how can i parse for with all the statements that are in its scope
The thing that makes parsing python interesting is the indentation. The standard gives rules for inserting INDENT and DEDENT tokens. We could to that in JavaCC, but the following takes another approach, which is to use semantic lookahead.Now it remains to write some java methodsThis is all untested, but I think it will work once minor errors are fixed.Once you can parse, counting lines is trivial.
