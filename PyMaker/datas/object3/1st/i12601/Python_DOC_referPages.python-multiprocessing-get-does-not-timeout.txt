I'm testing some code to timeout a function call using multiprocessing with Process and Queue. The Queue.get() method takes an optional timeout parameter. I wrote the following test to confirm it throws a timeout error when the called process takes longer than what is allotted in the call to get but it doesn't throw the error. Can anybody tell me how I'm failing to properly test the get timeout? I'm on Windows 7 with python 2.
From the documentation, Queue.get receives 2 parameters: block and timeout, in that order. You should call it like this
