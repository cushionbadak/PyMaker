I use redis-py (pip install redis) to get list : The result :The question the type is stringBut I want a dict Because I have to do something like this :It will cause error: TypeError: string indices must be integers, not strHow can I convert it ?? 
You're looking for ast.literal_eval. Set the response callback for the RPOP command to ast.literal_evalor call ast.literal_eval on each element of the Redis list you receive in the loopOf course, you can also use eval, but ast.literal_eval is much safer.
If you don't care about security, just use built-in eval(). returns
I tried following:To modify to your case, you have to do the import at the beginning and instead of print r do print ast.literal_eval(r).For your 'match' statement, I'd take a two step approach (and also check if the dictionary has the proper key).
