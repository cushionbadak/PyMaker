Natural Text
I have a text file that looks like this:I wrote the following program toRetrieve the data from the text fileSplit the text into columns delimited by a spaceSort the scores following each name into order (Lowest First,Highest last)Load the name and the highest score for each person into a list (scoreslist)Sort the list and output the results in alphabetical orderThe final output looks like this:I'm happy with the function at the moment but I feel that it could be a little more concise. Is there a simpler way?More importantly, I want to take the original file and use the same method to create an average of the numbers in the original text file and output in the same format. I thought there might be a simple average function that I could use but this obviously isn't happening:
You can use statistics.mean to calculate your averages, the csv lib to parse your file into rows, you never need to call read unless you actually want a single string of all the file content, you can iterate over a file object and split each line.  For your input file it would ouput:Now if you want to store all that data and output it ordered:That will give you two lists sorted from highest to lowest:For python2 you will need to calculate the average yourself and the logic for the loop is a little different:Instead of two lists you could store a dict of dicts that had the users highest score and mean and sort the items store in that.In regard to your own function, you could rewrite it as the following:
For your averaging problem, either use sum(x) / len(x) to calculate it manually, or the statistic module contains a mean function as suggested in another answer.In general, for problems like yours, use the pandas module for data analysis. Note that this is an external package that has to be installed before imported. For tutorials, see here.Check the .mean() method of pandas DataFrame objects for taking averages. For writing the resulting DataFrame, check the .to_csv method.
Ok, I gave it a little thought and this seems to work fine. As with all my code it isn't pretty.It seems to work but I assumed there would be a function such as min, max, mean, average that could just be plugged in.I am, very much, a beginner at this and I must admit that pandas isn't something i've used (or seen) before but thank you for the assistance with it paljenczy.
