I've a long list of strings; they are basically filenames. The format is like:and so on.What I need is to filter out the names containing numbers greater than 15 at the end. So with the above input, the desired outout would be:This number (15) is not fixed and provided by user as input.
Like below? Just use \d+ to search numbers?Demo:You can also search for _(\d+).txt (use () to catch the numbers like):To remove something like "abc122dedf_01.txt" in your file (if you don't want it).If you only need the last two numbers in the filenames, for example get 03 from 1203:
I would use splitReplace 15 in the above list comprehension with the variable which actually contains the number you want to check with.. Note that the variable must be of type interger or convert it to int during  condition checking.
