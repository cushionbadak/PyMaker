Debugging the following problem, post problem and code reference I am debugging. My question is, I think this if condition check if not necessary, and could be removed safely? If I am wrong, please feel free to correct me. Thanks.Given two strings where first string may contain wild card characters and second string is a normal string. Write a function that returns true if the two strings match. The following are allowed wild card characters in first string.For example, g*ks matches with geeks match. And string ge?ks* matches with geeksforgeeks (note * at the end of first string). But g*k doesnâ€™t match with gee as character k is not present in second string.thanks in advance,Lin
That if statement is critical to the proper operation of the function. Removing it will have disastrous consequences. For example, assume that first="*a" and second="". In other words, the function was called as match("*a",""). Then the if statement will cause the function to return False (which is correct since there is no a in second). Without the if statement, the code will proceed to the lineThe call match(first[1:],second) will evaluate to match("a","") which will return False. But when the code calls match(first,second[1:]), the call is equivalent to match("*a",""), and the result is infinite recursion.
