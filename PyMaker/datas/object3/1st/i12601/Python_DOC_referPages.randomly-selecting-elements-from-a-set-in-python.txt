This question already has an answer here:How do I pick 2 random items from a Python set? [duplicate]                    1 answer                If I have a set like so:How might I randomly generate a subset of s containing k distinct elements? 
Use random.sample:
Use random module:There is no need for you to s=set(range(100)) as range will provide a list of numbers in ascending order from 0 to 99.So, all of them are unique.Just feed that range(1,100) to the random.sample method:Quoting from Python Docs:random.sample(population, k) Return a k length list of unique elements  chosen from the population sequence or set. Used for random sampling  without replacement.
Use sample from the random module.
