Natural Text
I was testing my code and I thought that this piece of code was correct:but it's not, since when I input "a", this is what I get:ValueError does not catch InvalidOperation.I don't want the program to stop because of that, I want it to keep asking for input until it satisfies the condition. How do I do it?
The signal exceptions in the decimal module are all subclasses of the decimal.DecimalException exception class. You can catch any of the following exceptions to deal with the InvalidOperation exception, from the specific to the (very) generic:ValueError is not in that hierarchy, but catching Exception would also catch ValueError since it is a subclass. Generally speaking, you rarely want to catch BaseException since that catches all possible exceptions, including SystemExit and MemoryError.You can catch multiple exceptions in the same handler:would catch both your original ValueError exceptions, and all signal exceptions raised by the decimal module.
