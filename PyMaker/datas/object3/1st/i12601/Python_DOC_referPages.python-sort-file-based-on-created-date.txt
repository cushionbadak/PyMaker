Problemhow I can show each list item in new line and nice a nice format how I can sort the file/directory list based on last modified how I can sort the file/directory list based on creatation date 
Here is the program with some nice printing using the format function:Here is some code with a sort function being used on the accessed time. The code is not optimized but it is very readable and you should be able to understand it. Sample output:Happy optimizing! #If you change line 12 atime to ctime it will sort based on create-time.
