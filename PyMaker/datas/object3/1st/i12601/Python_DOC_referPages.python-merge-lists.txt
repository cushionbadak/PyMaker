Natural Text
I want to get the sum of numbers from a website. I do this:But if I am not mistaken, I now have a sublist for every number. Thus, sum(lst) doesn't work. How can I either merge the sublists or put the numbers in a single list to start with? Thanks!
You could use the following:Output
You can just use the built-in sum() function:Note that .get_text() is used here which returns a "text" of an element as opposed to .contents which is a list of texts of element's children.Note that I've also improved the locator and also check spans to have comments class.
