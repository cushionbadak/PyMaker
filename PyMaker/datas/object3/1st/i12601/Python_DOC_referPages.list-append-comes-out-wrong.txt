This question already has an answer here:List of lists changes reflected across sublists unexpectedly                    12 answers                I have the following piece of code as a problem.The first line prints [[][][][][]] which is what it should print but the second print gives[[1][1][1][1][1]]why does this happen? it is supposed to append only to the first list. 
In...you're creating five references to the same inner list. Thus, appending to one of them appends to them all.Consider instead:...which constructs a new list for each element.
Using id you can see that they refer to the same object.:As you can see, l actually have five same references to one object, []. So if you change anyone of them, you will see the same effect on the rest items
