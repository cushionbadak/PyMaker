I have a string of poker hands that looks like this: AA:1,KK:1,AK:1,AQ:0.5,AJs:1,ATs:1,...The number after the hand represents the weight from 0-100%. I then convert this into a dictionary that I can read the weight of the hand. The problem is the data I get lumps AKs and AKo into just AK if both hands are at the same weight. So I need some way to turn AK:1 into AKs:1 and AKo:1 and get rid of the AK:1right now I have code that just deals with the hands and not the weights:This turns AK into AKs, AKo but when I append it to a list it gets added as one item not two separate items. It also leaves the original hand in the list.How do I split this into two separate items when appending to a list?Whats most efficient way to get rid of the original hand?I import the information from a text or csv file, will converting it into a list or dictionary right away make things easier? Any other ideas appreciated.
Are you using Python3? The most minimal change to make that work is probably:Then in your main code you'll do something like:The whole code to me is probably:
