I've constructed the following little program for getting phone numbers using google's place api but it's pretty slow. When I'm testing with 6 items it takes anywhere from 4.86s to 1.99s and I'm not sure why the significant change in time.  I'm very new to API's so I'm not even sure what sort of things can/cannot be sped up, which sort of things are left to the webserver servicing the API and what I can change myself.
You may want to send requests in parallel. Python provides multiprocessing module which is suitable for task like this.Sample code:
Use sessions to enable persistent HTTP connections (so you don't have to establish a new connection every time)Docs: Requests Advanced Usage - Session Objects
its a matter of latency between client and servers , you can't change anything in this way unless you use multiple server location ( the near server to the client are getting the request ) .in term of performance you can build a multithreding system that can handel multiple requests at once . 
Most of the time isn't spent computing your request. The time is spent in communication with the server. That is a thing you cannot control.However, you may be able to speed it along using parallelization. Create a separate thread for each request as a start.Then use a thread pool as the number of request grows, this will avoid the overhead of repeated thread creation.
There is no need to do multithreading yourself. grequests provides a quick drop-in replacement for requests.
