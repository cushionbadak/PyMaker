I have a script that successfully removes a column from a csv file. Currently it does this by creating a new file. I want it to write to the original file rather than create a new one.I’ve tried this by using the r+ mode for open but it’s not working how I want. See notes below. I think r+ mode is the one I need but I’m struggling to find working examples to learn from.my code:attempt using r+ mode:This fails with the error list index out of range
From what I see, as the reader reads, the writer writes. On the same file.Files have a 'cursor', i.e. a current position upon which they are read from/written to.So the writer is overwriting the next row in the file after the one the reader has just read, with catastrophic consequences on the following readings.I think the first approach is the best one: create a new file and then rename it (the original input file is deleted automatically)
