The below code snippet is getting different outputs from Python 2.7 and 3.3.Output from Python 2.7:Output from Python 3.3:To fix the error in Python 3.3, I simply set the globals to be as the same as locals, that is exec(c,data,data).  Any idea why Python 3.3 is not behaving as that in 2.7?
It appears to be known and desired behaviour, see issue 13557 https://bugs.python.org/issue13557and further in https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#interaction-with-dynamic-featuresThe eval() and exec() functions do not have access to the full environment for resolving names. Names may be resolved in the local and global namespaces of the caller. Free variables are not resolved in the nearest enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace.You can solve the above problem by not using list comprehension with local variables method calls, or by providing variables through global scopeLoops insteadGlobal environment
