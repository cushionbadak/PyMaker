So I started with Strings & Lists (Basics mostly) and noticed this little thing:Works like a charm.When I try the same thing (different operation) on a LIST. Things go south: Output - NONEHowever:Gives the required output.Why is it so?
From Python Docs:sort(*, key=None, reverse=None) This method sorts the list in place,  using only < comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed  - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state).sort() accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword  (keyword-only arguments):  ...  This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when  sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side  effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use sorted() to  explicitly request a new sorted list instance).That means, list1.sort() will sort the element of list1 in place without creating any new object or list only returning None.Contrary to list1.sort(), sorted() (built-in method) instead returns a new sorted list of list1:sorted(iterable[, key][, reverse]) Return a new sorted list from the  items in iterable.
sort() sorts a list in place but returns None. The first snippet prints the return value of sort(). The second prints the sorted list itself.
list.sort is an in-place method. It modifies the list, rather than returning a new list. Its return value is None, so anything = some_list.sort() sets anything to None.From the docs:This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use sorted() to explicitly request a new sorted list instance).If you prefer that syntax (which is perfectly fine), use sorted(...) instead of list.sort
