I am trying to connect to an FTP server in a python script. I can access the FTP server from the browser without issue, but when I try to run the following:it fails with error_perm: 530 Please login with USER and PASS.But I don't have a username and password for this FTP--how come my browser seems to get past this authentication just fine?
It turns out that Firefox was automatically authenticating with empty strings for the username and password.These are the default arguments in ftp.login, so the following fixes the script:This is actually in the Python documentation too, I just didn't realize it was actually necessary.
