I am having a problem in a simple expression which is the following.When I enter 10 as an input it prints nothing as an output. With my elementary school math, I can easily assume that this should print all the numbers which can be divided by 10.So the problem should be in the if statement. It doesn't enter to print(n).I am using PyCharm Community Edition and Python 3.4
You should use == instead of is in this case because:is checks if two object's id are the same, and == checks if two object's values are the same.Well, range(40-101) gives range(-61) and that's treated as range(0, -61). Let's see:I think you mean range(40, 101) right?So your code should look like:Demo:Just got an idea to improve your code, you don't need % in this case since range() has a step argument. From the document:class range(stop)class range(start, stop[, step])The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in int or any object that implements the __index__ special method). If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1. If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0. If step is zero, ValueError is raised.For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.So as the document says, you can also set the step instead of use % to check all the numbers which can be divided by number manually use if. For example:
