I'm trying to learn how to build a web browser bot as half learning half project for someone else and I've hit a snag.The site I'm using as guide has:Which he claims keeps the shell window open do he can run various functions like get x,y cords of the mouse position and take screen shots. However when I run my code exactly as he has it in the guide it immediately opens and closes.What I don't want is something like, "make it so pressing enter closes shell instead", what needs to happen is the window stays open so I can enter various functions.What am I doing wrong? Am I suppose to just import the code in a different shell and run the functions outside it?The code:The guide is: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117
You have three ways:Start the intepreter with the -i option, as suggested by Ulrich in the comments:This way, the interpreter will be left open as soon as your script finishes execution and a prompt will be shown.Use pdb. This is often used for debugging, and has a different interface than the usual Python prompt. If you're not familiar with it, it might not be the best option in your case. Replace pass with these two lines:Use code. This will give you an interface much more similar to the usual Python shell and can be an alternative to pdb if you're not familiar with it:By the way, you were not doing anything wrong per se. The pass statement is not meant to "halt Python and start a prompt", it's just needed as a filler for functions or loops with an empty body.
