The word Fox produces the following sha1 hash:dfcd3454bbea788a751a696c24d97009ca992d17In python I'm simply trying to get this same output by doing the following:myhash just produces the following byte object:b'\xdf\xcd4T\xbb\xeax\x8au\x1ail$\xd9p\t\xca\x99-\x17'I've tried binascii and none of the methods there seem to be able to produce the above output.How can I produce the resulting ascii hash from here?
You have a hexadecimal representation of a digest. You can use the hash.hexdigest() method to produce the same in Python:You could also convert the binary digest to hexadecimal with the binascii.hexlify() function:However, that's just a more verbose way of achieving the same thing.
