Currently I have config.py in my package and I can access variables defined in config.py from other py files as First of all, Can I pass file as argument?test.py config.pyBut is there way to pass config file through command line as argument and access the variables defined in it? I see there is sys module to get arguments passed through command line. But can I get variables defined in passed file?editNow I am able to access variables in passed file as __import__(sys.argv[1]) and called python test.py config. But can I call config.py file by giving pythonpath? e/g/ python test.py ~/Desktop/config or PYTHONPATH='~/Desktop/' python test.py config? Because if I do this I get no module error.
What you do with import config is make all names from config.py available in your script.You can do this using __import__(sys.args[1]) like stated in answers to this question.But for actual program configuration, sure do take a look at the argparse module!
