I am new to Python and I am having some problems with CSV files in Python. Please help me outHow do I open and read csv files in Python which are present in some other directory? I know we can doAs long as my program file and csv file is in the same directory. But how do I provide a link to the csv file sitting in another directory?I have a list with multiple rows and columns, how do I transfer this data to a csv file and save it down in a particular location?Please help me out
First argument of open() is file, which can be an absolute path like C:\Program Files\file.csv or a relative one like ../../file.csv here .. refers to the directory above the current directory and . refers to the current directory.Where your_row_data is a list of lists.
