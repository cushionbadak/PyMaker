I am trying to make a dictionary from this file: with the key being the first word, and the values being all words afterwards.This is the code I have:When I print the follower and followed by variable, they are correct, but i'm having trouble adding them into the dictionary correctly; with this being the outputMy desired output would be Any assistance is much appreciated!

You can use collections.defaultdict() as a dictionary factory and just append the users following a person, e.g.:Which will produce, for your data:This will also allow you to have multiple lists appended to the user on a repeating record - otherwise you can just use a normal dict for followers and set them as followers[users[0]] = users[1:].The data structure you've shown as your desired output is not valid Python, do you really want it presented that way? I mean, if you insist you can do it as:
This is one solution using str.split and a try / except clause to capture instances where only a key exists.Note io.StringIO lets us read from a string as if it were a file.
this should work, didn't test it
