I tried to use the autodocumentation of Sphinx-doc. I want to fix the following problem. At the moment, no solutions from StackOverflow worked.Is it due to the structure of my project or the way I chose to import my modules ?Given structure of files :Following config sys.path :I've got some relative imports in fileInfo.py as :Terminal error
It seems your issue has to do with the structure of your project. As CristiFati suggested, you should have __init__.py files in each of your folders, including project. The docs on packages deem this necessary:The init.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path.For testing your code you'll need to run from some main.py file, since imports will be relative to the top-level folder (project in this case). Here's how the file structure should look:Then in main.py you should have:Running main.py should now produce error-free output.
