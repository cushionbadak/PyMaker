So I am trying to check and see if a bullet point is part of an item in a list by iterating through it with a for loop. I know that, at least in Regex a bullet point is defined as \u2022. But don't know how to use this. What I currently have but obviously doesn't work is something like this.Thanks in Advance!
In Python 3 your code will work fine because UTF-8 is the default source code encoding. If you're going to be working with Unicode a lot, consider switching to Python 3.In Python 2, the default is to treat literal strings as sequences of bytes, so you have to explicitly declare which strings are Unicode by prefixing them with u.First, set your source code encoding as UTF-8.Then tell Python to encode those strings as Unicode. Otherwise they'll be treated as individual bytes which will lead to odd things like Python thinking the first string has a length of 21 instead of 19.This is because the Unicode code point U+02022 BULLET is UTF-8 encoded as three bytes e2 80 a2. The first treats it as a single character, the second as three bytes.Finally, encode the character you're searching for as Unicode. That's either u'\u2022' or u'â€¢'.Real code probably won't be using constant strings, so you have to make sure that whatever is in list is encoded as UTF-8.
Best if you use the re (regex) library. Something like this:
