I've just started in python and with threading module. I used forks in C and the behaviour is that when fork is executed both threads keep on the same line of code. I was wondering how can I do that since I'm not able to do it. If I do not specify a target program does nothing on thread.start(). Is there any way to do that?. My code line is in main I have actually this code:Since Thread has no target they do not run but I don't know how to set target to that line of code that I'm currently executing
See Thread Objects 
Forking doesn't create another thread. It creates another child process, with its own pid, this is also the case in C. You can reproduce C's fork behavior using os.fork() (link to the doc). It will fork your process return the pid which will allow you to run different code depending on the process.If you want to use threads, using the threading module, I strongly suggest you start by thoroughly reading the documentation. You will see that you need to give a target function to execute to your Thread objects.
