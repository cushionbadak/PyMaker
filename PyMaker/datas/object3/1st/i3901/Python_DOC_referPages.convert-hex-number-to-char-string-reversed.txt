I have this variableI want the string "dcba", converting the hex number in char, and then reverse the string.How can I do that in python?
You can try this:Explanation:Using to_bytes() we will get the bytecode and to get the string dcba use the decode function.Output:
Interpret the integer as bytes in little-endian order, using the int.to_bytes() method:You do need to know the output length for this.

Enjoy!
