Natural Text
Working on outputting text and variables to a .txt file through python. And it doesn't work. This is the error that is given when i run it.Any help is greatly appreciated
Try using str.format.Ex:Note: f.write takes only a single argument, You are trying to pass 3("Number Plate:", np ,"\n")
You can try like this:Explanation:If you use with open.... there is no need to explicitly specify the f.close(). And also in f.write() using string concatenation + you can get the required one.
You can simply use str() functionThe str() function is meant to return representations of values which  are fairly human-readable.And your valid code will be like-your code giving Error, TypeError: write() takes exactly one argument (3 given)because-write() method takes only 1 argument, but you are providing 3 argument 1) "Number Plate:" , 2) np and 3) "\n"
