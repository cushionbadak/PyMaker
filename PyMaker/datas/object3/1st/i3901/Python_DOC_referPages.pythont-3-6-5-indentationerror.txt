I have just started writing in python, and the indentation is taking the best of me.I have this code:Which throws:File "so.py", line 9      except ValueError, e:                       ^  SyntaxError: invalid syntaxI am using only tabs.
Your code had two mistakes:First in the except partSecond is that you declared is_json at the bottomIf you declare at bottom you may get NameError: name 'is_json' is not defined error.
Have a look at the below 2 points.(1) Python3 uses different syntax for try-except statement for exception handling.Replace except ValueError, e: with except ValueError as e:.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html(2) Define your function before if statement. Function definition should be available before the point of usage (call).Thanks.
