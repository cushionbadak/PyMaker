Despite my best attempt, I am unable to make a dent into getting the required output. I have provided my progress so far (after the question). Write a class named Patient that has the following data attributes:name ( type string), height (type float), has_hair (type      Boolean)The Patient class should have an __init__ method (i.e., an initializer) that accepts the Patient’s name, height, and has_hair as arguments. These values should be assigned to the object's name, height, and has_hair data attributes. By default, let has_hair = 0Each Patient should start with 0 tablets, stored in an attribute tablets.A collect_tablets(number) method adds the given number of tablets to the Patient's number. This function should also be able to be called as collect_tablets() which just adds one barange to the total number.An eat() method consumes one tablet from the Patient's total, but increases the height of the Patient by 0.1m. If the Patient does not have any baranges, the method should print "I don't have any tablets  to eat!."A 'feast()' method consumes five tablets from the Patient's total. If the Patient is not hairy when he feasts, he grows hair. If the Patient is already hairy when he feasts, he grows by 50% instead (for example: a 2 m Patient grows to 3 m). A bald Patient that feasts, only grows hair, he does not grow in height unless he feasts later. If the Patient does not have enough tablets  for a feast, the method should print “I don't have enough tablets  to feast!.”My Code is :I am not able to get the program to execute.Please help and advise me as to what I am doing wrong. 
First, there are invalid characters in your code. On line 14:change the special opening and closing quotes to standard double quotes:After fixing the above and some indentation issues, the code runs, but the output is just a raw string representation of the object instance you're printing.In order to define a custom string representation, you need to define an __str__ and/or __repr__ method on your class. Have a look at the Python documentationFull working code:
