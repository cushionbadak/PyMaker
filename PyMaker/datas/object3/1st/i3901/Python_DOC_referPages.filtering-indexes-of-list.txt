I have the following list of numbers:I want the indexes of those numbers which are multiple of n,  so I do:That's ok, but what happens when I add the variable m?   Why that code doesn't returns [1, 3, 5, 4, 6]?What is the mistake?And how to create the function that returns that list?
You can use a list comprehension in combination with enumerate method. Also, you can apply extended iterable unpacking operator in order to pass parameters as many you need.Output
A more general and Pythonic approach that works for any number of variables is to use an any() or all() function that check the Truth value of the condition for all the arguments. If you want the index to belongs to an item that is divisible buy all the arguments you need all() other wise you can use any() that returns True right after it encounters a match.Demo:And with all():
The issue is enumerate returns an iterator from an iterable. Once it is exhausted, you may not use it again. Therefore, you can simply define a new enumerate iterator:Note there are better ways you can implement your algorithm.
