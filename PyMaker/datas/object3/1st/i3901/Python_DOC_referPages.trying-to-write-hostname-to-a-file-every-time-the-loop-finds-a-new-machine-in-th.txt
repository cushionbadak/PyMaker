I am trying to look for all the Windows computers on a network. Every time the program finds a computer in the network that is up and running, it will open a new file for that computer. In the file, I want to see the name of the machine, and its IP address.Once I'm done with that, I would like to log the installed apps on a particular computer onto that machine's file, which is why I have a new file for every computer that the program finds.However, when I run it, the machine has the same name every time. I have tried using import socket, but whenever I use any method that comes with it, I get an error saying that the socket has no attribute. I need from socket import * for my is_up method to work.Here is my code:Edit: I have put the new code here to reflect the use of gethostbyaddr(adr). I am still getting the following error:[Errno 11004] host not foundTraceback :
The issue here is the function used to get the hostname, gethostname() returns the name of the machine where you're executing the script.If you want the name of the distant machine you're inspecting, you need another function like gethostbyaddr, which returns a tuple of 3 members : name, list of aliases and list of IPs The other advantage of using such a function, as you get all details in one object, i think you have no need to use a file to store those, at least before using them in the second part of your script.You can unpack the values returned by gethostbyaddr to declare the variables you need in the next part :
