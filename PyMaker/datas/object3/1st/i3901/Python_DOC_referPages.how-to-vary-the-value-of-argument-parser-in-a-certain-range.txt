I am trying to run this piece of code. I want to assign different values to FLAGS.Ncolor as given is x. But when I run this code it is picking the default value of Ncolor that is 2.  
You seem to be mixing up the variables. FLAGS.Ncolor is the value given from the commandline. Which would be for example FLAGS.Ncolor = 5 (the default value in your code would be 2 ). In above code I would add a COLORS var:so you get a list colors with the number of values you want.I think you didnt properly understand what argparse is doing in the code and what you get back from p.parse_args(). Check out the argparse doc for example : linkif you want to add the numbers from the commandline directly you could do (notice the new 'nargs="+"' argument in add_argument()):Hope that helpsYou can then do something like that at the CLI:Best
Your code, after setting up the parser, is essentially doing:Use of FLAGS.NCOLOR as the iteration variable is not normal, but it does work - in a way.  It sets the attribute of the Namespace.  But why would you want to do that?  Usually that's the job of the parse_args method.for FLAGS.NCOLOR in ... works because the for statement assigns a value to FLAGS.NCOLOR, and FLAGS is a simple object class that accepts that kind of assignment.A more normal iteration would be:where i is the temporary iteration variable (just as used in your x=[] list comprehension.
