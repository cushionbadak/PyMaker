For my project i have scrapped twitter data in multiple jsonl file which needs to converted as single file and then read the single file again to extract informations.Code used to combine multiple jsons:Above code working fine, but this appends json file as string with each line seperated by ','.But, I am getting "JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 2 column 1 (char 2)"Kindly suggest on this error. Thanks !!
Your code does not actually "append json file as string with each line seperated by ','". It appends the dict (or list, or whatever) parsed from each JSON line as a dict (or list, or whatever).You haven't shown us the code that actually writes that output.jsonl, but that's almost certainly the code that's wrong. Most likely, you're doing something like this:Or maybe this:Either wayâ€¦ that's the problem. When you convert a list to a string with str, you get the Python representation of that list. Which isn't JSON, and isn't JSONLines.If you want to write JSONLines, you do it effectively the same way you read it:But really, if you're planning to export the whole list all at once, just to import the whole list all at once, do you need JSONLines instead of just one big JSON array?Meanwhile, if you're having trouble with JSONLines, instead of writing it yourself, why not use a tested implementation like, e.g., jsonlines?
