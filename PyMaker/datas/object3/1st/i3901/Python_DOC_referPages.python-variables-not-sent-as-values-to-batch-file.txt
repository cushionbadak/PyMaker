I have a python script where I am extracting values from a dataframe and trying to send them to a batch file. However, the values of the variables are not sent - the batch file is receiving them as variable names. Assuming all imports are in place.the batch file ftp_test.bat is as follows. When executing this, it fails with error:   C:>Searching for host...   Host does not exist   No session.   Host does not exist   No session.it looks like the username and password being sent are handles not the values. independently, when executing the batch file with hard-coded credentials, it works.what am i doing wrong?
You are passing literal strings of a_ftp_user, a_ftp_passand filename.Examples below will double quote the arguments even if not neededas I do not know if spaces exist in the arguments.You can concatenate the variables with the string parts of the command.Or, you could format the string to avoid + concatenation anduse {} placeholders instead.Or if you are using Python 3.6+, you can use f-strings to replacevariable names in a string with the values. Note the f before the string.View string - Common string operations about string formatting.Finally, your batch syntax require the set to be altered i.e.:which gets the 1st argument.
