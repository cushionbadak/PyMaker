What methods need to be altered if want to change the default behaviour of the dictionary?Some of the methods I am aware of like __getitem__(), __missing__(), __iter__() etc.I am trying to implement the dictionary in such a way that if I tried to assign the value to key(already existed) then the old value should not go away while should be kept in some list and when we try to remove the key like pop(key), it should remove older value.What methods need to be modified to override the dict class to achieve this behaviour?

You can then extend the __getitem__ method as well to take the index of the item you want in a list. As for the pop method, you will also need to override dict.pop.Example:
