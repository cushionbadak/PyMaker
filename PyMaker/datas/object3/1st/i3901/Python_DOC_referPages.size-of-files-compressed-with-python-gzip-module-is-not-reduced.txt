I made a simple test code that generates a lot of integers and writes them into a compressed file using the gzip module.The compressed file is created but when I decompress it, the raw data are actually a lot smaller:Can you please explain what am I doing wrong here?
The assumption that append mode would append to the existing stream is wrong. Instead it concatenates a new stream to the existing gzip file. When decompressing these are then concatenated transparently as if you had compressed a single file. But each stream contains its own header and footer and those add up. Inspecting your file revealsNote the repetition of the magic number 1f 8b, which marks the beginning of a new stream.In general it's usually a bad idea to repeatedly open a file in append mode in a loop. Instead open the file once for writing and write the contents in a loop:The resulting file is around 200 kiB, compared to the original 3 MiB.
