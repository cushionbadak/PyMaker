Natural Text
Using a dummy file (streamt.txt) with the following contents:The first word of each line represents a user and the rest of the line is a message, similar to twitter. I need to print a list of the top n (entered by user) original posting users (most messages) next to the number of messages they sent.This doesn't include any message with 'RT' at the start. Formatted in justified columns in lexicographic order in the case of ties.As it stands, my code only finds the most used words in the messages and it doesn't exclude RT and DM messages or account for n:This is my output:The actual output should be:Any ideas as to how I should do this?
Count as follows:Output:
Use Counter :
Using collections Module.Demo:Output:
Here is a complete solution using only defaultdict as imported class. Note that it takes into account the fact that several users may have the same number of messages:  
This can be done efficiently by recovering username of an author with str.split and keeping count with collections.Counter.If you want the users sorted by number of message, your can then use Counter.most_common. You optionally pass as argument the number of items you want returned.
