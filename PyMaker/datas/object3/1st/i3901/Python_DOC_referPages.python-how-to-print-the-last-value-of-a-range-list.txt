I have this code in Python:If a user inserts a beginning date like 2018-05-07 and an end date like 2018-05-11 it will print:In this case it will only print until the 10th day, how should I do to print also the end date (2018-05-11)?
There are many solutions to your question, however, I believe the easiest would be to adjust the daterange(d, d1) function, by simply adding 1 to the range(int ((d1 - d).days)).The reason for this is that, as per documentation, range(stop) does not output the stop value, but only the values 'before' it.
