Today I saw a function in a python textbook, the code is below:When I gave params to the power like below:The function returned me a 3125. I know 3125 may be came from (5*5)*(5*5)*5,but I don't understand how working is the params in the code. What the meaning of the expression (5,)*2?
That's a concatenation of a tuple.
If you inspect the value of params, you can see how it works:*n applied to a sequence returns that sequence appended to itself n times (see documentation).
Note that (5,)*2 expands to (5, 5), aka is a tuple.  See the docs on tuples . Re pow(): according to the docs, pow(x,y) returns x to the power y: In your script, you use the * in power(*params) to insert the two items in the params tuple as individual parameters into the function. You could have achieved the same by typing power(5,5). Thus, 5^5, which equals 3125. A intuitive tutorial on tuples is here.
