I want to have a dict of functions, but some of the functions take more arguments than others.I don't know how to call the function through the dict. Am I supposed to have an if statment or is there something I am missing?
Assuming this setup:Here is what you can do:
You can make all the functions take a list of arguments.You could also store the number of arguments in the dict values.Then you can call the functions like,
Store the functions in the dictionary, and call the functions with the correct number of arguments.  Nothing special needs to be done.You can even inspect the functions in the dictionary, to get the method's signature (positional arguments and keyword arguments, and default values).Output:Function 1 - no args  Function 2 got arg Hello  Function 3 got 'red', 'gray' and 'blue'
