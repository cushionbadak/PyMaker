So I have the file 3D_492.png and I am trying to get rid of everything but the numbers after the last underscore. How would I go about this?I want 3D_492.png to become 492.pngMore examples:Anniversary_1_Purple_710.png to become 710.pngThey are all in the folder \ImagesEdit: I'm dumb and forgot to say that I would like to rename the files with the new names.Thanks
Using split:Full example including rename, assuming Images is relative to the directory containing our Python script:
Perfect job for str.rpartition:It is guaranteed to return three elements, which sum to the original string.  This means you can always get the 2nd element for the "tail":Putting the pieces together:
Here is one way, using os.path.basename and then str.split to extract characters after the final underscore:
Sounds like you just want to split on _ and ignore everything but the last result.Renames are done using os.renameNote that if you want to do this with an absolute path (e.g. if fnames looks like ["C:/users/yourname/somefile_to_process_123.png", ...] this will require more processing with os.path.split)
You can use a regular expression to search for the digits preceding the extension.
