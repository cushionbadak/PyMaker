I have two matching size matrices in a spreadsheet of variable size, one with data items and another flagging items enabled for processing. After zipping the items they are not in a convenient order to process. How are items zipped so I have item and enable together?Expecting to just zipper = zip(output, doit) but it failed badly as shown in output. Expected output and zipped matrices are shown below.OutputI was expecting zipper to look like:No success with:
this should workas a replacement to your old linestandard types[] indicates a list and () a tuple. the docs for python types are here. the main difference is that tuples are immutable. here i just respected you desired outputlist comprehensionis equivalent tounpackingunpacking is sort of a quick assignment. a, b = [4,7] is equivalent to both assign 4 to a and 7 to byou know the output of zip(output, doit) is [([u'Batch 1', u'Batch 2'], [0, 0]), ([40, 30], [0, 1]), ([40, 25], [1, 1]), ([50, 30], [0, 0]), ([30, 10], [0, 1])]so if you do for row in zip(output, doit):, row will be in the form of ([40, 30], [0, 1]) which can be unpacked as [a, b], [c, d]you can make that assignment directly in your for statement which gives for [a, b], [c, d] in zip(output, doit)
