Call stack is: explore() -> cannot_be_modified() --> check()If I meet some conditions in check, I want to quit check and cannot_be_modified and come back to explore.So how can I achieve this?I thought about raising a specific type of exception in check function and catch it in explore but that exception can be caught in function cannot_be_modifiedDoes anyone have ideas?Thanks
Even if it's not the most elegant solution, you may decide to raise an exception (built-in or custom) in your check function and catch that in the explorer function. Be sure that you're catching only your exception.output:
