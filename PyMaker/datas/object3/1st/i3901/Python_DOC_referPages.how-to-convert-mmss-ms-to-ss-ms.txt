I'm trying to make a conversion for below example:original time: 1:03.091converted time: 63.09I did some research and found that I can add up the min to secs, but don't know how to add the milliseconds anymore. Below is what I've managed to do so far:In this case, how could I get 100.44, for example?
You can use datetime instead of time. For example:Edit: You can get anything hour, min, second and sum it up. from datetime import datetime
