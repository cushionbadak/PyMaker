Natural Text
When I use f.writelines('aaa') in both Python2 and Python3, the string aaa is written to the file, but what I expect is three separate lines of a.Here is the document of writelines:Please note that it accepts any iterable and str is iterable, so why instead of writing a line for each item in the string, writelines() simply writes a single string? Should I need to use f.writelines(list('aaa')) to get the desired result?I wonder whether this is a deliberately consideration or simply a novel bug.
from documentationWrite a list of lines to the stream. Line separators are not added, so  it is usual for each of the lines provided to have a line separator at  the end.Example:Output:Please note that the line separator \n is part of each string.
