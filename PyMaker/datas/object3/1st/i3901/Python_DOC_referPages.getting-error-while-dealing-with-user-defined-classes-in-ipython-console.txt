First I should say that I am using Python 3.5.2.I think something is wrong with ipython when I define my own classes.So, when I run following code in standard python console, I get no error:But when I run the above code in ipython console, I get the following error:Please help if you have any idea about this problem.
Looks like IPython is trying to access a.__class__, and failing. It's probably doing this as some kind of standard sweep of objects for diagnostic purposes. You'd get the same error in the regular Python console if you tried print(a.__class__).Your __getattribute__ should have a fallback in case there's no entry in the dictionary matching the key. the documentation recommends invoking the base class' __getattribute__ method if you need to access an actual attribute. Something like:It might also make sense to override __getattr__ instead of __getattribute__. That way, it is still possible to access all of the attributes of the object, without having to do any explicit checks for them in the function.
