I am looking to easily parse through a JSON file that I am getting with a GET request. I am new to this and would like some help. This the the JSON file I get from the GET request. I would like to return the most recent USD price of whatever crypto coin I have entered. This is first object in the "Time Series (Digital Currency Intraday)" object. How do I notate this in python? I know how to go into an object given I known the name, but since the time is always changing, how do I just go into the first one (ie. the index of the object) rather than the name "2018-05-19 15:50:00". This is my code that is relevant to this section:I know this shouldn't be hard, but I have looked all over the internet and can't fine a clear answer on how to go through JSON files. Thanks!
You can iterate over the elements of data['Time Series (Digital Currency Intraday)'] using dict.items():If you just want to get the first date:
Collect all keys from the ""Time Series (Digital Currency Intraday)" dictConvert them to datetime objects (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) Sort themTake the first oneDoes that solve your problem?
If you're familiar with Python's Pandas, you could always try to utilize pandas.read_json. This puts your data into a pandas object, making traditional munging easier.  recent_date = df['StartDate'].max()
