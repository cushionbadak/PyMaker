I am preparing python script which will control other python and linux scripts in correct sequence. And I have one doubt about below code:As you can see at first I am preparing files and then run linux_script.sh. Next step is to compare two dict, but it cannot be done until linux script will be completed - the script is running other application which creates .json file. Until .json file is not prepared, test_dict cannot be executed because it will fail. Question: python will be waiting for this line to be completed: os.system('./linux_script.sh, and then run test? If not how I can force python to do that?
os.system() does wait for the command to complete before returning.Note that, since you're calling the function directly inside the class body, this will execute when your test class is being loaded, not when it gets instantiated. If that's not what you want, move the call into the constructor, a set up method or directly into the test method itself.
