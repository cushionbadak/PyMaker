Due to fairly complex data nature, you could use a dict comprehension (where only the lowest (based on its price) accommodation is kept for each country), inside a list comprehension (that iterates through all the countries):Resources:[Python]: PEP 274 -- Dict Comprehensions[Python]: List Comprehensions[Python]: min(iterable, *[, key, default])
This is one way using list comprehensions. Since your dictionaries contain one item each, we extract the first key and first value. Alternatively, you could use next(iter(d.keys())) / next(iter(d.values())).
You can use min:Output:
You can try this
