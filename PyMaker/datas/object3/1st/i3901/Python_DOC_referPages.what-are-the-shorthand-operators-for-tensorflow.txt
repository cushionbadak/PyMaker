I've been using TensorFlow for very little but it seems promising. I'm doing the Coursera second course from DeepLearning.ai (Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization).I noticed that there is an equivalent(ish) to simple operations like:tf.matmul(a,b) ≈ a @ btf.add(a,b) ≈ a + bI prefer shorthand operations because they might make code easier to read. So...What are all the shorthand operators?Is there some place where I can find all the possible operations?Also, I would appreciate to hear some feedback on whether it is a good practice or not to use these shorthand operators...
This is not specific of tensorflow but a functionality of the python language. By defining some special member functions, you enable the use of those "shortcuts" -- for example if you implement the __add__ member function then you use + to call this function.You can find more about those here regarding "numeric" operators, and here regarding "container" operators (such as []). There are some more on the same page.The fact that this is a python functionality, means that they may depend on the version of python you are using. I am thinking more particularly to @ which came in python 3.5 and therefore cannot be used in python 2.7 AFAIK.Those shortcuts make the code easier to read and I have not seen any induced penalty so far, so you can use at will.
