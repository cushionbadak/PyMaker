I have a package (a folder) named models containing__init__.py, model_a.py, model_b.py.my __init__.py contains:In my main.py I doWhich throws the error TypeError: 'module' object is not subscriptableBasically what I want to do is elegantly load the model which is set in the config. Accessing the config like this works fine.
You're trying to do programmatic attribute access, so you need to use the getattr function:Subscripting (with square brackets, like foo[1]) is not the same as attribute access (with a dot, like foo.bar), in exactly the same way that foo[2] means something different to foo(2).
i don't know is it write but you can try this,
