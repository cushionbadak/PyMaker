Natural Text
I'd like to test logger messages without printing them to the screen in my unittests.  Given this code:How do I look at the log records in the logger to see that there was a warning?  I cannot find an iterator in Logger that would do the job.
You may need to use TestCase.assertLogs context manager in such case.Documentation provide a pretty good example of what can be done with it:Inside the context manager, you can access cm.records for a list of LogRecord instances, or cm.output for a list of formatted messages
