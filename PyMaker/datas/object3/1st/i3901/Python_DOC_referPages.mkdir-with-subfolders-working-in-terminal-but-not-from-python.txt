This question already has an answer here:subprocess.call                    3 answers                I wanted to create some folders with subfolders and have this python3 script that would read a csv file and create directories for me. I was expecting that it executes commands of this sortwhich works fine from the terminal and creates a folder called algorithmic-toolbox with 6 folders from week1 to week6 and then each folder contains slides, exercises and assignment folders.A sample csv would be like this:I am getting this error when I run the python script.Not sure why it says FilenotFoundError when I am creating directories with -p which is supposed to create the parent directories if they don't exist.
I believe parameter expansion used in the above command will not work without passing the shell=True argument to subprocess.call. This way Python will execute the command in an intermediate shell process.If you want your script to be platform independent you could instead use os.mkdir and handle the logic in Python.
