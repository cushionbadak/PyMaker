I am unable to resolve value +02:00 Below works fine with time zone -0500 :2017-01-12 14:12:06-05:00Does not work fine when time zone is -05:00 :2017-01-12 14:12:06-05:00
Time zone in format -05:00, i.e. with a colon, is not supported by the datetime module.But you can use dateutil.parser or pandas:
The documentation for strptime, for the %z format specifier:If I run your second example in my Python shell (Python 3.6.5), I get a ValueError:Based on that, offsets with : in are not valid. You can have to handle this yourself, or use another parsing library
