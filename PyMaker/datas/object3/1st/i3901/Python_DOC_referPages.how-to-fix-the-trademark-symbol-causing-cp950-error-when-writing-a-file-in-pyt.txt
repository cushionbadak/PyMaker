Natural Text
I am extracting text from a webpage and writing the content into a file:It prints the content on screen just fine, but its giving a unicode error when writing the content into a file:Upon printing the content to the console, I saw there are some trademark (TM) symbols in the article. So, I tried doing this:text=text.encode("utf-8")but I still get an error, albeit a different one:I have tried the following, but to no avail:It gives the following error:I also tried this:and this gives the original error (so, basically, it does nothing):How do I fix it?
I found the solution to be to open the file to write to in binary mode, and then to encode the unicode characters:Apparently, Python can't write encoded unicode text into a file unless the file being written to is opened in binary mode.
