I figured out how to count directories in a folder, but not sure how I could edit my code to recursively count subdirectories. Any help would be appreciated.This is my code so far.
I think you may want to use os.walk:
If you want to count them all without the root, this will do it:
You can use a glob here - the ** pattern indicates a recursive glob.  The trailing slash matches on directories, excluding other types of files.Using / works on windows, macOS, and Linux, so don't worry about putting os.sep instead.Beware of a weird edge case: shell globs typically exclude hidden directories, i.e. those which begin with a ., but pathlib includes those (it's a feature, not a bug: see issue26096). If you care about discounting hidden directories, filter them out in the expression when calling sum. Or, use the older module glob which excludes them by default.
