How do I do that?Please forgive my ignorance.I am new to programming and linux
You mentioned that you are not familiar with Linux. Below is how to do it shell commands.  Once this is understood, if you want to do it from within a Python script, you can do similar actions with an import of the os module.  First make your target directory:then you can copy
I don't know if you need to automatically browse folders, so if you need it you can use something like this to identify PDF files:Then you can manipulate path with os.path commands:Finally you can also use shutil.copyfile command:I let you combine and test all these commands so that you get familiar with python. Don't hesitate to print or debug variables before doing the final shutil.copyfile
