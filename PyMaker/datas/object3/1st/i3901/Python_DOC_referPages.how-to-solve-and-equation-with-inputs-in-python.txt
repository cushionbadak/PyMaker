This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I am trying to create a python program that uses user input in an equation. When I run the program, it gives this error code, "answer = ((((A*10A)**2)(B*C))*D**E) TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'int' and 'str'". My code is: 
The input() function returns a string value: you need to convert to a number using Decimal:But your user might enter something that isn't a decimal number, so you might want to do some checking:
The compiler thinks your inputs are of string type. You can wrap each of A, B, C, D, E with float() to cast the input into float type, provided you're actually inputting numbers at the terminal. This way, you're taking powers of float numbers instead of strings, which python doesn't know how to handle.
That code would run fine for python 2.7 I think you are using python 3.5+ so you have to cast the variable so this would become like thisI tested it 
there are three ways to fix it, either which limits you to integers (whole numbers)or:which limits you to float numbers (which have numbers on both sides of the decimal point, which can act a bit weird)the third way is not as recommended as the other two, as I am not sure if it works in python 3.x but it is 
input() returns a string, you have to convert your inputs to integers (or floats, or decimals...) before you can use them in math equations. I'd suggest creating a separate function to wrap your inputs, e.g.:
