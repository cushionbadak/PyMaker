I find myself wanting to keep a lowest/largest count when iterating through dictionaries. For example:Rather than setting my lowest_value to a number that will certainly be greater than the first if value < lowest_value:, is there a nicer way of doing this?For largest_count I can usually just use 0 or -1. 
You can use min() or max() like:Code:Test Code:Results:
You can from math import inf and use inf rather than some ad-hoc number. Ints compare against floats just fine in Python.
Python's builtin min can take an iterable. You can also put the > 100 filter in a genexpr. Python dicts can also return an iterable of values only, since you dont' care about the keys.You can get the list of keys in a list comp separately.This iterates twice, but that's OK unless your dict is really large (in which case, consider using pandas dataframes instead.)To avoid duplicating the filter step, you can use a dict comp first.
The one-liner.
