I am very new at Python.I need to input integers, and sort integers into positive and negative lists.When the input is 0, it can be ignored.The result should look like this:This is my code, but it has some problems. first of all, my code doesn't count the same numbers twice;in this case, there are two '5', but it counts as one.second, when there is no input number,    print("There is no input")is not shown.How should I solve these problems?
first of all, my code doesn't count the same numbers twice; in this case, there are two '5', but it counts as one.Not precisely. What's happening is that, as soon as your loop encounters a zero, it breaks out of the loop and stops looking at any further numbers. In the case of your first input, this means it ends up skipping over the second 5.The solution is simple: remove the else: break. It's unnecessary. If a number is neither > 0 nor < 0, you don't need to do anything, so you don't need an else: for that case.second, when there is no input number, print("There is no input") is not shown.The check for an empty list is inside the for loop. If the list is empty, there are no numbers to iterate over, so the loop never runs.Move that check outside the loop.As an aside, there's a much simpler way of doing the job of your for loop:This implementation uses list comprehensions. You will probably learn about these later.
