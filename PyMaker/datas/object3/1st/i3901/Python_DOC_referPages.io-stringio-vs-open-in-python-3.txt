Natural Text
All I could find is this statement:The easiest way to create a text stream is with open(), optionally  specifying an encoding:f = open("myfile.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")In-memory text streams are also available as StringIO objects:f = io.StringIO("some initial text data")But this gives no insight at all on when I should use open() over io.StringIO and vice-versa. I know that they do not work exactly the same behind the scene. But why would someone go for open() in Python 3 ?
The difference is: open takes a file name (and some other arguments like mode or encoding), io.StringIO takes a plain string and both return file-like objects.Hence:Use open to read files ;Use StringIO when you need a file-like object and you want to pass the content of a string.An example with StringIO:It's very useful because you can use a string where a file was expected. In the usual case, with a csv file on your disk, you would write something like:
