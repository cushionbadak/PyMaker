Use a collections.defaultdict, swap your keys and valuesUse sorted for output:function to return top n users (treats ties as one entry):Using a defaultdict is simple and fast, and here are some timings to prove it:Functions that will be timedResults
You can use sorted and a dictionary comprehension:Output:Edit: for any number of top users, pass the value to the function:
