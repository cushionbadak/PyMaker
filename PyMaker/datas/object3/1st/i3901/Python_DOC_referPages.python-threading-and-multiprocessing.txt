This is my code:When i run this code, the result is:When i change the Thread into Process, the result is:Why the +5 for x doesn't work while the append for y works?And, why when i use Process both +5 and append don't work?
I suggest you to read tutorial before asking basic questions as it will save everyone's time including yours.In short, when you use Thread, the main thread and launched thread share the same memory space but the x in function foo is another internal x but not the same x outside. So you just change the internal x but not the x outside. Further, actually y is also an internal y, but you are changing what it points to but not itself. You can confirm this by change y.append(5) to y = [0] to see will the outside y change.And, when you use Process, the main thread and launched process hold totally separate memory space.
