I am trying to start and stop an in-memory database server from a python script for a certain experiment I'm working on. The issue that I am facing is that I'm not able to figure out how to continue to the next instruction automatically. The following code seems to work except as I said, it will wait for the server to return. I tried to search various solutions but none worked - including the ones mentioned here on stackoverflow. 
Cool! this one worked. Thanks all!
