I have a regular expression that I want to apply to each line of a CSV file.Here's the function which basically removes all comma's encountered before a single digit number. The function is working perfectly fine for the string.However, I have a CSV file containing hundreds of such lines. For instanceI tried to read it using CSV reader and apply the function but unfortunately, it's not producing any output. What did I do wrong here:
