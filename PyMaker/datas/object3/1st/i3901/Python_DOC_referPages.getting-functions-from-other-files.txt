So I've got this function that I use through multiple file, is there a way to turn this into a class saved on a separate file and call for it on each of my other files?
is there a way to turn this into a class saved on a separate file and  call for it on each of my other files?For example:
You don't necessarily need to use a Class for that. You could just have the function defined in one file and then import it into the file that you are working in. It will be easiest if the two files are in the same folder.File containing function, e.g. called func.py:File you are working in, e.g. called working_file.py:Running working_file.py will returnIf you would like to type add(2, 3) instead of func.add(2, 3), you have to change the import statement in func.py to from func import add, which only imports that specific funciton.Hope this cleared it up.
