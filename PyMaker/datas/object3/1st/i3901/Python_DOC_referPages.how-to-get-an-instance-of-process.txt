Question: How can one get an instance of the class asyncio.subprocess.Process?In order to replace synchronous and blocking calls to methods of an instance of subprocess.Popen, I want to use an instance of the asyncio.subprocess.Process.The documentation for asyncio claims that this is accomplished by the function asyncio.create_subprocess_exec, whose arguments are more or less the same as those to the constructor for subprocess.Popen. In particular, the documentation claims that asyncio.create_subprocess_exec will:Return a Process instance.This, however, is not true in my experience. Like instances of the subprocess.Popen class, according to its documentation, instances of the asyncio.subprocess.Process class are supposed to have attributes like pid and stderr and methods like communicate.Here's a complete minimal working example:These all indicate that proc is a coroutine. I want an instance of the Process class.
I just figured it out; I am posting my MWE here in case it helps anyone in the future, since it took me several hours to figure out. The MWE example in this tutorial was helpful, as well as the suggestions in the comments.
