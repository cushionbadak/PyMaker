I got this value like this:Or in a different way:So how can I get this working so that my file plays?
In Windows, there are Unicode and ANSI versions of functions.  The documentation indicates the filename is an LPCTSTR.  For the ANSI version that is defined as LPCSTR and for Unicode it is LPCWSTR.Here's the proper way to call a Windows function.  Generally you want the W version of the function.  Defining .argtypes and .restype will also help with error checking.  As you found, you can pass the wrong type and it will not work.  With .argtypes defined, incompatible types will be caught.Output (after sound plays):Or skip all that work and just use the winsound module:
Despite the documentation specifying it as a string.A string that specifies the sound to playIn Python you actually have to make it byte values.  So simply:
