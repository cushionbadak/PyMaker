I have two lists of lists of the same length in Python 3 as follows:Elements of A are indices of elements of W. I would like to remove the elements of W given A. So, in the example, I would like to remove W[0][0], W[1][0], W[1][1], W[2][0], W[2][1], W[2][2], etc.What I did is this:But this gives the following error: TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not list
Unlike numpy arrays, you cannot index a list with a list. But you can use a list comprehension for this task:Or, if you are happy using a 3rd party library, numpy syntax is simpler:
One easy way is to use two nested loops. As you have probably noticed by now, you need two index numbers - one for the list in A and another for the element number of this list. Here is one way to tackle the problem:
