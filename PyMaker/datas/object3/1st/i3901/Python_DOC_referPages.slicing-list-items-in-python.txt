I have ordered list of string elements which I need to iterate.. starting from specific element/item from the list until the end.The list that I have:I wanted to iterate from any given element (which would be dynamic on each run) for example consider input3 currently till the end of List.So I wanted to achieve something like this:I have searched out that, in Python, we can slice the list with positional base but not on value base.
Yes using index() finds the position of an element in a list.So if your list looks like this:And you want to initerate from input3 onward then using ip_list.index('input3') returns the position of input3 (so 2).You then just have to slice the list in the normal way (as if you were doing ip_list[2:]) but using index():See Finding the index of an item given a list containing it in Python
list[list.index(value):]see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmllist.index(x[, start[, end]])Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.
Here's a solution based on iterators that works with any iterable, not just lists:Here I used the iter function to get an iterator from the iterable, and the next function to move that iterator forward. You may also be interested in What does the "yield" keyword do?.You would use it like this:
