Natural Text
I am using python 3.6 and beautfulsoup4I have the first node:title = self.html.find(id=(lists[1][selectionindex]))this is not none and is this node is highlighted in red:How can i get a list of the nodes in blue (any div/p nodes) but stop when it gets to h1/2/3 node
I'm assuming that you can find the first <h3> tag using some id (as shown in your code). The following code will get all the <p> and <div> tags after the <h3> tag and will stop when it encounters either <h1>, <h2> or an <h3> tag.The find_all_next() method returns a list of all the tags that come after the current tag.If you want all the tags between two such tags, and not only the <p> and <div> tags, use this:Or, the same using itertools.takewhile:
You can use BeautifulSoup's find_all function to get all instances of a specific HTML tag.
