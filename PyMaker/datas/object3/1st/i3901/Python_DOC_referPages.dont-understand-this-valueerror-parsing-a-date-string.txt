This question already has an answer here:Parse hours without leading zeroes by strptime in Python                    3 answers                For some reason python is not parsing my date properly but I looked at the strftime/strptime behavior and it looks to be rightIf I do:I get May 18, 2018 02:47 PM EDT, which looks to be the exact same format except for the leading 0 but strptime should be able to parse leading 0s.What am I doing wrong in parsing this date?Edit: Found out its the timezone but not sure why:returns a valuereturns ValueError
Python date handling has always been a little light in the timezone handling department (it's a complicated problem). You can implement your own derived tzinfo class from the abstract base class provided in the standard library if you only have a small subset of them that need to be handled—I've done it before and it's not too hard—or you can use something like the third-party dateutil module recommended in the documentation at the end of the tzinfo section which handles a much larger number of them. Anyway, you can get dateutil from here or you can simply install it from an OS command line with pip install py-dateutil.
