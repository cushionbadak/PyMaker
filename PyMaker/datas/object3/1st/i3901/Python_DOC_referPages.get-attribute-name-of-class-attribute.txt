Here are two discrete objects:For any Field object, is there inherently a way for that object to be aware of the attribute name that MyClass assigned it?I know I could pass parameters to the Field object, like potato = Field(name='potato'), but that would be messy and tedious in my actual case so I'm just wondering if there's a non-manual way of doing the same thing.Thanks!
Yes, you can make the Field class a descriptor, and then use __set_name__ method to bind the name.  No special handling is needed in MyClass.object.__set_name__(self, owner, name)  Called at the time the owning class owner is created. The descriptor has been assigned to name.This method is available in Python 3.6+.
