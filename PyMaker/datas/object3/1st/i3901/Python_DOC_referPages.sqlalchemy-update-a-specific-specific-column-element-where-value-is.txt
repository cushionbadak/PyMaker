I have a sqlite db, created as below:and the contents of the table are as below:I wanted to update the row where sp_id="sp-10.1.10.147"(identifying using the sp_id) and update the subnet_id and vpn_connectivity to new values. after updating the table could be like this.I am trying to write this update as a function where I can have the feasibility to give anyone value as an identifier(not necessarily sp_id always) of the row, and its corresponding columns new elements as inputs to the function.ex:*Note: identifier and changes are not same always, the identifier will be of fixed length 1 but changes could be of variable length.I have tried many methods, but I could not make it, completely relying on this post for an answer. 
The "identifier" is easy to handle: just use Query.filter_by() and unpack the given dictionary as keyword arguments.Since Query.update() accepts a dictionary with attribute names as keys, handling the changes is as easy as passing the dictionary forward:As long as both dictionaries use attribute names as keys, it'll work, but your example includes "subnet_id" as key, which is not an attribute of the mapped class. Perhaps it should've been "subnet_attached".
