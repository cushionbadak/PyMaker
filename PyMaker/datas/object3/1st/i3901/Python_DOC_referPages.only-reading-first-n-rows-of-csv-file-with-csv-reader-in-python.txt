Natural Text
I'm adding the text contained in the second column of a number of csv files into one list to later perform sentiment analysis on each item in the list. My code is fully working for large csv files at the moment, but the sentiment analysis I'm performing on the items in the list takes too long which is why I want to only read the first 200 rows per csv file. The code looks as follows:  How do I make sure to only read over the first 200 rows per csv file with the csv reader?
The shortest and most idiomatic way is probably to use itertools.islice:
You can just add a count, and break when in reaches 200, or add a loop with a range of 200.Define a variable right before your for loop for rows starts:Then inside your loop:
Using readlines() should do it.
