Natural Text
I am trying to make a code where I can input a random sentence, and count the frequency of the times a letter returns in this string:So far I have achieved to append each letter of the input in the list (chars). But now I need a way to count the amount of times a character returns in that list, and express this in a frequency.
Without a collections.Counter:Or if you really want to do it fully manually:In both cases count dictionary will have each different letter as its key and its value will be the number of times a letter was encountered, e.g.:If you want to have it case-insensitive, be sure to call letter.lower() when adding it to the count.
There's a very handy function, Counter, within the collections module which will compute the frequency of objects within a sequence:which will produce:In your case, you might want to concatenate your lines, e.g. using ''.join(lines) before passing into the Counter.If you want to achieve a similar result using raw dictionaries, you might want to do something like the following:Depending on your version of Python, this may be slower, but uses the .get() method of dict to either return an existing count or a default value before incrementing the count for each character in your string.
You can use a set to reduce the text to unique characters and then just count:
