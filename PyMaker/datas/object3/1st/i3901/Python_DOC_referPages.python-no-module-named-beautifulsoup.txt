This might be a super newbie question but I am trying to import BeautifulSoup to my python project: but I am getting this error:From what I am reading I have to install it make a child folder for it? If so why do my other imports such as import urllib.request work without installation and this one doesn't? 
Python comes with a default set of modules - you can see that urllib is included with your installation of Python by looking at the list of default modules on this page.You should follow these instructions to download and use pip, the Python package manager and installer, to get and install the BeautifulSoup module.
