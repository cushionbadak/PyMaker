Natural Text
I need a program that counts the top 5 most common first words of the lines in a file and which does not include lines where the first word is followed by a "DM" or an "RT"?I don't have any code as of so far because I'm completely lost. 
Not tested, but should work roughly like that:You should also add a check that ensures that parts has > 2 elements.
Read each line of your text in. For each line, split it into words using a regular expression, this will return a list of the words. If there are at least two words, test the second word to make sure it is not in your list. Then use a Counter() to keep track of all of the word counts. Store the lowercase of each word so that uppercase and lowercase versions of the same word are not counted separately:The Counter() has a useful feature in being able to show the most common values.
