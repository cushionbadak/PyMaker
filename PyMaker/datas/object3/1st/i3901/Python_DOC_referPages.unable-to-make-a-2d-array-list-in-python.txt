this is my code in python I don't understand how to combine given output in a one single array (2d array)code is:-and the output is :-
A 2D array in python is just a list of lists. List can be defined with some pretty simple syntax -- a = [1,2,3,4] defines a as the list [1,2,3,4]. Your check function currently just prints the lists you make. If you want to keep the lists you make to use later, you need to return them, so that a = check(temp) will assign the value of check(temp) to the variable a.If your check function returns the lists, you can create a list of your results with results = [check(temp), check(rainfall), check(humidity), check(population)].
