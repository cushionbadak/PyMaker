Natural Text
This function converts string roman numerals into integers by iterating from the right and adding to the symbol on the left unless it is greater, then it subtracts. What I don't understand is how i gets assigned to a index in the string. How does it bind to the iterator from range when it reduces?I know this is very un-Pythonic. I found this example in a book on interview questions in Python and want to understand why this works. 
lambda is - in simplified terms- a simple, anonymous function. You can break it up just like a function based on the colon:The string s and the dictionary T are available in a scope higher than the lambda and neither is assigned within the lambda statement, so the lambda has access to both.functools.reduce is a function that basically maps another callable across an iterable. As you can see in the docs, reduce applies the current result as the first argument to the given callable, and the current item as the second argument. A third argument can be supplied to reduce, which is the starting value; if not supplied, the first element in iterable will be used instead.So, as you can see, the current element of range (the iterable passed to reduce) is passed at each Step as the second argument (i) to the function passed to reduce (lambda). The lambda function then uses the second argument (i) to index string s
