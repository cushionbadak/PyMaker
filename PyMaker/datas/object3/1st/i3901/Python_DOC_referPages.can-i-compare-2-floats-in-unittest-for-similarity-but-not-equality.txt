I have this test above. My problem is the after training my machine learning models the result is a little different each time.So, I would like to assert TRUE when are similar in my Flask-api.The ChangeToSurvive is a float, so sometimes is 29.2 and after training again change to 30.5 or other number.
unittest has assertAlmostEqual method for this purpose:And you need to repeat this for all values from your dictionaries you wish to verify. It's best to wrap this with a test utility method.
