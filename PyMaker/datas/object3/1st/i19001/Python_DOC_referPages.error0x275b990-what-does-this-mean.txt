I have this function, but i'm not familiar with the error or how to correct it.error map object at 0x275b990
error map object at 0x275b990It is not an error - you just print address of iterator, returned by map. You could print list(w) to make sure that everything's alright. Of course, you should not return list(w) since it is unnecessary and expensive.
In Python 3+, map() is a class, not a function (documentation here). A map instance can be iterated over and each item in the sequence will be processed only as needed ("lazy evaluation"). This way an actual list need never be created, saving time and memory, and if you don't need all the items (e.g., you stop processing when you hit a certain value) then you can save a bunch of function calls, too. In general, then, you will want to do something like this with map():If you really do want an actual list, just convert it to one: the list() constructor accepts any iterable, including a map() instance:What you're seeing when you print a map object is not an error, but rather the default Python display (repr()) of objects. The code is the id() of the object in hexadecimal, which in CPython is its memory address; this is useful mainly for distinguishing one instance from others. You'll be seeing this a lot, so get used to it.
