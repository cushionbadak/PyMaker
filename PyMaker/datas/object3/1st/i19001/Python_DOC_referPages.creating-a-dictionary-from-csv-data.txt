I have a function that takes a CSV file and splits it into 3 values; isbn, author and title then creates a dictionary that maps isbn values to tuples containing the author and title. This is my current code:The problem is that at the moment I can get it to create a dictionary for each isbn but not one for all of them. My current output is:What my output should be:It's probably a really simple issue but I cannot get my head around it.
You need to declare isbn_dict before the loop, like this:This way, each item is added to the existing dictionary.
Use the csv module for easier and more efficient processing, and a dict comprehension:Your code only created a dictionary per line and only printed the dictionary. You probably wanted to return the dictionary instead.Using a dict comprehension not only makes the function more compact, it is also more efficient. The dictionary is created in one go, in C code, instead of in a Python loop adding keys and values one by one.
