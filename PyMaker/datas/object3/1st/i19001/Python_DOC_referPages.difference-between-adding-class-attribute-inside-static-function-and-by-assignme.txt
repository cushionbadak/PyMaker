There is code:Why the name __m is not mangled to _A__m but __z is?
As the Python tutorial puts it:This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, as long as it occurs within the definition of a class.Name mangling occurs at compilation time for code that is lexically inside of a class statement. It doesn't occur for code outside of class statements. It doesn't occur for code in functions that are defined outside a class statement and then added to the class object. It doesn't occur for code dynamically executed by a exec or eval call inside a class statement.
Exactly because you declared it outside the class, and name mangling happens inside classes.
