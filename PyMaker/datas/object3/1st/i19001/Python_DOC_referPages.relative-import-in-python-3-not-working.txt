I have the following directory:I have a function f defined in file1.py.If, in file2.py, I doI get the following error:SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative  importWhy? And how to make it work?
since file1 and file2 are in the same directory, you don't even need to have an __init__.py file.  If you're going to be scaling up, then leave it there.To import something in a file in the same directory, just do like thisfrom file1 import fi.e., you don't need to do the relative path .file1 because they are in the same directory.If your main function, script, or whatever, that will be running the whole application is in another directory, then you will have to make everything relative to wherever that is being executed.
Launching modules inside a package as executables is a bad practice.When you develop something you either build a library, which is intended to be imported by other programs and thus it doesn't make much sense to allow executing its submodules directly, or you build an executable in which case there's no reason to make it part of a package.This is why in setup.py you distinguish between packages and scripts. The packages will go under site-packages while the scripts will be installed under /usr/bin (or similar location depending on the OS).My recommendation is thus to use the following layout:Where file2.py imports file1.py as any other code that wants to use the library mydirectory, with an absolute import:When you write a setup.py script for the project you simply list mydirectory as a package and file2.py as a script and everything will work. No need to fiddle with sys.path.If you ever, for some reason, really want to actually run a submodule of a package, the proper way to do it is to use the -m switch:This loads the whole package and then executes the module as a script, allowing the relative import to succeed.I'd personally avoid doing this. Also because a lot of people don't even know you can do this and will end up getting the same error as you and think that the package is broken.Regarding the currently accepted answer, which says that you should just use an implicit relative import from file1 import f because it will work since they are in the same directory:This is wrong! It will not work in python3 where implicit relative imports are disallowed and will surely break if you happen to have installed a file1 module (since it will be imported instead of your module!).Even if it works the file1 will not be seen as part of the mydirectory package. This can matter. For example if file1 uses pickle, the name of the package is important for proper loading/unloading of data.
When launching a python source file, it is forbidden to import another file, that is in the current package, using relative import. In documentation it is said:Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always "__main__", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.So, as @mrKelley said, you need to use absolute import in such situation.

It is initialized to a default path taken from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, or from a built-in default if PYTHONPATH is not set. You can modify it using standard list operations:Inserting it at the beginning has the benefit of guaranteeing that the path is searched before others (even built-in ones) in the case of naming conflicts.
