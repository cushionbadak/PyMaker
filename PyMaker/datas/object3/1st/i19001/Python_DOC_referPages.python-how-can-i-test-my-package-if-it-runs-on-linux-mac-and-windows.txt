I need to test my Python package if it works properly on different systems. I found Tox for different Python versions, but what about different operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac. Can you recommend me a convenient way to test if my code works on all systems?
You'll need (possibly virtual) machines running one of each operating system. Personally, I just run my unit tests on different physical machines, but nearly all of my code is operating-system independent, so I can do most of my development on one operating system during the day and just run the tests on the other OSes at the end of the day.If you have operating-system dependent code (e.g., Windows handles the Python multiprocessing package differently from Unix), you can use the unittest module's skip functionality to skip tests of, say, Windows behavior when you're running the tests on Mac OS.
