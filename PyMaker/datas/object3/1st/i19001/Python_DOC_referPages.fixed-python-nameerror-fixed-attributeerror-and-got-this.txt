FIXED: turns out there is a module already called parser. Renamed it and its working fine! Thanks all. I got a python NameError I can't figure out, got it after AttributeError. I've tried what I know, can't come up with anything.main.py:parser.py:And no matter what I get the error:The same error occurs when trying to access xmlwrite.When I change xmlread and xmlwrite to parser.xmlread and parser.xmlwrite I get:The drive is K:\ because it's my personal drive at my school.
If your file is really called parser.xml, that's your problem. It needs to be parser.py in order to work.EDIT: Okay, since that wasn't your issue, it looks like you have a namespacing issue. You import your parser module twice when you use import parser and then from parser import *. The first form of it makes "parser" the namespace and the second form directly imports it, so in theory, you should have both parser.xmlwrite and xmlwrite in scope. It's also clearly not useful to import minidom in main.py since you don't use any minidom functionality in there.If you clear up those and still have the issue, I would suggest looking at __ init __.py. If that still does nothing, it could just plain be a conflict with Python's parser module, you could substitute a name like myxmlparser.
