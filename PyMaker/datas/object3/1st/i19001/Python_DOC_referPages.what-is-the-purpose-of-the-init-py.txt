This question already has an answer here:What is __init__.py for?                    10 answers                When creating a Python package, I am told to create a blank file called init.py. What I don't understand is why I need to create this file. The distutils build script doesn't modify it, so five builds later it's still blank. What is it's purpose?
It a signal to Python that the folder is a package, not just a folder. It also contains initialization code that is run when the package is imported into a script.See the docs on the subject for more. The most relevant extract:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the  directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent  directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally  hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In  the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can  also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__  variable, described later.
