I have the following three python scripts:parent1.pyparent2.py:child.py:If i call parent1.py with:it gives me like expected the following output:if i call parent2.py with:i get the same output. But in the first example i get the output of child.py as bytes and in the second i get it directly as a string. Why is this? Is it just a difference between python and bash pipes or is there something i could do otherwise to avoid this?
When python opens stdin and stdout, it detects what encoding to use and uses text I/O to give you unicode strings.But subprocess does not (and can not) detect the encoding of the subprocess you start, so it'll return bytes. You can use a io.TextIOWrapper() instance to wrap the child.stdout pipe to provide unicode data:
