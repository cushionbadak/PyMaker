I want to search and replace the character '№' in a string. I am not sure if it's actually a single character or two.How do I do it? What is its unicode?If it's any help, I am using Python3.EDIT: The sentence "I am not sure if it's actually a single character or two" kind of deformed my question. I actually wanted to know its unicode so that I could use the code instead of pasting the character in my python script.
That character is U+2116 ɴᴜᴍᴇʀᴏ sɪɢɴ.You can just type it directly in your source file, taking care to to specify the source file encoding as per PEP-236.Alternatively, you can use either the numeric Unicode escapes, or the more readable named Unicode escapes:
In Python 3 it is always a single character.
