Natural Text
I am trying to change the text string from the form of file1 to file01.  I am really new to python and can't figure out what should go in 'repl' location when trying to use a pattern.  Can anyone give me a hand?
You could try this:The brackets wrapped around the [1-9] captures the match, and it is the first match. You will see I used it in the replace using \1 meaning the first catch in the match.Also, if you don't want to add the zero for files with 2 digits or more, you could add [^\d] in the regexp:A bit more of a generic solution now that I'm revisiting this answer using str.format() and a lambda expression:A bit of details about the lambda expression:I am using the expression [A-Za-z_]+ assuming the filename contains letters and underscores only besides the training digits. Do pick a more appropriate expression if required.
To match files with single digit on the end, use a word boundary \b:
its also possible to use \D|$ while checking for two digits presence with file, which decides whether to replace file to file0 or notthe following code will also help to achieve the required.import retext = 'file1 file2 file3 file4 file11 file22 file33 file1'x = re.sub(r'file([0-9] (\D|$))',r'file0\1',text)print(x)
You could use groups to capture the parts that you wish to keep, then use those groups in the replacement text.The matching group is created by including ( ) in the regex search. You can then use it with \group, or \1 in this case since we want the first group inserted.
I believe the following will help you.  It is beneficial in that it will only insert a '0' where there is a single digit after 'file' (via boundary ['\b'] special character inclusion):'textwithzeros' should now be a new version of the 'text' string with '0' before each number.  Try it out!
