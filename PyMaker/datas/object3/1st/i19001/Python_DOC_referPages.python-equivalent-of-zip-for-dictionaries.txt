If I have these two lists:I can iterate over them as follows:Or more pythonicallyWhat if I have two dictionaries?Again, I can iterate manually:Is there some builtin method that allows me to iterate as follows?
There is no built-in function or method that can do this. However, you could easily define your own.This builds on the "manual method" you provide, but, like zip, can be used for any number of dictionaries.When only one dictionary is provided as an argument, it essentially returns dct.items().
You may want to make an intersection, using the Python Set type.Cheers,K.
Dictionary key views are already set-like in Python 3.  You can remove set():In Python 2:
In case if someone is looking for generalized solution:or if you like to separate key from values and use syntax likewe can replace last line withTestsgives us(tested on Python 2.7.12 & Python 3.5.2)
