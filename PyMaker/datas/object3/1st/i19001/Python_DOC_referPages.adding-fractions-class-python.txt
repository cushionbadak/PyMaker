I have this portion of a class that takes a whole number and a fraction and add them together.The outcome of this is 3 and 17/12, when it should be 4 and 5/12, I am not sure how to do this, I assume with an if the fraction is >= 1. Any help would be much appreciated
If you are using the fractions library, ou can just sum everything, then take the int() portion of the fraction:The Fraction() class implements __add__ for you, you can just sum up integers and Fraction() objects and it all works as it should.Demo using constants:One little-known but handy factoid is that Python the int() type has both .numerator and .denominator attributes, that the fractions.Fraction() class makes use of. If you are not using the fractions library, you can make use of that yourself:
One way to "fix" your version would be to deal with the improper fraction directly:Although there are more efficient ways of doing this addition more directly.
