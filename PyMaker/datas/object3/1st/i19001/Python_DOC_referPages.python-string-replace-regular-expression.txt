This question already has an answer here:How to input a regex in string.replace?                    7 answers                I have a parameter file of the form:Where the parameters may be in any order but there is only one parameter per line.  I want to replace one parameter's parameter-value with a new value.I am using a line replace function posted previously to replace the line which uses Python's string.replace(pattern, sub).  The regular expression that I'm using works for instance in vim but doesn't appear to work in string.replace(). Here is the regular expression that I'm using:Where "interfaceOpDataFile" is the parameter name that I'm replacing (/i for case-insensitive) and the new parameter value is the contents of the fileIn variable. Is there a way to get Python to recognize this regular expression or else is there another way to accomplish this task?
str.replace() v2|v3 does not recognize regular expressions. To perform a substitution using a regular expression, use re.sub() v2|v3.For example:In a loop, it would be better to compile the regular expression first:
You are looking for the re.sub function.will print axample atring
As a summary 
re.sub is definitely what you are looking for.  And so you know, you don't need the anchors and the wildcards.will do the same thing--matching the first substring that looks like "interfaceOpDataFile" and replacing it.
