If you use time.sleep(1), your loops will run a little over a second since the looping and printing also takes some time. A better way is to sleep for the remainder of the second. You can calculate that by using -time.time()%1It's easy to observe this by using print i, repr(time.time())vs
You can pause the code execution using time.sleep:
Use the time.sleep function.  Just do time.sleep(1) in your function.
Use time.sleep(number):
