Can C or C++ be used to program a library in python? I know that python can be used to write a library but I am wondering if C or C++ can be used.
Definitely.  There are lots of high performance libraries written in C (simplejson being a notable and fairly simple example.)See http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages
