I'd like to be able to use unicode in my python string. For instance I have an icon:which should create icon = '▲'but instead it literally returns it in string form: &#x25B2;How can I make this string recognize unicode?Thank you for your help in advance.
You can use string escape sequences, as documented in the “string and bytes literals” section of the language reference. For Python 3 this would work simply like this:In Python 2 this only works within unicode strings. Unicode strings have a u prefix before the quotation mark:This is not necessary in Python 3 as all strings in Python 3 are unicode strings.

Use \u escaping in a unicode string literal:Alternatively, if you want to use HTML entities, you can use this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2087433/71522
