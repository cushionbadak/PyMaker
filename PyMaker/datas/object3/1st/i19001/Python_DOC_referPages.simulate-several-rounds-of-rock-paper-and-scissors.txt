I am trying to implement a function that takes an integer n and simulates n rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors between players Player 1 and Player 2. The player who wins the most rounds wins the n-round game, with ties possible. The function should print the result of the game as shown.I think I need to approach this in a modular fashion. In other words, I need to combine at least 2 functions, my problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to do that. How can I activate the result from an embedded function when calling the simul() function?So I have created a function that simulates the game Rock, Paper, Scissors by execution the function rps(p1, p2). The code is the following:This is where I'm a bit stuck. I need to activate this function when executing the simul() function—how can I do that? What I have so far is the following:
To "activate" a function, you just call it. For example:Of course you need to write the choose_rps function (which randomly chooses and returns one of R, P, or S)—but, as you can see, you just call it the same way as the rps function.To put it all together into a script:And then you'll probably want something to drive it, such as this:… or…If you want, you can simplify this further. For example, you can turn the whole loop into a sum call with a generator expression:
Here is an equivalent function without the RPS narrative:Here is one that follows the story and is expanded to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock:
