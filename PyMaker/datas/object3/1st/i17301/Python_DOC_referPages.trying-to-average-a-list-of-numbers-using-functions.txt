First and foremost, I am new to python. As of such, I only know for loops, range, lens, and sum to do this problem. I am having difficulty trying to make a function that can average list of numbers. This is my code so far:So far, I am getting a syntax error on my third line with range(L).
All you need to do is return the sum of L divided by the length of L:No range() or float() or for required.In Python 3, / always produces a floating point number. sum() will do all the looping for you. The only thing you need to take care of, is returning 0 if the list is empty.
Following line is missing a ):
Because average of empty list is undefined, you should rather return None instead of '0'.And instead checking for length, it is better to catch potential error, according to EAFP principle. It makes also more clear what are you doing, as error is self-descriptive.
