So I've been learning the basics of Python and threw this bit of code together but i'm having a few issues. So I basically want it to check if the user input matches a value in the 'con' variable and if it matches to print correct, if it's wrong print not recognised. Also, I'd like to add lower() to the users input, so the capitalisation doesn't affect the results but don't really know where to add it.Like I say, I'm new to coding so go easy!Cheers
con is a list and uInput is a string.  Meaning, they will never be equal.Instead, you want to use in here:The above code will test if the value of uInput can be found in con.Then, you can add str.lower for case-insensitive searching:This code will test if a lowercase version of the value of uInput can be found in con.
You can chain that method straight onto the string that input() returns:Note also that the input will never be == con, as con is a list and the input is a string; instead, try:
