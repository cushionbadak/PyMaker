Let's say we have an instantiationAnd from the clients.py code I haveSo, from the above when it does PiHttpClient("192.168.1.234")  the host="192.168.1.234", right? but the init(self,host, port=8000) looks for self, host. I didn't see self being passed in as argument.then inside PiMixedClient, because PiHttpClient extending PiMixedClient, then its host and self should be as the same as PiMixedClientthen gpio=NativeGPIO(client)    again inside the init of NativeGPIO  _init(self, client),  from the calling function I do not need to supply the self?so when extending to lowest level it become RESTAPI base class, its sendRequest method is from client which is from the PiMixedClient class's sendRequest?
Yes - a python method always gets self as first argument, you might want to take a look at the docs on classes.Yes-No. You do not need to manually suply self if you create an instance of the class (you do if you want to override the init method)YesBut really, take a look at the python docs, they are pretty good.
