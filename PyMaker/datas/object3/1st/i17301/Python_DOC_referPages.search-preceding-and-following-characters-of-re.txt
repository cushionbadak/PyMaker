This question already has an answer here:Python regex alternation                    1 answer                I am trying to find the characters immediately before and after a regex match in a given string. This is the code.The test string has an occurence of 'abb' here ...fdbabbfsd... I am under the impression that the special character . matches any character other than \n and the {m,n} Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible as stated hereSo I expect my re to return ['bbfdbabbfsdfa'] and not just ['abb']. What am I missing?
It's because of the capturing group. Just move the parentheses:findall only matches groups, so everything you want to match needs to be in the parentheses.
According to re.findall documentation:Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of  strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned  in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern,  return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern  has more than one group.So by surrounding whole pattern as a group or removing group will give you what you want.
