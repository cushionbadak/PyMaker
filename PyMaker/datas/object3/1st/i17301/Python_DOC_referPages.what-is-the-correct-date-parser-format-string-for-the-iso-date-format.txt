I am trying to parse dates in the ISO date format, but for reasons I don't understand, the pattern I am using isn't working.From the shell:But 2014-01-03 should be a match to %y-%m-%d, right? Why am I getting this error?
From the docs (emphasis mine):%y Year without century as a zero-padded decimal number.   00, 01, ..., 99%Y  Year with century as a decimal number.  1970, 1988, 2001, 2013   Therefore %y-%m-%d is expecting 14-01-03 while you have 2014-01-03 which requires %Y-%m-%d.
Difference between upper and lower case:Documented in strptime and strftime behavior.
