I am looking for something similar in python to make this a "simulated operating system". EG:now, the idea is they can type in something like this...... and behind the scenes, we get this:Similarly, I would like to be able to print all method definitions that exist within that class when they type help.

You can use the built-in function vars to expose all the members of an object. That's maybe the simplest way to list those for your users. If you're only planning to print to stdout, you could also just call help(shell), which will print your class members along with docstrings and so on. help is really only intended for the interactive interpreter, though, so you'd likely be better off writing your own help-outputter using vars and the __doc__ attribute that's magically added to objects with docstrings. For example:To pick out and execute a particular method of your object, you can use getattr, which grabs an attribute (if it exists) from an object, by name. For example, to select and run a simple function with no arguments:Of course you could first tokenize the user input to pass arguments to your function as needed, like for your cat example:
