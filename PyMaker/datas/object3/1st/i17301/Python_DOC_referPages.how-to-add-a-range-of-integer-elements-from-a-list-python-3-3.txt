I know sum(list) works to add ALL the elements in a list, but it doesn't allow you to select a range. ex:In this case I want to add l[0 : 4] together. I know I can do:But is there a function that allows me to select the range of elements within a list to add together?
If you don't want to create a sublist, you can use itertools.islice:
You can use the builtin slice function to get the range of items, like thisThe parameters to slice are the same as the slicing syntax.
Why do you need a new function anyways? Just do sum(l[0:x]). If you really want a function, you can define one yourself:which adds from index start to end including end. And start is default to index 0 if not specified.
