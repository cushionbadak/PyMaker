So I am trying to turn a string with multiple separators into a list, but dictated by where the separators are:ex:  ("Hooray! Finally, we're done.", "!,")    to be converted to:  ['Hooray', ' Finally', " we're done."] based upon the separators given.As you can see, the string is split into a list based on the separators.  My closest attempt:when I do this I get the result: ['Hooray', 'Finally', "we're", 'done.']but I need to have " we're done" as one element of the list, not separated.  I got a suggestion to use a string accumulator, but I don't see how it helps to solve the issueThanks
Just do this, using re.split:EDIT:Without regular expressions, you need a custom function such as:And then use it as so:
You can use re.split with an appropriate expression:Splits the first element of the tuple by every character in the tuples second element.The regex is made out of the tuple's second string where all regex special charcters are properly escaped. [some chars] means that every character inside the Square Brackets will be a seperator.
A simple solutoin without regular expressions could be:
Change the string so all the separators are the same, then split on that one:
