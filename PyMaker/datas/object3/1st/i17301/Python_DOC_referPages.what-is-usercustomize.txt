I have seen many mentions of usercustomize throughout the docs. What is it exactly?I am on Ubuntu 12.0, Python 3.3, using the IDLE interpreter. Adding a 'usercustomize.py' file to /usr/lib/python3.3 with the following code in it:I started the IDLE interpreter. Without importing math, I typed math.sqrt( Typing Ctrl + \ to start the auto complete suggestion, I get a prompt like sqrt(x). This suggests that math in fact has been imported. But actually calling the function raises NameError. What exactly is going on here?
See the site module for full documenation on what usercustomize is meant to do.Note that usercustomize is only imported if site.ENABLE_USER_SITE is enabled:After this, an attempt is made to import a module named usercustomize, which can perform arbitrary user-specific customizations, if ENABLE_USER_SITE is true. This file is intended to be created in the user site-packages directory (see below), which is part of sys.path unless disabled by -s. An ImportError will be silently ignored.Importing math into usercustomize will not make it available in IDLE; you are not making it a built-in that way. You could add it to the builtins module, but I'd advice against that.usercustomize is not meant to set up a default IDLE environment, it is meant to add extra entries to the sys.path module search path and other general Python runtime environment changes.
