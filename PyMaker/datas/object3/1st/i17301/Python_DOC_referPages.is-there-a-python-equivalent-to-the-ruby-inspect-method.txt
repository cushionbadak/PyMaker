In ruby you can inspect any object with the inspect method:For example:will printIs there any similar facility in python which allows me to print the content of some arbitrary variable?
Use repr. It returns a string containing a printable representation of an object. (similar to Object#inspect in Ruby)BTW, there's no symbol literal (:symbol) or single character string literal (?x) in Python; replaced them with string literals in the above example.
