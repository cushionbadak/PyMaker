i'm trying to solve a small python problem.i found the solution online but i'm unable to run the code in python 3.0 interpreter.i'm beginner i just started learning couple of days back please help me.
All you needed, really, was the print() function, and string.ascii_lowercase instead of string.lowercase. The string.maketrans() function is now a class method on the str type:This is a slightly clean-up version of the code you found. Now stop cheating on the Python Challenge and solve the problems yourself. :-)
string.lowercase has changed to string.ascii_lowercase.string.maketrans is now str.maketransprint is now a function and requires brackets.For more information about all the changes, see What's New In Python 3.0
