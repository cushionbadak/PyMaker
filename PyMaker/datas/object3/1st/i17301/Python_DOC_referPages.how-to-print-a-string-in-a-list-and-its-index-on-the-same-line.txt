This probably has a very simple solution, but I'm just a beginner.What I have is:Right now it only prints the index and not the string. I'm not entirely sure what the issue is, but when I switch the ordering in the last line so that (L[i]) comes first then it prints the string but not the index. I want to print both on the same line.
In Python 3.x, print is not a statement as in Python 2.x, but rather a function. You can use it like this:Additionally, enumerate is great for what you're trying to do:Note that you can use print as a Python 3.x-style function in Python 2 if you import it from the __future__ package (for Python 2.6 and up):
In Python 3.x, print is a function. So, you have to pass both the values as parameters like thisWhen you say Python 3.x, accepts i as the parameter to print and considers (L[i]) as a separate expression and evaluates it, but that doesn't get passed to the print function. That is why always the first element is getting printed.Apart from that, your entire statement gets evaluated to the following tupleTo understand that, try something like this, in the Python REPLWhen the inner print with 1 getting executed, it will return None and the next element is 2. In Python, when you write two expressions separated by comma, in parenthesis, they will become a tuple.You can confirm the same with Python's generated bytecodes, like thisOutputBUILD_TUPLE corresponds to the tuple construction and as we don't use it, it gets discarded immediately.

As others said, print is now a function, so what python is doing is interpreting the line:print(i), (L[i]) as a tuple. Do print(i, L[i]) instead.You'll also want to use enumerate:
