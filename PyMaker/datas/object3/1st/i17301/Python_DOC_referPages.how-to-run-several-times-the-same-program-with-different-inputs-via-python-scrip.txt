I need to run a simple C program several time, each one with different input string (let's say AAAAA... increasing size, until I get "TRUE" as output).e.g.in C I would simply use a while loop.I know in python there is the while loop as well.So the python program would be:Given that I can make the .py script executable by writingandWhat should I do to make this work?Thanks in advance
You could try something like this (see docs):The subprocess module is preferred to the os.popen command, since it has been "deprecated since version 2.6." See the os documentation.
You can use subprocess.check_output:
file.pyrunning file.py would execute ./program 10 times with increasing A input
Use commands. Here is the documentation http://docs.python.org/2/library/commands.htmlcommands.getstatusoutput returns a stdout output from your C program. So, if your program prints something, use that. (In fact, it returns a tuple (0, out) for stdout).commands.getstatus returns boolean status from program which you can use as well.So, assuming you are using stdout to capture the ./program output, the entire modified program looks likeI would experiment with getstatus to see if I can read values returned by program. Edit: Didn't notice that commands is deprecated since 2.6 Please use subprocess as shown in other response.
