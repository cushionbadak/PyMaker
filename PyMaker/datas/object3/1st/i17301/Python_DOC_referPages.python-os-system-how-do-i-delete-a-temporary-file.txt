I'm trying to delete a temporary file using Python. My OS is Windows.Now, I noticed that it makes sense for me to use os.system("del xxx") to remove that file, but is there a way to make it universal? For example, to make it also work on Macs or Linux? I know that those systems use "rm" rather than "del".Thanks!
Use os.remove instead of os.system:
Have a look at tempfile. This should be the preferred way when working with temporary files.
