I wonder if my answer below is correct and feasible or are there any improvements Thank you.question: a program that checks x y and z if they are odd or even if they are odd checks if the number is the biggest of all three.Below my answer:
Wow! That is a ton of code. Why don't you just put x,y,z in a list. Use a list comprehension to remove even numbers. Then select the maximum value using the max function. Something like thisThen you can use max(arr) to figure out  what variable contains the maximum odd number.
Your solution is probably a bit too verbose and specific. What if you needed to find the largest odd number and there were four? Or a hundred?A better idea would be to use Python's max function to examine a sequence that filters out even numbers.You can collect the numbers to be examined in a sequence like a list:Then you can filter that sequence with a list comprehension:Then you can find the max of that sequence:Suppose that there were no odd numbers in the sequence, though. The max function raises an exception if its argument is empty. So we can use a conditional expression to check to see if A_odd is empty:Then when we print the answer with print(A_odd) we get the result or the message.Python 3.4 (not yet released) includes an addition to the max function that allows this to be even more compact - you can skip the conditional and just do max(A_odd, default="No odd numbers in sequence")
This is inspired by Eric's answer but meets your need to print x, y and z instead of values. Personally I would prefer to write if d%2 but that's just me, it's up to you.It uses a dictinoary with Eric's list comprehension idea.EDIT: I just figured that this would be cooler using a function. Test run like so,
This prints 'No odd numbers' if there are none  in numsDoing print(max(some_list)) where some_list is empty returns an error and so is not dealing with situations where there are no odd numbers present
