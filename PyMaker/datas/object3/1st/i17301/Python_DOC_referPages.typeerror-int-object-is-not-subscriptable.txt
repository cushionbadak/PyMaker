Why does this code snippet result in: TypeError 'int' object is not subscriptable?hexdata is a hexadecimal string. For example, it may be 0x0101.
You're doing this:If you intended to remove the first two character, use following:If the orignal string is hexadecimal representation, you should pass optional base argument 16If [2:] is used to remove 0b generated by bin (not to remove leading characters from the original string), then following is what you want.BTW, you can use str.format or format instead of bin + str.zfill:UPDATEIf you specify 0 as a base, int will automatically recognize the number's base using the prefix.
Parentheses in the wrong place. Assuming you have a string like "0x0101" where you want to end up with a 16-digit binary string:The int(X,16) call interprets that as a hex number (and can accept a number of the form 0xSomething). Then bin(X) turns that into a string of the form 0b01010101.The [2:] then gets rid of the 0b at the front and zfill(16) fills that out to 16 "bits".
