Here is my list ,I am trying to change keys of this dictionary , What i am trying ,This code is printing tmp_lst as [None, None, None]But when i have tried following , got the correct result.Both codes seems like the same then why i am getting [None, None, None] in first case and correct output in second case ?
dict.update always returns None, so in the first example, you append None three times while in the second example, you append the dict object three times.
because newo.update() doesn't return anything (so you get None).
HereYou are actually adding the return value of newo.update to the list, which happens to be None. In the first example you first update the dict and then append the dict itself to temp_lst. That makes a difference
