This question already has an answer here:Why does Python code use len() function instead of a length method?                    8 answers                Python's length of list can be calculated by len(a_list). My question is, why was a_list.len() not implemented? Is there a reason behind it?
likely just because its redundant when we already have and are use to len() maybe you could add a .len() method :)there is a a_list.__len__()
