In the main script, I want to stop it under some condition. I tried return but it is wrong since it is outside the function. I tried exit, but it does not stop. See the following: what should I do ? the version I used is IDLE 2.7.5+
use exit()
If you're not in a function, use sys.exit()Note that this will exit python entirely, even if called from a module that's inside a larger program.It will usually be better organization to return from a function, and keep as much code inside functions as possible.
Another way to exit a Python script is to simply raise the SystemExit exception with raise:This solution does exactly what sys.exit does, except that you do not need to import sys first.Also, your specific problem was caused by the fact that you were not actually calling the exit function:However, you should not use this solution because it is considered a bad practice.  Instead, you should use sys.exit or raise as shown above.
