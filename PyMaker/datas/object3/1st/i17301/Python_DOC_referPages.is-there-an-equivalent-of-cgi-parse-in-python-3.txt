I am trying to run the following program:when I run it, I get the following error : I am using Python 3.3, I can't find if there is an alternate to cgi.parse() that I should use.
cgi.parse exists in python 3.3, however you have a python file named cgi.py and it is finding that.Here is where the badly named cgi.py file lives:python 3.3 does not have "has_key" though...So you'll get an error on this line:Changing that to:Makes the code work properly for me.Output:
cgi.parse() exists in Python 3.3. You've called some other file "cgi.py", and Python is finding this instead. Rename that file and any related .py[co] files.
