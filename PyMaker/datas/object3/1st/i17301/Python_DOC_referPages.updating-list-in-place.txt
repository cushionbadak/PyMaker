I have a list of strings, some of them ends with new line symbol. I want to modify this list by removing \n from strings which ends with it. For this purpose I use the following code:The output is the following:So the original list wasn't changed though list is mutable object. What is the reason of such behavior?
You can use slice assignment and a list comprehension:Your code didn't work because it is equivalent to:i.e You're updating the variable s, not the actual list item
because the for loop makes copies of strings.You can use:[s[:-1] if s.endswith('\n') else s for s in aList]Maybe this is simpler, though it will remove also whitespaces.[s.strip() for s in aList]
Using list comprehension and str.rstripAbove will create new list. To modify the original list, use slicing (list[:] = ...):NOTE str.rstrip returns different result from [:-1] when tehre are multiple trailing newlines:
