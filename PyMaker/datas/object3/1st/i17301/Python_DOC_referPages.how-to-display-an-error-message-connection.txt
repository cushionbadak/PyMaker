please tell me whether I catch a possible error? or FileNotFoundError applies only to files in a file system? in this case, what type of exception I do still use the above code?
Here is a list of exceptions raised by requests library. FileNotFoundError is not among them.You should do something like:You can catch other exceptions depending on your needs:So, in case of an unknown host, you should catch requests.exceptions.ConnectionError.Or you might want catching a base exception for all requests exceptions. Consult the docs or the source code to find out what it is.
