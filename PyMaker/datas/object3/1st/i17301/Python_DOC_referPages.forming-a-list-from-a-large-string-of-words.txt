Natural Text
With this code: And this text file: http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~buoni/cs8/labs/lab05/wordlist.txtI am to return a list of all the words in the text file.But when the function is called a la:My computer (core-i5) takes about 5-10 minutes to perform the task and then ultimately freezes.It can return the string of individual words in about 2 seconds though.
I faced no problem. took exactly 0.049 sec to form the list(process program without print). printing will take lot of time.
The 'file' object is a iterable, and you can iterate it with a 'for' stament.  This is more memory efficient.  Read this: Methods of File ObjectsSo, try this code:How works:First, create the empty list.Open the input_file.Iterates the file object line by line.Append each line to the list.Then, return the list.It takes no more than 3 seconds in process the whole file.
