I get the following error when running this code:Attribute error: DisplayWelcome has no attribute 'completeKey'
This is an easy one...  ;-)You forgot to call the constructor of the parent class (cmd.Cmd). There the completekey attribute is automatically declared with a default value. That solves the problem!
