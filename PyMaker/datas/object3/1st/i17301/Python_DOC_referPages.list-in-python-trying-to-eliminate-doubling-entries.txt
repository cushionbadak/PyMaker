I have a question that I didn't find answer anywhere on the internet (it's on python) :I have a class named Pion and is described like this :in the main function, I'm creating a List of Pion :I'm adding these values to this list : Now, I would like to find a way to clean up the list and only have unique combination x and y properties for each element of the list so at the end, my list will have 3 elements and not 5 (I want to eliminate the doubling entries (3,4) and (4,6) and only have one element with Pion(3,4), one element with Pion(4,6) and one element with Pion(2,9)I've tried to implement it in my code and I'm not able to visualize how I'll have to procede.Any clues or possible solutions for this problematic?
Using set:output:If you define __hash__ and __eq__, you can do it simpler way (The order of element is not guaranteed).Alternatively you can use OrderedDict.fromkeys (Orders are preserved):
This is easily solved using sets. You simply have to make your Pion hash able and then you can do this:You can use the add method to add more programattically.
