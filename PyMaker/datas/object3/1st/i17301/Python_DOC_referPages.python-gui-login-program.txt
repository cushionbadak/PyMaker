Me and my friend are making a program that requires a login at the start. We've managed to get the user to input details, and have the program create a text file called (users name) profile with the details in. each one is formatted like this:(Name)(Username)(Password)when you want to log in, the program asks for your name and finds the file with the name (whatever they typed) profile.if it exists, the program then opens a GUI window and asks for the username and password, and if you put in the correct details for the file it has opened, it says that the details are wrong. We think its to do with the variables, but we've tried lot of different ways of laying it out e.t.c and can't find the problem. Can anyone help?(The code I have included is only the GUI part including the bit that isn't working, the rest is fine.
Notice that readlines does not strip the end-of-line character(s) from the lines:So username == line[1] is probably failing since username does not include the end-of-line character. And the same goes for password == line[2].A simple fix would be to use 
I would use python's pickle module to save data. It is much more high level than just saving it in a text file. In my example, I pickled a list of dictionaries.A note about pickle from the docs:Warning:The pickle module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.Also check out shelve and marshal, they perform similar results, or consider saving it in a json file format (python has a json module)
