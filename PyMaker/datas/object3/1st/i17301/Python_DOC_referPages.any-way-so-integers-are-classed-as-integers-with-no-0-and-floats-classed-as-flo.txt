So. In my program I have a part where I check whether the result of a division sum is an integer or not. For example, 6 / 3 = 2 (True) or 7 / 3 = 1.66 (False). The problem is that when I do a division like 6 / 3, the result that should be an integer is classed as a float because it comes out as 2.0 instead of 2. Is there any way so that decimal/float answers are classed as floats with a decimal point, and integer answers are classed as an integer? (The number without the .0 at the end)I have this now:I want this:
Just use float.is_integer().For example, as expressed by OP:No need for anything complex here- and implementing this into your function should be easy.
Does 7 / 3 * 3 = 7?
