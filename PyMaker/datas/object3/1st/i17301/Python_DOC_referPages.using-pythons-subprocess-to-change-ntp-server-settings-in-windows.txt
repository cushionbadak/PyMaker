So I'm trying to change the ntp server settings in Windows (XP and 7) using the following:But this fails miserably. I'm sure the problem lies in how I'm formatting the parameters, but I have yet to come upon how to do it properly.
Your last arguments are not splitted. You probably need to replace '/f /v \"0\" /t REG_SZ ...' with ] + ['/f', '/v', '0', '/t', 'REG_SZ'] + [...].As an alternative, pass the whole command as a string (as you would on the command line).
