I have a csv file like thisI need to change this file tonumber first form.In this form What I have done.The current output Expected output Any clues?
Simple:Edit:If you can use awk, this will be much simpler:-F '\t': fields in the input are separated by tabsOFS="\t": fields in the ouput shall be separated by tabs, too{print $2, $1}: for each line in the input, print the second and the first field
You can read each line from the file (using readlines()) and use the strip() (To remove end of line characters)  and the split() function (To remove white spaces and separate out entities)  with default arguments to convert each line into a temporary array:For example Following this you can use the list pop() method to get the last element and print that to a file, eventually reversing the order and putting the number before the word.For exampleYou can run the above logic in a loop (as shown above in the code snippet) to generate a new file that has the required structure by printing Num and Wrd in the same loop into the file.
