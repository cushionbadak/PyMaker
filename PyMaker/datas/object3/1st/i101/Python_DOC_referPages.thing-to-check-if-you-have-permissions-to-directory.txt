I'm writting an python program and now I'm working at exceptions.I have this but later I will need to delete this folder that I creates.Can someone tell me how to do it easier, please...
Don't.It is almost never worth verifying that you have permissions to perform an operation that your program requires. For one thing, permissions are not the only possible reason for failure. A delete may also fail because of a file lock by another program, for instance. Unless you have a very good reason to do otherwise, it is both more efficient and more reliable to just write your code to try the operation and then abort on failure:Other concerns about your codeUse os.path.join to concatenate file paths: os.makedirs(os.path.join(dest, test)). This will use the appropriate directory separator for the operating system.Why are you looping on failure? In real world programs, simply aborting the entire operation is simpler and usually makes for a better user experience.Are you sure you aren't looking for the tempfile library? It allows you to spit out a unique directory to the operating system's standard temporary location:
I think what you want is os.access.os.access(path, mode, *, dir_fd=None, effective_ids=False, follow_symlinks=True)Use the real uid/gid to test for access to path. Note that most operations will use the effective uid/gid, therefore this routine can be used in a suid/sgid environment to test if the invoking user has the specified access to path. mode should be F_OK to test the existence of path, or it can be the inclusive OR of one or more of R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK to test permissions. Return True if access is allowed, False if not. For example:And the mode contains:Refer: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/os.html#os.access
