Natural Text
I would like to:read lines from the filefind line with specified text (## Required reading)print next lines after the line with specific text IF they contain star (*) at the beginning of the lineif there are no more lines with star (*) (or different line) in the next line, it must stopSo what I did so far is reading the file, getting lines and finding specific text, in this case it is ## Required readingThis will print out the next line but thats all. What I need is to print out all the next lines if they contain star(*) at at the beginning of the line. If not, it should stop printing lines.I was thinking about some while condition but I couldn't figure out howThis is how it looks in original file:but the file also contain other sections, not only ## Required reading section, and I would like to get only the links with star (*) from this section and print them out.
Try this:The last line will set the is_required flag to either True or False depending on the line having the specified text or not.
