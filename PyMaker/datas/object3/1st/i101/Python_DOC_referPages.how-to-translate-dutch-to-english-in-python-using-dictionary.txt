Natural Text
I am trying to translate I am Jason using this code, but when I use it, it prints out nothing, unless I do one word like hello, then it prints out guten tag, but that's it. Plus, I can't turn the input data into lowercase to be able to compare it to the dictionary. What can I do to make this code work?This is the traceback *Please enter your nameJasonPlease enter sentenceI am Jason*
You made a list out of the user's responselists don't have a lower method.First get the user's response and turn it into lower case.Then split the string on whitespace to get a list of individual words.
