I'm trying to use subprocess.Popen() to run a command in my script. The code is:When I print the output, it's printing out the created shell output and not the actual command that's in the list. I tried getting rid of executable='/bin/csh', but then Popen wouldn't even run.I also tried using subprocess.communicate(), but it didn't work either. I would also get the shell output and not the actual command run. I want to completely avoid using shell=True because of security issues.EDIT: In many different attempts, "hrun" is not being recoognized. "hrun" is a Pearl script that is being called, DAR_MeasLogDump is the action and log_file_name is the file that the script will call its action on. Is there any sort of set up or configuration that needs to be done in order for "hrun" to be recognized?
Try:csh is expecting -c "full command here". Without -c I think it just tries to open it as a file.
Specifying an odd shell and an explicit cwd seems completely out of place here (assuming cwdir is defined to the current directory).If the first argument to subprocess is a list, no shell is involved.If you need this to be run under a legacy version of Python, maybe use check_output instead of run.You generally want to avoid Popen unless you need to do something which the higher-level wrapper functions cannot do.
You are creating an instance of subprocess.Popen but not executing it.You should try:Args should be passed as a sequence if you do not use shell=True, and then using executable should not be required.Note that if you are not using advanced features from Popen, the doc recommends using subprocess.run:
This works with cat example:I think you need only change to your 'hrun' command
