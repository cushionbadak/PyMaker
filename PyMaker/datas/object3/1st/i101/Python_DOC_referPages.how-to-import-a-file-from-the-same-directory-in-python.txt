I have the following directory structure in python. In mel2samp.py I want to import  TacotronSTFT from tacatron2.layers using these lines of codeBut it throws an error ImportError: No module named tacotron2.layers. 
But it is recommended to make tacotron2 as a package by adding init.py Then you can use it asfrom tacotron2.layers import TacotronSTFT #Use TacotronSTFT
Also need an empty __init__.py file in tacotron2 folder. After that you can do: 
You can make your folder a package by adding __init__.pyYou can read more about it hereThe __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
