I am making a To Do List app in Python using Arrays or Lists. I want to check if the array containing all "to-do tasks" is full or not. If it is full I would then inform the user that the list is full. I am still a beginner.
Are you saying that you've limited the number of possible tasks to 10? and if each one has a task attached then the list should notify the user it's full?If so, you know that an empty task is "10.)" so at max it's length is 4 (4 characters), so if any items length is less than or equal to 4 then it's emptyCan I also advise of a better way to create the todo list? Use a dictionary.and to add a new task is easy!and to update a task is even easier!Here is how I would do it:
You don't have to define todo_list with numbering. Just define the maximum size of todo_list and check if length of todo_list is bigger than maximum size.
