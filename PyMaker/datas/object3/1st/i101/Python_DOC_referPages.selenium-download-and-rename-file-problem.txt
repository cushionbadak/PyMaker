I am using selenium to login a page, and download some tiff files, now i have a variable downloadurl, it contains an array of url links which i scraped from the website. now i am using the below code to download files:I do get all files downloaded but with no names, eg. img(1), img(2) ...Now my problem is: I want driver.get(downloadurl) download files one by one according to downloadurl array sequence, and rename the file right after  it is downloaded according to title variable which is an array, then download the next file, and rename...P.S. I avoid to use requests because the login procedure is very complicated and requires authorization cookies.Many thanks for the help!
To elaborate on my comment:This will work assuming that "img(1).png" will be renamed and then the next download will come in as "img(1).png" yet again.The hardest part would be making my_list_of_links_and_names but if you have the data in separate lists, just zip() them together. You can also generate your own title every loop based on some criteria... 
First we will create a function (Rename_file) that renames the downloaded image from its folder.Then we Apply this function in array of url links:Sample code:I'm quite sure on the Rename function I created but I haven't really tested this with an array of url links since I really can't think of where could I test it. Hopefully this works on you. Please let me know :-)
