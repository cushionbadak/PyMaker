I have a for loop that is continually passing a parameter to an API. I am taking the responses from the API call and appending them to 3 lists. Once the for loop is completed, I am creating a pandas dataframe which I am then write to a .csv file. The entire loop takes like 20 min to run and I just got an error 10 min in, so I lost all the data before it was able to write to a dataframe and then .csv file.How would you handle this situation better?
The simplest solution is to just wrap the loop in a try/catch block like so:Execution will then continue to the subsequent part of your code.You could also put the Try/Except block inside the loop if you want to continue working on subsequent list items.See the docs on exception handling for more detail on how to use try/except and do more nuanced conditionals on error type.
