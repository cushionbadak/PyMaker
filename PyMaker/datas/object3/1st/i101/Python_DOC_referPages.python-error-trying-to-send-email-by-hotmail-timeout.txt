My code is as follows:I always get this error when I try to send a email. Could you help me.
I recommend reading the example in the manual located at https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.htmlYou would need to make sure your firewall operating system and LAN router allows outgoing traffic on port 25.Also, set verbose debug level as per manual server.set_debuglevel(1)Try sending out test emails via localhost using terminal commands, to make sure the os can definitely send out emails, and that it isn't a python code issue.
