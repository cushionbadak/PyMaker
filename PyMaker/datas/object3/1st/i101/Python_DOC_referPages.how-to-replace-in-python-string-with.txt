Natural Text
I'm trying to parse through text scraped from reddit and clean it up for nlp, but the text has backslashes before each single quote. When I try to use string.replace, however there seems to be no effect, with \' staying the sameto be clear, there is no issue with replace itself, it removes the end-lines just fine. How do I make replace recognize these characters?
If you're fine with using regex you can try this -gives 123132''213'asGiven that you want to only replace the backslashes that are followed by single quotation marks and not all of them.
you can write chr(92) to substitute \https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chrReturn the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is  the integer i. For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a', while  chr(8364) returns the string 'â‚¬'. This is the inverse of ord().
