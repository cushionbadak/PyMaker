I am using python unittest and trying to catch the exceptions. I have tried with self.fail but in that case, once there is an exception, it is a failure and it stops running the rest of the codeWhat can I try so even if one case fails, it still executes the rest of the cases ?I am trying to avoid printing the exceeptions.Code currently using:
Use the try and except block and name the said 'error' on the except blockE.g. Error is 'NameError'You can read more here Handling Exceptions
You can make every test to be a function and call it from the main block. This way each one will get executed and the failed once will return the fail reason to be filed by main block.
