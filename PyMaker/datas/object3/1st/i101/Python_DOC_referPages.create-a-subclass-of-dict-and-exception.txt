For a web application I want to have a raise-able dict.How can I avoidand have some raise-able dict-like exception that can directly be JSON-dumped without having to access a special attribute of the exception subclass or having to use json.dumps's default= argument?
Can you simply define the methods that you need for the exception to work as a dictionary and also define a dumps method of your exception?
