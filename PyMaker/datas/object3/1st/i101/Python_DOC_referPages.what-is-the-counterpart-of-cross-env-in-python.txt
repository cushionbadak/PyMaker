If so then you can set the environment variable NODE_ENV to devlopment by using the assignment expression os.environ['NODE_ENV'] = 'development'. os.environ should work on all operating systems you memntioned. After that you can run the command nodemon --watch src --experimental-modules ./src/app.mjs on Python using check_call function from Python'ssubprocess module. Remember to set check_call env argument to os.environ in order to load the environment variables you set into env.Here is an example filescript.py:So when you want to run dev mode, you can enter the command:
