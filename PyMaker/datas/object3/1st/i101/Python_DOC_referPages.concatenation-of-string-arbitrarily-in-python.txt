I have to generate the concatenation of the string:My function has n and stuff as inputs it has to generate the following arbitrary sequenceHere N is the no of input strings to be considered.Sample Inputs:N = 3 , stuff = ['x','y','z']Sample Ouputs:xy xz yzExplanation of output:xy -> combination of 1 and 2xz -> combination of 1 and 3yz -> combination of 2 and 3The range of N is not specific to 3. i.e Range of N <= 1000. My code:My Output:xy  yy  zyI understood I failed to implement the indexing in list properly.But also I could not fix this bug.Question1:Can anyone help me to fix the list indexing in loops ?Question2:Time Complexity is O(n^2) Can I optimize to O(n)?
Maybe it's not what you are looking for. But try this one for beginner:or you can simplify by using itertools.combination:
You could achieve this with list comprehensions and itertools.combinations:with 2 being the length of your desired combination
