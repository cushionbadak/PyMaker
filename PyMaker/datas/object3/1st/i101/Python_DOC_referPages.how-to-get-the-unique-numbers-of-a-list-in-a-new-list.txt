I have this list:I want to have this as the output:So I only want the unique numbers to have an output.This is what I tried, but it does not work:My output is:I have no clue how to fix this? I am a python beginner so can anyone explain what the answer is and why that should be the solution? Many thanks in advance!
Use a Counter object.chain.from_iterable "flattens" my_list. The Counter compiles how many times each element from the flattened list is seen, and the generator expression sends only the keys mapped to a value of 1 to set.Some of the intermediate values involved:
I had an earlier answer posted that wasn't right. I don't like to give up, and I wanted to find an answer to this question that only used sets.  I'm not saying that this is a better answer than the others, but it does achieve at least my own goal of not bringing any extra packages into the solution:Output:There's probably a better solution even to using just sets. I always want to try to use the simplest set of tools possible because I think it is the most understandable to do so, and will often turn out to be as efficient as anything else as well.
Not a fancy python solution but what you probably want is to build a dict where the key is a number in the list and the value is the number of times it occurs.This solution is by no way optimal since we are performing to many iterations:
I agree with chepner on using a Counter.  Using functools.reduce to flatten the list came from here.
