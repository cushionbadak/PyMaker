I have a large dataset of news articles, 48000 to be precise. I have made ngrams of each article where n = 3.my ngrams look like this:now I need to make a binary matrix of each shingle and article:At first I have kept all the shingles in a single list. After that, I have tried this to check if it works.as one is set and another is string it does not work. any suggestions, how to make it work? or any other approach? thank you
