I have written the following code to modify my custom python class Point using the ctypes library, following the approch I found in this tutorial. The wrap_function is just a little helper for ease of use, as this is a MWE from a bigger project. On the python side: And on the C-side: When executing the python file in Windows 7 cmd, it prints the following output: Why does it stop at 18.000 ? I tried it several times, sometimes the loop reaches 19 or 20k, but it never gets higher than that. Does it have something to do with the array initialization on the C-side? Did I mess up the parameter passing on the python side? Bonus question: How can I pass a list of these points to the C-side with ctypes?
Although NumPy adds an additional complexity level, every piece of info can be found on [Python 3]: ctypes - A foreign function library for Python.The (main) problem was that the Point structure was differently defined in C and Python. Also, the function expects a Point*, so byref must be used (it works without it as well, I don't know whether this is Undefined Behavior's happy case, or ctypes does that silently - due to argtypes).I've adapted your code in order to work.dll.c:code.py:Output:@EDIT0:If you want to handle a list of Points, you can use arrays. Something like:
