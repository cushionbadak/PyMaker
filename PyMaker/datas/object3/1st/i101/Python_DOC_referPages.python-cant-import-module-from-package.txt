I have a flask restful project with the following layout (file names changed for convenience)foo/ is just a folder containing code for one of the API endpoints, I'm planning to add others in the future, for this reason I have common/util.py file which contains reusable functions that I will use with other API endpoints.foo/main.pyin foo/utilities.py I have classes with methods that get some data, I import those classes to foo/main.py to return JSON responseclasses in foo/utilities.py also uses some functions from common/util.py but when I try to import something from common/util.py to foo/utilities.py I get import common.utilModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'common'What could be causing this? I tried importing various ways:from common.util import my_funcfrom .common.util import my_funcfrom myproject.common.util import my_funcbut none worked.This is myproject/app.py in case it matters:I'm doing all of this in activated virtualenv if it matters
from common.util import my_funcIn Python 3 this is an absolute import, that is, the directory with common/ subdirectory must be in sys.path. In your situation it's certainly a wrong approach.from .common.util import my_funcThis import expects common to be a subdirectory of foo which is also not the case.from myproject.common.util import my_funcThis is finally the best approach but for it to work the parent directory of myproject/ subdirectory must be in sys.path. Either you install the entire myproject or add the parent directory to $PYTHONPATH environment variable or add the directory to sys.path in foo/main.py. Something like:or/home/to/parentdir is the directory where myproject/ is.After installing myproject or adding its parent directory to sys.path you can also use relative import. You need to remember that common is a sibling package comparing to foo so the import must be not from .common but from ..common:
