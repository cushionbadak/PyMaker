I used pickle for a few months to save my ML-models and was able to load them without any problems but recently after Reinstalling Windows and Python I am getting this error message when I try to load the exact same model:AttributeError: type object 'sklearn.neighbors.ball_tree.NeighborsHeap' has no attribute '__reduce_cython__'Does anyone know what is causing this?I used Python 3.6 (64bit) before and I am using the same one right now.
Most probably, you are using a different version of sklearn.According to search results for __reduce_cython__ in Cython's codebase, it's added by Cython to some compiled types to make __reduce__ work correctly or something. So its absense likely means changes in the affected classes or their hierarchy.
