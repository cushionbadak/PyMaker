Natural Text
I had to create and write to a text file from Blender python script. the documentation here says that with the fdopen() function one can open the txt file as a stream in your code. However, fdopen() does not seem to be implemented in python api in blender. Instead, it is commented as #supply fdopen(). you can actually do what fdopen() must do with another function open() which is a built-in function of the python api (seemingly does not belong to os). Also, if I use os.open() in blender, it returns an integer instead of a file. Does this all mean that the Blender os module implementation is different from the 'native' python os? I mean, this library is 're-written' in C by blender devs? I have no computer science background, so I cannot really understand, why that is happening, if I am right in my assumption. My understanding is that BDFL has written os module in C and it should now perfectly work for everyone, everywhere. why not simply take it and embed in python api in blender? can someone explain this to me in some detail?
Blender uses default python os module. os.open returns a file descriptor (int); builtin global function open returns file object - that's what you should use for your regular file access.
