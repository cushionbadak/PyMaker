I have nearly 5000+ xml files in a directory. I am planning to read them one by one and parse them, however I am not sure os.listdir(path) is a good way, os.listdir(path) returns a list with names of the files inside that directory. After that with the for loop which takes the string names of the files and giving them to Parser class object might not be a good way, since the parser would searh the files again, second time, with their names inside the same directory.Is there a better way? Am I missing something, Maybe a pointer logic for finding inside directory?EDIT: I think this question is off topic and should be deleted since parser doesnt search for string name inside the dir, in other words I believe Operating system handles it in the back. As you can as following lines inside ET object of Parser, it directly opens
