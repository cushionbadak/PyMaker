I have folder and code structure like thistransaction.pyexecutetransaction.pytest_execute_transaction.pywhen I execute test_execute_transaction, it is able to import executetransaction from core folder but I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transaction' on the import code line in executetransaction module.If I runexecute_transaction({"a":"b"}) in executetransaction module then transaction is imported as expected and I get "in create object".I have added empty __init__.py in all folders. This is my first time posting question here, please tell me if more details are required.
Ok your problem is how you import the transaction module in executetransaction.py. Change from transaction import Transaction to from .transaction import Transaction. The dot operator tells python that you're wanting to import from the current package.
This may help you Using local importsWhen importing the package, Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package subdirectory. docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules
