I have two Python files, file 1 and file 2 that does two separate things. I want to run them together. I am using VS2017The pseudo code for file 1 is:Currently when I use this format, the subprocess does start the file 2 and run it but the rest of the code for foo2() after the if-else condition runs only when the process is terminated( another condition that I have setup inside file 2). I am trying to work it in such a way that, file 2 will start running in the background once the if-else condition is met, and will give outputs in the command window but also run the rest of file 1. Not pausing the running of file 1 till file2 is done. If not in subprocess is there another way to start both files simultaneous but control the output of file 2 by passing the value of the "variable". I am trying to figure a proper work-around.I am new to Python.EDIT 1:I used the command:Even if I use process.kill(), the subprocess still runs in the background. It won't quit even if use the task manager.I also wanted to pass a variable to the second file. I am looking into something like But as far as I have looked, it was told that I can only pass strings through a subprocess. is it true?
I believe you can do this with both multithreading and multiprocessing. If you want to start them both right away and then monitor the variable, you can connect them with a pipe or queue.starting when triggered:starting right away:
