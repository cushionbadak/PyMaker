I am struggling with one piece of this code and can not seem to get it right. I am attempting to access and print a single cell value from a csv in python. I have the list of rows and columns to specify each single cell but face index errors when I attempt to turn the file into a list and then specify[row][column]. Is there anyway I can get the single cell str values without using pandas? I would prefer to use the csv module if possibleCSV file 'annotations_full.csv CSV file 'results.csv'
If you want want to access / view / print the specified cell value, then you can do the following:CSV File: simple.csvPython code to access specified code:
The code snippet below focuses on accessing cells of results.csv, based on coordinates provided in annotations_full.csvIt first creates a list of dicts (OrderedDicts as of Python 3.6) by iterating over a csv.DictReader instance on results.csv.It then iterates over a DictReader instance on annotations_full.csv, fetching the coordinates for the lookup of the results.csv cells and prints the cell content, along with some safeguards for invalid column names and row numbers.Note the [rnum - 1] used to provide the index for the result_content list. Python lists are zero-based; unless the row numbers in annotations_full.csv account for that (e.g. the first row in results.csv is referenced with the row number 0) you need that to access the correct list element.Content of sample annotations_full.csv:Content of sample results.csv:Output of the code snippet using the sample files:
