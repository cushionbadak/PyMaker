The below works in Python 2 but not 3. Is there a way to access local variables in Python 3? Or an alternative solution to these cases?Error in Python 3: KeyError: 'local_var'Below is a simpler toy example of above (works in Python 2 but not 3)Error in Python 3: KeyError: 'local_var'
As explained by @user2357112 in a comment, list comprehensions have their own local scope (and thus locals() dict) in Python 3.Compare:WithIn the first case, the function locals is called inside the list comprehension code while in the second the result of the function call is passed as an argument to the list comprehension.The dis module confirms that:The locals function was not called. You see the call in the code of the list comprehension:While             The locals function is called before the list comprehension execution, the iter is built and passed to the list comprehension.Concerning your specific problem, you can force the evaluation of locals outside of the list comprehension (note the i=i: this is not a positional argument):If your version of Python is 3.6 or newer, you can use (f strings)[https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-498-formatted-string-literals]However, I think it's not a good idea to make a lookup in locals() for every iteration. You can build your format_string once and use it in the list comprehension: Or (>= 3.6):Then you have:
