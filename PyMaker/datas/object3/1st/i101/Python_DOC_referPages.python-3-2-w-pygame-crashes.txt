Well, I was happy starting on Pygame with a bit of knowledge on python, But while i was following some starter tutorials i noticed that, At the moment of running my code the Pygame window didn't see to respond, so i put some "print" commands to see how far did it get, I noticed that it stopped on the Loop, Any ideas on how i can fix it? I will leave the code around here
