I am not sure about your question as it has undergone lots of edits. I think this is what you are searching for...
You can sort a list. So you can sort the list that contains your dictionaries using one value or more that are contained in the dictionary itself as key, but you cannot sort a dictionary. Dictionaries don't work like that.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict
