My Scenario looks like this, where i have identified the columns having NaN values using,Now, I need to find the correlation between these columns and target variable. So I tried something like,train[[nan_cols,'SalePrice']].corr() and got the below error:KeyError: "[('LotFrontage', 'Alley', 'MasVnrType', 'MasVnrArea', 'BsmtQual', >'BsmtCond', 'BsmtExposure', 'BsmtFinType1', 'BsmtFinType2', 'Electrical', >'FireplaceQu', 'GarageType', 'GarageYrBlt', 'GarageFinish', 'GarageQual', >'GarageCond', 'PoolQC', 'Fence', 'MiscFeature')] not in index"So, is there a way for me to pass my column names as a tuple in pandas? I tried the same with list and Series as well but as they were mutable, it didnt work out. Please suggest.
By this lineyou trying to access rows. Also [nan_cols,'SalePrice'] gives a list of a tuple and an object: [(tuple),object]A good practice is to use loc in order to locate required rows/columns. To access columns I would suggest:orMore on * operator you can read in python tutorialHope that helped.
Try below one:Why do we need to pass columns as a tuple. To index in second line, we need only a list of columns.
