I have data stored in a byte array. How can I convert this data into a hex string?Example of my byte array:
Using str.format:or using formatNote: In the format statements, the 02 means it will pad with up to 2 leading 0s if necessary. This is important since [0x1, 0x1, 0x1] i.e. (0x010101) would be formatted to "111" instead of "010101" or using bytearray with binascii.hexlify:Here is a benchmark of above methods in Python 3.6.1:Result:Methods using format do provide additional formatting options, as example separating numbers with spaces " ".join, commas ", ".join, upper-case printing "{:02X}".format(x)/format(x, "02X"), etc., but at a cost of great performance impact.
Consider the hex() method of the bytes type on Python 3.5 and up:EDIT: it's also much faster than hexlify (modified @falsetru's benchmarks above)Result:

If you have a numpy array, you can do the following:
Or, if you are a fan of functional programming:
