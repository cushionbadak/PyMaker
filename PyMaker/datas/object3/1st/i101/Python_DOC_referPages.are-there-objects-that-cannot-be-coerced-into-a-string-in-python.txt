In Python, can any object be coerced into a string unless its __str__ method is overloaded to raise an exception?
Everything in Python is an object. The type object has a method for string coercion as youâ€™ve noted. If some object did not have this method defined, it would not be an object. This contradicts the first statement. QED. 
Yes, any Python object can be converted to a str.
Yes:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.htmlSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the repr() function or the slightly different str() function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the print() function.
