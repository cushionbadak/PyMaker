I am trying to parse a host file that is basically a host file like below.What I would like to figure out is how to make a dictionary out of this with the headers being keys and the servers being a list as the value part of the dictionary.I have not been able to find this or at least have been able to put it into working order. I'm kinda stuck with the code below.Which does output correctly but I can't wrap my head around getting it into a dictionary like above.Sample output currently
This one was pretty fun. I edited your string in the example below to add moreLet me know if you'd like for me to explain
Maybe you want something like it?CodeOutput{'prod': ['server1', 'server2', 'server3'], 'uat': ['server4', 'server5', 'server6']}
