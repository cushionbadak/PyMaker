I am unable to change the date into the float format. When I use them I get the following error. return array(a, dtype, copy=False, order=order) ValueError: could not  convert string to float: '24/03/2019'
You can't parse a string like 24/03/2019 info a float/int since it has non numeric chars.My advice would be to parse that string date into a datetime:If you really need to parse it into a numeric value and the dates are all like the one you provided, 24/03/2019, I would advise to use a regex and parse it into an int instead of float.
