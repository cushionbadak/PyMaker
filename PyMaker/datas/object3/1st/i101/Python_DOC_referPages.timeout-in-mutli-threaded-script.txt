Unlike this: Timeout on a function callI'm trying to timeout a line of code within a thread (not the main thread).Signal only works in main thread, so I can't use that.The line I want to limit is a web request with the requests library:I can't use requests built-in timeout, because it doesn't always time out under certain conditions.
If you are using python's standard threading library, I don't think there is an easy way to terminate the thread once it has started. There are some options mentioned in this thread (:D), you could perhaps try.If you don't care when the thread completes and just want control back, you can provide timeout in join method. It would look like below,Other option (which I like) would be to use concurrent library,Quoting from docs on result(timeout=None),If the call hasnâ€™t completed in timeout seconds, then a  concurrent.futures.TimeoutError will be raised. timeout can be an int  or float. If timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to  the wait time
