Natural Text
I recently read this sentence in Django documentation, but couldn't understand the meaning, please explain it in simple words.Django aims to follow Python's “batteries included” philosophy.
As documented in the official tutorial, Python has a driving principle to include in the standard libraries all the quality tools you'll need to do nearly any job. Django, similarly, comes with modules to fit nearly any use case.Contrast this with some other languages with much more minimal syntax and stdlib (Go comes to mind) which are much closer to "Batteries Not Included."
