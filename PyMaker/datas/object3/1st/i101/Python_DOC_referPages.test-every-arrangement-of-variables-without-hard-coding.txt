I have 9 different variables, we will call them a - i, I want to test if a+b+c == d+e+f & a+b+c == g+h+i & a+b+c == a+d+g & a+b+c == b+e+h & a+b+c == c+f+i & a+b+c == a+e+i & a+b+c == c+e+g. But there is one problem. I want to test all the possible arrangements of this such as swapping b and h or even more variables. I have also calculated that there are 45360 different arrangements. I am wondering if there is any possible way to do this... I would appreciate any help!
You can use itertools.permutations to generate the list of all permutations, then you can either sum them, or write your own custom add function:Hint: be careful with floating points, as floating point additions are not commutative, a+b is not necessarily equal to b+a, and they're not associative, (a+b)+c is not necessarily equal to a+(b+c). This shouldn't be an issue if all the numbers are integers.
