What is the expectation of the number of times you need to roll a fair die until you have seen every number?I have been asked to define a function that runs a monte carlo simulation that returns an estimate for the question above. My understanding of the solution is that I need to:Define a function that takes the number of trials as an inputGenerates a random integer between 1 and 6 (the number of sides on a die)Store that integer in a list if it is not already in the listCount the number of trials it takes to reach said condition, and return that countI am fairly new to programming and Python in particular so I am struggling to identify why my syntax does not produce an output when the function is called and was hoping someone could help steer me in right directionThis is my code :
You are probably not printing whatever the funtion returns - that why it displays nothing.Use print(roll()) instead of roll() to print the result you get.You have too many loops and your solution uses far too much memory space.Consider being unlucky and having to roll 1.000.000.000.000 times to get the first 6 - you'll save 1.000.000.000.000 other numbers in a list .. thats a lot of memory.You can use a set to remember seen numbers and a counter to count how long it took to find all:Output (4 starts):
Your while condition does not express what you expect it to be. You probably wanted to use list comprehensionalso, you don't want 3 layers of loop, only two: one for each trial and the other while trial is not complete. A working example, close to your original post would bewhereas a more efficient solution uses set to efficiently do the same thing as the previous solution achieves with any([side not in collection for side in possible_sides]):Or, even more efficiently, just check if len(sides_rolled) < 6, as pointed out in an answer by Patrick Artner.
You can simplify your code considerably by using a set instead of a list and also changing your iteration logic:This code can be used like this:
