I am trying to parallelize my function , but i am not able to get it to work,This is what it looks like-Now this does not work , it does not parallelize properly ,and when it does,it runs the same file on every process.Any suggestions on how i can parallelize this would be really helpful.Thanks in advance.
The idea is to have many 'workers' where each one of them gets a video to work on.Something like this
