Basically: If I declare a bytearray somewhere:arr = bytearray(somestr)Then create a memoryview of it:view = memoryview(arr)Can I be sure that for as long as I have a reference to the view object somewhere, that the bytearray will remain?i.e:Will garbage collection ever remove the original bytearray? Or does this count as a reference?
It counts as a reference. However you can call release() on the view to remove that reference:Note that you can access the underlying object from the view using the obj attribute.In generaly, anything that is not described explicitly as a weak reference holds an actual reference. In memory-managed languages that's the default.
