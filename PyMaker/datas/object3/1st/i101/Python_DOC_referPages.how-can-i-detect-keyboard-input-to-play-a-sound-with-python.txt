I am making a program that will play a sound when you press a key (or just type) on the keyboard. I just started to work on it, and I am trying to use pygame.key.get_pressed() to check for keyboard input. I got to here with the code:It works by checking if a True value is in spam (spam is the name of the list pygame returns). key.get_pressed returns a list of True/False values for every key, True if pressed, False if not.The problem with this code is that when I run it, it only outputs None. This means that I am not detecting the keyboard input.If anyone knows how to fix this, or a better way to do it, I would greatly appreciate it!Thanks!
pygame.key.get_pressed() gets the states of all keybord buttons. It returns a list.But, note the values which are returned by pygame.key.get_pressed() are only updated when the key event is get events from the queue by pygame.event.get(). In simple words, pygame.key.get_pressed() only works, if there is an event loop, too.You can evaluate a specific key (e.g. space key):If you want to evaluate if any key is pressed, then you've to evaluate if any() value in allKeys is True:Another solution would be to check if the KEYDOWN event occurred. The next pending event can be fetched by pygame.event.get():
