In a python script, i want to be able to connect to the gmail server, and then download all my emails into a single .mbox file. Is this possible? If so, what library is used and where can i get it from? Thanks
imaplib from Python standard library.mbox format usually means just that the messages are catenated after each other, with the caveat that each line that starts with From needs to be escaped with >, very easy to write out by hand from Python script, though also supported by standard library with mailbox.mbox
Standard imaplib is working fine for me. Another standard library mailbox could be useful as well.
