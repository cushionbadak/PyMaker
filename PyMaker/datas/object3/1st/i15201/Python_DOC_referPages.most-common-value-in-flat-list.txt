What are some ways to get the most common value in a list?So far I'm doing:But I was wondering if there was a list method or something 'simpler' to do this?
You can use max with list.count, but it's not efficient as your current solution:
That's pretty much as good as it gets - although I'd suggest using .most_common(1) which will be more efficient* than .most_common() and use it like so:*Source from collections.Counter:
This is almost equivalent to what @JonClement 's solution doesAs heapq.nlargest will runin this specific case where n=1 which performs the same as above just without the list of a single tuple.
