As far as I know the eval function lets a python program run python code within itself.I want to run a print() command using eval function in Python2.7, but I received the following error : Note that I don't have any problem with this command it python3.4 :
In Python 2 print xxx is a statement, not an expression. eval is for evaluating expressions; you can use exec for executing statements.In Python 3, print(xxx) is a function call, so it can be evaluated.
