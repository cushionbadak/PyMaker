After I port my script to Windows from Mac (both python 2.7.*), I find that all the logging not working in subprocess, only the father's logging are write to file. Here is my example code:the output only write this is father into log.out, and the child's log missing. How to make logging woking in child process?
Each child is an independent process, and file handles in the parent may be closed in the child after a fork (assuming POSIX). In any case, logging to the same file from multiple processes is not supported. See the documentation for suggested approaches.
