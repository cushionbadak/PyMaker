This question already has an answer here:What is the source code of the “this” module doing?                    5 answers                Using Python 2.7.Saw that when importing the module "this", an output to the screen (interpreter) is automatically generated.It outputs some kind of text labeled as "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters."I am curious as how that is done.How does one have a module output, or do anything, immediately when it is imported?[EDIT] This not a duplicate, as the referenced question is on the "ROT13" encoding being used in the module "this", and not as to how to invoke an action from an imported module.
when you import something, you are doing the equivalent of copying and pasting a class onto the top of your file. inside that package, anything can be done that can be done in your normal python file, hence a print statement. 
Try this you'll get the hang of it:main.pyhelp.py
