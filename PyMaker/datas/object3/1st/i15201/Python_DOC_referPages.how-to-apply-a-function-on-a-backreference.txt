Say I have strings like the following:I would like to spot the integer numbers (in the example above, there is only one number, 3), and replace them with a value larger by 1, i.e., the desired result should beIn Python, I can use:to append a 9 at the end of the integer numbers matched. However, I would like to apply something more general on \1. If I define a function:How do I apply f() on \1, so that I can replace the matched strings in old_string with something like f(\1)?
In addition to having a replace string, re.sub allows you to use a function to do the replacements:From the docs:re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping  occurrence of pattern. The function takes a single match object  argument, and returns the replacement string.
