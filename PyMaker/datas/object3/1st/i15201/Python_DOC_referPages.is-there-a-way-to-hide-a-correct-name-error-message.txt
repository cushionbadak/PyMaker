I'm working on writing a simple function that will take the square root of a number. The user is prompted to provide a integer. However, if they provide a string--I'd like there to be a message "You did not give me a number".  See code below: Works okay with a integer: With a string: The error makes perfect sense since answer isn't defined. However, is there a way to just print/return the exception "You did not give me a number" without the NameError message?Thank you for you help! 
You can add an else block to the end of  your try/except:The code inside the else block will only be run if the try block completes successfully.  Here is a link to the documentation for more information.
