Natural Text
I have no idea where to start with this. I need to write a function that will return a string of numbers in ordinal value. So likewould give me '4123'would give me '4213'I thought maybe I could make a dictionary and make the each letter from the string associate it with an integer, but that seems too inefficient and I still don't know how to put them in order.
You could sort the unique characters in the input string and apply indices to each letter by using the enumerate() function:The second argument to enumerate() is the integer at which to start counting; since your ordinals start at 1 you use that as the starting value rather than 0. set() gives us the unique values only.ordinals then is a dictionary mapping character to an integer, in alphabetical order.Demo:Breaking that all down a little:
Take a look at string module, especially maketrans and translateWith those, your code may look likeand pass your strings as variable
You could make a character translation table and use the translate() string method:
