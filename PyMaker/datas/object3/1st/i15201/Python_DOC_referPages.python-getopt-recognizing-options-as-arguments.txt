I'm trying to parse some options when running a Python script.However, when I run thisThe print(args, opts) yields this.Why is it parsing options as arguments?
getopt requires that all - options come first. -p 4 instead came after a non-dash option.python tsp.py -p 4 cities.txt will be parsed correctly.You may want to switch to using the argparse library instead; it is far more flexible and can parse optional command line switches in any location, as it also handles required arguments explicitly.
