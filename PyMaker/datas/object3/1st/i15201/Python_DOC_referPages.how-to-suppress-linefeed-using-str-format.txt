Natural Text
I know how to use end="" with the print function in Python 3.0 to suppress a linefeed, but how do I suppress a linefeed while using the str.format method?
The newline is being added by the print function, not str.format.  From the docs:print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end.Notice how the end parameter defaults to '\n' (a newline). There is no way for str.format to remove this newline because it isn't there until after the formatted string is given to print.You will need to use end="":
