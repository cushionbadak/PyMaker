I am trying to create a 2D Array class and want to make the matrix iterable. Does anyone know how to go about doing this? I am a new to classes in python and still getting the hang of things. Also, how would str be implemented in my main? If i just use print(customMatrix) will that go and use the str method?Heres what I'm working on. I know some of it isn't correct :)
Actually there is a yield keyword which is handy in this case, It can be thought of as a return statement which saves the previous state while returning anything ,so when you call the method it first yields self.matrix[0][0] on the second call to this method it would yield self.matrix[0][1] and so on..
Read up on generators and the yield keyword, they're fun to use!
