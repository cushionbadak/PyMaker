I want to find the difference between two times such as (05:33, 16:01).  So I know I need to write a script that will do that, and I can do that with these def's:Any help is appreciated.
If you only have hours and minutes, you can use timedelta which is pretty straightforward:I don't have the actual input you're using, but seems like you know how to map the strings to the creation arguments yourself :)Generally you can map strings such as '05'33' using split and int:
Yes, definitely datetime is what you need here. Specifically, the strptime function, which parses a string into a time object.That gets you a timedelta object that contains the difference between the two times. You can do whatever you want with that, e.g. converting it to seconds or adding it to another datetime.
I highly recommend using the standard Python libraries for this. See the Python reference.
