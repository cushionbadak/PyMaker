I'm doing a Merge Sort assignment in Python, but I keep have the error of RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceededHere's my code:Can someone tell me why? To make the problem more usable to others, feel free to edit the question to make it make more sense. ^_^
When you write a recursive function, you should be careful about the base case, which decides when the recursion should come to an end.In your case, the base case is missing. For example, if the list has only one element, then you don't have recursively sort it again. So, that is your base condition.Note: The variable name list shadows the builtin function list. So better avoid using builtin names.Since you are doing lot of pop(0)s, its worth noting that it is not efficient on lists. Quoting Python's official documentation,Though list objects support similar operations, they are optimized for fast fixed-length operations and incur O(n) memory movement costs for pop(0) and insert(0, v) operations which change both the size and position of the underlying data representation.So, the better alternative would be to use collections.deque, instead of list, if you are popping a lot. The actual popping from a deque is done with popleft method.
You don't have an exit point in merge_sort. You need to do something like:You always need to have a conditional exit in recursion function: if COND then EXIT else RECURSION_CALL.
