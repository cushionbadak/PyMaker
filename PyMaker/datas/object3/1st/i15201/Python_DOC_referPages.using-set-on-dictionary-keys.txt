For my program, I wish to cleanly check whether any elements in a list is a key in a dictionary. So far, I can only think to loop through the list and checking.However, is there any way to simplify this process? Is there any way to use sets? Through sets, one can check whether two lists have common elements.
This should be easy using the builtin any function:This is quick, efficient and (IMHO) quite readible.  What could be better?  :-)Of course, this doesn't tell you which keys are in the dict.  If you need that, then you're best recourse is to use dictionary view objects:
You can test for an intersection between the dictionary's keys and the list items using dict.keys:Demo:Note that in Python 2.x, the method is called dict.viewkeys.
As far as efficiency goes, you can't be any more efficient than looping through the list.  I would also argue that looping through the list is already a simple process.
