I have got some code to attach files from an email using MIME module however each time I send the email I want it to automatically send only the first 5 most recent pictures in the file.I am a beginner to Python so help would be appreciated
Use os.stat to fetch atime, ctime or mtime. Then simple compare timestamps (or use some other logic based on datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp)
