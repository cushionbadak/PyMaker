I am attempting to write a C extension for python. With the code (below) I get the compiler warning:And it fails at run time with this error:I have spent literally hours searching for a solution with no joy. I have tried multiple minor changes to syntax, I even found a post suggesting the method has been deprecated. However I find no replacement. Here is the code:If it helps here is my setup.py :And the test code in test.py :Any help would be much, much appreciated.
The code you have would work fine in Python 2.x, but Py_InitModule is no longer used in Python 3.x.  Nowadays, you create a PyModuleDef structure and then pass a reference to it to PyModule_Create.The structure would look like:And then your PyMODINIT_FUNC function would look like:Note that the name of the PyMODINIT_FUNC function must be of the form PyInit_<name> where <name> is the name of your module.I think it would be worthwhile if you read Extending in the Python 3.x documentation.  It has a detailed description of how to build extension modules in modern Python.
I ran into the same problem with Py_InitModule(). I started with the aforementioned Python 3 docs, specifically the "Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter" doc. But that doc's chapter entitled "A Simple Example"  leaves out details. So. I googled this scipy lecture:http://www.scipy-lectures.org/advanced/interfacing_with_c/interfacing_with_c.htmlwhich is in many ways more suitable for someone new to Python-C API extensions ... except it has not been updated for Python v3. So ... consult the scipy lecture, and the Python 3 docs, and this StackOverflow discussion, culling the pertinent information from each for your needs.
