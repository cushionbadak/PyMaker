I have been playing with tkinter and used a lot of web resources and currently have this code:I ran it using python IDLE and it passes and generates a window with aeroplane and the drop-down has all the details of that dictionary and it looks like this:BUT if I change my Data to:and running this generates me an error:How to address this error and display aeroplane, bus, car, train just like I the above image looks?
The signature for method insert of a TreeView, as documented at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.Treeview.insert, is:and your JsonTree is recursively calling itself withand calling insert (for "leaf" nodes) as:However it's clearly documented that "If iid is specified, it is used as the item identifier; iid must not already exist in the tree" (at the URL I gave above).So, is key unique as it should be?  The error message tells you it isn't.  And indeed -- you're calling Tree.insert with e.g a key equal to From (&c) repeatedly -- because every sub-dict has such a key!So you need to "make unique" the key you're using.  Simplest may be to change the signature to:and the recursive call to:and in every insert where you now just use key as the third (iid) argument, use instead prefix+key, for example:for the specific call to insert I had shown earlier.This way, the identifiers in your tree will be e.g 'aeroplane.From', 'bus.From', and so forth -- all unique, so you'll be fine.If you're not actually using those identifiers you could alternatively just omit the third argument -- Tkinter will then internally generate a unique identifier on your behalf.  But controlling your own identifiers may make it easier for you to track exactly what the user picked, depending on what, exactly, you're after.  So, either choice may be best!
