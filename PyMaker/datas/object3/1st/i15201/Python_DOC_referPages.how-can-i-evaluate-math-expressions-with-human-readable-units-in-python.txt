Is there a way to evaluate expressions from strings that include human readable number units?For example:... should be equivalent to 1e-6+1e-6 (where u=micro).
This answer expands somewhat on Joran's to replace all SI affices with the appropriate exponents:Using the dictionary SI, we create a regular expression that will match any of the keys in SI as long as they're preceded by a digit and followed by a word boundary:Next, we define a substitution function repl_si() that looks up the match in SI and replaces it with "e" concatenated with the exponent.Then, all we have to do is write a function that calls re.sub() appropriately with the regex, substitution function and formula, and voil√†:Now all you need to do is call eval() on the result, which of course you should absolutely never do with user-supplied input.
should work... by just replacing any digits followed immediatly by u with e-6 before evaluating
Adding an answer, mostly inspired by Joran, it probably isn't as elegant as Zero's but I think it does the jobone thing I made sure that the unit MUST be preceded by a numeric figure (\d+)I fixed the units by processing a series of substitutes over different unitstmp_exp will come out as1e18+3e15+0.5e12-7e9-6e6+2.5e3-1e-3+3.7e-6+4e-9+13e-12-59e-15-73e-18+0.5e-5
