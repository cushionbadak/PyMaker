I try to make Tk window like python console. But my problem is when multiline code comes. How i can compille_command() and runcode() if input is multiline: for example if True:print(something) or for i in range(x)
I'd not use the interactive interpreter code for this. You can use the exec() function to interpret Python code.Under the hood, that is exactly what code.runcode() does.
