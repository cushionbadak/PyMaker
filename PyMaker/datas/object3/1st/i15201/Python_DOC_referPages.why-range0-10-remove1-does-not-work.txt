whydoes not work?I know the question is pretty short, but I do not have any idea why this thing does not work..Is it possibe to write it in one line?
x = range(0, 10) will return either a list or a range object (depending on your Python version).Python 2.xx = range(0, 10).remove(1) will return None as list.remove will modify the list in-place and so returns None. Your list is created and the value 1 removed, but as it is never assigned to anything, it's garbage collected.Python 3.xx = range(0, 10).remove(1) will return an AttributeError as range objects don't have a remove method. If you convert it to a list using list(range(0, 10)).remove(1) you'll have the same issue as Python 2 though.A way to get what you want would be to use a list comprehension. In the list comprehension you'll iterate over range(0, 10) but use an if statement to only add a value that isn't 1, such as:
Because the remove() method operates "in place", and doesn't return anything.
The problem is that remove is an in-place operation, and therefore returns None. It does indeed do what you think it does: create a list from 0 to 9, then removes the element 1, but that is a temporary list that is not assigned to any variable.As an alternative, a list comprehension could achieve this
Why remove does not work is already covered.I'd like to present an alternative to the list comprehension method:While the list comprehension is considered more pythonic, filter might sometimes be closer in expressing the underlying problem.
The result is None because list.remove() doesn't return anything. You could workaround that by using a lambda function and the or operator. In Python 2 this one-liner would work:or this in Python 3: Both execute faster than using a list comprehension would (although it's not quite as readable):
