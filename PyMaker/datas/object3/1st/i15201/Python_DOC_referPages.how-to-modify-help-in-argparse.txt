When you runfoo.py -h ORfoo.py --help,you will get a "help" message about how to use foo.py and what arguments that it takes. Is there a way I can append to this message? Printing __doc__ for example?
Sure, argparse gives you a lot of customization possibilities.  To "append" to the help (print more after the help message is done), for example, use the epilog named argument.where ... stands for "whatever other named arguments you want to pass to the parser constructor", the message in question will be printed on --help after the help about arguments.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html for a few thousand words about argparse (written as a reference but with lots of examples) and https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html#id1 for a few thousand more (written as a tutorial).  Maybe half those docs are about how to fine-tune messages for --help or error cases!-)
The help-formatting function, argparse.ArgumentParser.format_help(), looks like this:So, you can eithercustomize the strings used (they can be passed as constructor arguments, you're probably interested in epilog), orreplace the default HelpFormatter (the formatter_class constructor argument) to customize how these strings are transformed into help textthe argparse module bundles 3 alternative classes.
