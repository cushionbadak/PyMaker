I wrote a tokenize function that basically reads a string representation and splits it into list of words.My code:My output:Desired Output:Basically I want the apostrophed words and hypen words to remain as a single word in list along with double quotes. How can i change my function to get the desired output.
\w+ matches one or more word characters; this does not include apostrophes or hyphens.You need to use a character set here to tell Python exactly what you want to match:You'll notice too that I removed the x = document.lower() line.  This is no longer necessary since we can match uppercase characters by simply adding A-Z to the character set.
