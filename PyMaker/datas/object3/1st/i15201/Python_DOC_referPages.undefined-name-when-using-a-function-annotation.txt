Natural Text
I am trying to express time in terms of hh:mm. I know that the colon is telling python to count from hours to minutes but that is not what I want.  Can someone explain a way to correct this mistake of mine?This is the error I get:
Function annotations need to be valid expressions.  Meaning, you cannot use an undefined name in an annotation or else you will raise a NameError.Instead, you can use a string literal:This works because string literals are expressions.
