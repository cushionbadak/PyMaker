Natural Text
I have a textfile and it looks like this :I want it to look like {'zor': [10, 21,], 'bob': [30]}  etc but the numbers keep getting replaced when I add multiple scores to a name I split the scores so that the names and scores are in separate positions.
You are not building lists; simply use the dict.setdefault() method to insert a list object when the key is missing, and append your values:I took the liberty to clean up your code a little; I'm using the file as a context manager so that it is closed again automatically. By looping directly over the file you get individual lines, no need to split first. And I used str.partition() to split just the once (it is more efficient for that case than str.split() is).Demo:
