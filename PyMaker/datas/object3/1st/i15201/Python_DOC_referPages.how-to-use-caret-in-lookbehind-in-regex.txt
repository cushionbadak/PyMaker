I want to find all separate words "is" in This finds is everywhere I need except beginning(?<= )is(?= |$)This leads to error with parenthesis https://regex101.com/r/vD5iH9/22:(?<=^| )is(?= |$)How to lookbehind beginning of the line?
Lookback assertions in Python need to be fixed width.  Meaning, you cannot use (?<=^| ) which matches the start of the string (0 characters) or a space (1 character).To do what you want, try using re.findall:Note that \b matches a word boundary.
