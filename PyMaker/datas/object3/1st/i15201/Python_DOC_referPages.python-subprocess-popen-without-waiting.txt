I'm using Python 3.4.2 on Windows. In script1.py I'm doing this:it works and call script2.py . The problem is that in script2.py there is a infinite loop (there must be) and the script1.py is waiting for script2.py to finish. How can I tell to script1.py to just call script2.py and don't wait for the process to finish?
Just don't call myProc.communicate() if you don't want to wait. subprocess.Popen will start the process.
Call the script in another window.start is a windows shell function that runs a program separately, allowing the current one to continue its process. I haven't tested this as I've no access to a Windows OS, but The linux equivalent (nohup) works as required.If you need fine control over what happens with script2.py, refer to the multiprocessing module here.
