What would be the most efficient way to get all dict items with value == 3 and create a new dict? Here is what I have thus far:Is there a more efficient, simpler way to do this? Perhaps using a map?
You could use a dict comprehension:Note that you should call d.iteritems() in Python 2.x to avoid creating an unnecessary list.As you can see from the timeit.timeit tests below, this solution is more efficient:It is also a lot simpler, which is always good.
