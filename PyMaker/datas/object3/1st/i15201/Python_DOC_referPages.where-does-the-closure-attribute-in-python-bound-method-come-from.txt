In Python3, A.say is a function, and I know it has__closure__ attribute.__closure__ not in dir(a.say) or its super class, but a.say.__closure__ returns the closure tuple. It makes me confuse. Thanks.
I don't know in Python the internal implementation of objects with type instancemethod but I think it is how __getattr__ works in instance method objects. My guess is when you say a.say.__closure__ it first looks up for __closure__ in dir(a.say) and then fallbacks on dir(a.say.im_func).
