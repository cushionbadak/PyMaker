I am just fixing a 2.7 script to 3.5 and ran into some decode/encode issues.above is the 2.7 version that reads stuff from a xml file. What is the correct way of doing this in 3.3 since some encoding stuff was changed and 'str' object has no attribute 'decode' any more.I have seen this also: .encode('UTF-8').decode('utf-8')  do this have any effect ?
Python 3.X already holds unicode characters, so I think you do not need to use .decode('utf-8'). In the moment you need to store in someway/somewhere your doc['code'] then you can use .encode('utf-8') and then retrieve it through .decode('utf-8')
