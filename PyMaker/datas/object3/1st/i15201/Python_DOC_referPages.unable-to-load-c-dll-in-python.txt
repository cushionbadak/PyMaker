I have a C++ dll which I'm trying to use it in Python, until now there are no errors, system seem to be doing what I wanted, but when I try to access mydll, the Intellisence in the Python IDLE shows the following,from the above pic, it's clear that the intellisence doesn't show up any available functions of the dll, but when I checked the same TestDll.dll with dumpbin /EXPORTS TestDll.dll it has 45 functions, but none of those functions are available with python.Please Note: There are several questions on this topic, I tried the following suggestions but no use,incompatible version of Python installed or the DLL [TestDll.dll & Python both are 32 bit versions]I think ctypes is the way to go [Same Issue, cant see any functions, but loads the dll]Now my question is how do I load all the available functions(as shown by dumpbin)?Edit 1Based on eryksun suggestion, I was able to make some progress. The TestDll.dll comes along with a header file TestDll.h(my bad I missed this file earlier), from which I could see the available Exported Functions.TestDll.h: now I've tried the following,until now it's fine, but when I try to define the argTypes, not sure how to do it for structs?any suggestions are much appreciated.
Based on your header, here's a dummy C file (for Windows) that can be used to test a ctypes wrapper.  You mentioned C++ but the example was a C interface, which is a good thing because ctypes works with C functions not C++.x.cHere's the ctypes wrapper.  Note that ctypes does not inspect the DLL and automatically load all the functions.  You have to declare the functions, parameters and return values yourself.  See ctypes:structures and unions for the Structure syntax.Also note that for a DLL with _stdcall functions use WinDLL instead of CDLL.x.pyAnd the output:
