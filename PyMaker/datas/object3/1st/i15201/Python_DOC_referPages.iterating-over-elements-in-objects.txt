Python iterating through object attributesI found this question when trying to understand iteration over Objects, and found this response from Eric Leschinski:Which produced text that listed all attributes in class C, including functions and hidden attributes (surrounded by underscores) as seen below:Now, I understand how to filter out the 'hidden' attributes from my iteration, but is there a way to filter out all functions as well? Effectively, I'm looking for, in class C, only attributes a and b, listed sequentially, without the __module__ and __doc__ information and without any and all functions that happen to be in C.
