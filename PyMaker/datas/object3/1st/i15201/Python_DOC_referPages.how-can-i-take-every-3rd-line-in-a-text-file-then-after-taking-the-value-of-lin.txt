Natural Text
I am new to Python, so please help me...I want to take out every 3rd, 4th and 5th line in a text file. There are 22 lines in the text fileHere is just an algorithm My problem is that I want the for loop to repeat, but next time name should extract line 6, distance line 7 and time line 8. The next time the loop repeats, it should change name into line 9 and so on...Hopefully my problem is clear enough, I am not sure how to phrase it.Thanks for all the help in advance... I am cluelessBy the way I am using python 3.3

If you always know that you will only ever need those three lines, you simply need to do:
Using the grouper recipe from itertools:
You file is not very large(only a few lines), so memory seems not to be a problem for you. Said that, you can try a different approach:
The following code opens your file, uses the lines #1 and #2 by a reasonable guess of your description and then proceed to scan the filethe method readline returns a single line from the file, with a newline at the end (that's why we use the method strip when we want to use the file content as a name...) and returns a null string '' only (only) when the EOF is reached.we use an infinite loop to scan the rest of the file, but when the file is over we want to stop... that's why we do something different when we read the activity name, first we test for a null string (meaning: we reached EOF) and possibly break out of the loop..
I think something like this would be a fast and simple way to do it:Output:For such a short file, you could just read each line explicitly and calculate the values 6 times without any loop at all. This would require more code, but most of it would be boiler-plate and it would likely be the fastest possible approach.
