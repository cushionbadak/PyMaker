I get list index out of range error even though it isn't . I am attaching the image of my CSV as well.
There are two possibilities here:You have a line with no commas on it. split will be a list with just one element.You have an empty line. split is an empty list.Either way you'd have to guard against that, perhaps with:to skip such lines.You are reading a CSV file; you may want to avoid re-inventing the CSV-reading wheel and use the csv module here:Note that I renamed name to names and value to values, to reflect that these are lists. I also converted the values to floating point numbers to make them usable in a plot; if they are integers instead replace float() with int().
