Natural Text
I got the following code from How do I get a raw, compiled SQL query from a SQLAlchemy expression? and it worked fine until we moved from Python 2.7 to Python 3.4. I've made a few changes though I'm stuck on with the error unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'bytes' and 'dict'
Thanks to the comments, I ported it to python 3
