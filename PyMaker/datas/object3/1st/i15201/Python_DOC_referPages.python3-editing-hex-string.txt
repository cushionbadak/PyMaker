I'm trying to write a file's hex size in the header of another file. When I convert the length to hex I get b'\x00\x00\x00\x04'  so it writes "00000004" to the file.The file's length is stored in 2 byte intervals though, so I need it to format the string to this b'\x00\x04'. what the easiest way to do this?I tried this but I know it's not correct and not the proper method. 
You are converting a number into bytes, not hex. Use the struct module to do this:This produces an unsigned short, 2 bytes, in big endian order; for the length 4 that'd produce \x00\x04:
Assuming the integer is an big endian unsigned short, use struct.pack with the big endian flag.In this format string, > is the big endian flag, and H is unsigned short.Example:You can find all the struct format characters here.
