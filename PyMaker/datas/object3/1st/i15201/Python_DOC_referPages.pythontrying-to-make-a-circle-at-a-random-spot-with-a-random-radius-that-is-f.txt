# Heres what I have so far. The colorCircle(myTurtle) doesn't seem to work and I don't really know what to do. Kinda of an amateur, any tips would be appreciated.
This:is equivalent to:Because you don't assign the random number to a variable, 4 in the example, the random number is discarded.  Then you pass the whole list of colors as the argument to begin_fill().To get the random color, you can do this:But, python makes things easier than that:Edit: =============However, you are trying to pass an argument to the begin_fill() function, yet begin_fill() does not accept any arguments.  By default, begin_fill() uses black as the fill color.  To set the fill color to something else, use one of these functions:Here are some examples of what you can do:Or you could do this:===========Finally, color is not a good name for a list.  List names should be plurals, for example: colors, numbers, words; then you can write loops that look like this:
First, you don't assign your random number to anythingSecond problem is that you can't fill with begin_fill(color), but you can type begin_fill() but the default fill color will be black. so what you need to do is something like this:color = [('white',0),('yellow',1),('green',2),('blue',3),('purple',4),('red',5),('black',6),('magenta',7),('pink',8),('brown',9)]randomPos = random.randint(0,9) #We randomly choose which color will it bemyTurtle.fill_color(color[ randomPos ]) #We set fill color to color we previously chosemyTurtle.begin_fill() #We start to fillI hope I helped and if you have any questions, just ask me.
