I have two list of lists like below. I know I can use set(list1)-set(list2) or vice-versa to print the list that's different from the other corresponding one. However, I do not want the complete list to be printed out, I just want that part of the list that's been modified. For example, list1:list2:If I do set difference, it prints out the entire list. I want the output to show only the columns that are different/added/taken away when 'Code', 'sID' are the same.  EDIT: The first list of each list of lists is the header. So I want to compare the lists when values from 'Code', 'sID' columns are matching. Desired output:something like this or anything simpler is fine also. 
Use difflib.SequenceMatcher() to work out how your lists have changed:This simple setup only lists what things have been added, deleted, or replaced:but the matcher also gives you what hasn't changed; I ignored the equal tags to simplify the demo. It shows how two elements have been added, and one element was replaced by two other elements. 
set(a) - set(b) returns the elements that are in list a, but not list b. To view elements added to a list, use set(newList) - set(oldList), to view elements removed from a list use set(oldList) - set(newList).You cannot apply if you apply set on a list of list in python 3 (I do not know about python 2) you get the following error: TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'. So you will have to apply this to each of the corresponding sublists.
