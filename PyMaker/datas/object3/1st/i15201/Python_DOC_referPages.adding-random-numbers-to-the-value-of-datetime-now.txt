Basically, I'm trying to make a program that will calculate the average speed between two points that are 200m apart, and of course convert that into mph so I can say whether it is above or below the speed limit. I'm having problems making it so that it adds random numbers to the value of datetime.now() as it is telling me "NameError: name 'random' is not defined".There's probably an incredibly simple solution to this, I'm just very unsure of how to use the random in this instance.I'm not really sure how to go about fixing this, thanks for any help.Here is my code so far:
Because you imported like this:you don't need to reference the namespace. Instead of this:Try:This is because when you import like from ... import ..., it adds them to the current scope. Just like how a = 29 would add the variable a to the scope with value 29, from random import uniform would add uniform to the scope as a function.
You imported the name uniform (among others), not the name random:This adds seed, randrange and uniform to your globals.Simple remove the random. prefix and use the uniform global directly:Note that you can simplify your code here; there is no need to add to camInput1 then subtract that again. Just use:datetime_value + timedelta_value - datetime_value produces just timedelta_value again.
