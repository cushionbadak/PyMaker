I have some code which seems to print [<__main__.TCar object at 0x0245C1B0>] but I want it to print the actual contents of the list.What is wrong with my code?
You have to define either a __str__ method or a __repr__ method for that:In a nutshell,  __repr__ is used if there's a need to display "raw" content of the object, it's the kind you see when you are displaying the list's contents, so if you have a list of cars, it would look like this:[<Car Tesla Model S 500bhp $100000>, <Car Smart Fortwo 80bhp $5000>]__str__ is used if you try to print the actual object, like print(TeslaCar) with TeslaCar being a TCar instance. It would give you something like "Tesla Model S".
You have a list of objects here. Add something like:-This would print the value of all attributes of object. Or you can modify the function as per your behavior requirement.
print the attribute one by one rather than printing garange once: print(self.attribute).Note that the attribute in the code is an instance of the object
You can either override __str__ or __repr__ like this:Also you might want to check out this question about __str__ vs. __repr__.
