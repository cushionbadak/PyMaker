I am very new to programming and have been pouring over this site and others to better understand how I can write a script in Python (version 3.4.1) that does what I already know how to do in Command Prompt (version 6.3.9600).In Command Prompt I can very easily type this (after the ">"):And everything works perfectly. The .T01 file is converted and the resulting files appear in the input folder.In Python I have no idea what I am doing. I've tried this:And I get this errorIn a window that says Z:\input\convertToRinex.exe at the top. It happens so fast that I had to use a screen recorder to read the error message.I thought the list from Python would be translated into the exact same syntax that already works in Command Prompt and the same thing would happen.I am clearly missing something. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

You need to escape the \, use forward slashes or use raw string r:\ is used to escape characters
