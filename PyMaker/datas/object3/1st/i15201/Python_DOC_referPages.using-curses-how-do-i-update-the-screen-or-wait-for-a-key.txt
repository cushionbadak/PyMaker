How do I update the screen or wait for a key at the same time? I'm using unicurses on Python but I think I would have the same problem in C.Here's what I want to do in pseudo code:My problem is that the screen doesn't update unless something happens, like resizing the screen or pressing a key. I was thinking about using the while loop (and a time.sleep(1)?) to update the screen and a thread to wait for keys. Is that possible? I don't know much about threads, that's why I'm asking. Is there a simpler way?Thank you.
This can be done without any complicated multithreading. There is a function curses.halfdelay that can be also found in the unicurses library that you use. It takes the number of tenths of a second to wait until continuing. https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.halfdelayHere is an example code that refreshes every half a second unless there is a button that has been pressed, in which case it updates immediately.
