I try to unzip 150  zip files. All the zip files as different names, and they all spread in one big folder that divided to a lot of sub folders and sub sub folders.i want to extract each archive to separate folder with the same name as the original zip file name and also in the same place as the original zip file . my code is:After i run the code nothing happened.Thanks in advance for any help on this. 
UPDATE:Finally, this code worked for me:
You could use Path.rglob() to enumerate zip-files recursively and shutil.unpack_archive() to unpack zip files:It "extract[s] each archive to separate folder with the same name as the original zip file name and also in the same place as the original zip file" e.g., it extracts 'layers/dir/file.zip' archive into 'layers/dir/file' directory.
To unzip all the files into a temporary folder (Ubuntu)
