Natural Text
How can I check if the letters of a word that the user entered are all in a list?This doesn't seem to work:
For example like this?cf. Python - verifying if one list is a subset of the other
Use sets; either test for an intersection or for a subset:oror if you wanted all characters in inpt to be in letters (so only a, b, c or d can be used, use the inverse:Demo:where an empty set() is considered false when used in an if statement, a non-empty set() is considered true.
