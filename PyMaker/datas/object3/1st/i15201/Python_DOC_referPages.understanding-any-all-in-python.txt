I'm experienced with Python a little, however, still doesn't understand how to use all() and any(). I'm trying to solve a problem;2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers  from 1 to 10 without any remainder.What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all  of the numbers from 1 to 20?My algorithm was first like this;However, before I run the script I realized that my algorithm is wrong because number may divisible by all of the numbers in the tuple. Then I remember all() function, I tried to change my codes like;But I got TypeError: 'bool' object is not iterable error. Probably I have never used all() and any() before, just saw some examples and I didn't understand. Could anyone explain me clearly? Then I can solve this problem.
As all() function accept an iterable as its argument you can pass a generator within , also as you are in python 3 you can use range(1,20) that return a generator instead the tuple :
all() and any() require an iterable parameter to be passed to them.all() returns true if and only if all values in the iterable are truthy.any() returns true if any one value in the iterable is truthy.For your specific problem, you would likely be better off using filter instead, since that can support both an iterable and a function.
any() and all() take lists, not equations.  While the concepts come from mathematics, these functions operate on lists of values.  Maybe you want:
