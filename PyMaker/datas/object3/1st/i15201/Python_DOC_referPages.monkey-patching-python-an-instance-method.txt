This question already has an answer here:Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance                    17 answers                Mocking out methods on any instance of a python class                    4 answers                I'm trying to monkey-patch a class instance, but don't quite see how I can patch a class method no problem.But say I only wanted to replace make in the instance, what's the easiest way to do that?
You can create a new instance method out of times_eight by using its __get__ special method:
Doh!
Methods only get the self arg passed automatically when received from the class (not from the instance dict), so you'll need to pass an 1-arg function there:(You can simplify that with functools.partial.)
