Basically, I have a long string, and I want to do something like:So, for example, if the string is equal to "hello_world" and x = 5, then I want to return {hello, _worl, d}.
The canonical way of doing this in Python comes from the itertools recipes pageresults in:
This should do the trick, it relies on python elegantly slicing arrays shorter than requested (ie "this_string"[2:400] will return "is_string" without error).
Something like this should work. We're relying on the fact that the while loop will run one last time even if there's only one character left (like "d"), and that we can take a slice that is longer than the actual string, and it will just return whatever is left.
Here's a nifty little recursive function to do it:
