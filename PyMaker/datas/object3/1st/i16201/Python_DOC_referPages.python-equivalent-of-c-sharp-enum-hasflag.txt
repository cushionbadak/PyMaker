Lets say in pythonin C# there is a HasFlag function in Enum, which tells me an object's flag is part of StateCIs there a equivalent version in python?Right now I can only think (as bitwise noob) of this and not even sure if it supposed to work:
Testing for a flag:Adding a flag:Clearing a flag:
HasFlag is basically bitwise operation.
Python 3.4 has an Enum data type, which has been backported.Python 3.6 has the (Int)Flag data type, which is also present in the aenum1 library:1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
