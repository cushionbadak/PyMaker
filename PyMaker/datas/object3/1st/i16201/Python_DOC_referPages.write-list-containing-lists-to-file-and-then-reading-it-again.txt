I'm quite new to python, and as a little project, I am trying to make an interactive program where I can store recipes, each recipe will be stored as a list of the format: [Name, Servings, [List of ingredients], [List of steps in method]]The first function, that creates the list works (i.e. I have created and stored in the file [Scrambled eggs, 1, [2 eggs, milk.....], [Beat the eggs....]]However when I then call the 'view_recipes' function, I get:so it is clearly iterating over characters in the string.Is it a problem with how I write my list to my file? (I've looked this up before and everyone says you just need to have f.write(str(list)) Else it must be a problem with the reading of a file: but how can I get python to import it as a list of lists?My code so far:
I think your problem is that list(line) transform a string into a list of characters:You should use something like pickle to read/write data to a file.See for example this answer.Edit: In order to be able to add more recipes to your file, you canadd all your recipes to some variable and read/write all at onceFor instance something likeAnd in add_recipe:You will have to change add_recipe to return recipe.add recipe to your file each time you call add_recipe:read your fileload recipes if they existadd your recipe to recipeswrite the new recipes to the fileAlso, check @jonrsharpe comment. You could easily use sqlite3 to avoid drawbacks of both my methods.
