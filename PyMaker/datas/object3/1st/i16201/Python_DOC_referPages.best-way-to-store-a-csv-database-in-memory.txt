Natural Text
I have a text file (CSV) which acts as a database for my application formatted as follows:Before you ask, I cannot get away from a CSV text file (imposed) but I can remove/change the first row (header) into another format or into another file all together (I added it to keep track of the schema).When I start my application I want to read-in all the data in-memory so I can then query it and change it and stuff. I need to extra:I am trying to figure out what would be the best way to store this in memory using Python (very new to the language and its constructs) - any suggestions/recommendations?Thanks,
If you use a Pandas DataFrame you can query it like it was an SQL table, and read it directly from CSV and write it back out as well. I think that this is the best option for you. It's very fast and performant, and builds on solid, proven technologies.
