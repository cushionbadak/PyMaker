I've created a function to project a bipartite edgelist into a single mode edgelist, and everything works as it should.  However, my existing plan has been to add all these edges to a list, then load that list into a pandas dataframe, and filter the list based on edge weight to create new dataframes, then write those dataframes to csv.  This has worked well, until my data became too large to hold in RAM.  I'm thinking that instead of adding the single mode edgelist to a list, I should just just write the contents of folded to CSV, and skip even adding that data to a list at all.  I would also like to filter what I write to CSV to only write lines with weight greater than or equal to 2.Data:How can I alter my code to write directly to CSV and skip adding the edges to the folded list, but only edges that have a weight greater than or equal to 3?Below is the code as-is, which adds all the edges to a list, then writes to list to CSV:
Well, the answer to the main question (there is a good reason why you should restrict your question to, well, one question) is quite simple - all you have to is to remodel this tiny bit of code:Into something like:Of course you will have to format the row accordingly, and you may not need to open and close file handle for each row, but with this approach you won't have to build up a large chunk of data in memory that you do not need.
