Is this the only way to get a byte of binary data?If I use byte = data[index] it throws an error:
From the bytes documentation:Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object b, b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be a bytes object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1).So byte = data[index] assigns an integer value to byte - which as your error message points out, does not support the buffer interface.You could, instead of byte = data[index:index+1], write this:... relying on the fact that the bytes constructor, if passed a sequence (note the brackets around data[index]), will use it to create a bytes object  - but that's not really any more readable, and is significantly slower (by a factor of six on my machine with Python 3.4).
