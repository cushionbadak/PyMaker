I am new to python so I did some digging and from what I understand the member variable of a class will update in all instances of that class regardless of which instance you modified it with.  However, it doesn't seem that the same should happen with instance variables however when I run this block of code...I get this output...The board variable is updating in each instance of the Game class even though I am only changing it in one of them.  Does anyone know why this is happening and what I could do to avoid it?Thanks,Nick 
use copyEDITTo truely understand what's under the hood, you should learn about Python DataModel. The official doc is easy to follow.  To be short, list are mutable type in Python, which means that if you assign a list object to multiple variables, they are actually pointing to the same list object, thus changing one of them will affect others.   On the other hand, string, int, tuple, ... are immutable data type.if you assign a=1 then a=2, 1 and 2 are different int objects, i.e. 1 does not become 2, because int are immutable, they can't be modified.  
You're using the same board when you create both instances - so when one of them updates the board - the change is reflected in the other as well.
