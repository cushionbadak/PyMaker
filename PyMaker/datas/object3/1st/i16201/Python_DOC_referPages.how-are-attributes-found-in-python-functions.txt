I've been playing around with Python's magic methods, and I've come across an interesting behavior:Since I overrode foo's __getattribute__, shouldn't foo.a return 5?
Special methods are looked for in the class of the object, not amongst the instance's attributes. Thus, to affect foo.a, you would need to modify the __getattribute__ method of type(foo) which is function. However, the built-in type function does not allow you to change its __getattribute__ method:I think that is true of all objects defined in C rather than Python.
