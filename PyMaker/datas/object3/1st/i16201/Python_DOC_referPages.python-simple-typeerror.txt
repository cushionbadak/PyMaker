This is a module containing two class:When I  create an instance of Notebook(), and perform a search("hello"), a TypeError happened. The error tolds me the filter in Note.match must be a string, but when I perform n.search("hello"), "hello" is already a string.Can someone tell me what's really wrong inside?Thx!!!
You're using a filter but the variable is declared in the function's signature as filer:so it probably takes a different filter from an outer scope (thanks to @grc - filter is a builtin function) that is not defined as a string.
