New to PythonAssume the followingSo now do the following:Now what I want to do is NOT have to call B.Bset(A.Areturn) in order to get self.Y updated. In another words, I don't want to have to "refresh" B explicitly every time A changes. Ideally, something like an implicit (defined in B.__init__) flag that says, for this instance, if the value of A changes, trigger B to evaluate. Almost like a "depends on" relationship between A and B for a given instance of each.Suggestions on how to do this?
If you're willing to require that A receives an instance of B in its constructor, you can simply use the property decorator for this:If you want something more generic (so that A doesn't need to know about B at creation time), you can provide a way for any object to register to be updated when A.x changes:Output:
