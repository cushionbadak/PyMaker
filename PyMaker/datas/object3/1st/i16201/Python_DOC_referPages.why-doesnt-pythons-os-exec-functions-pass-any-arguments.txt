I want to replace the current process with a new process using the same Python interpreter, but with a new script. I have tried using os.execl, which seemed like the most intuitive approach:The result is that this is printed to the screen (from the print function):And the Python interactive interpreter is launched. Entering this into the interpreter:Shows that Python received no arguments.If I copy the output of the print function and enter it into my terminal, it works as expected. I have also tried using execv and execlp with identical results.Why doesn't the execl call pass the arguments to the Python executable?
The arg0, arg1, arg2, ... (arguments after the sys.executable) are passed to subprogram as argv. If you pass script_path as a the first argument the subprogram will interpret script_path as argv[0] instead of sys.executable.Replace the execl line as following will solve your problem:
