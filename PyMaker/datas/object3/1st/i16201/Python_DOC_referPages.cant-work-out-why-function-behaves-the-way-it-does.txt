We are building a web crawler, and the task was to create a function that outputs a keyword and the url's attached to the keyword. The keyword cannot be duplicated in the list. This is the final code:inputs:     add_to_index(index,'udacity','http://udacity.com')add_to_index(index,'computing','http://acm.org')add_to_index(index,'udacity','http://npr.org')These are the correct results:There are a couple of things i am really struggling to understand about this function. The first thing is where in the function does it say to not duplicate the keyword?As far as i can tell, the statement index.append([keyword,[url]]) should add the keyword Udacity twice to the index list, and it fact it does add it twice if i put the statement above the for loop. So, i really don't understand where in the for loop it is specifing to not duplicate keyword in the list? The function just seems to be saying: append a url to the index list if a keyword matches, and if not, go out of the loop and add a keyword and its url. And the second thing i really don't understand is why index.append([keyword,[url]]) statement is at the bottom of the for loop, and not above it. If i put it at the top it gives me completely different results. Shown here:Why? When the statement is after the for loop, nothing is returned because index is empty. So, i don't understand why putting the statement at the top would not produce the same results? I have really struggled to understand this and i am at a complete blank. Any help would be much appreciated. Many thanks! :)
There is a return statement which causes the function to exit once it has found a matching keyword. This means that index.append([keyword,[url]]) can only ever be executed if the function could not find a matching keyword in the collection.
