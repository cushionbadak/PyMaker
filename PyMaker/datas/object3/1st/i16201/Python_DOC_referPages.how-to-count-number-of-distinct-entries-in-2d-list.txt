I have a 2D list and I want to learn how to return the number of distinct entries there are in the table.since there are 10 numbers that are not the same I want it to return that number, how do I go about that?
Convert your nested list into a set and take the length of it, as below:Sets are containers with no duplicate elements, this means that set([1, 1, 2]) -> {1, 2}. The length of the set can then be used to find the number of distinct values originally in your nested lists.
Flatten the list in a set comprehension to remove the dupsOr create a set and use set.update:python sets
Below is the easiest way to get distinct number countlen(set(sum(numbers, [])))
