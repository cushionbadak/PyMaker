Is it possible to retrieve the argument values of a clang.cindex.CursorKind.CALL_EXPR cursor?When I dump the AST using the compiler (clang++ -ast-dump source.cpp) I get info about function calls (call expressions) and their arguments. But I'm not able to replicate it using the bindings for python (where the AST is retrieved using libclang's parser).Here's the source code I'm using:Here's a part of its AST dump:I'd like to retrieve the IntegerLiteral value part in the last line by evaluating the call expression cursor.
You can get this information from the list of tokens, for IntegerLiteral the first token will be your number (not really that neat but better than nothing!).Example cpp program:Example python code to parse it and print out just the IntegerLiteral value (using lib clang):Output:
