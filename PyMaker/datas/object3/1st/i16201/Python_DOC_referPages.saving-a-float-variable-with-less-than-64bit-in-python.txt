In my PYTHON program, I am loading a lot of (floating) numbers for later use. I am talking about 100 Million numbers or more. It seems that I run into problems with memory space on RAM. Since the numbers I am saving do not need to have a high precision (3-4 digits would be more than enough) and are usually small (in the range -1000 .. 1000) I do not use the precision provided by a 64bit float. Is there a possibility to save a floating number using less memory (maybe 8 or 16 bit)? Thank you!
I would use the types in the numpy library, which provides the following types of interest:So, if you wanted a 16-bit floating point number (1 sign bit, 5 exponent, and 10 for the mantissa), you could use the following:See also, data types in NumPy
Pack them into arrays of float-format values using the struct package's f format.
