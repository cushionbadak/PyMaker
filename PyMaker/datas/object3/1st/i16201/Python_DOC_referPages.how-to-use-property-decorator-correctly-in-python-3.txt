I have method annotated with @property in athleteModel.py script:I use this method in another script:At last line (print method) I get exception:What is wrong in my code?
@property only works on methods, not on functions.get_from_store is not a method, it is a function. A property object act as a descriptor object and descriptors only work in the context of classes and instances.In your case there is no need to make get_from_store a property, really. Remove the @property decorator and just use it like a function:You cannot otherwise make top-level functions act like attributes.
