I have a class Test with class parameter parameters = {'first': [1,2,3,4], 'second': [5,6,7]}. I want to convert it into a dictionary so that it will be "{'Test': 'first':1 'second':5}"what I tried is:di = {}di = dict(itertools.izip(name, vals))where I'm getting Test i.e classnane in variable name i.e name = Test andvals = {'first': [1,2,3,4], 'second': [5,6,7]}Though I want it as "{'Test': 'first':1 'second':5}", shouldn't this print "{'Test': 'first':[1,2,3,4] 'second':[5,6,7]}"?? Instead what I'm getting when I'm printing di is {'Test': 'first'}. I'm not getting where my logic is going wrong.
Use a dictionary comprehension:
If you are working with Python 2, you can use dict() constructor:If you are using Python 3, you can use dictionary comprehension:
Try using dict comprehension:Input:    Output:
That is a basic for loop. Itertools is way to complex for this kind of stuff.
