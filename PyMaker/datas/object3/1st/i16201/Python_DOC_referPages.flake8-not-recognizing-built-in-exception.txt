I have a strict pre-commit hook set up with flake8, so I can't commit until its happy. This is normally a good thing, but it is causing some problems with what seems like no problem at all.I can't get Flake8 to recognize a FileNotFoundError.example.pyThis is enough code to get Flake8 to generate the error I checked the python docs, and FileNotFoundError is a 'built-in' exception, so I don't think I should have to import it from anywhere, and my python interpreters have not complained about it, just seems like an issue with flake8.
Running python 2.7.8 I get the follwoing:If I change to OSError it works correctly  on python 3 FileNotFoundError is a subclass of OSError in python3Using OSError will catch more than just the FileNotFound error in python 3 so you may want to add additional checks.For python 2 it is an IOError:You can catch the specific error:Sure there are betters ways but for python 3:
I found a couple of mentions of this issue on the Python Code Quality tools repo. Specifically Issue #75.Two workarounds were listed. You can use the --builtins flag to specify a comma separated list of known builtins that flake8 is flagging.The other workaround is running flake8 under python3 instead of python2.Hopefully one of these two solutions will work out for you, as twisting your code up to work around a syntax check tool is counterproductive.
