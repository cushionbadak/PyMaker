I wonder, what might be the most pythonic way to use max on a list of objects regarding a specific attribute. Assume there is this class:Now there is a list of Foos:I want to have the maximum value of this list.I could use max on a list:This would always construct a list first (might reduce performance on huge lists), so I thought of using the key argument:This looks a bit ugly to me, since I donâ€™t get the attribute, but the object.I could also define the __eq__, __le__ functions inside Foo, but this would limit the use of max to a specific value, I could not use max for more than one attribute.Is there another way, to get the maximum value in a nice pythonic way?
Slightly better with a generator expression:This is plenty Pythonic, not sure if it can get any better than this.
