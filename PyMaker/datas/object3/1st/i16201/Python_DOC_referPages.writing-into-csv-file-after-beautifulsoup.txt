Natural Text
Using BeautifulSoup to extract some text, and then I want to save the entries into a csv file. My code as follows:It did what I want for the most part EXCEPT whenever if there is a comma (",") within the entry, it sees it as a separator and split the single entry into two different cells (which is not what I want). So I searched around the net and found people suggested of using the csv module and I changed my codes into:This made it even worse, now each letter/number of a word or number occupies a single cell in the csv file. For example, if the entry is "Cat". The "C" is in one cell, "a" is the next cell, and "t" is the third cell, etc.Edited version:2nd edition:Updated output:Output example:Another edited codes (still having one issue - skipping one line below):
writeFile.writerow will iterate over what you pass in so a string "foo" becomes f,o,o three separate values,  wrapping it in a list will prevent this as writer will iterate over the list not the stringYou should open your file once as opposed to every time through your loop:
For the latest problem of skipping line, I have found an answer. Instead ofUse this:Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open. The "a" mode is the appending mode, where as "ab" is an appending mode while opening the file as binary file which solves the problem of skipping one extra line.
