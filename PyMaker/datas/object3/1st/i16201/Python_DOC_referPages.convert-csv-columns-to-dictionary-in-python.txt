Assuming you don't have any space in your datas, and all your actual data rows have exactly 3 fields:Given your sample data file, this produces:The trick here is to use setdefault to access to outer dictionary. It will either return the value if the key was already present -- or a new dictionary if this is the first time we encounter that key. After that, this is simply a matter of adding the value to the inner dictionary as usual.
