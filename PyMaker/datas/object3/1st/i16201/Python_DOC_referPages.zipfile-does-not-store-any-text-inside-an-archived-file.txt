Natural Text
The following code results in the file found in the zip being empty, instead of having some text in it:
Add flush to the file object:This problem also affects normal (non-temporary) files, so they'll also need the flush treatment:Alternatively, de-denting the 2nd with block would avoid having to use flush since a file gets closed automatically when that block exits, increasing the chance of it being flushed:Note that this will only work for the 2nd example, but not the 1st; see tempfile docs for the reason why.
