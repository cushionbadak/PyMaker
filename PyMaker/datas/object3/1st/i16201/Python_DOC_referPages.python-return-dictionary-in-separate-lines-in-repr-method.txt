I'm need to return my dictionary generated in the class using repr method, and i want it to return in separate lines.Is there any way i can do it?expected:what i got:since i can't use "pprint"  I don't know if there's any other way i can do it.
I assume you have a good reason for not being able to use pprint ... But this shouldn't be that hard:e.g.:
First, if the only reason you think you can't use pprint is because you haven't looked at the docs and assume pprint.pprint is the only thing in the moduleâ€”well, it's not, and even if it were, you could always create a StringIO and pass it in as the stream argument.But if you want to do it manually, of course you can. You just need to think through the rules, and translate them to Python.Let's write it the long way:If you know how to write list comprehensions, you can probably turn that into a one-liner; if not, either go learn, or keep it as 5 lines.
