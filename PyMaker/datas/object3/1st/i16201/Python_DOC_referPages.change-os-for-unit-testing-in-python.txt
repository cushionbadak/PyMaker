I have some python code that I've been tasked with unit testing that had different branches for different OS's. For example:I want to unit test both paths. Is there some way to temporarily change the sys.platform?Please let me know if I can provide any more information.
Well, you could simply do sys.platform = 'win32', but it is quite ugly solution so instead try the mock module (it has been ported to python2 too).This way of course you will have to create separate test cases for the operating systems.If you want to test it on 'real' OSs, use a Continuous Integration (CI) software. They can be configured to run tests on different operating systems.
