I have a test that works by mocking out the web service. I have it where it returns a specific return value when a specific method is called. I'm verifying that the wrapped function returns the value I expect. Issue is that the test seems almost useless.Here is what I have - What I'm looking to do is only return E if the GetMemberStatus method is called with specific parameters. I've tried to do - however this doesn't seem to change anything.Question - How can I set a mocked methods return value only if called with appropriate parameters?
Generally speaking, you don't. You instead assert that your mocked method has been called with the expected parameters as part of your test:All your attempt did was record a mock call, as if the code-under-test had called GetMemberStatus, then assigned 'E' on the return_value attribute of the Mock instance returned by that call.You could set the side_effect attribute to a function instead; it'll be passed the arguments and you could test there:but that really puts testing what arguments are passed in in the wrong location.
