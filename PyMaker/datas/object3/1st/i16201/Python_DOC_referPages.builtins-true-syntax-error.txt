Why does the following code generate a syntax error?I know in Python 3.X True and False are reserved words, but calling builtins.True am I just calling an attribute on the module object builtins?
True is  a reserved keyword, and that means you cannot use it as an attribute name either. Like names, attributes must be valid Python identifiers.You can still access the object as an attribute with getattr():This can be found in the documentation under:Attribute references in the expression documentation:Identifiers and keywords in the lexical analysis docs:The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or keywords of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.False [...] TrueEmphasis mine.
