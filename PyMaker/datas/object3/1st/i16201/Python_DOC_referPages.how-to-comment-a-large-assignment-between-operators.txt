Natural Text
Is there a way I can comment between the assignment? I've tried """ """ but gives syntax error also.Edit for Martin:
You cannot put comments between statements like this, as the \ effectively removes the newline. As such, all the text after the # is a comment and no longer part of the expression.You can put your expression in parentheses instead:Now the comments are seen as separate lines but the parser continues to expand the expression until the closing ). By using parentheses you get to still have your newlines, crucial in signalling when a comment ends and the expression continues.To understand the difference, study the Line structure documentation; an expression should form one logical line, but normally only one physical line is permitted. But within parentheses, physical newline characters are ignored allowing for implicit line joining:Expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split over more than one physical line without using backslashes.[...]Implicitly continued lines can carry comments
You can do Your code would turn intoThis works because expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split over more than one physical line without using backslashes and implicitly continued lines can carry comments (according to documentation).
