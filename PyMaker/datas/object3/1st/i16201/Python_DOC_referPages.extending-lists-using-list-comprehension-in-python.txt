So let's say I have list     items = ['abc', 'def', 'tre']. Now I want to insert a flag before each of list items. E.g the new list items2 should be ['-g', 'abc', '-g', 'def', '-g', 'tre']. I could read the list and append each one after appended the flag but I want to start doing it the python way. What I came up with is:What this gives me a list with smaller lists:I understand that this is because it would be equivalent to saying Any ideas about this? Thanks

One approach would be using zip:After that, you can use itertools.chain to flatten the list:Note that due to function call overhead, this is quite slow, compared to a simple list comprehension:So for performance and clarity, I suggest you use Robáµ© answer.
As a complement to other excellent zip based answers, you might use itertools.repeat() instead of "counting" items:And if you don't like zip, an alternative:
Another simple way is to loop through your list and insert after every element.As you insert your length up to the insertion point doubles, so you need to put your next element at (i*2)+1
