Natural Text
I've got a random bunch of words and I need to make it into a list, but there is a problem, I must take the words as they are and convert them into a list in the program itself.for example I got this raw input:Now how do i take this 5 words and make my program to make each word into a proper string like so: "hello","mike","cat","dog","burger"
You can use the split method
You're looking for str.splitNote that this requires that the user properly format the string, and that there are no leading or trailing spaces (e.g. Hello, dog becomes ["Hello", " dog"]). Consider building some sanity tests for the string, and possibly mapping the whole thing through str.strip
