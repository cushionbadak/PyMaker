I have the number 67.14, for example.I need to set another variable as the next multiple of 10 down (60, in this case).Would it be possible to just get the "7.14" from "67.14" and take it away?
Use // to get the floored quotient of x and y:Result:Use % to get the remainder of x / y:Result:
Type:
The % (modulo) sign should help you here:new = old - (old % 10)
There is an easier solution:divide by 10round to integermultiply by 10
