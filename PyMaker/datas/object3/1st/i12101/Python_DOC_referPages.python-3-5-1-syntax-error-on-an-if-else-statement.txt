Thank you for any assistance.
You should study the basic syntax of python first. Take a look at the if and elif in python.There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.  The keyword elif is short for else if, and is useful to avoid  excessive indentation.So after the first if to check for more conditions, you need something like this:There are more issues with your code.1. The input is wrong as more than one argument is passed. You can use string's format method like this:2. The condition in while has wrong logic. If you want check if the entered value is not in the range of 0-25000 inclusive, you should put a not before the condition like so:and possibly 3, 4, 5 and so on.
else can't have a condition. Change to elif ("else if").
