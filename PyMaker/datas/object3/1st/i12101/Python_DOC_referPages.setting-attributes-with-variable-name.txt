Trying to figure out how I can do the following. Suppose I have some function which has an attribute that I want to set. generically let's call it: func.attrib = ['list']. the challenge is that 'func' can vary according to the result of some look up (say, based on a key within a dictionary). so, I might want to say:etcwhere func, func1, func2 are the result of a look up in a dictionary. Treating func as a string and appending ".attrib" will not work, so I'm guessing a more specific method of formatting is required. any help appreciated! 
Have you considered using an if statement?Coz for say, if the look up is "Big Melons" and for that you have to use func1.attrib then you could use if or elif statement.
If you're trying to set an attribute on a function stored as a value in a dict, just do the lookup and set the attribute, e.g.If no such dict exists, you but all the function in question are defined in the global namespace of the module, and you want to assign the attribute based on the function name itself ('func', 'func1', etc.), then you could use globals to get the current module's global dict:If the functions are in some other module, you'd use getattr:
