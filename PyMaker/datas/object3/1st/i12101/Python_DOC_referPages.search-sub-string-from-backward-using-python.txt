Wondering if there is a neat API in Python to search a string from backward (from a specific position in a string), for example, in string "Hello StackOverflow Hello Python", suppose I want to find the index of sub-string "Hello" which is previous to sub-string "Python"?thanks in advance,Lin
Yes, it's called str.rindex(). It takes arguments sub - a substring to look for, start - a starting position, and end. It is the reverse of the index function. There are some others, like rsplit, too.
