Using this page How to find the unicode of the subscript alphabet?I can print all superscripts except j,l,r,w,y,s and h.  Unicode clearly has coded for these superscripts but for some reason it will not work in Python. So for the other superscripts I simply write:But when I do that for the troublesome superscripts I get error message: "SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-4: truncated \uXXXX escape"  As usual the error message makes no sense.  Here is the code I use for the superscripts which will not work:It must have something to do with the fact that all of those superscripts start with 2 and only have 3 digits.  I have also tried rewriting the codes with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Assuming Python 3, it's supposed to be a 16-bit or 32-bit hex (i.e. 4 or 8 digits) code. Your error message hints at the 4-digit requirement by saying \uXXXX:However, you can encode your Unicode character in two other ways as well (see the documentation linked above):
