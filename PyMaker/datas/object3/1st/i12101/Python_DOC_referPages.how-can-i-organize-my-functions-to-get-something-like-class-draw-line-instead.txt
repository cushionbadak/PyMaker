I often use functions that are nicely organized into calls such as pygame.draw.circle. I want to follow this structure in my class but do not know how do so. I tried using a nested class but it was limited to its own scope rather than its parent's, which was necessary for it to function.How do I properly implement this feature?Alternatively, is it a bad idea to attempt to mimic this except for certain scenarios? What should I be doing instead?
Try this:Or, you could do it this way.draw.pyyour_project.pyYou may want to read https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages as you're making your final decisions.
