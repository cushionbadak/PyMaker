When I use the following code:My test fails because AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'.This is not at all what I expected. Obviously I would expect it to set the value like I want... but apparently config is only dict-ish, unfortunately.How can I patch this so config['db'] is the value I want, just for the lifetime of my test?
It appears that the problem is that I had a slight misunderstanding. Although ConfigParser looks dict-like, it isn't actually. The stack trace holds evidence of this:Note that it's trying to do a read_dict here. That's because it's expecting to have a section-ish format:From the docsHaving a single-key access is not possible. To get this example to work, you have to do the following:Note: Values will be converted to their stringish counterparts. So if you are trying to store an actual database connection (or similar) here, it won't work.
