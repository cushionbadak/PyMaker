In python, how can I write a function that get some number n and print all possible words(a-z) permutations(with replacement) when length=n.Without using recursion and without using external functions like itertools.permutations, itertools.combinations etc..For example:n=2 should print n=3
Basically you are counting. Here is an example. A tried to keep it simple so it is easy to follow:The only point where you really work with your items is in get_string.EDIT: small adjustment so the output is formatted like in your question
