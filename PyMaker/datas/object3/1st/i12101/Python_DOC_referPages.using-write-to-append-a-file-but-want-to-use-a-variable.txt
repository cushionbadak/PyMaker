In my code I have a file opened, and I want to append to the file the current date and time. I'm using datetime to get the dateAnd assigning the current date/time to a variable called "currenttime"When I try to do this, I get the error:
This is becuase you're trying to write a datetime object to a text file. You can convert the datetime object in a few different ways to make it writable, for example:orie:If you want to use a special format of your timestamp you can use strftime, for example:You can read more about formatting the datetime here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behaviorFrom the name of your file and the fact you're adding a timestamp it might be a good idea to look into the logging module in python, if logging is what you want. It's very well suited for that purpose instead of manually writing to a file: https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html
Convert currenttime to string with str():Note that you should write to your file with f.write(), not log.write().
Typecast datetime object to str
