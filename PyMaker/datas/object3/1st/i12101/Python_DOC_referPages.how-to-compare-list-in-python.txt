I have one list I want to compare this list with other list but also I want to extract the information regarding the list content in numeric order.All other list have the elements that are same as a.So I have tried thisI want to compare a1 with a and extract dict values [3, 5, 6, 8].
Just loop through a1 and see if there is a matching key in the dictionary you created:Demo:However, take into account that you are using floating point numbers. You may not be able to match values exactly, since floating point numbers are binary approximations to decimal values; the value 2.999999999999999 (15 nines) for example, may be presented by the Python str() function as 3.0, but is not equal to 3.0:If your input lists a is sorted, you could use the math.isclose() function (or a backport of it), together with the bisect module to keep matching efficient:This tests up to two values from a per input value; one that is guaranteed to equal or lower (at index - 1) and the next, higher value. For your sample a, the value 2.999999999999999 is bisected to index 3, between 2.1 and 3.0. Since isclose(3.0, 2.999999999999999) is true, that would still let you map that value to 4 in b.
