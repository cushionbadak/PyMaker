I have this program that simply takes two files and compares them line by line. It works fine as long as both files have the same amount of lines. My problem would be what if for example file2 has more lines than file1? Or the other way around. I get the  IndexError: list index out of range error when this happens.  What can  I do to take this into account? 
Instead of reinventing the wheel, why not use the built-in difflib? Here is an example using difflib.unified_diff from the docs:
You should catch the IndexError and then stop your comparison
Perhaps you can use itertools.izip_longest. If one sequence has been exhausted, it emits some fill value (by default, None):Edit As @danidee correctly notes, for Py3 it is zip_longest.
