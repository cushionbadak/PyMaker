New to Python and programming in general, and maybe I'm asking the question wrong, but I can't seem to find what I'm looking for. So, I'm trying to take an input:And define it as a dictionary to then be added to as they add stats, program does math for derived stats and adds to them, that type of stuff. So, if the input is 'John Doe', and I strip the whitespace out:How do I then take the resulting string 'JohnDoe', and define it as a dictionary type? I'm keeping this in program to get more comfortable with it, then I'll eventually be looking to create files that it will load/save for different users with a GUI and everything. But that's very long term right now. I do take this and print a formatted sheet using the keys of the dictionary. 

Maybe this example will give you a bit of an idea how a dictonary works:
