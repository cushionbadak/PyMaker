rookie question here but I am making a very basic program with a GUI. It takes French words and translates them to English (sort of)Problem is, if I type in multiple words, it opens upI have triedBut that gives me errors, as does
You need to change show_entry_fields and use str's split() method:If you want the words to be separated by something other than spaces, then you need to pass the delimiter to split. For example, if the words are separated by a comma followed by a space (as in 'hello, world, bye'), then the split call should be word_list = e1.get().split(', ').As for the errors you get, e1 = [Entry(master)] makes e1 a list, which doesn't have a get() method. So you get an AttributeError when you call show_entry_fields. e1 = Entry[(master)] does not make an Entry instance but is trying to index into Entry (the class) which isn't the kind of thing you can index into. So this should immediately raise a TypeError.
