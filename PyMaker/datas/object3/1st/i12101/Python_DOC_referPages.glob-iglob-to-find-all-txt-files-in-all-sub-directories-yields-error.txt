Simple code gives the below error. It's directly from the docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)TypeError: iglob() got an unexpected keyword argument 'recursive'
It seems you're using Python 2.7 and reading the Python 3.5 documentation.
The recursive parameter has been added in python 3.5, which means version 3.4.3 also has that problem. If you don't want to upgrade your python version, you can use glob2, which supports recursive calls (**) by default.
