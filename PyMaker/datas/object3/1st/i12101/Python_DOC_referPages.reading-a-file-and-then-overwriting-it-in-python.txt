I've been trying to read a file and then overwrite it with some updated data.I've tried doing it like this:For some reason, it doesn't overwrite the file and the content of it stays the same.
Truncate the file after seeking to the front. That will remove all of the existing data.
You should add a call to truncate after seek as tdelaney suggested.Try reading and writing in different scopes, the code is more clear that way and the data processing is not done when the file handlers are open.
