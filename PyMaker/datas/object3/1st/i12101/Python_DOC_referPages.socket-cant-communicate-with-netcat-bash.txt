On a vm I used the command: nc -l -p 8221 -e /bin/bash and made a python3 script: this script doesn't work. By don't work I mean when I  run a command with my python script, lets say "pwd", it just loads but never runs.When, instead of running the python script I would run nc 192.168.1.60 8221, it would work fine. Any ideas why?
From input()'s documentation:The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string  (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.But Bash is operating in canonical mode and won't process input till a new line arrives. This won't happen, leading to recv blocking forever.add a + '\n' after the user = input("what to send?: ") to fix it.
