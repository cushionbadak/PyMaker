I'm working on a project using python to read the digital inputs on the raspberry pi. I wanted to turn one of the buttons into a toggle, as in it switches a value between 1 and 0 whenever I press it. Everything is working fine except the section:It seems like this should work with the rest of the code to make the value toggle between 1 and 0 whenever the button is pressed, but a prints as 0.0 every time, does anyone know why this is?
If you start with a = 0, both if statements match, and you end up back at 0.Use if .. elif instead; this is one statement and only one of the branches can ever match:I'm not sure what you are using these values for, however. Floating point comparisons are tricky, because calculations with floats can lead to very subtle differences, where it may look like you have 1.0 exactly but you really have 0.9999999999999872545. That'll not be equal to 1.0. Perhaps you wanted to use a boolean instead? In that case use:If you do need to use floats, test if your value is close enough:If you are using Python 3.5 or newer, you can use the new math.isclose() function:
