There is getpass(), a function which hides the user input.
If your using Tkinter:(this is Python 2.x. However, 3.x would be very similar)In the shell, this is not possible. You can however write a function to store the entered text and report only a string of *'s when called.Kinda like this, which I did not write. I just Googled it.

On Unix, the  prompt is written to the file-like object stream. stream defaults to  the controlling terminal (/dev/tty) or if that is unavailable to  sys.stderr (this argument is ignored on Windows).Note: This module mimics unix password prompts and does not show asterisks.Usage:
