I don't know if this is just a newbie mistake, but Python is not recognizing all of my arguments. I am using bash, so maybe this is the problem. I have a working argument called -vs and I am trying to make it detect a necessary integer after it, so the appropriate syntax is program.py -vs 5, or some integer. However, it does not recognize the "5". It does when I put the dash (-) next to it and make it start with a letter. How can I get Python to see this?Here's a fragment of the code:By the way, the argnum variable increases by one every time as I loop through these arguments. (I'm using a for arg in sys.argv[1:]. Do not worry, I start argnum as 0 and incrementing it is the first thing I do when looping, so it does not see the program path and/or name, or sys.argv[0].
Here's an example with argparse instead:
