The error reminded is the indice of str can only be integer, not str. Please help me figure out the my error
your students variable is a list of 3 strings, rather than list of 3 dictionaries
Because students contains Strings that just happen to be the names of students, not the student dictionaries themselves. Change:ToNotice the lack of quotes. 
You created the list students as a list of strings, not as a list of references.You should edit the content from:to using the references to the dicts created above:
you need to take away the quotes, so that would be:[lloyd, alice, tyler]
