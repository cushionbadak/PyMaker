Is there a way that I can parse a single comma delimited string without using anything fancy like a csv.reader(..) ? I can use the split(',') function but that doesn't work when a valid column value contains a comma itself. The csv library has readers for parsing CSV files which correctly handle the aforementioned special case, but I can't use those because I need to parse just a single string. However if the Python CSV allows parsing a single string itself then that's news to me.
Take a closer look at the documentation for the csv module, whichsays:So if you have string:And you want "an object that returns a line of input for eachiteration", you can just wrap your string in a list:And that's how you parse a string with the csv module.
You can still parse a single string with csv. Use StringIO to write a string buffer (also known as memory files):
Basically just @larsks answer above but more brief and demonstrating that it works on csv values that have commas inside quotes.If you upvote me, upvote the other answer too. https://stackoverflow.com/a/35822856/1196339
