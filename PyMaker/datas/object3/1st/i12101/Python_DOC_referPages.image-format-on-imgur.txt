I'm playing around in python trying to download some images from imgur. I've been using the urrlib and urllib.retrieve but you need to specify the extension when saving the file. This isn't a problem for most posts since the link has for example .jpg in it, but I'm not sure what to do when the extension isn't there. My question is if there is any way to determine the image format of the file before downloading it. The question is mostly imgur specific, but I wouldn't mind a solution for most image-hosting sites.Thanks in advance
You can use imghdr.what(filename[, h]) in Python 2.7 and Python 3 to determine the image type. Read here for more info, if you're using Python 2.7. Read here for more info, if you're using Python 3. 
Assuming the picture has no file extension, there's no way to determine which type it is before you download it. All image formats sets their initial bytes to a particular value. To inspect these 'magic' initial bytes check out https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic - it matches the initial bytes against known image formats.The code below downloads a picture from imgur and determines which file type it is.
