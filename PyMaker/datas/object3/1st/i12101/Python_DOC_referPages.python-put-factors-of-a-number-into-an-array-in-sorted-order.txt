I have written this algorithm that finds all factors of a given number and puts them into a list:Inside the list cofactors will be placed next to eachother, but I would like them to appear in sorted order instead. Example of output from algorithm above: for n = 36 it outputs [1, 36, 2, 18, 3, 12, 4, 9, 6]. I'm doing this as an exercise and I would like to know what the most efficient way of getting them in sorted order would be, any ideas?You can see one of my solutions below. It works, but I don't think it's optimal.
Just simply return the sorted list:how ever if you dont like using sorted function simply change for loop range to (1,n+1) :another way is using bisect(most efficient way):Insert in this module is O(n) however search is O(log(n))
The one thing you are missing is simpler and easier operations on your lists. There is a Python built-in for reversing a sequence: reversed.So you can do:
output:[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36]
