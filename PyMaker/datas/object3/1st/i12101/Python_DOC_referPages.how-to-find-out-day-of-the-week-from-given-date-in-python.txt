Write a function that accepts a string which contains a particular  date from the Gregorian calendar. Your function should return what day  of the week it was. Here are a few examples of what the input  string(Month Day Year) will look like. However, you should not  'hardcode' your program to work only for these input!Note that each item (Month Day Year) is separated by one space. For  example if the input string is:Then your function should return the day of the week (string) such as:Algorithm with sample example:Since we got 2, May 5 1992 was a TuesdayMy first question is how do I accept June 12 2012 as input from the user? Is there any method that allows me to do this? Any help would be appreciated.
