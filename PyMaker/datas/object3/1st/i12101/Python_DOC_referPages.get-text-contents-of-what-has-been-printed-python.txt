Lets say I print the following codeThis prints the results of an algorithm, appropiately to the numbers that the user enterred.Now if I wished to get a variable containing all that had been outputted to the python console, how would I go about that?EDIT: To clarify the reason I want the output if so basically I can clear the screen with "CLS" and reprint everything I've already printed but with the even x values crossed out as you are supposed to do with the russian peasant algorithm.
Its all about redefine your stdout to some inmemory stream.You can use printing to string. See python2 docs - Reading and writing strings as file, python3 docs - Core tools for working with streams.Do what you what with that string even print it with regular print.Code Python2:Code Python3:whatWasPrinted then can be changed, printed to regular stdout, etc.
What you seem to want is to tee the output, if we make a minor tweak to the Tee implementation here using a tempfile you can write to a TemporaryFile then get the output from that:
I'm not sure why you want to do this, so this might not help you, but it's possible to get all values printed in console by executing your script from another script.in a new file : should do the trick. communicate() with the options set in Popen will give you the console output.This might need some adaptation for unix.
