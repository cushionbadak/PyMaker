PYTHON VERSION == 3.5code:output:the output isn't correct because there should be more fields from the msg other than "MIME-Version" and "Delivered-To" I thought email.message_from_bytes() parses the contents of a byte stringis msg not a byte string?the docs recommend this:Is there a way to parse the returned message using the email module?so we can store the email details. like sender, body, header etc.
the answer turned out to be fairly easyinstead of joining  raw_email with a space just join it by a \n and the email module can parse the fields correctly:also an a awesome thing about using the email moduleis when you call email.message_from_bytes() the output returned is a dictso you access the fields like this:but what if the field doesn't exist?:the above code will return None and not throw a KeyError
