This question already has an answer here:When is del useful in python?                    17 answers                Learning Python at the moment. (coming from PHP)In Python there's a delete(del) function to delete your variables.This is new to me, What are the benefits of deleting a variable?What are the drawbacks of not deleting a variable?In what situation would I most likely want to delete a variable?EDIT:This question here just compares the differences between del var and var = none.I'm trying to understand why you would need to delete a variable in the first place. 
Although your question seems to point to same thought. But I have tried to respond in a way you asked it. Benefits of deleting the variableIt frees the memory occupied by that variable in the memory. After deleting the variable, the RAM can be used for other heavy tasks (like reading a file, loading an image, etc.)Drawbacks of not deleting the variableIf you don't delete the variables (say 10) initialized each with an image/video file then you can guess yourself that you can run out of memory. Now guess what if the videos were 5K then you will most probably run out of memory. This's were del will come to rescue your program. Situation in which you might need to delete the variableWhen you are sure that the variable will never be required in future. Or, again, when you might get into situations in which you may run out of memory.
