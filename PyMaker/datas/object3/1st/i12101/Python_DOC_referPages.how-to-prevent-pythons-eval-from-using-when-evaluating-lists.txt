I've noticed that Python's eval() function shortens some lists, using "...":How can I prevent it from doing so?(Subsequent code is barfing on the "...".):Here is a typical "line" from one of my human-created configuration files:
You are trying to serialize (save) arrays in wrong way. Numpy has np.save or numpy.savetxt, which you can use to save data and later numpy.load or numpy.loadtxt it from file.Don't use eval, it's neither safe nor sane to do this, because object representations may not show all information that is required to reliably reproduce some objects.If you're loading human readable configuration, a common way is via module configparser.
