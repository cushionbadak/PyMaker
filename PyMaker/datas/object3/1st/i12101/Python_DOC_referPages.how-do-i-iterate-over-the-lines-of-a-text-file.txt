Natural Text
I need to take lines from a text file and use them as variables in a python function.file is the variable name and I plan to have a text file containing a list of text file names like so:I can call the function  with a single file name fine:But I have a long list of files I need to go through. How can I read the file containing the file names line by line while calling the function once with each file name?
"How can I read the file containing the file names line by line while calling the function once with each file name?" ... you just explained what to do. Supposing your text file containing other filenames is "listoffiles.txt",Note that because call keeps overwriting output.txt you may have other issues.Depending on other design goals of course, you could have call work on an open file object instead of a file name. This makes the function more generic and potentially useful for other cases such as using other file-like objects such as StringIO.
in the following example I assign a text file string to an arbitrary variableI then eliminate the '.txt' so as to adhere to variable name conventionthen I assign the string value of x to a number 2if you try the code you should get
