I have an object:I am having issues passing self.THREAD_POOL[thread_index] as reference to def x(pool)I need x(pool) to change the value of the variable in the object.If i check the value in wait_for_finish then the object is not changed.Passing object by reference: (tested and works properly)this means that dictionaries in python are passed by reference; So, why in my code is it passing by value?SOLUTION@DevSharkaccording to the documentation, you should not do this unless absolutely needed. I decided not to use this. https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.JoinableQueueinstead i will be doing:
You are running your function in a different process. That's the way multiprocessing works. Therefore it does not matter what you do with the object, modifications will not be seen in other processes.To share data between process, see the doc as someone noted in a comment.Data can be stored in a shared memory map using Value or Array.
