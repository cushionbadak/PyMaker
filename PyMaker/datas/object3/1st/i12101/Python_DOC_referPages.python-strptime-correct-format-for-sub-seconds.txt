This question already has an answer here:How can I parse a time string containing milliseconds in it with python?                    7 answers                My datetime data is like this: I am trying to use But I get this error: How can I fix the format "%Y-%m-%d %HH:%MM:%SS" to match the datetime format that I have? 
This is the correct format:Breakdown:%H: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.%M: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.%S: Second as a zero-padded decimal number.%f: Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left.
You don't need to include two characters for hours, seconds and minutes in your format string; %S is "Second as a zero-padded decimal number", %H is "  Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.", etc. It's also worth noting that you're completely missing the symbol for microseconds (%f). You should add that if you want your format_string to work. Here is a link to the strftime() and strptime() behavior documentation
Per the documentation (I recommend bookmarking that link if you're planning to do any significant work with python dates and times), the correct directives for zero-padded hours, minutes, and seconds, are %H, %M, and %S, respectively (no doubled characters)Further, your input strings include microseconds, so you'll need to either remove those from the inputs or include the %f directive as well.Thus: datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')
