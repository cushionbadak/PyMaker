I am using python v2.7I have a csv file which could contain only space or tab without any characters (A-Z and special characters). It looks empty but the size is larger than 0. How can I check if the csv file contains no characters but only space and tab?I am using the csv module.
If you plan on doing anything with the CSV file if it's non-empty, the best idea probably is to read it into a list first, so you can still create a csv.reader object from it:
One easy way to do this:(note it will ignore tabs, line jumps and spaces).
