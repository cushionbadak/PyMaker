I have two nested lists:(l1 is completely unsorted but l2 is in alphabetical order, in case that is relevant.)Basically I want to end up with another list like this:So: merge the lists inside l1 which share a common first element then replace all the values in l1 with their corresponding values in l2 and finally format them in the manner of l3 (with the nested lists e.g. ['beta', 'gamma'] in alphabetical order).(This question is similar to what I want to do but I was unable to modify the answers given to fit my problem.)Thanks!
You can use dictionaries for (a) mapping the letters to words, and (b) for merging the lists. Particularly, have a look at collections.defaultdict to make it a bit easier.If you prefer the result as a list of sorted lists, just get the items from the dict.
