I am trying to check a URL using python selenium to see what page the site is on.  I have the following urls...I am using this python...This isn't working because all of the URL contain the string, how can I change it so that it only works for an exact match?
Use the equality operator == as follows:It is convention to put the variable name on the LHS of the equality operator and the string you are testing it against on the RHS.
If you want to go a step further, you can use regular expressions
