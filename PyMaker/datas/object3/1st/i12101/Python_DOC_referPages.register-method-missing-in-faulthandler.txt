I'm getting the following error message while trying to kick off iPython's notebook:This is under Python 3.4.  Looking in Python documentation I see that register is a documented method:faulthandler.register(signum, file=sys.stderr, all_threads=True,  chain=False)    Register a user signal: install a handler for the    signum signal to dump the traceback of all threads, or of the current    thread if all_threads is False, into file. Call the previous handler    if chain is True.However looking into the faulthandler module, I don't see the method listed:What am I missing?
I just ran into the same issue (python 3.5-64, windows, fully updated), you can upgrade ipykernel to an newer version (>=4.3.1) version where this is  resolved :pip install ipykernel --upgradeYou can also downgrade it (to <4.3) but downgraded is not recommended. There is a bug in ipykernel 4.3.0. which was introduced during the 4.2.x cycle and affect only windows users.An issue has been filled on GitHub, which will be fixed in 4.3.1 which has now been released. 
If you read a bit further down in the documentation you quoted, you'll see the reason register is not available for you:Not available on Windows.
