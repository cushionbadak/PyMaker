I tried to deploy my django app on the OpenShift, but somesthing going wrong, and I dont't know how to solve this problem.The result from rhc tail -a myproject:(and the site page show 500 Internal Server Error)It's my first time to deploy my app at OpenShift, a PaaS platform.Before that, I only deploy it successfully on my CVM with centos(python3.5, django 1.9.2).My files put like this:myproject/wsgi.py:myproject/myblog/wsgi.py:My Django version is latest 1.9.2, python 3.3 is provided by openshift.Thank you for watching my problem and help me figure out.
Django 1.9 only supports Python 3.4 or higher. Your specific error is caused by the call to find_spec which was added in Python 3.4.You can either downgrade to Django 1.8 or choose another PaaS provider which supports Python 3.4.
