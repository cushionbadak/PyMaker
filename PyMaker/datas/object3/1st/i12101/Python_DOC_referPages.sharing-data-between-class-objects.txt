I'm trying to improve my coding skills and use OOP when I need to replicate similar structures or when passing many parameters through functions.

Then I want to have these values in memory (to avoid multiple querys) and share them with different objects of a class.I tried something like this:But every time that an Object() is created calls Data and the query is executed.Is there any way to share the data without passing it as an argument?
