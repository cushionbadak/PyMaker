I get this message:Current code:This is no solution, since dict_a gets modified:Moreover dict_a is an instance of a custom class which does not support copying (it is lazy and creates items on the fly depending on the key), so I cannot simply do:How do I replace MergeDict?
You can use collections.ChainMap. It does the same thing as MergeDict: keeps a list of mappings and accesses them in order.However it's generally simpler to just actually perform the merge of the dictionaries. It probably isn't impossible to add copying support to your custom class and just update it.
