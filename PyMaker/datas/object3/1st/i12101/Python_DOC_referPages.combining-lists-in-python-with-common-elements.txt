I am generating lists with only '1' and '0' in them:I am trying to combine them so that if a '1' appears in either list, it appears in the new list, and replaces any '0'What would the code be?  
Use bitwise or | on a list comprehension and using a zip function:If the lists don't have same length, use zip_longest from itertools module:Another way, is to use starmap as well and remember in Python3, this yields a generator so you will have to convert it to list after that, this way:
Here's how you could create your third list:I have a feeling there's a way better way to accomplish what you want, without using these lists. You can think of your lists as binary numbers:
What you're looking for is the bitwise OR operation.  An OR of two bits will be 1 if either of the input bits are 1, and 0 if both are 0.  There are a variety of ways to do this in python over a list, but the simplest would just be a for loop.  Assuming the lists are the same length, this would work:
