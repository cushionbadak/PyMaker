Whenever I run this it just continues to get the p value, not the computed future value of the account?!
This is because you use // in your i//100 rather than /. This will cause the result of i/100 be rounding-down and hence always result in 0.0 as long as i < 100 (which will be the case). That is why your future value is always the same as your present, since you put money with no interest.Simply change:into:Also, since you never really need to eval I (it is just i/100 where you have already eval i from the user input), try to simply put I=i/100 like this:You should get your future value
