When trying to download the exported data via CSV, the terminal is coming back with an error. It is not a simple x.read() versus x.open() issue as shown here on a similar stacks question, but rather trickier since it's writing and saving to a csv file via Pyramid and Pyramid's Response method. I am a bit confused as to why this is happening and could use some guidance on finding the bug. I appreciate the guidance and suggestions. Python 2.7, PyramidView Code: Terminal Error: 
By returning the response from a with block, you are closing the NamedTemporaryFile before it is returned. You don't want to write to a file, but to a stream.I use something like the code below in Python3/Pyramid/SQLAlchemy and that works for me. Don't have python 2 installed, so not tested for python 2
