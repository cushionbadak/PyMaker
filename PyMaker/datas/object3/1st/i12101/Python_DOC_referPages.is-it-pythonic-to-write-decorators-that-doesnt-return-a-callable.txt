I observed that python decorator need not return a callable.  Tried below example in a django queryset.  Is it some how a bad practice?PS:Are there any situations where this technique can be used for more useful purpose?
From the Python Glossary:decoratorA function returning another function, usually applied as a function transformation using the @wrapper syntax. Common examples for decorators are classmethod() and staticmethod().Edit: A decorator that does not return a callable would not fall under this official defnition of the term 'decorator'. It would by unpythonic.
