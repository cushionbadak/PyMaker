I am currently working through a python tutorial that has asked me to create a random function and run it 10 different ways. I'm stuck on how to actually get it to use floats. I Assume I should post the entire thing and just point out where I'm trying to get float to workThese two parts simply refuse to return a float. Here is what I tried so far.I've attempted to add float when calling on the function variable, as followsvolume float(length4, width4, height4)I tried to add float to the actual definition part of the function as followsdef volume float(length, width, height):as you can see, I have float placed in the actually math part of the function, with no effect.It must be possible to make this work. I am hoping someone more knowledgeable can point the way, and I am out of ideas
There's nothing wrong with your math, you're just printing the result as an integer by using %d. If you use %f instead, you should see the correct result:
Use %f instead of %d when you want float instead of integer.Also, you can format your strings more with "%0.2f" where 2 is how many decimal places you would like.
