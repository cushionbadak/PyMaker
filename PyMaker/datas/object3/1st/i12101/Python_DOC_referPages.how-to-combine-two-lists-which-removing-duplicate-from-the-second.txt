How do you combine two lists whilst ommitting items in the second list that have the same first tuple value as the first tuple value in the first list?e.g If I have two lists:The new list should be:without (1,34) or (32,75) since 1 and 32 are in the first list. The lists can be of any size.
Construct a set whith the first element of each tuple in a and use a list comprehension on the elements of b, discarding the tuples whose 1st element is contained in the set
You could use itertools.chain to join you  list a to one for checking, then use list comprehension:
Combine the lists: comb = a + bSort them using a stable sort: comb.sort() (Luckily the sort in Python is stable)Walk through the sorted list and remove duplicates
