Natural Text
I have a file that is encoded in Unicode or UTF-8 (I don't know which). When I read the file in Python 3.4, the resulting string is interpreted as an ASCII string. How do I convert it to a Unicode string like u"text"?
The term "Unicode" refers to the standard, not to a particular encoding.Since files in computers are binary, there exist different ways of encoding Unicode data in binary files.  One of them is "UTF-8".You can consult https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.htmlAn example taken from this document (in the section "Reading and Writing Unicode Data")In python 3, unlike python2, unicode string constants are not written with a "u".
