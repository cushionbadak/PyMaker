Hi I'm teaching myself python, have downloaded 3.4 and am working through Think Python. The problem i'm having is printing a grid. I won't put the whole code up but the bit that is a problem. now this when called is supposed to print a beam like this + - - - - + - - - - +However, the actual output is+ - - - -+ - - - -+I've spent a good two hours on this but the version of python i'm using is different from the book I'm working on. Could anyone help me out of this log jam?
The problem is that, by default, the print function creates a new line at the end of its output. Here's an easy fix.
With python 3 to prevent newline characters being printed set end="" like so:print("+ - - - -", end="")You can read the documentation on this here
