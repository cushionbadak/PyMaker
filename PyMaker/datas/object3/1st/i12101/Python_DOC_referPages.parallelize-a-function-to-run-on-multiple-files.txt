Natural Text
I have a python script (with methods) that parses a .txt file to match some strings. I have four other .txt files, all sitting in the same directory including the original file.  How do I go about parallelizing my code such that I can run the python script on all of them? 
For example using concurrent.futures:You can add optional postprocessing logic using as_completed method.
