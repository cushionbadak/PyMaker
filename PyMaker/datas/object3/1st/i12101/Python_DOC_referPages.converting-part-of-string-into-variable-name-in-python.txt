Natural Text
I have a file containing a text like this:Does anyone know, how could I extract variables like below:...  and so on
If the lines you want always start with upstream and server this should work:app_dic should then be a dictionary of lists:EDIT If the input file does not contain any newline character, as long as the file is not too large you could write it to a list and iterate over it:This is more ugly as one has to search for the closing curly bracket to break. If it gets any more complicated, regex should be used.
If you are able to use the newer regex module by Matthew Barnett, you can use the following solution, see an additional demo on regex101.com:This makes use of the \G modifier, named capture groups and some programming logic.
This is the basic method:Obviously that's a bit rough around the edges, but it will perform a full-scale regex search of whatever string it's given. Probably a better solution would be to pass it the objects themselves, but for now I'm not sure what you would have as raw input. I'll try to improve on the regex, though.
I believe this as well can be solved with re:Or similarly with re.finditer method and without pat.scanner:
