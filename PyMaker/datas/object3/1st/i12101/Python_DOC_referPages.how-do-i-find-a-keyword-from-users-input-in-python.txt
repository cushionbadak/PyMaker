Natural Text
When the user types in  anything in key_words it will work, but if the user enters it in the sentence its works like this:It's supposed to find the keyword "screen" and enter yes but it just goes blank. I know I have to split the user's response but how would I do this for the recent python?
This looks like a good job for any. You want to iterate over your sentence and check to see if there exists a word in that list. If there is "ANY" match, return true: You also do not need to case to str as it will already give you a string. So I removed that, it is unnecessary. As mentioned in the comment, you do in fact have a syntax problem at the end of your conditional statement.
Since split() returns a list and not a single value, you must test each of its elements individually (in a loop).  If the user enters more than one of these keywords, multiple messages will be printed.  N.b this is for python3.  For python2, use raw_input instead.  I also removed the str() in the input() function. 
The solution can be achieved by converting both the key_words and user_input sentence to a set and finding intersection between the 2 setsOutput:

You can use set intersections.Another Option This is much easier and self-explanatory. Count each word in key_words. if anyof those just say you should do this...
