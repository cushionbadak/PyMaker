Natural Text
I would like to extract all link targets from a piece of text. So for example, from the followingI would like to get ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'].However, I would like to skip any links that are in parentheses and occur before a link that is not in parentheses. After the first link that is not in parentheses, parentheses become irrelevant and I would like to match all links. So, for the stringI would like to get ['d', 'e'].I have tried using the regex module. The following expression captures all links (with and without parentheses):How can I skip initial links in parentheses?
So basically the task is to drop links while they are inside parentheses, and then return all the links in the remainder. You can use the (aptly named) itertools.dropwhile in combination with regex.Here's how I would do it:Trying this on your data:People will usually tell you to parse HTML etc with specialized libraries and they are often right. HTML is not a regular language and regex can't really deal with it in its full complexity. But you seem to be dealing with a "regular" sort of data here, for which regex might just work.
Parsing HTML is not an easy task, and not easily done with regexp, you'd better use a real HTML parser like html5lib which is really great. Once the HTML parsed you can spot interesting values with a simple state machine or whatever pleases you:
