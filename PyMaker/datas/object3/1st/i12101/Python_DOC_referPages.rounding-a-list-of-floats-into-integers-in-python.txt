I have a list of numbers which I need to round into integers before I continue using the list. Example source list:What would I do to save this list with all of the numbers rounded to an integer?
Simply use round function for all list members with list comprehension :If you want round with certain presicion n use round(x,n):
You could use the built-in function round() with list comprehension:You could use the built-in function map():I wouldn't recommend list as a name, though, because you are overriding the built-in type.
Another approach using map function.You can set how many digits to round.
You can use python's built in round function.The output is:
NumPy is great for handling arrays like this.Simply np.around(list) or np.round(list) works.
