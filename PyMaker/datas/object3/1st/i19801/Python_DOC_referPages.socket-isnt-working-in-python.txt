I've been trying out the 'socket' module in Python but whenever I attempt to run this code :Then it dies. Here is the error without the except and try :I've just started Python(Today) and am in need of help.I saved it as socket.py but also sock.py ...
looks into the current directory before Python's standard library. And since your file is called socket.py, it is itself imported instead of the socket standard library module. Rename (don't copy, since that would leave the original file) the file to something else, such as my_socket.py.
