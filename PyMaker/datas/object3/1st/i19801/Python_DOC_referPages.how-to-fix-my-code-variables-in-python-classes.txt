This code will not work due to the variable and if I remove the variable test and make itHow would I fix my code so it would allow for input of a variable?This is just a test I am doing so I can make it work in a much bigger code.
When you specify command = self._test, self._test is a function that will be called. self._test("A") is not a function, it's a call to a function (that returns None because there's no return statement in the definition).You can write 'a function that calls self._test("A") as either lambda: self._test("A"), or functools.partial(self._test, "A"), or explicitly in GameBoard.__init__:
The problem is when you do command = self._test("A"), you are calling the function, and using the returned value (which is None in this case).The solution is to use functools.partial(), which takes a function and some values, then gives you a new function which just calls the given function with the values you passed it (and any additional others you pass when you run it):You could also do this manually by making your function return a function:Do note that this would impair your ability to call _test() normally elsewhere.
When creating handlers for buttons, it is a good idea to pass the button itself to the handler. That way, a single handler can handle many buttons, and the handler is free to examine all the properties of the button.Here's a simple way to achieve that based on your code:
