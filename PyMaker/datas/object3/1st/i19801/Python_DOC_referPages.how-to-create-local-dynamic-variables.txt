Natural Text
this is my code, I want to use eval() to get the rule status but eval() needs local variables, there is many classes that inherits the base class, so I need to rewrite get_stat() in every class.I want to avoid this, an idea is to create dynamic variables in get_stat(),eg. class b dynamically creates variables a and b in func get_stat()How should I create dynamic varables in function? or any other way to avoid this stupid idea. I use python 3.2.3, locals() does not work
You can pass a dictionary to the eval() function containing the variables to evaluate the expression against:Pass self.__dict__ to give access to an object's attributes:Links:eval__dict__
