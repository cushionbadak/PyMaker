Natural Text
I have a file "data.txt" with lines such asI have a python script that reads this file line by line and splits it up into a tuple of data in the form (id, street address, city, state). The script splits each line up by commas:This method clearly breaks down because I have some lines that have chunks of text surrounded by double quotes that I want to consider as a whole entity in the tuple as opposed to two distinct pieces of data.How do I tell python to treat blocks of double quotes a single entity when splitting by commas?I have tried splitting by quotes first and then commas and vice versa, but these methods don't seem to get at what I am trying to do.
Use a real CSV parser. Python 2, Python 3
That is called a "comma separated values" or short "csv". Python has a library for reading it.Check out: http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html or http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html if you are using Python 3.
