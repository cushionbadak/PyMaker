I'm making a game in python, and it has a health system. Can I make the program check for changes in the game_state['health'] I have all the time without using if game_state['health'] = =< 0?
Definitely read up on some educational materials, tutorials, etc.A basic approach might be something like the following:Your main game thread would receive the EndGameEvent and act on it appropriately.  I guess this is still using your check, but you don't have to explicitly write a line of code every time you want to check the health status.
