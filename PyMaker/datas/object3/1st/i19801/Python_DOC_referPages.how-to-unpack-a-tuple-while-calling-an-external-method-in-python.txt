I call a method of an external library multiple times in my class like this:The lines containing the with statement are bugging me, because they require passing the the constants as arguments every time. I would like to store the arguments in a predefined data structure like a tuple and pass that to the external library.
You can do this:The * syntax unpacks an iterable (tuple, list, etc.) into individual arguments in a function call.  There is also a ** syntax for unpacking a dictionary into keyword arguments:You can also use both in the same call, like func(*args, **kwargs).
