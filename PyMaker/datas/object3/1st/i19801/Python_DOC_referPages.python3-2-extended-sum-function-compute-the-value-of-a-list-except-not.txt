In some code I'm writing, I'd like a function similar to the built in sum() function, except with my own custom two-argument function as opposed to addition. It's easy to write such a function, but I'm wondering if there's one in the standard library somewhere? I took a look through the itertools doc, but didn't find anything. It would also be similar to itertools.accumulate(mylist)[-1], except with functions other than sums.My own code for such a function:     So sum(mylist) would be equivalent to accumulate(mylist, lambda x, y: x+y). In my use case of course, I have a different function I'd like to use (it is more complicated than a simple arithmetic operation.)It seems like this would be a fairly common thing, which is why I'm surprised half an hour of searching didn't find anything like this. So: If and where does such a function exist in the standard library? (I'm using my own code above for now.)
The usual name for that function is fold or reduce, and it's actually built into Python 2 under the latter name:In Python 3 you have to import it from the functools module.
