I am new to python. I am trying to make a small elavator program.The code: I get this error: AttributeError: type object 'int' has no attribute 'getLevel'Aside from changing the str to int, am I using any bad technique? I really want to improve my programming thinking and code writing. Thank you :)
int() is a type, so to instantiate it, you need to do int(getLevel), not int.getLevel.Check the docs for examples and more.Also note that getLevel is an odd name for the variable, as it implies it is a function that gives the level. A better name would be just level.It's also worth noting that input() evaluates the input as Python code (In Python 2.x, in 3.x it acts as raw_input() does in older versions), so getLevel will already be a number, although I would recommend using raw_input() instead, and keeping your conversion from a string to an integer, as it won't allow arbitrary execution of code, which is much better.
Here is the sample code modified:
