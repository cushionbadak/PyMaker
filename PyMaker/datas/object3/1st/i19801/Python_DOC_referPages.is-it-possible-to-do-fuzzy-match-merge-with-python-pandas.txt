I have two DataFrames which I want to merge based on a column. However, due to alternate spellings, different number of spaces, absence/presence of diacritical marks, I would like to be able to merge as long as they are similar to one another.Any similarity algorithm will do (soundex, Levenshtein, difflib's). Say one DataFrame has the following data:Then I want to get the resulting DataFrame
Similar to @locojay suggestion, you can apply difflib's get_close_matches to df2's index and then apply a join:.If these were columns, in the same vein you could apply to the column then merge:
I have written a Python package which aims to solve this problem:pip install fuzzymatcherYou can find the repo here and docs here.Basic usage:Given two dataframes df_left and df_right, which you want to fuzzy join, you can write the following:Or if you just want to link on the closest match:
I would use Jaro-Winkler, because it is one of the most performant and accurate approximate string matching algorithms currently available [Cohen, et al.], [Winkler].This is how I would do it with Jaro-Winkler from the jellyfish package:Output:
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/merging.html does not have a hook function to do this on the fly. Would be nice though...I would just do a separate step and use difflib getclosest_matches to create a new column in  one of the 2 dataframes and the merge/join on the fuzzy matched column 
As a heads up, this basically works, except if no match is found, or if you have NaNs in either column. Instead of directly applying get_close_matches, I found it easier to apply the following function. The choice of NaN replacements will depend a lot on your dataset. 
You can use d6tjoin for that   index  number index_right letter0    one       1         one      a1    two       2         too      b2  three       3       three      c3   four       4       fours      d4   five       5        five      eIt has a variety of additional features such as:check join quality, pre and post joincustomize similarity function, eg edit distance vs hamming distancespecify max distancemulti-core computeFor details seeMergeTop1 examples - Best match join examples notebookPreJoin examples - Examples for diagnosing join problems
