Natural Text
I want to display only the diff between commits that have a tag added to them. Or the closest to this. In other words something like this:And so on. I have tried but cannot get this specific format maybe someone can help me out there. Then once I have a text file with this format or as close as possible I do the following:After doing this I do not know how TO READ EACH OF THE LINES IN EACH OF THE STRINGS in the array tag_separation?Once I can do this I can check if line in the string starts with a certain character (@, +, - or tag) and store different lines in data structures to manipulate later.Thanks in advance for the help!
You might want to use the GitPythonlibrary, which will give you an higher-level access to your git repository.And even if you decide not to use it, you can probably have a look at how it's done there!
Git wonâ€™t be able to give you that format in a single command, so you need to create it yourself a bit. For that, here are some hints:You can get a list of tags using git tagYou can get the commit SHA1 for a reference (i.e. tag) using git rev-parse TAGNAMEYou can get the diff between two commits using git diff A..B, for example git diff tag1..tag2That way you also end up with already separated diffs for each tag, so you do not need to store it in a file first and split it again, you can just start with it.After doing this I do not know how to read each of the lines in each of the stringsYou can iterate through the lines of a string by splitting it first, using str.splitlines.
