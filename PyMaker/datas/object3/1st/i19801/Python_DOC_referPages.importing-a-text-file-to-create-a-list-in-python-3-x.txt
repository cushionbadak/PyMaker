I can't seem to figure out how to use values given in a text file and import them into python to create a list. What I'm trying to accomplish here is to create a gameboard and then put numbers on it as a sample set. I have to use Quickdraw to accomplish this - I kind of know how to get the numbers on Quickdraw but I cannot seem to import the numbers from the text file. Previous assignments involved getting the user to input values or using an I/O redirection, this is a little different. Could anyone assist me on this?
Depends on the contents of the file you want to read and output in the list you want to get.It could be more accurate if we knew the input and output requirements.
