I'm new to Python and coming from a PHP background.. I'm impressed.  Is there a way of getting a list of numbers from this sequence:i.e. if i=2 and n=30:4, 6, 8, ..., 30Okay, this is a really simple sequence but is what's a more general way to do this sort of thing functionally?Maybe there's some nice functional programming way of doing this?  In PHP I think I would make some function some variables and interaction but Python might be able to do it more elegantly?Many thanks.
