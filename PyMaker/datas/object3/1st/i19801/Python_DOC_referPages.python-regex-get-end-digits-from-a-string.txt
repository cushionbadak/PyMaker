I am quite new to python and regex (regex newbie here), and I have the following simple string:I would like to extract only the last digits in the above string i.e 767980716 and I was wondering how I could achieve this using python regex.I wanted to do something similar along the lines of:indicating that I want to find the stuff in between (.*?) which starts with a "-" and ends at the end of string - but this returns nothing..I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction..Thanks.
You can use re.match to find only the characters:Alternatively, re.finditer works just as well:Explanation of all regexp components:.*? is a non-greedy match and consumes only as much as possible (a greedy match would consume everything except for the last digit).[0-9] and \d are two different ways of capturing digits. Note that the latter also matches digits in other writing schemes, like рнк or р╡и.Parentheses (()) make the content of the expression a group, which can be retrieved with group(1) (or 2 for the second group, 0 for the whole match).+ means multiple entries (at least one number at the end).$ matches only the end of the input.
Nice and simple with findall:Regex Explanation:Or more simply just match the digits followed at the end of the string '([0-9]+)$' 
Your Regex should be (\d+)$. \d+ is used to match digit (one or more)$ is used to match at the end of string.So, your code should be: -And you don't need to use str function here, as s is already a string.
Use the below regex$ depicts the end of string..\d is a digit+ matches the preceding character 1 to many times
Save the regular expressions for something that requires more heavy lifting.
Try using \d+$ instead. That matches one or more numeric characters followed by the end of the string.
