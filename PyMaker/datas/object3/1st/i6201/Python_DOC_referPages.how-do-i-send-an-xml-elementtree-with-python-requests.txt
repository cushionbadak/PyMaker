Natural Text
I want to send an XML POST request using the Python 3 Requests library.When I create my XML body as a plaintext string, I am able to send XML bytes to the server without any issues. However, if I send my request as an ElementTree.Element, the server responds with the error message "Premature end of file".Writing XML as plaintext (works)Building XML with ElementTree (fails)When I tried printing my XML ElementTree to debug, I found that Python was interpreting it as an object, rather than as parsable text. I suspect that this may be the cause of the issue.Ideally I would like to build my XML POST request using ElementTree.Element, then send it to an API using Requests.How can I send an XML ElementTree.Element to a server using Python Requests?
Use ElementTree.tostring() to create a string representation of the xml.
