How can I get a better way?josn :I want the result.I tried this.

You can use ast.literal_eval()Output:
You could use regex
So, time for some string magic:This will land you with home = '1p: 2, 2p: 0, rs: 2, 3p: 0, penalty: 0, fe: 2, ord: 2, ot: 0'But in essence, this is a one-line workaround for doing the exact same thing you were doing with the replaces. It converts the string home to a dictionary to use in a comprehension. In the end, the dictionary is replaced by a string. I do not see what the use would be for removing a piece of structure engrained in the json, except if it is for printing purposes, which can be done more efficiently in a dict comprehension.
