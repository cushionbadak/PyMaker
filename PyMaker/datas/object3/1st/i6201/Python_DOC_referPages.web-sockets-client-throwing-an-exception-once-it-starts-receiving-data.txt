You use run_until_complete() which completes once you started process. Instead, you should use .run_forever(). It will keep your socket open, until you close it. EDIT:You can do something like this:Or:Or if previous examples didn't succeed, you can try with following code:
From what I can tell, your current code will exit after it receives its first message.Try changing your code to a consumer pattern, as mentioned in the websocket docs here:https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#common-patterns
