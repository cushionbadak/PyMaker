Natural Text
I need to count the number of words and the number of spaces of the text indicated below through defining a function in Python. I tried with the split(" ") command but due to the text are in two different lines I don't know how to do it. Can somebody help me?text1 = "A sentence is a group of words that makes complete sense, \n contains a main verb, and begins with a capital letter."
You can try the followingwordsspaces
Another way to count the number of words it's the following:print len(text1.split())
