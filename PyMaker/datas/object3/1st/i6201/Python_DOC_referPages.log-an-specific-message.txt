I am familiar with that kind of error. I pull CSV data from a certain website, but the subscription was expired, so I got that error. I would like to log an specific error that will tell me 'At least one sheet must be visible. Verify that your subscription with blabla.com is still active.' whenever I have that kind of error. How could I do such thing in python
Use try and except. If you don't know how logger works check out this tutorial by Fang. In the case your wondering more about Exception in Python check out the tutorial given by jonrsharpe in the comments.
