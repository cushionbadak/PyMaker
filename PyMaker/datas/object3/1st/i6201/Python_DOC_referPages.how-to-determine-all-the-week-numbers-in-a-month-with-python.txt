I have the following problem: Given a year and a month, determine the week numbers that are contained in that particular month, i.e., October 2017 contains week numbers 39,40,41,42,43,44. Caveat: As a rule, week starts in Monday and ends in Sunday. I have a cumbersome code that does the trick but I would like to know if there is a more elegant or Pythonistic way of doing this.  
You could simply return a range and avoid the whole initializing process. Also, note that isocalendar returns a 3-tuple of integers:If you really want to return a list, simply return list(range(...))
