I am trying to make a Raspberry Pi robot using Python and I don't really know how to use curses to assign a key to a movement. I am very new to this and would like some help.I wrote my try at the code below:I keep getting the following error:Please helpThanks,Aryan
Looking at your code, it looks like an error occurs inside of your try block. Unfortunately, I can only assume at the moment, that the error happens during the curses.initscr() call.Your finally block is always execute, even if an error occurred.To diagnose this further: Can you add a except to your try block and print the error?If you see an error like AttributeError: 'Module' object has no attribute 'initscr', then you probably named your python script curses. Rename it and delete the 'curses.pyc' file.
