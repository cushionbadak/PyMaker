I have an image sequence path that is as follows : /host_server/master/images/set01a/env_basecolor_default_v001/basecolor_default.*.jpgIn a pythonic way, is it possible for me to code and have it read the first file based on the above file path given?If not, can I have it list the entire sequence of the sequence but only of that naming? Assuming that there is another sequence called basecolor_default_beta.*.jpgin the same directoryFor #2, if I used os.listdir('/host_server/master/images/set01a/env_basecolor_default_v001'), it will be listing out files of the both image sequences
Try using glob. Something like:
The simplest solution seems to be to use several functions.1) To get ALL of the full filepaths, use2) To choose only those of a certain kind, use a filter.
read the first file based on the above file path given?With effective glob.iglob(pathname, recursive=False) (if you need the name/path of the 1st found file):glob.iglob() - Return an iterator which yields the same values as  glob() without actually storing them all simultaneously.
