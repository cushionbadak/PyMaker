I'm having some trouble in my program to back and forth between routines within a loop.Each routine turns on some LEDs for a specific time in a certain order constantly looping, they vary in time and order in each routine. What I have developed so far is a state to determine which routine should be running. For each routine, I have a button that will assign the value to that state. However, I'm not quite achieving this as my buttons to trigger the other routines while one is already running don't stop the current one running an initiate the one selected.I suppose what I need to know is: How to have a button that can assign the state at any given time throughout the loop? I'd like a routine to start whenever I push the button rather than wait for the current loop to end, like interrupting a sequence to start another. I don't want to break the loops, I would like to go back and forth between routines.In short, the program so far is basically:This is my current Code:
Here's an example that doesn't block execution by using sleep:Let me know if you have any questions.
