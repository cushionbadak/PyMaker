I am trying to bulk insert documents in MongoDB using python library pymongo.But I keep failing due to BulkWriteError. I am trying to insert only 10 docs sequentially without _id so conditions in this answer / discussion doesn't apply here. Similar question has no answer.  I have tried pymongo 3.4 and pymongo 3.5.1, both give the same error. I am on python3.6, mongodb 3.2.10. What am I doing wrong here?
Python is still referring to p as being the same thing for each array member. You want a copy() of p for each array member:Or even simply:Unless you do that the _id only gets assigned once and you are simply repeating "the same document" with the same _id in the argument to insert_many(). Hence the error for a duplicate key.As a quick demonstration:Gives you:Or more succinctly:Gives:Which clearly demonstrates the index value passed overwriting the same value which was passed in.But using copy() to take a copy of the value:Gives you:Or our base demonstration:Returns:So this is basically how python works. If you don't actually deliberately assign to a new value, then all you are doing is returning the same referenced value and simply updating each referenced value in the loop, rather than producing a "new one".
