Natural Text
I have following string I want to parse above messages using regular expression and print only messageoutput should be
If you want to regex it:This doesn't handle the special chars you have in there though.
This should do it:
python has find and index methods that will search a string left-to-right for a substring and return its position as an integer. It also has rfind and rindex that do the same, but they search right to left. So you can split the text on newline characters and slice each line. Could look something like this:yields output:The if line: was thrown in there because the final """ was on a new line which would have come up as an empty string and index/rindex throws an error if it can't find the substring in the string. If that is an issue, you can use the find or rfind methods which return -1 instead of throwing an error.It is also worth noting that unexpected results will show up if the message itself has a : in it.
If you have a string and want to get all the text after the FIRST ":", try something like this:If you want to remove the colon from the message, just add 1 to the indexThen you can do this for each line by using messages.split('\n') as shown below
