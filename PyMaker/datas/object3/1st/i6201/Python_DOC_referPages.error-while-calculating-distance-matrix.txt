I'm following this post to calculate distance matrixso this is the code snippetI had tried these two method(other one with comments)but it never worked though,now with these code I get the error
The urlib doc statesNote The urllib module has been split into parts and renamed in Python 3 to urllib.request, urllib.parse, and urllib.error. So importing with urllib, urlib.parse, etc alltogether seems somewhat strange. quote_plus() should be in urlib.parse. Did you try with that one?
