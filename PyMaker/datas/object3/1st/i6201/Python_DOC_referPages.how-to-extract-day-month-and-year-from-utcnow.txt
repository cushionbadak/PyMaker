Use datetime.utcnow().date()Adding to answerThe datetime object always contains year, month, day as well as hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds. It is a combination of  what the date and time objects contain, see datetime ObjectsOutput:
Use time_created.day to find the day.(Similar for month and year)
