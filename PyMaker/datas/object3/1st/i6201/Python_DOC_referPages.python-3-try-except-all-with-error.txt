This question already has an answer here:How to get exception message in Python properly                    3 answers                Is it possible to do a try-except catch all that still shows the error without catching every possible exception? I have a case where exceptions will happen once a day every few days in a script running 24/7. I can't let the script die but they also don't matter since it retries regardless as long as I try except everything. So while I track down any last rare exceptions I want to log those to a file for future debugging.example: Any way to replace the_error with a stack trace or something similar?

You can do:Or use raiseDoc's are always your friend Tip: Avoid use "except:"Use something more descriptive likeUnless your code are very well tested, you can't figure out every error.
