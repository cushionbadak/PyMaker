In Django's strftime() and strptime() Behavior8.1. datetime — Basic date and time types — Python 3.6.3 documentationdate, datetime, and time objects all support a strftime(format) method, to create a string representing the time under the control of an explicit format string. Broadly speaking, d.strftime(fmt) acts like the time module’s time.strftime(fmt, d.timetuple()) although not all objects support a timetuple() method.Amongst the paragraph, what's d for in d.strftime(fmt)? Abbreviation for date and datetime?It does not make sense, because there are 3 objects specified at the starting of the paragraph.
I consider d here as a datetime instance. And strftime is a method of datetime instance which formats date to a given fmt format pattern.
This is the documentation for the datetime module; strftime is a method that - as that quote states - is available on all three of the classes in that module.d is just a name for the instance that you are calling the method on; it could be one of any of those types.
