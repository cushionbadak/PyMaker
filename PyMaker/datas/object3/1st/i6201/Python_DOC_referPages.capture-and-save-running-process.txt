I want to capture "print('Recording GPS Position...')"  on the SD card. For now, this is printing on terminal directly I want to capture this runtime process (p_1) from terminal and store on the SD card as it is being executed. How do I do this?Also in general what is a way to capture and store processes at runtime from terminal and store on the SD card (note I do want to store processes as it is being executed and not after its execution is done).
You'll want to choose a directory for your SD card, and instead of print()ing to the terminal you'll write() to the file you choose.Here is the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlEdit: it's been answered better here https://stackoverflow.com/a/8024254/8240691 but it would still be worth your while to look over the input/output documentation.
