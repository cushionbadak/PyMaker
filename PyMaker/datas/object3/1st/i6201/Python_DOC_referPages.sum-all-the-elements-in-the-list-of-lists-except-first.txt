Add all the elements in the list of lists except the first element and make a new list. Output should look like Eg:  -1083.88 of the output list is = -604.5+(-141.38)+(-338.0)=-1083.88I've tried like this   Thanks in advanced.
Going by your expected output, I believe you're looking for a transposition and sum on the columns. You can use zip for that.Alternatively, convert the transposal to a list and you can avoid the if check (this is similar to MaximTitarenko's answer, so credit to them as well).Or, if you'd prefer,Which is a little less elegant.
You can try this:
To use all python flavour you need to use itertools.islice since in Python zip() returns iterator and you cannot just [1:] subscript zip object.To include 'total' in the begging as cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ kindly noted in comments
If you want to be really efficient about it, you could use itertools' isliceEdit: sorry, didn't read the entire context the first time around :)
