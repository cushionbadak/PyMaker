I would like to extract one element from list in python.For example:As expected, the code print 0 for both a1 and b1.However I would like to get '0' for both a1 and b1 with single quotation mark instead of 0.Any idea or help would be really appreciate.Thank you,Issac
Quotation marks are not parts of a value - they are only for distinguish e. g. the number 1 from the string with the only symbol 1.The print() function don't print quotation marks even around strings (unlike  an interactive session when you give as input only a variable name or an expression).So you have manually put them into the print() function, e. g.oror - in Python 3.6+ -
Normally, Python will print a string without quotes. That's standard in almost all programming languages.However, Python does let you print a string with the quotes, you just need to tell it to print the representation of the string. One way to do that is with the !r formatting directive.The items in a are integers, if you want them printed as strings you need to convert them to strings.outputYou can read about the representation of a string in the official tutorial.There are other ways to see the representation of a string. For example, you can call the built-in repr function:Bear in mind that if a string already contains single-quote chars then its representation will be enclosed in double-quotes:outputAnd if the string contains a mixture of quotes then the representation will revert to using single quotes, and using backslash escapes to denote single quotes:outputSo if for some reason you don't want that behaviour, then you will need to print the quote marks explicitly:output
well,will do, but as commented by others I am unsure about your intentions.
I searched online and found Why are some Python strings are printed with quotes and some are printed without quotes?I think if you print as follows, it will work as you wish:
