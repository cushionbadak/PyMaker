Natural Text
So I have a list of sentences and I want to remove punctuation from each sentences. I can remove it in this manner:But I want to modify the list content and do it one line. Something like this:What is the proper way to do it?
In Python 2, you can use str.translate() like below:Output:In Python 3, you can use str.maketrans() like this:Note: Using your approach, you can do:In one line:
I think the fact that you're trying to solve this in a one-liner points out that this is more of a riddle, so I'll not answer with a complete solution.So, there's loads of ways to do this. You could build a regular expression, replacing all punctuation with nothing at once, for example.But, if we're going to stay with the idea of your last line of code, I think reduce() is the python built-in that you're looking for!
