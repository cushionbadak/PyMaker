I'm workign with Python 3, trying get an integer out of a digest in python. I'm only interested in the first n bits of the digest though.What I have right now is this:This however results in a ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: b'\xa9J' error.Thanks.
The Py3 solution is to use int.from_bytes to convert bytes to int, then shift off the part you don't care about:Example use:On Python 2, the function can be used almost as is, aside from adding a binascii import, and changing the conversion from bytes to int to the slightly less efficient two step conversion (from str to hex representation, then using int with base of 16 to parse it):Everything else works as is (even the // operator works as expected; Python 2's / operator is different from Py 3's, but // works the same on both).
