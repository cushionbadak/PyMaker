So I have two python scripts, one of which is calling a function in the other:First (first.py):Second (second.py):My goal is to save the output from get_value in first.py to save to the variable data as a list (i.e. [0, 1, 2, 3, ...]). Is there any possible way to do this, without printing these values in the process?Thanks in advance!EDIT: I can't alter first.py, due to other functions already relying on it's current output.
