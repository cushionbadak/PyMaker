What I have now is:where a[1] is the a[1]th 5 minute in a day, a[3] and a[4] are number of counts. I want to sort this by the first two elements.But when I use sort, a[0] always comes first.In fact, I want a[1] to come first. How should I do this?I have tried key argument in sort. For example, a.sort(key=int), error occurred saying that invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2013-11-20,29,0,0'  
Your issue is, that each item in your list is a string. If you sort a string, each character at each position will be compared with eachother. In your example all characters are the same until after the first comma. After the comma, the next characters are a '2' and a '3'. As '3'>'2', the sorting is not as you wish. I assume you want 29 be > 3.In this particular case, you could just reverse the sortingBut as you probably have a list with more items, this will not work... The only solution I see is to split each item in your list at the comma ','. Then convert the items which should be considered as integers to int. For example you can do it like this:Your temporary list looks now like this:[['2013-11-20', 29, 0, 0], ['2013-11-20', 3, 0, 2]]Then sort it by the position as you wish. This you can do for example like this:By using the itemgetter you can define in what order you want to sort. Here it is sorted at first by the element 0, then 1, etc... but you can change the order. a_temp_sorted now looks like:[['2013-11-20', 3, 0, 2], ['2013-11-20', 29, 0, 0]]Now you can convert your result again to a string. This you can do like this:a_sorted is now your sorted version of your source a. It now looks like this:['2013-11-20,3,0,2', '2013-11-20,29,0,0']
Make a key function that returns a tuple of values you want to sort on.Then use it to sort the list
