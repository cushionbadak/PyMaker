This is the changed code as you can see we need to split with comma so that it works properlyyou can learn more about split on tutorialspoint
If you're splitting by comma, you'll need to specify that delimiter to split:Otherwise, you split by space by default, meaning y becomes  Which is an invalid numeric value, raising the error.You can consolidate your code with a list comprehension:
Just to add a solution.You can open the file using the csv module:The [0] index is to get the first line in your fileand i used a list comprehension to get the values as integersmore about csv filesmore about the csv module
You can make a list of integers from the string you read from the file like this:
Inspired by @Karak's effort with ast.literal_eval() consider this:This will work as long as the file contains comma separated numbers (will also work with floats, and mixed floats and ints). If there is a single number on a line it must have a trailing , so literal_eval() will interpret the line as a tuple.
