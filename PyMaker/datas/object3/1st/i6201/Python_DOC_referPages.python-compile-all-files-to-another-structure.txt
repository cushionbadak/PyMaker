I have a Python project with files in a directories structure and I would like to get all .pyc files to the same directories to deliver without sources.I am trying to do this with python -m compileall -d /tmp/new -b . but all pyc files are created in their respective sources directories instead of /tmp/new/somedir/Any ideas? Will i have to create a script to recreate this structure?
Take a look about distributing *.pyc files:What are the limitations of distributing .pyc files?I suggest you use Py2Exe or cx_Freeze:http://www.py2exe.org/https://anthony-tuininga.github.io/cx_Freeze/
