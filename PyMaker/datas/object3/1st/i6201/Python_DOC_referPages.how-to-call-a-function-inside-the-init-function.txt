My professor wanted us to add a new function to this program called loadtemperatureData. This function uses a loop to load temperatures in the temperature file (filename) to a list and return the list to the caller. she also wants us to modify the __init__ function:Modify __init__ function to add one more data attribute temperatureList. Inside __init__ function, call loadTemperatureData function and assign the returned value to temperatureList.Modify calculateAverage function to use the data attribute temperatureList to calculate average temperature. Main function remains unchanged. I keep getting this error:This is my code:my original code is at the bottom im not sure what she wanted or if I attempted to do this correctly
Here's the modified code:Notes:I stripped a lot of the old (unused) codeThe commented return line from calculateAverage is the simplified form of the 4 lines below it. You can decomment it and delete the 4 following linesIn main, instead of having num1, num2, ... you could create a list: temperatures = [35, 63, 40], and then iterate over it: for temperature in temperatures:, temperatureFile.write(str(temperature) + "\n"). It's more elegant, and if you want to add another temperature, you just add a new element in the listOutput:
You modified __init__ to take 2 arguments (not counting self); as the error says, you are only calling it with 1.
You don't need to include the temperatureList parameter to your constructor - you're going to assign the return value of loadTemperatureData() to it regardless of the value of that parameter, so you can discard it entirely.On an unrelated note, I think you want to assign the return value of self.loadTemperatureData(filename) to temperatureList so it'd look something like Also, your loadTemperatureData is defined inside another function - so this code won't work if your class actually looks like the one you've included in the question.
Your constructor is declared with 2 arguments, while you are creating an object with one argument.You can remove second argument :
