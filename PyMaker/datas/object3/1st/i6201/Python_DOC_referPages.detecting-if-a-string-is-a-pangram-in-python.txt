How is this working?  It checks if a string contains each character from a-z at least once?This returns True for example:I can only assume it is something to do with lexographical ordering as stated here, but still a bit confused.Comparing two lists using the greater than or less than operatorWhen I read the link in this SO question:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#comparing-sequences-and-other-typesIt says:Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same  sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the  first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the  outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are  compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted. If two items  to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the  lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of  two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If  one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter  sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for  strings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual  characters. Some examples of comparisons between sequences of the same  type.But this isn't clear to me.
It is a set operation, not list. Which is equivalent to,s <= ts.issubset(t)Test whether every element in s is in t.See here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.htmlEdit: See here for the current version of Set. Though easier explanation is given in the old version (For comparisons).
No. It's comparing two sets. So it's converting the input string to lower case and then using Python's set type to compare it with the set of lowercase letters. This is very useful (and fast) technique for comparing two lists to see what members they have in common/difference.
