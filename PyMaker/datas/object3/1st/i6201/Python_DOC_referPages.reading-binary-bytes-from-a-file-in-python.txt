Consider a file that contains binary data represented as bytes:The bytes can only have either 0 or 1 values.What is the most performant way to take a group of 32 bit/bytes and parse them into a (32-bit) integer? The struct module is probably what I need but I couldn't find an immediate way to do this.Alternative methods that involve casting bytes into chars and then parsing the integer from a bitstring e.g. int('01010101...', 2) don't perform as fast as I need them to for my use case.
Workaround SolutionsConsidering the test number 101010...:Map bytes to string, then parse the int:Iterate over the bytes and build the integer using bitshifts:
