Ideally, setting up logging for simple scripts should take only one line of code. Unfortunately, most examples have up to ten lines of boilerplate. Is there a simpler way to get a basic logging setup?Edit: ideally, I'd like timestamps, maybe log level, and not much more.
I think the easiest way to setup a logger is to use the logging module.
There is a very nice module in Python called logging. You may find plenty of examples here logging-cookbook. Personally I use logging to log into a file and to be able to switch between different levels of verbosity when needed through whole of the project.
Ok, I just made a basic logging configuration module:That's not much, but now you can just:Which outputs useful information by default. This is as simple as it gets, but it uses a real logger, which means you can very simply switch to more complex logging in the future. I might even publish it to Pypi.
