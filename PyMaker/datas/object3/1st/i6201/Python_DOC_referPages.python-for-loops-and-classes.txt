What you need is for the Rect attributes to be randomly generated with the random module. I have modified the code you gave an made some changes.Firstly I changed the draw method so that it just draws at the x and y values.The biggest change was that instead of the big complicated myList list in your code, I just stored 10 Rect objects in a list called myRects which I think is much simpler.You can fiddle around some more with the number generation from around Line 45-52. You can read a bit more on the random.randrange() function here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integersI hope this answer helped you!
