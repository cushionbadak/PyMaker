I am having a python code like thisThis returns the output asKindly help me to solve this problem. I wish to enter every data into my file. 
file.write takes a single parameter, a string. You have to join your values and then write to the file. Lastly, do not forget to close your file:If you are going to multiple values later on, you should use a list:Edit:Regarding you recent comments, you have two options.Creating an initial dictionary:Or, using globals with a list:
Use f.writelines(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-ioNo line-separator is added.If you want to have a special separator, use "separator".join([str(i) for i in [a,b,c]]) and write this to file via f.write()
all the previous are valid ones, and I will try to complete them
f.write() only takes one argument and write that into your file. If you want to write multiple components, you can use f.writelines([a,b,c]). Also, you can only write string to a file, so make sure to do str(*) for all your variables.
All the answers suggested are good. If you want to make it more readable and neat, you can do this as well:
You can use the % operatorNotice that the substitution variables x, y, z are all in parentheses, which means they are a single tuple passed to the % operator.Here is an example that you can execute online.The code works perfectly.The output is : 13 15 16
