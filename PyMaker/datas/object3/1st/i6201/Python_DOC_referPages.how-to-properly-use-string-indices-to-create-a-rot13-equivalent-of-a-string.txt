For my programming class, we have to create a function that takes in a string argument and returns the rot13 equivalent of the string. When I try running my function, it says that count can't equal str[i] because string indices have to be integers. I'm honestly lost and what else I could do to make the function work. Any help would be lovely    
In Python, for i in str will loop through every character in the string str, with i set to that character (which you already know, since you're doing ord(i)). (Don't use str as a name, by the way: str is the Python name for the string type.) count = str[i] is treating the character in i as an index. You don't need to (or should) do that. It doesn't make much sense.
