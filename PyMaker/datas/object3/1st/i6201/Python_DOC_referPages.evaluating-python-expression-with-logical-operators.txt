I am trying to evaluate an expression with both arithmetic and logical operation. I am really confused with the output. For example:I gives the output of the condition after the & operator. Is it we cannot use logical operation in evalUsing OR operator , it gives me different output.When i tried with float values inside the expression, it throws TypeErrorUse it without logical operation ,Confused here .
Python logical operators are named and and or - & and | are the bitwise operators. So you want:This being said, eval() is very unsafe so don't pass it user inputs... 
Bitwise logical operators has higher precedence the equality. There is nothing specific to eval here.You should be using or in order to have the right precedence:As mentioned by @bruno desthuilliers, eval is not something you should use on user input. You should probably build you own mapping between user input and Python operation. If you really want to build Python expressions, you might want to have a look at the ast module.
