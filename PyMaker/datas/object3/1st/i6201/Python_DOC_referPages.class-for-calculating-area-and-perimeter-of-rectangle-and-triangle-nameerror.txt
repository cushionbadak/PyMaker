I get an error from this code, any idea? Looks like there is something with my test functions. I really don't understand this. I just started using classes, is there something important I have to thing about when making test functions within classes? The code seems to work fine if I dont call the test functions with test_Rectangle and test_Triangle. Tried looking in my book and other examples but can't find any solution to this problem. Code:
As jonsharpe pointed out, you are making wrong indentation, in defining the test_Rectangle function inside Rectangle classThe following program will work.EditBefore I thought you have given a small set of code from your code which replicates the issue and hence did not care to change the solution much, but now have updated the answer.UpdateSince, the test functions are inside the class, and since there was no instantiation of the classes and no calls to the test functions through those instances, the functions were not getting called.In the following code, i have moved your own functions outside the class definitions and called them explicitly.Have a look at these python libraries to write your testsUnit Test python 2Unit Test python 3
