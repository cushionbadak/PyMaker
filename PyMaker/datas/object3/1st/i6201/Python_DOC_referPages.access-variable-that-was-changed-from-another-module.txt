I'm studying Python and creating a simple chat bot. Consider I have a module with main function:And consider there is an another module where i want to access queue from bot module, but function from this module gets invoked some time after bot.py module got invoked:And when I try to access queue that should be in wrapper object I get and error saying there is no queue in wrapper. But if I run in debug mode over bot module I can clearly see that wrapper.queue contains object. But when create_job function from another_module.py is invoked it doesn't know that there were a queue in wrapper. The problem here in my opinion is that var queue from bot.py gets initialized after main() and init_queue() had finished working but module itself gets imported into another_module before that.What am I doing wrong (probably missing something about variable scope) and how can I get my wrapper.queue initialized in when create_job() is invoked?Thanks in advance!
You could use a property, so that the queue attribute is automatically initialised when it is first accessed:
