For a given exclude_list = [3, 5, 8], n = 30, k = 5I'd like to pick 5(k) random numbers between 1 and 30.But I should not pick numbers in the exclude_listSuppose exclude_list, n could be potentially large.When there's no need for exclusion, it is easy to get k random samplesSo to get the answer, I could doI read that range keeps one number in memory at a time.I'm not quite sure how it affects the two lines above.The first question is, does the following code puts all n numbers in memory or does it put each number at a time?2nd question is, if the above code indeed puts one number at a time in memory, can I do the similar with the additional constraint of the exclusion list?
Sample notes in sample's docstring:To choose a sample in a range of integers, use range as an argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a  large population:   sample(range(10000000), 60)I can test this on my machine:One way to sample with an exclude list efficiently is to use the same range trick but "hop over" the exclusions (we can do this in O(k * log(len(exclude_list))) with the bisect module:and we can see it working:Specifically we've done this without using O(n) memory:
