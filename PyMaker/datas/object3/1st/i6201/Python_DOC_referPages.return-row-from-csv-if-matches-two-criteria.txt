Natural Text
The following script works where REPORT_TYPE is SOD, but what if I want it also to have the criteria of a field called DATE in my CSV to be equal to 10-24-2017? The format of the DATE field also includes hours, minutes, seconds, but I want to ignore them (e.g. 10-24-2017T23:59:00).I tried the following but it does not like the AND in there and gives me an invalid syntax error.
Python doesn't have LIKE operator (unlike SQL).So you can use the startswith method:Also, use lowercase and, because Python's identifiers/keywords are case-sensitive (again, UNLiKE SqL).
