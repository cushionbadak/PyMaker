I'm trying to get html code from the QWebEnginePage object. According to Qt reference, QWebEnginePage object's 'toHtml' is asynchronous method as below.Asynchronous method to retrieve the page's content as HTML, enclosed in HTML and BODY tags. Upon successful completion, resultCallback is called with the page's content.so I tried to find out how call this method synchronously.the result what i want to get is below.Thanks for reading this. Have a good day you all.
A simple way to get that behavior is to use QEventLoop(). An object of this class prevents the code that is after exec_() from being executed, this does not mean that the GUI does not continue working.
You could use a multiprocessing.Connection object created as one side of a multiprocessing.Pipe's send method as the call back and then use the other end of the pipe's recv method immediately after.  Recv will block until the html is received, so keep that in mindexample:
