I'm new to this all, and I would like to simply determine what to write on the command line to run a python program (myprogram.py) which contains the following code at the end:The program is supposed to (among other things) change the working directory to a folder called "static", which is at the same location as myprogram.py.  I tried many things (including specifying the full path, with and without quotes, with nested quotes, etc), for example:I get:I read several docs (such as this) and examples etc, but am stuck.  Thank you!
There are two problems that I can see;dir is the name of the variable that the first unflagged argument will go into. You don't specific it on the command line, it's position is what makes it go here. So try running python myprogram.py static.I'm not really sure what Path is, but I think you just want to remove that argument. Without type specified, it'll default to string which is capable of holding a path.
