Objective: enter goal string; program loops trying random letters + space until goal word matches generated word. To expedite, when the randomly generated word has a character of some index that matches the goal word, the character is appended to a list and the range start point is now the length of that "correct character" list. However, on the 7th loop of this program there will always be a "string index out of range" error indicated at the first IF statement of the SCORE function. I don't understand how this is possible, because range stop is up-to-not-including and I am using the goal word length as my stop value. Any help is appreciated.

You seem to be misunderstanding how Python variables work:Afterthe variable rand_strg is still '' because you didn't assign the result of gen_rand_string() back to it. You don't need to initialize variables in Python (so the first line above is unnecessary), but you do need to saySimply returning a local variable (that happens to be named rand_strg too) doesn't magically change that variable in a different scope.
