In my Python code, I have :from vmtk import vmtkscriptsThe program has no issue finding "vmtkscripts.py". However, in vmtkscripts.py I have "__all__ = ['vmtkactivetubes']where "vmtkactivetubes.py" is in the same folder as "vmtkscripts.py". After running I get "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vmtkactivetubes'"However, this "from vmtk import vmtkactivetubes" doesn't give me any error.I would really appreciate if you could help me, why I get such a error?
This is a problem of scope, try using:This from the documentation:In all cases, if the optional parts are omitted, the code is executed  in the current scope. If only globals is provided, it must be a  dictionary, which will be used for both the global and the local  variables. If globals and locals are given, they are used for the  global and local variables, respectively. If provided, locals can be  any mapping object. Remember that at module level, globals and locals  are the same dictionary. If exec gets two separate objects as globals  and locals, the code will be executed as if it were embedded in a  class definition.
