I'm trying to install couple of modules via pip into custom directory using flag --target.e.g.:pip3 install --target /custom/module/location /path/to/package1Everything works just fine. By adding /custom/module/location to PYTHONPATH I can use my package1.But when I try to install package2 which requires package1 (located in /custom/module/location) pip throws:Basically:does not work, butworks just fine. Is there any way of telling pip to look into custom location /custom/module/location other than PYTHONPATH?btw when using first method, pip3 list can see the package1
I think target switch will be used like this:  You need to add /home/path/of/directory to PYTHONPATH to actually use them from that location.  You can upgrade pip by:-    
Solved it by using raw setuptools.First add a path to PYTHONPATH and then install local packages.
