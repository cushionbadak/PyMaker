I would like for child process to have certain properties, but since you can't force child methods to inherit the property decorator, I want to at least assert that these attributes of the child are properties of the class.Something like this:But of course by the time Parent.__init__() is run, self.foo has become 'bar' and there is an AssertionError. Is there a way to accomplish what I'm going for using meta classes? If so, can it be that the Parent class is the one that inherits the metaclass, not the Child? 
I found a solution. Instead of testing whether self.foo is a property, I tested whether it was not a bound method:This will work for most cases, but will fail if the property being returned by Child.foo is itself a bound method. Still open to more complete answers.
