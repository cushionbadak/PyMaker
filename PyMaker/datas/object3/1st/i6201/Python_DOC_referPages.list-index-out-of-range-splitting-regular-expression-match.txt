For some reason this little part of my code is giving me a problem. I have been trying to figure out why it is giving me a "list index out of range" errorThis is the arg I'm feeding it:Product Name: Tio Nacho Shampoo Mexican Herbs Recommended Use: Shampoo Manufacturer/Distributor name: Garcoa Laboratories, Inc. 26135 Mureau Road Calabasas, CA 91302 (818) 225 - 0375 Emerg ency telephone number: CHEMTREC 1 - 800 - 424 - 9300 2 .When I have it set to [1], this is the result:When I have the split set to [0], this is the result:I'm trying to get this result:Its matching to it, but the split for some reason doesn't want to work. What am I missing? Why does it give that result for [0]Thanks for the help!
str.split() doesn't take a regular expression, you need to use re.split().You should also get in the habit of using raw strings for regular expressions, otherwise you need to escape the \.
I'm assuming arg is a string. string.split() does not accept regex as delimiter. You can read about it here.Instead, you should use arg.split("Manufacturer/Distributor name", 1)[1].
