How do you get a rectangle (rect) to appear on the output screen for a set amount of time, for example 2 seconds, before disappearing? I am making a version of wormy a nibbles clone. I would also like to know how to make an apple disappear when the worm "eats" it.
You don't delete objects, you draw over them in Pygame. Concerning your disappearing rectangles, a simple Timer will suffice. Now, we can't write code for you here without you providing any info so I've just stated some basic information, so the next time you post a question, provide some info and read the How to ask page, and welcome to SO.
