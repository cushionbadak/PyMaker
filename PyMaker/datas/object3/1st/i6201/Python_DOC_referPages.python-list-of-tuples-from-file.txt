Natural Text
I have completed some rather intensive calculations, and i was not able to save my results in pickle (recursion depth exceded), so i was forced to print all the data and save it in a text file. Is there any easy way to now convert my list of tuples in text to well... list of tuples in python? the output looks like this: 
You can use ast.literal_eval():
First I remove the start and end square bracket with [1:-1], I replace ), with ); to be able to split by ; so that the it foesn't split by the commas inside the tuples as they are not preceded by a ). Inside the loop I'm using [1:-1] to remove the parenthesis this time and splitting by the commas. The map part is to convert the numeric strs into ints and I'm appending them as a tuple.
