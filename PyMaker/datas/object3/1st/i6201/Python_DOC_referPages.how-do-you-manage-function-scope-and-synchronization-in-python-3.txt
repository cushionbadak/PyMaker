This a 2-question rolled into 1 - I get the following output from the script nextThe script:The questions:How can I make the function checker() accessible only to other functions in this class (limit the scope)?How do I synchronize for multiple threads ("4 - Bye for now" is an error, counter should be reset when message is set to new value).Essentially, I am looking for a replacement of "synchronized private void" from another language. Thank you for your help.
1 - you dont. Scope of methods and variables is most of the time handled by programming conventions. In this case you would add a underline in the beggining of the checker to identify it as a private method that should only be called by the other methods inside the class.2 - to synchronize multiple threads you need to work with the the threads using threading specific commands, trying to use the "carry_on" like you did will make you end in some weird alleys.Ps: if I recall there is the @Async and @Sync annotations, you could look further into it.
