This question already has an answer here:Making a string out of a string and an integer in Python [duplicate]                    6 answers                I want to create string using integer appended to it, in a for loop.  Like this:But it returns an error:What's the best way to concatenate the String and Integer?
NOTE:The method used in this answer (backticks) is deprecated in later versions of Python 2, and removed in Python 3. Use the str() function instead.You can use :It will print string012345678910.To get string0, string1 ..... string10 you can use this as @YOU suggestedUpdate as per Python3You can use :It will print string012345678910.To get string0, string1 ..... string10 you can use this as @YOU suggested
To get string0, string1 ..... string10, you could do like
The str(i) function converts the integer into a string.

What you did (range[1,10]) is a TypeError since brackets denote an index (a[3]) or a slice (a[3:5]) of a list, a SyntaxError since [1,10] is invalid, and a double off-by-one error since range(1,10) is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and you seem to want [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]And string = "string" + i is a TypeError since you can't add an integer to a string (unlike JavaScript).Look at the documentation for Python's new string formatting method, it is very powerful.
You can use a generator to do this ! 
If we want output like 'string0123456789' then we can use map function and join method of string. If we want List of string values then use list comprehension method. Note:Use xrange() for Python 2.xUSe range() for Python 3.x
I did something else.I wanted to replace a word, in lists off lists, that contained phrases.I wanted to replace that sttring / word with a new word that will be a join between string and number, and that number / digit will indicate the position of the phrase / sublist / lists of lists. That is, I replaced a string with a string and an incremental number that follow it. 
Concatenation of a string and integer is simple:just use
