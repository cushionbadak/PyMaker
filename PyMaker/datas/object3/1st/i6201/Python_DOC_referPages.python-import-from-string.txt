I'm trying to import another python script with a name of the form fe_fi_fo_fam.py, I'm using importlib.import_module("fe_fi_fo_fam.py") but I'm getting the error : "module fe not found" , how do I get it to read the whole string instead of only the first part? I'm new to python and I seem to have scoured the internet without an answer.
Yo can instead use the built-in function exec after you compose the module stringNote: Python 3.6 exec
I think you have to understand the difference between module name in Python and file name. importlib.import_module() gets a "module name", not a "file name", so "fe_fi_fo_fam.py" is not a valid argument, instead you have to use "fe_fi_fo_fam" with no .py extension.
