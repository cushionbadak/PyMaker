I am trying to send data via an API but am getting the TypeError: can't concat bytes to str. This I understand means I need to convert part of my code to bytes but I am unsure how to do this. I've tried adding b in front or using bytes('data') but might be placing them in the wrong area. This is the problem line:I am unsure what and how to convert to bytes.
Use requests if you can, it's much easier to work with.Otherwise, you need to urlencode the payload to be posted to the server. The url encoded version of your payload looks like this:Here is a working example:http://httpbin.org returns this JSON response:Note that I am using httpbin.org as a test server, posting to https://httpbin.org/post.Also, I have changed the Content-type header to application/x-www-form-urlencoded because that is the format returned by urlencode().
