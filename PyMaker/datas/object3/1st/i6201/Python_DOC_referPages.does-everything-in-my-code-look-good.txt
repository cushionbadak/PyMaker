Anything I could improve on?? I am a python beginner. Is there anything I could do to make my code look cleaner or just make it look more professional? Thanks
Personally, I would use the getpass https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html library when getting a users password and also you could have simplified it by doing:or with getpass:
Note that this site is not for code review, but since you're new there is something that is really obvious:When you want to ask the user for an input, you can give your string as a parameter to the input function. Also, you don't have to cast PassChoice to string since it is the type that input() returns.
