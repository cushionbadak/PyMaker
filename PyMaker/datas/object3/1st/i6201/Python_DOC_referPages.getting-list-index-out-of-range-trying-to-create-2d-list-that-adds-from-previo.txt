basically, I need to create a bell triangle of values based on a-list-of-sublists/nested-lists that are created from a given param of number of "rows". I'll worry about the formatting of the bell myself but I'm struggling to come up with the logic to generate the nested-list. I'm not too familiar with python syntax. so I need to make it so that the first element of each sublist (except the first sublist, the first sublist/row is always just [1]) in the list rtable is the last element of the previous sublist, and every subsequent value in that sublist is the sum of the previous index's value and the previous sublist's value that has the same index as the current sublist. so if the param was 3 rows it would look like1  1 2  2 3 5or as a list would look like[[1], [1, 2], [2, 3, 5]]here's what I've got so far:the first if-statement exists to start the second row if the param is more than 1 row since I know that is what starts the second row. the second if- exists so that it appends iff it isn't on the first sublist where there is nothing more that needs to be added. the out of range error occurs at the line right under that if- . not sure why I'm getting out of range there since I'm making sure that appends only if the sublist it's on isn't the first/0th sublist, meaning afaik it would only run if it were on a sublist between the second and the last sublist, where it could go back and look at the previous sublist and not be out of range. also I'm using [-1] to access the last element of the list as I learned that that's how to access the last element of the list. so not sure what's wrong here. any help would be appreciated
this works for me  wii's comments for debug print statement should help with your code
