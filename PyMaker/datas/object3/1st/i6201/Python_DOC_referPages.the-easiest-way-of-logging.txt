I would like to collect info with the help of logging. The idea is simple. I have hash_value of some data, which I want to write to log. So, I set up my logging this way:As you can see, now timing and some message will automatically write to log file, for example I can use it like this:But what if I want to write hash_value of my data automatically? Like it is happening with time now. I looked through documentation and find nothing useful. There is no attribute for variable in module logging. So I am forced to do it awry. Like this:I would expect from this code:and to do the job. But it does not work (and it should not basically) and I did not find the solution in documentation. So, how to avoid this awry code:which I am having now?
The above code will produce following output:
It is not awry code, you want to add two informations, therefore you must either pass two parameters to format or concatenate the string more "manually"You could go withOr you could change the "data" object so its "str" or the repr method adds the hash by itself (preferably the repr in this case)Which in this case will print the hash and the string version of the parameter data( or simply whatever you want to show as string) passing only one parameter in the string format.Anyway, you could make the formating string prettier with....By the way, in C++ and Java you would also need to declare two "entries" for those two atributes. In java would be something like this:
