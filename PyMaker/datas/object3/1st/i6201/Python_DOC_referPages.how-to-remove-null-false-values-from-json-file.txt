Natural Text
I have a JSON file with this dataHow can I delete any key-value pairs that contain null, false and true of this file, using Python?These values can appear in various level of the data structure.
By decoding, processing the object recursively, and encoding to JSON again.I like to use single dispatch for such tasks:I used is not False, etc. to test for the exact objects. Had I used v not in {None, False, True} the integer values 0 and 1 would be removed too as False and True are equal to those values, respectively.Demo against your sample loaded into data:
