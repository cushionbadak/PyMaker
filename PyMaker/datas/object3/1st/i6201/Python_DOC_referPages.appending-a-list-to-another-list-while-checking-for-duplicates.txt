I need some help adding a list to another list while checking for duplicates. I only want to add items to my base list that are not already there.I cannot do this using sets because the items in the base list are also lists.An example of my base list is as follows:The list that I want to add to this is as follows:So I want to add the 'newLinks' list to the base 'toCrawl' list, however I only want to add it if the item in newLinks is not already in toCrawl.As well as this I also want to add the items from 'newLinks' to the 'toCrawl' list as a list. So rather than adding the item in 'newLinks' as: "http://websiteExample.html" I want to add it to the list as a list for example: ["http://websiteExample.html",0]
Could this be done with a dictionary instead of a list?
A nice solution would be to use list comprehension and cast your list as a set:OutputNote that in order to remove duplicates, sets seems to be the good pratice, this is from the documentation:A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.  Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a  sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection,  union, difference, and symmetric difference. (For other containers see  the built-in dict, list, and tuple classes, and the collections  module.)
Dictionary was a good shout thanks. I ended up going with this method however:
