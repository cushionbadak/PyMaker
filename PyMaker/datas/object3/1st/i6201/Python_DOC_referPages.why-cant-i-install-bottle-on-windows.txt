I have had problems getting the embedded version of python working with my app. It needs the bottle module, but when I try pip install bottle on this machine, I get an error:This is because I don't actually have access to the C drive on this machine. Is there a way to do it differently?
Creating a virtual environment in Windows:Create a folder and open a command prompt inside this.Then, create a virtual environment by using: virtualenv venvTo use this virtual environment, you need to activate it first. Activate it using: venv\Source\activate.batNow you will see a (venv) prefix in the prompt. That indicates the virtual environment is ready to use. Finally, install packages in this virtual environment as required like this: pip install bottleList the installed packages in a .txt file for later: pip freeze>requirements.txt
