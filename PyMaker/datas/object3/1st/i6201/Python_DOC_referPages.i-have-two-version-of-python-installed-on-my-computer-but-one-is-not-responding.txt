I have two version of python installed on my computer one is 3.6.0 Anaconda and another one is 3.6.3. Now on 3.6.3 I can not run or import any library like pandas or numpy on IDLE. I use windows 10. I can work on 3.6 version [Anaconda]. I tried to change the version through command prompt by py -3 but since both the version are in 3 + so it didn't work.
Remove the Anaconda Python 3.6.0 python path from your PATH environment variables.Instead, add the Python 3.6.3 path to your PATH variable.Now use your normal command prompt for Python 3.6.3 version.Use the command activate root in command prompt When you need Python 3.6.0 version.
If you have two versions of Python 3 on the same machine you should use virtual environments.This will keep them separate and allow you to use the one you want and install the modules you want on that version.You can learn to do this here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
