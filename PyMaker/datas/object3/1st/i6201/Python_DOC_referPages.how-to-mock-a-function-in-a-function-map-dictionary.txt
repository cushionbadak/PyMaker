I am trying to patch the fun_1 function from the worker_functions dictionary and I seem to be struggling:cli.py:I've tried mocking cli.fun_1 and cli.main.action and cli.action but this is leading to failure.test_cli.py:Do I seem to be missing something?
You'll need to patch the references in the FUNCTION_MAP dictionary itself. Use the patch.dict() callable to do so:That's because the FUNCTION_MAP dictionary is the location that the function reference is looked up.
