Recently I had a school project in which I need to take a user input as an integer between 1-12 (representing the months of the year), and the age of the user, and do a math equation to produce a number that will spit out the age and birth month of the user (yes I know this is redundant but I have to do the math equation and not spit out the user inputs). Me being that one kid who wants an 100% tried to make it so that the user can input the month by string e.g(Jan = 1) using lists and if statements. The code bellow isn't working as whenever a user inputs something if statement doesn't change the birthNum variable. So please help me as i have tried almost everything and nothing works, but I feel as if I am so close to getting it to work.Here is the code for turning the user input (string) into a integer:
Your condition is checking whether a string evaluates to a list. What you're looking for is the in keywork - i.e. That said, there's plenty of other problems in your code.
Using lists for this is highly unperformant. Your solution would require about 5 * 12 lookups for getting the value associated with a String.A way faster data structure that can do this use case in O(1) is a dict.Try to format your code like this:Then you can get your solution by simply doing:Read python data structures for a good overview. Dictionaries are section 5.5
