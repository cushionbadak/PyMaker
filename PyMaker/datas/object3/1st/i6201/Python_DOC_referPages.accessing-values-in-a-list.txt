I am trying to create a loop that runs through each element in a list, then returns the element in uppercase if a string is found. However, for some reason, my if statement does not seem to be working in my favour. Any ideas?
Try This ( Normal way ):Pythonic Way :Another Way:About Your Comment :
The more Pythonic way to do this would be not checking if the element is a string at all:One concrete reason this works better than checking if the element is a string is, in Python 2, Unicode objects are not strings but they can be uppercased (and probably should be in the example you provided).
Single liner using List Comprehension :#driver values :The problem you are facing is due to your usage of element to update the list. Use the index instead for the updation.
