Natural Text
Is there a simple way to sort alphanumerically but in numerical increments then starting the letters again at next numeral yes a capitol letter followed w/ no spaces up to a 5 digit numberpython, amino acid sequence numbers?In Python I've tried:BUT id like it as:
You can use this sort:Should be fine cause Amino Acids only have one letter.
You can use python's sorted() functionsorted(sorted(l1), key = lambda value:value[:1], value[0])output:['C1', 'D1', 'E1', 'S1', 'C2', 'D2', 'E2', 'S2', 'S4', 'S6', 'W373']
If my understanding is correct that amino acids are represented by a single alphabet followed by a number then the following should do the trick.This would sort take the first char to the end of the string, sort it and then bring it back and should do the trick.Again, I don't know much about amino acids and the first google search result suggested that there's only one char followed by numbers. And my answer is based on that assumption
