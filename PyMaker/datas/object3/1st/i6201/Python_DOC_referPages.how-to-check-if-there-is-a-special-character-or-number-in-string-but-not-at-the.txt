Is it possible to check if a string contains special characters or numbers from this string of characters:But at the same time ignore all results where these special characters are at the end of the string?Examples:
You could use str.rstrip to remove all trailing special characters from the end of the string, and then check whether the resulting string and the special character set are disjoint.
This regexp:The first part of the regexp requires the string to start with a sequence of characters that don't include the special characters. The second part matches a possibly empty sequence of special characters at the end.DEMO
