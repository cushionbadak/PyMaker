I am doing Grok Learning Course, and have come across a problem. Sorry if I have done anything badly; not a professional at coding:I am trying to make a variable that will be True/False depending on many conditions:So, I have tried different ways to do this like:Assigning variable to each of my conditions:etc..However, I want to find a better way of doing it than that, which is long and tedious. Thankyou.  
It's as simple aswhich evaluates to True if all three conditions hold and False otherwise.As you are new to programming, here's how you read it.First you evaluate the right hand side which isThis is evaluated left to right. First it evaluates y > 2 which will either be True or False. If False the whole right hand side is False and False will be assigned to x. Otherwise it keeps on evaluating all of the other sub-expressions on the right hand side until one of them is False or until you've found every one to be True, in which case the whole right hand side is True. In either case, True or False, your variable x gets the desired value.
If you have multiple expressions and if you want to do expression on a expression using and's & or's combinations its better to put it on like this
Comparison operators like (>, <, !=, etc.) all end up being evaluated down to True or False by the python interpreter. Python also has Boolean the operators and, or, not (Read more in Section 4.2 of the python docs) but you can use these in combination with the comparison operators to chain them. So your assignment becomes:
You can use ternary conditional operator :How it works ?because booleans are a subclass of int , so [y > 2 and g < 4 and n != 3] produce a integer value but ['false','true'] takes it as index value.Test case:output:Test case2:output:Now, if you want you can store the result in a variable :which you wanted i think.
