I am having a bit of trouble understanding callbacks. I have the following usecase: From my gui i start a new thread called videoDown (which is its own class). From this thread i want to push the data back to the gui which i have implemented a callback system for. BUT to update the GUI i need to be in the GUI thread and not the thread i currently reside in (which is the videoDown thread).Code where i start my thread (class Downloader):videoDownload thread:Callback (also in class Downloader):How exactly do i implement it so i can give data from my video download thread back to the gui thread while the current thread is set to this video download thread. What do i need to change, i have been struggling with this for hours.~Greetings
Maybe use a Queue instead of a callback.  Initialise the queue in your main thread, pass the object to the download thread and call get() on the Queue object to block until an item is passed to it.In the videoDownload object pass the data back to the main thread via the Queue
With a lot of help from luke. I came up with the following answer.In my javascript i created the following function:Which is implemented in python like this:After that I changed my init to create a queue like this:After that i changed my download_single function to this:And lastly my download thread is now this:This solved my issue, any other way does NOT work and will block the UI.Thank you a lot luke!
