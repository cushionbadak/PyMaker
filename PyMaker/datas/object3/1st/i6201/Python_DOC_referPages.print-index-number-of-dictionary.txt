I'm trying to pull out strictly the index number from the following dictionary:I'd like to be able to do something likeAnd have it return:I'm sure this is something simple that I'm overlooking?
I think you have mixed up index numbers with keys.Dictionaries are formed like such:{key: value}data.keys() will return a list of keys.In your case:From there, you can call the first item, which is 0 (First item in a list is 0, and then progresses by one).If you are looking for a specific key by the predefined values, then try:Note: python3 no longer uses .iteritems()By the way, you are missing a curly brace at the end.  It should be like this:data = {0: {'GAME_ID': '0021600457', 'TEAM_ID': '1610612744'}, 1: {'GAME_ID': '0021600457', 'TEAM_ID': '1610612744'}, 2: {'GAME_ID': '0021600457', 'TEAM_ID': '1610612744'}}Assuming that you wanted consistency, I've added the missing quotes as well.
Some more info on dictionary operations in the docs.This what you want?:If you are trying to iterate over the values:
Could you clarify where you are getting 'x' from?  If you want to print keys, you could just do
