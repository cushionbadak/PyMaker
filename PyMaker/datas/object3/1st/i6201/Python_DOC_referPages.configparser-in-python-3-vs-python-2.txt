I've been slowly making the transition from py2 -> py3 and I've run into an issue that I can't quite resolve (as trivial as I'm sure the problem is). When I execute the code below, the config file appears to have no sections :(Where have I gone astray? As a note, I did reuse this code from a python 2 script (replacing the old ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser with the new configparser.ConfigParser). I don't think this fact is relevant, but maybe it is? Clearly, I do not know :) Here's the project/main.pyHere's the project/utilities/utilities.py:And finally, here is the project/project_config.ini:Interestingly, if I add The change will be written to the file, however, upon re-execution, it will not be recalled (as witnessed by .sections()). I'm sure I am missing something simple! What gives? 
Turns out .read() accepts filenames, and .read_file() accepts filetypes. Originally, I was using .readfp(), but read_file() has replaced it in py3! Silly, silly me.
