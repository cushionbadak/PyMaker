I have a list containing URLs with escaped characters in them. Those characters have been set by urllib2.urlopen when it recovers the html page:Is there a way to transform them back to their unescaped form in python?P.S.: The URLs are encoded in utf-8
Official docs.urllib.unquote(string) Replace %xx escapes by their single-character equivalent.Example: unquote('/%7Econnolly/') yields '/~connolly/'.And then just decode.Update:For Python 3, write the following:Python 3 docs.
And if you are using Python3 you could use:
or urllib.unquote_plus
You can use urllib.unquote
