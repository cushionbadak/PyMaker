I want to create a dictionary of the capitals and governors and then later choose a random state to ask the user what the capital of _ is or who the governor of _ is. I haveI get an error that states is undefined and I am unable to figure out why.
You don't need a function for a static dict like states and also no main function. You can simplify this a lot:
Why not make your dictionary in this type of format?states = {'Alabama': {'capital': 'Montgomery', 'governor':'Kay Ivey'....}It flows more like Json data that way.Plus here in your question,def state_dict():    states={"Alabama":["montgomery","kay ivey"],"Alaska":["Juneau","Bill     Wallker"]}You don't return the states dict. So when you use it in random.choice(state_dict()) you never end up passing the states dict to random.choice(state_dict())
Update2:As @schwobaseggl has pointed out there's no reason to use the function states_dict() here. Just doAlso, you should study the PEP8 style guide and incorporate it in your muscle memory now.Update:Original:You indentation is incorrect.states is outside the function state_dict(). Make it:Additionally, you haven't followed the PEP8 style guidelines, maybe you did and compacted the code for SO. For those reading, this is a better way to format the code:
As @Ajax1234 noted your indentation in state_dict is off and you need to add return statesYour function is state_dict but you're calling states_dictYou need to switch random.choice(states_dict) to random.choice(states_dict())If you fix 1 & 3 you should be good to go.
