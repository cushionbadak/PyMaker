Please I have several alignment files. I used regular expression to pull out those with gaps using if re.search(r"A-Z[A-Z]", seq):to get sequences with gaps e.g M--------A . My question is IN PYTHON how do I get the character M and A which are preceding and after the gap? This is an example of the file I am working with below.

You want to capture the uppercase letter [A-Z] immediately before and after a 'gap' consisting of a number of dashes -+.So your regular expression should contain ([A-Z])-+([A-Z])To extract the two uppercase characters, you could use re.replace with $1 and $2 as part of the replacement string.
