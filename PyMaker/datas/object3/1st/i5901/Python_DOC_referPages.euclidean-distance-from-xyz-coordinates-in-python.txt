I have a datafile that looks like this.where XYZ coordinates are in columns 6,7,8 and and a letter associated with a point is in the last column. I want to identify distances between those points that have a letter H in the last column. How can I do this? I know that this is the code I need to perform the operation, but I am confused as to how to use the values in columns 6,7 and 8, and only for the case where the last column is H:
Of course, @Silencer's answer is already correct and the use of a data structure like OrderedDict is a good idea, but if you want to use standard methods only, you can try:
I use regexp to extract the date, and then filter them by the rules.A demo code is like this:
A simple solution that uses generator expressionsFrom PEP 289 -- Generator ExpressionsRationale   Experience with list comprehensions has shown their widespread utility    throughout Python. However, many of the use cases do not need to have a full list created in memory. Instead, they only need to iterate over the elements one at a time.becauseyou don't need to save the intermediate results, possibly you have a large data setand combinations from the itertools standard library module because you want to compute the distances for every couple of interesting points in your data set.
