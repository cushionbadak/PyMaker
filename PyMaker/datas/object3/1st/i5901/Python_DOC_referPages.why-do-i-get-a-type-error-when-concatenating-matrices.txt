Natural Text
so I'm working with this code which should return the combined version of two matrices from a text file (w/o importing any kind of module). The text file might contain something like:[[1,2],[3,4]] [[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]And output:[[1,2,5,6,7],[3,4,8,9,10]]I keep on getting this type error: TypeError: eval() arg 1 must be a string, bytes or code objectHow do I fix this? Thanks.
I keep on getting this type error: TypeError: eval() arg 1 must be a string, bytes or code objectWell that's documented indeed.How do I fix this?Quite simply: don't pass a file object to a function that expect a string, bytes or code object. BUT actually the real solution is : don't use eval() at all - it's a huge security hole. At least use ast.literal_eval():Also you don't need to reopen your file (and forget to close it), you already get the content in data
Here is a way to do it using ast.literal_eval() which is much safer than running the dangerous eval on arbitrary file input:For your data:
