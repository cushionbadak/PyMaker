Natural Text
I would like to abbreviate the first word in a 2 word string of values in dictionary.input dictionary:I would like this to be the output.output dictionary:
One possible approach is to extract that first capital letter in a capturing group and use re.sub() referencing the captured group in a replacement string:Note that this would also handle cases when there are more than two words/names defined in a string - like in case of "Amy Farrah Fowler".Though, I can imagine a case to break this approach as well. Strictly speaking, this is a Natural Language Processing problem, but depends on what can the possible names be in your specific case as well.
You could do something like this:Which outputs:If you need it to work for more names, you could use something like this:
By tweaking the values in dict using join and split
This should work for any number of words you have in your dict as value.But this works only in Python 3
