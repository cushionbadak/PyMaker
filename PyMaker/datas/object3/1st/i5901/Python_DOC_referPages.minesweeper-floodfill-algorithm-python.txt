I'm trying to recreate the minesweeper flood fill algorithm, so I have a flood fill function in which I recursively pick all the boxes around the ones that have a neighbor value of 0, meaning they are not touching any bombs. I understand why this is an infinite recursion, and that I must somehow use a visit matrix that detects which position has been tested so I can end eventually end the recursion. I have tried implementing a "visit" matrix which would be switched to true for a position (row,col) if the position is used in the recursion, but I could not get it to work at all. How could I implement the visit matrix in this code in order to get the proper flood fill algorithm used in minesweeper?
This is the code I found to work in case anyone has the same issue as me, I'm not sure why but using "try:" would stop the recursion for certain cases, so switching to a good-old fashion if not statement is better for setting the boundaries. Then it is simply a matter of setting the visit matrix to false once you "open" a cell.
