Natural Text
Just learning in Python 3, doing function building.  I have a set of functions that take in multiple elements from the user and output the unique elements.  I'm wondering if I can improve the program appearance because if there are large number of inputs they chain together, one after the next, each on a new line.  Ideally, every time a user hits enter the input line takes the element and the same line resets for the next value.Here's what I have:The output (in Jupyter Notebook) adds a Please input some things: line for each element a user inputs.  50 inputs, 50 lines; looks sloppy.  I cannot find a way to have the function just use a single line, multiple times.
You just need to use the map function to take input in a single line and then split every data and then typecast it to form a map object and then pass it to the list function which would return a list in the variable like this:
Do you want to clear the text in the console after each input? Then you could use os.system('CLS') on Windows or os.system('clear') on Unix systems:Alternatively, I think you could use curses.
