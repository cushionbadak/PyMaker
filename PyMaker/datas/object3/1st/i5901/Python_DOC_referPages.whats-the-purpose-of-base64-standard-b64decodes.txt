It seems to be identical to base64.b64decode(s) except it doesn't have the option to take an additional argument. Why would someone need the "standard_" version when they can just use the normal version and leave out the second argument?
The first can use an optional alphabet, and revert to the standard if none is given; the other uses the standard.It is possible that the API has both methods for backwards compatibility (to avoid breaking existing code)From the documentation:base64.b64encode(s, altchars=None)  Encode the bytes-like object s  using Base64 and return the encoded bytes.       Optional altchars must be a bytes-like object of at least length 2 (additional characters are ignored) which specifies an alternative  alphabet for the + and / characters. This allows an application to  e.g. generate URL or filesystem safe Base64 strings. The default is  None, for which the standard Base64 alphabet is used.base64.standard_b64encode(s)   Encode bytes-like object s using the standard Base64 alphabet and return the encoded bytes.
