I'm having a difficult time with detecting the Backspace key using the Curses module. Whenever I press the Backspace key, the character / string returned is '^?', however I'm not able to detect it with:if str(key) == '^?':The code below is set up to run
On my machine, running Python 3.5.2 or 2.7.12, I get KEY_BACKSPACE shown as the key when I press backspace, and usingin place ofresults in the backspace key backspacing letters off record.I think it's possible that, on your system, you're getting the actual backspace character. In that case, you might try '\b' in place of '^?', as according to the docs, that is the string escape for the ASCII backspace character.
According to your clarifying comment, backspace in your terminal is neither 'KEY_BACKSPACE' nor '\b' ('\x08').Since you're using curses.wrapper(), which calls curses.initscr(), this suggests that something is wrong with either your terminfo database (unlikely) or your terminal configuration (more likely).getkey() == 'KEY_BACKSPACE' or getch() == curses.KEY_BACKSPACE is supposed to work on any properly-configured system, so you're likely to have problems in other applications too.The TERM environment variable is how the terminal type is communicated to tools which need the functionality beyond basic teletype, so, to fix that, start by checking what the TERM environment variable contains in the environment where you're running Python.As a quick hack, you can check all the values it's been observed to take.
