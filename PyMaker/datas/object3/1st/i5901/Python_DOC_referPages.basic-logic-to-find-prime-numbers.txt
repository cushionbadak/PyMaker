I aim is to have a simple logic to find prime numbers between 2 ranges. However to start simple, i am trying to have a code that evaluates a number input if it is prime and i am failing at it. Though i am able to evaluate it to some degree the final print statement is off. How do i ensure that the final print only happens when the previous loop is done and did not succeed?
In this case, you could use the while-else construction.See https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement(Or https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement if you are using python 2.7)
Well, you can find this answer anywhere on the net. But i will put a simple function here to check for a prime number.
