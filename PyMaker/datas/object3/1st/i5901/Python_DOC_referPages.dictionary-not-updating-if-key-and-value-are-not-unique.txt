Im new to python and Im creating this gambling game where a user will have the choice to bet on symbols that will be generated (eventually- haven't gotten there yet). Im creating a dictionary to hold my data for how much the user is betting (the value) and the number corresponding to the symbol they are betting on (the key). Each player has the option to place more than 1 bet per turn. I am running into a problem where if two different players input the same bet&symbol combination (for example $10 on 1 (Crown)) then the dictionary wont update to contain 2 separate entries of 1:10, it will only have one entry of 1:10. This is what Im working with right now Any help would be much appreciated! Thank you!
It is best to think of a Python Dictionary as "an un ordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary)." https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlWith that being said, whenever user A chooses 10, and then user B chooses 10; user A choice is literally being overwritten by user B's choice. A single dictionary can only hold 10 once as a key. In order to resolve your solution you'll have to use some other data structures. The key within a dictionary should be unique. A solution to your problem could be to use different levels of dictionaries. You could have a dictionary of player names that holds a dictionary of their value, and their symbol. However, your player names would have to be unique, otherwise you would run into the same issue.
