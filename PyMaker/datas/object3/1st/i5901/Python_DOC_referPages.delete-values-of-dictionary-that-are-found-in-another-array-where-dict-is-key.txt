I want to delete every values in dictionary prot_dict that are found in another np.array not_protThe expected resultWhat I tried gives me back the same dictionary.How to remove values of dictionary matched to items in another array (I doubt list may be easier)? If it is fast, it would be very good.
Try this:
You can use dict comprehensions and list compressions together, something like thisOUTPUTfirst we are iterating items in dict and then for each value we are using list comprehensions to filter out value present in not_prod list.
One simple way to achieve this is the following:This approach is called list comprehension and described e.g. here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
I just made some modifications to @Ev. Kounis' answer.Use hash set will be fast to determine whether it contains the values in not_prot.
