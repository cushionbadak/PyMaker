Natural Text
I am relatively new to python3 and I just got the code for a string that adds one number to the previous number, and adds that number onto the previous number as a stringFor example if the first number was 1, it would 1+1 to equal 2 and attach that to the string to make 12.The first few digits of the number would be123456789101112131415161718... I have the codeAnd I am wondering if there is a way to stop it at a certain amount of digits lets say 10,000 and then save it to a document called number.txt
All of the answers so far are very memory intensive, or quite finite.I would consider the itertools.count generator and printing the results immediately. This will use very little memory, and is by far the most 'infinite' of the solutions posted so far.
will create till from 0 to 100 like so0123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899
