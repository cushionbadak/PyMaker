I need to access command prompt in python, currently I useI would need to get os.system commands like os.system(start cmd) and other commands for writing inside of cmd(command panel).
Instead of running the command prompt, and running programs from there, you can just immediately run the programs that you are interested in. Take a look at python's subprocess module.So in your case, If you want to start/stop on demand, then you can do this:subprocess.Popen starts the process, and os.killpg will stop it.By the way, it's "Command Prompt", not "Command Panel". I'm not being pedantic here - unless the context gives it away, many people will have no clue what "Command Panel" is referring to.
