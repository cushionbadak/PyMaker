I'm trying to get a count on, for example, how many a's are in a massive list of passwords out of curiosity. but i think when i'm trying to add a count for a character it's killing the loop that is going through all the characters. 
You should use a dictionary (or a list which has an order) to store how many counts of each letter there are. This is much better than using 26 one letter variables which is ridiculous!To create a dictionary, you can use a dictionary-comprehension with str.count on the entire contents of the file.which would give letterCounts as something like:
counts is a Counter keeping track of the counts of all the characters that appear in the file.  YOu would access the number of as with counts['a']
