I have a simple test bench implemented in python.The test runner exposes a set of functions to the test.This may be considered as a domain specific language for writing tests.Most test cases form simple sequences of calls to these functions, sometimes involving control flow statements, but nothing more complicated than that.Now a few test cases have become too complex and would benefit from being refactored using functions.This is where I run into problems.From within the functions I cannot access local symbols defined inside the test case. I can also not access the functions exposed by the runner (log and verify).Any idea on how I can get this to work?Maybe there is a different (and better way) to accomplish this, that I as a C++ developer do not see.
If you do:Produces:Generally a good idea to avoid dynamic code execution like this anyway!
