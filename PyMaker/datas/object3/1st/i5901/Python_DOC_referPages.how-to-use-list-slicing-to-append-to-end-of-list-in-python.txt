Following can be used to add a slice to append to front of list. what slice to use to append to the end of list. 
If you really want to use slice, you can use the length of a:output:But the simplest is to directly extend a:

You have got short answer from Jeevaa and Reblochon Masque but if you want to use for loop then try this:Output
I think you should consider extend():Both + and += operators are defined for list, which are semantically  similar to extend.list + list2 creates a third list in memory, so you can return the  result of it, but it requires that the second iterable be a list.list += list2 modifies the list in-place (it is the in-place operator,  and lists are mutable objects, as we've seen) so it does not create a  new list. It also works like extend, in that the second iterable can  be any kind of iterable.Time ComplexityAppend has constant time complexity, O(1).Extend has time complexity, O(k).Iterating through the multiple calls to append adds to the complexity,  making it equivalent to that of extend, and since extend's iteration  is implemented in C, it will always be faster if you intend to append  successive items from an iterable onto a list.â†³ More Information
