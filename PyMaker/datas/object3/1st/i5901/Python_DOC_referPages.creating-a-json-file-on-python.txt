Natural Text
This is my first post here.So I'm trying to write this recursive function [on Python 3.6.3] that takes three args, here is the exercise text:"A dictionary d represents a tree (and we name it as dictionary-tree).Each key of d is a tree's node_ID, and its attribute is the list (eventually empty) of node's "child(ren)'s" ID(s). Nodes' IDs inside lists are sorted in ascending alphabetical order.Write generate_subtree(fname,x,fout) function that, taken:a JSON filename containing a dictionary-tree "d" (fname)an "x" IDa (new) JSON filename (fout)produces the dictionary-tree that represents the "subtree" of the "x" ID. If "x" ID is not in the original dictionary, then the output file will contain an empty dictionary.e.g.executing generate_subtree(fname,'d',fout), the output will contain the following dictionary:This is my attempt:'fout' is my problem: the JSON file does not actually exists, and the function has to create it in order to write the output dictionary in it, but I don't succeed (after many efforts) to make the function create a new file to write the output in it.Any of you could please help me?edit: since is an exercise, i have to do it using recursionedit2: wrote the exercise text and edited the function as I coded itedit3: the code actually works, but the recursion stops after the analysis of the key given in the arg; did I placed the "for" cycle in the wrong place? [sure I did]
I think you are writingfrom one json file to another json file. If you could do without a recursive function, try this:Printing data written to to.json file:
