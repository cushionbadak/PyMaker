So currently I am trying to find out how many times a specific word appears on a page. My Python code has this: print(len(re.findall(secondAnswer, page))) 0Upon careful analysis, I noticed that print(secondAnswer) is giving me a different answer "Pacific"from print(ascii(secondAnswer)) 'Paci\ufb01c'I have a feeling that my secondAnswer value in len(re.findall(secondAnswer, page)) is using 'Paci\ufb01c' instead and thus not finding any matches on the page.Can someone give me any tips on how to solve this?Thanks, Nick
Unicode character fb01 is the ﬁ ligature. That is, it's a single character as far as Python is concerned, but appears as two (tied) characters when displayed.To decompose ligatures into their separate characters, you can use unicodedata.normalize. For example:Or in this specific case, you could write your regex to accept the ligature as an alternate for the fi character sequence, for example by using alternation with a non-capturing group: paci(?:fi|ﬁ)c.
