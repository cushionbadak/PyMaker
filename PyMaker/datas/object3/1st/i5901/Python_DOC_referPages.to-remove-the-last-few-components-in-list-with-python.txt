I want to delete the last two element in list a after sorting, but I get this error:
pop(i) pops the element at index i in the list. When you do a.pop(a[3]), you're popping the element at index a[3]=3. If you want to pop the last element, just do a.pop() without any argument, it will implicitly pop the last element.
The reason you're getting the error is because you're looking up what index to pop by retrieving an integer from the list, so by doing a[2], you are first fetching the value 3 and obviously this is outside of the range of the list.So as said otherwise, just call pop without the parameter - pop()
Simply make the list equal to itself minus the last two elements.
First of all pop is able to just remove the last element, you don't need to specify the argument.Removing the sorting as it doesn't change much here you get:It should do what you probably wanted.More context and explanationAs explained in the docs if you optionally specify the parameter to pop - it takes in the index of the element to be removed.So in yet even more simpler code:What it means is:a[3] - take third element of the list, it's 3 (remember this is 0-indexed)so in this situation a.pop(a[3]) happens to be the same as a.pop(3)so it removes the third elementNow your error happens because you do a.pop(a[2]) which is again a 3, and the list is too short. 
Others have already pointed out your usage error.Even easier, just take the slice of list that you want:This sorts the list, strips off the last two entries, and assigns the result back to a.
just use the pop function twice without parametrs like this:
If you want to remove the last elements you dont need to pass a parameter to pop. Just call a.pop() twice.  The problem rest in that you are not passing the index but the value of the array in the determinate position. When you do pop of a[3] the value is 3 and that index no longer exist because the array size is 3 and the last index is 2.
