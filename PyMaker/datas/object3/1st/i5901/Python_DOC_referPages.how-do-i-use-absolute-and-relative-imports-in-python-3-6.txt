Natural Text
I have a python project/library called "slingshot" with the following directory structure:From __main__.py I would like to import functions from util/prepare_env.py.I would like to ensure that util refers to the util I have in my project, and not some other util library that may be installed somewhere.I tried from .util import prepare_env but I get an error.from util import prepare_env seems to work, but doesn't address the ambiguity of "util".What am I doing wrong?__main__.py is as follows:When I type python3 ./slingshot I get the following error:When I type python3 -m ./slingshot I get the following error:
__main__.py modules in a package make the module run as a script when you use the -m command line switch. That switch takes a module name, not a path, so drop the ./ prefix:The current working directory is added to the start of the module search path so slingshot is found first, no need to give a relative path specification here.From the -m switch documentation:Search sys.path for the named module and execute its contents as the __main__ module.Since the argument is a module name, you must not give a file extension (.py). The module name should be a valid absolute Python module name[.][...]As with the -c option, the current directory will be added to the start of sys.path.
