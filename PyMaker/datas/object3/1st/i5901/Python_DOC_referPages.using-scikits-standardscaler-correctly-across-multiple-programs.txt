I am having a question that is very similar to this topic but I want to reuse the StandardScaler instead of LabelEncoder. Here's what I have done:I also tried set_params but it can only change these parameters: copy, with_mean, and with_std. So, how can I re-use the scaler I got in program one? Thanks!
Just pickle the whole thing.Follow the official docs.You can either use python's standard-pickle from the first link or the specialized joblib-pickle mentioned in the second link (which i recommend; often more efficient, although not that important for this simple kind of object = scaler):If you by any chance want to store your sklearn-objects in databases like MySQL, MongoDB, Redis and co., the above example using file-based storage won't work of course.The easy approach then: use python-pickle's dumps which will dump to a bytes-object (ready for most DB-wrappers).For the more efficient joblib, you have to use python's BytesIO to use it in a similar way (as the method itself is file-based, but can be used on file-like objects).
