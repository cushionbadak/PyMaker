As suggested in the comments, I'm reformatting my comment as an answer. I will attempt to elaborate on my explanation.You are calling the print function, which outputs the text, then returns None. This may not be intuitive, but None is returned from any function that doesn't return anything else.The None is then passed to the input function as a parameter, which transforms it into text, outputs that and then waits for input.
The "input()" call should only take a string as an argument, not a print function:
