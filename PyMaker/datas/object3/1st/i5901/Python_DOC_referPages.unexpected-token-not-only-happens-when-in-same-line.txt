So this is a question about the ambiguity introduced with questioning indent, not really the matter of not.==============Original Question==============I'm using Visual Studio. Basically here's the simplified example of what I've encountered:Here I want to check if x and y has an input, if not, using the variables of the class itself. However, that can't run, the  if not y: is underscored with red waving line saying Unexpected token 'not', like this:The wired thing is that once I split it into another row, things would be fixed:So what's wrong writing them together in one row? Or is that some sort of bug of Visual Studio?
Ambiguity. Which one do you mean?orHere's more details: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.htmlTLDR Just don't use ; in this case
This is logical. If you write a lexical scope (like if), even after the semicolon, it is still under the if.For example:(prints nothing)So:is equivalent to:Since introducing a new scope makes it terribly hard to understand, the syntax is not allowed in Python. It would create ambugity.So the statement you wrote was incorrect: you would have scoped the if not y under the if not x, which was not what you meant.
