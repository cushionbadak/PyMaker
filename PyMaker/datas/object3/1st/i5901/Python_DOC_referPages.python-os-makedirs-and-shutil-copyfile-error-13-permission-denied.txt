In my code, I create a directory like so:Which creates a directory in the place where I run my python script.Then  I wish to copy three files from the original directory where the folder is located into the newly created directory, like soHowever, trying to copy those files throws this error:I have tried various shutil copy methods with the same error.EDIT: This is running on windows
Per the copyfile docs:dst must be the complete target file name; look at shutil.copy() for a copy that accepts a target directory path.You can't use it to do what you do in the shell, naming a source file and a target directory and having it deduce the file should be put in the directory with the file's original name. You have to explicitly name the target file, or it thinks you're trying to copy to the same name as the directory, and unlike replacing a file, you can't replace a directory with a file without explicitly renaming the directory or deleting the whole directory tree first. To fix, just make sure to repeat the file name in both source and destination:The problem would be more obvious on a UNIX-like system, because those systems would reject the action with EISDIR, causing a Python IsADirectoryError to be raised, but Windows for some reason chose to use more general error codes associated with permission/access problems (EACCES and related Windows specific error codes) that Python translates to PermissionError (because Windows just isn't telling it the real problem, and it would introduce all sorts of race conditions if Python tried to check if the real problem was trying to use a directory as a file to fix the exception type).
