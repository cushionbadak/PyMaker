I was testing the StanfordNERTagger using the NLTK wrapper and this warning appeared:My code looks like this:I tried to use CoreNLPNERTagger but I could not find any examples or documentation. I only found this link:where it gives something like an example in the comments of the class CoreNLPNERTagger(CoreNLPTagger)                                      (I found it by searching the keyword "CoreNLPNERTagger")I tried to follow that example with no use.I think I should start (if that is the correct term) the coreNLP server first but if is that the case I don't know how.If anyone got any idea or advice I would be grateful.
Well i found myself working with Stanford POS Tagger recently (got a similar warning) but still the tagger is still working.The thing is, this is a warning telling you that they will change/remove the StanfordNERTagger class (more information about the warning).What i advise you to do is to maintain your code with venv or just copy the module (that's what i did) for example in order to keep your nltk module the way it is (avoid updating therefore sticking with this class).Hope this helps you.
