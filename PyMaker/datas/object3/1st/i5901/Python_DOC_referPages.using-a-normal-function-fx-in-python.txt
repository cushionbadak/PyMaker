I want to use a function f(x) in python. Something like ax^2 + bx + c (polynomials). I want to do that using a for loop and a list. This is what I have so far:for example: when I fill in f([5,2,3],5) I have to get:3*5^0 + 2*5^1 + 5*5^2. Does somebody know how I can change my code so the output will be the result of that polynomial?
Your code is almost correct. You just need to add a running sum, and you need to select individual numbers from a
use a generator expression with enumerateYou can use this comprehension in you func like this :EDITED : More optimized version suggested by @Paul Panzer
