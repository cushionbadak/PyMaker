I want to save all the traceback of all the exceptions from every failed test I run to an external file.Instead of using try and except in every test i would like to use the tearDown of unittest so it will be more generic.something like:the problem is that the exception that you get in the test_some_test cant be called with traceback in the teardown (the tracebacke return None)any suggestion? 
So after I went over a big piece of the unittest code I found a solution!The TestCase class has an _outcome attribute.The _outcome has a list type attribute called errors.errors[0][1] is a tuple that is exactly like the sys.exc_info() output that contains the traceback.So now that I have this tuple that I can use in traceback.format_exception() just like traceback.format_exc() uses it and problem solved.
