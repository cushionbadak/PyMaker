I am trying to make something like FileSystem in python. My goal is to make files which can contain some data and Directories which can contain some files. Then I have some simple commands cd lsmk_dir mk_file So, now I have a problem with this: There's DirectoryBase class which is different from Directory, because it has no ParentDir (Directory in that is File/Directory saved). Then there's Directory class that extends DirectoryBase and overwrites path() method (method returning path to file/dir) and data dict has another default key: '..', but when I am trying to find it in data dict it raises KeyError. Another weird thing, about it is that I am testing if file/dir exists, and if not it will return, so I don't know how this is possible, that it got KeyError.This is my code: Error looks like this: or when I delete prints: Sorry if it is too confusing, I am beginner and my English is bad too.
the code logic is flawed:you are throwing an error when the key exists. Just negate the condition (and drop the .keys() which is useless & unpythonic and even a performance killer in Python 2):there's the same error in __delitem__ BTW.When fixed (and stubbed most of unexisting/unshown classes with str) I get the following output:
