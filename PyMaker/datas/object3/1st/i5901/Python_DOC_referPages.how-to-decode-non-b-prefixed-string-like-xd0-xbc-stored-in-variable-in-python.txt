Natural Text
I have some variable from API.For example:I need to get variable b by decoding a:But I can't write in code something like this:because this text (\xd0\xbc) is already in the variable.
You need to use str.encode() and pass encoding="latin" to get b == 'M'.If "latin" is not the standard encodings you were looking for, try others. 
will this help ? I would guess there is a better way however I do not know it
