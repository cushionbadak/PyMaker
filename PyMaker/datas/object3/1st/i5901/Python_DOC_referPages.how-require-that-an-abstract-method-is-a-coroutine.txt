How can I require that an abstract base class implement a specific method as a coroutine. For example, consider this ABC:Now when I subclass and instantiate that:This succeeds, although func is not async, as in the ABC. What can I do so that this only succeeds if func is async?
You may use __new__ and check if and how a child class has override parent's coros. Caveatsa child class may override __new__ as well to suppress this constraintnot only async may be awaited. For exampleit's ok to call change likeNot to mention __await__ in objects, other raw Futures, Tasks...
