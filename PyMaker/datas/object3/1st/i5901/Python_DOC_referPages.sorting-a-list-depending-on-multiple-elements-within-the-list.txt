is it possible to implement a python key for sorting depending on multiple list elements?For example:And I want to sort the list depending on the difference between two elements, so that the delta is maximized between them.Expected result:Other result would also be possible, but 1 is before 4 in the origin array so 1 should be taken first:I want to use python sorted like:Is there any possibility to do it this way? Maybe there is another library which could be used.
Since (as you showed  us) there could be multiple different results - it means that this sorting/order is not deterministic and hence you can't apply a key function to it.That said, it's easy to implement the sorting by yourself:This solution runs in O(n^2) but it can be improved by sorting col in the beginning and then instead of looking for max and min we can extract the items in the beginning and the end of the list. By doing that we'll reduce the time complexity to O(n log(n))EDIT Per your comment below: if the index plays a role, again, it's not a "real" sorting :) that said, this solution can be engineered to keep the smaller index first and etc:
This solution is quite brute force; however, it is still a possibility:Output:Note that the output is in the form: (list, total_sum))
