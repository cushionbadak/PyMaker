These are randomly placed bricks which move along the x-axis, to the left and right from wall to wall. I'd like to have all bricks collide with themselves, for example if one of them hit another brick, the speed must be -speed.My code is below:
You'd have to add another, nested loop to use the colliderect of each block with all other blocks. You also need to check if the two block instances are not the same object block is not other_block.You could also use itertools.product instead of the two loops.
