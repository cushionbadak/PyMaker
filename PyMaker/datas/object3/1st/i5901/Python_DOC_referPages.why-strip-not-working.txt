Natural Text
I have the following data in a huge string:I am trying to remove "'&nbsp ;'" from this huge string but it does not work with strip like this:Same output as before no change in text of data:Why is there no change no stripping is happening all the &nbsp are present there and then?Help Please!
str.strip() removes characters from the beginning of the line or the end of the line only. It does not modify those in between, so instances of the substring &nbsp; situated elsewhere in the string will not be removed. Also, str.strip() removes any of the characters in the given string, not the actual string.You can use str.replace() to remove the substring '&nbsp;':
What you are probably looking for is replace rather then strip is used to eliminate characters at the beginning or end of your text. By default it is removing spaces, but you can specify a character as well.
