I am trying to create code for an assignment that can walk down a directory and return all filesI am having trouble with multilevel folders, such asfolder1 ---> folder2 ------->foo.txtI have the following codeHowever, If I were to run that code I would get the following result[folder1, folder2]I have run through this is a debugger and the program is not detecting the second directory to actually be a directory.How can I get the program to walk all the way through the directory.Note, I am not allowed to user os.walk
os.path.isdir() takes a full path, you are only giving it the relative name. Create the path first, then test that:However, you are re-inventing a wheel here, just use the os.walk() function to list directory contents :
