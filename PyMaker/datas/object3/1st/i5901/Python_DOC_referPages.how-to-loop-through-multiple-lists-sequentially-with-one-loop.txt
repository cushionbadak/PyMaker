This question already has an answer here:Iterating over two lists one after another                    3 answers                In Python 3.6.3 Is there a way to loop though one list after another?For example:(In this case, I want to loop through the face cards right after the non-face cards.)For clarification:The above line throws a:This is my problem.
range doesn't return a list in Python3, so range(2, 10) + ["J", "Q", "K", "A"] doesn't work, but list(range(2, 10)) + ["J", "Q", "K", "A"] does. You can also use itertools.chain to concatenate iterables:The nested comprehension does, of course, constitute a cartesian product which you can also use a util for:
The problem with your current code is here:First off, it should be range(2, 11), otherwise, cards with the number 10 are omitted. Second, in order to join the range and the list, you'll have to do like so:So the final result will be:I think this will give you the desired output (first all non-face cards, then all face cards).
See @schwobaseggl's solution for what you want, but I usually prefer to represent cards as a 2 character string, however:This is more readable in my opinion, and will still behave a lot like a tuple of rank, suit.
In Python3, you can use unpacking:
Focusing only in the error you do get:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'range' and 'listI will give you an explanation.Your current code does work in Python 2:will print:In Python 3 you have to use list(range(2, 11)):will print:You have to use list() because range() in Python 3 does create an immutable sequence type, not a list.
