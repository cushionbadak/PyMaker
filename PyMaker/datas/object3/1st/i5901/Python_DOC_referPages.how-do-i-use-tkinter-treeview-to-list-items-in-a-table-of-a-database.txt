I have a SQLite database that I am going to read from and list one of its tables data into a tree view. I have been searching for a long time in order to get this to work and I am struggling to find anything that either works or makes sense to me. for instance in my table I have the headings 'Member ID' and 'Full Name'.for test purposes I have created variables storing strings for these values.How do I go about creating headings in the treeview according to the headings in my tables of my database?I now how to read for the database but I then need to know how I would insert this values into the treeview. (for this example 'name' and 'id')
Sample output:More information on heading.More information on insert.More information on options (E.g. columns and headings)
