block of code is:Execution gives:"Give word 1: readyGive word 2: steadyThe words have the following in common: eady"What I don't understand is the following part:    for letter in word1:        if (letter in word2) and (letter not in common):            common += letter
We start by declaring an empty string common. As we find letters the two words have in common, we will add them to this string.for letter in word1: We go through the first word letter by letter.if (letter in word2) and (letter not in common): We check if the letter is also in the second word or also already stored in common.common += letter: We append the letter to our string. Since we check common for our letter in the previous step, the final result of common will only ever contain a maximum of one of each letter.
All this code is doing is using a for loop to go through each character in word1 (using "letter" as the name of that character) and adds it to the string common if it's also in word2 and if it's not already in common (since common just contains the letters in both strings, no duplicates).For more information about for loops in Python, perhaps see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
