So I have a file that look something like this:I want to create a list where each 'group' is in a separate list like this:[[Apples, Red, Round], [Banana, Yellow, Long]I am completely stumped on how I should proceed. 
We'll split on \n\n (two newlines) to separate the groups, then use regular str.split to divide those into itemsYou can see a similar example (without the file I/O) running at this repl.it
I'd split the content once by a double newline in order to get each group separately, and then split each group individually:
Short code is great but what if you have to maintain it 2 years later? ;-)So here's my more human readable version which works like the existing versions:This is two lines longer but I prefer this way because I am able to read and understand that easier than the other versions. However it's your decision. I hope I could help you.
