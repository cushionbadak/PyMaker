I have Python code written where a function gets in a JSON list (responses), a location (that is irrelevant at the moment) and a tripIdArray (an array with trip_id numbers that need to be compared with the 'responses' list)It returns a list where 'time', as a string, is the first element. I need to sort the list by 'time'.How can I do this? Here is my code.Time is formatted on a 24-hour clock (no am or pm), "04:18:00" for example.
This should suffice:This is because your array is an array of dictionaries. The key routine grabs a dictionary element to use for sorting.
