Consider the following example:What is the proper way to bind async method to a keystroke in tkinter?I've tried something like:...and a bunch of other combinations, but to no avail.
tkinter itself is asynchronous thanks to event loop, the after method and the bindings.However, if you trying to stick with asyncio it's also possible, but first let's consider what you tried.Your first try is obviously a fail, because you trying to call spam as a generic function, when it's a coroutine. Your other tries are more correct than a first, but await coroutine or yield from coroutine can be used to start a coroutine from another coroutine only, so it fails again.So the proper way of start that beast is a scheduling of its execution with a self-explanatory method ensure_future (or old async, which is just a deprecated alias).Try this example:Also, I think that it's worth to mention this question, since you use an update method.
