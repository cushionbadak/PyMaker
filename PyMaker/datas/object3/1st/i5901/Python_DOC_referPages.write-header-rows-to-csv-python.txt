How do I add headers to row one in a csv? My solution currently appends everythingSomething like: writer.writerow(['DataA', 'DataB', 'DataC', 'DATA D'])[0]I feel like there an easy way of doing this and I'm overlooking the obvious.I've looked at a lot of examples online but am still struggling as to how you can easily do this in a csv.As an example lets say I wanted to scrape data of SO - load up selenium, write that into four columns and do this for 20 pages.  I'd want to write the headers to row 1 each time and then append the scraped data 
In the first line open('C:\\fa.csv', 'a+', newline='', encoding="utf-8") you have a+ which is append you want w which is write.Check this out: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
