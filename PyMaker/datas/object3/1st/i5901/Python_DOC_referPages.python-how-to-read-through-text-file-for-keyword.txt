Natural Text
**This is a practice applicationI have a text file containing a id & a password. Each pair is on separate lines like so:I then have 2 functions to allow the user the add another id/password or update the password by selecting an ID then the new password. (I have removed the save functionality so I don't create loads of pairs when testing)The question is how would I write a check function so that when the user is creating a new pair.. it checks if the id/password already exists. Then on the update password function, it only checks if the password exists?My code so far:
The easiest way would be to use JSON:Not that I have included a seemingly unnecessary if clause in new_password. This is just for you that you can easily enter your own code what you want to do (maybe different) in each case. 
Create a function to store your usernames/passwords in a dictionary, then you can easily check it for existing usernames/passwordsTo store in dictionary:Then you can check for existing usernames or passwords like this:
When you are reading the file, make a dictionary with all the IDs as its keys.In next step, reverse the dictionary key-value pair so all its values (i.e all passwords) become its keys.Finally, when you enter a new ID and password, just check those dictionaries to know if they already exist. You may refer to this below code:
