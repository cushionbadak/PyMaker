I  have multiple lists in a list.I want delete the lists based on repeated values of sub list of( 4th and 5th) values.for eg: In sub list one 4th and 5th elements are 4&5.I want to check the repetition 4&5 in other lists.deleting the repeated ones.(same as for 2&5,5&5,4&5)The output i am expecting is :I don't want to use numpy. Because it is taking much time in while loop.I want to use normal methods.This is just example.I have large file of data like this.i want to use a.any() method.How can use a.any() method for this problem.Please help!!
You can try something like this without using any external module, with just one loop:Data is :One line solution:Detailed solution:output:
You can use groupby from the itertools package, and take the first element.  You will need to semi-sort the list first using the 4th and 5th elements, then group on those same elements and return the first element of each group.
This will get you the output you want.Basically you want to keep a snapshot of the two values that you look for changing. When you see them change, you add to the new list, and update the snapshot of the two values.I happen to use what's called a "slice" to grab both values together, since they're adjacent to each other in the sublists. And I start out by setting the slice to some illegal value to make sure it works for the first iteration through the loop.
If you are looking for uniques, you can do:If you are looking for transitions (ie, the first from a defined duplicate series), you can do:
You can use Pandas:Output:Or we can use Numpy:Output:
