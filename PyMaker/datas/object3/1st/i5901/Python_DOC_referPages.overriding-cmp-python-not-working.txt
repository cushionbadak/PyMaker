This question already has an answer here:Compare object instances for equality by their attributes in Python                    8 answers                Why can't I use the method __cmp__ in Python 3 as for Python 2?                    3 answers                Could anyone please find out what is wrong going on here? cmp is not being invoked. sorted(list, key=...) or similar works fine. However, that is also not overriding cmp method. My aim is to sort by multiple keys. I have composition relationship as well. Student can have list of another custom object and so on. What is best way to do? I am thinking to do something like compareTo or comparing or Comparator (Stream API) in Java in functional way. There could be default sorting.Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5, Mar 21 2017, 17:54:52) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.TypeError: unorderable types: Student() < Student()
__cmp__() is obsolete and is no longer supported. The correct way to do it is to override as many of __lt__(), __le__() and __eq__() as required.
In Python 3 __cmp__ is deprecated. For sorting use __lt__ instead:
