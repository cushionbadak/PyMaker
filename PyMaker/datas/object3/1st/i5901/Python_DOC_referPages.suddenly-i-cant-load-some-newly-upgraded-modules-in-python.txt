I suddenly can't load newly upgraded modules modules, e.g scikit-learn, zope, but I can find other packages. Even though the path links from the import points to the correct anaconda folder, which contains all the code. Any ideas what might be wrong and how to fix it?
sadly but true... your error is real..but the below warning message as well. Use sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis from now on. How to deal with the other possible persisting error is also updated into my answer. Enjoy!No errors when running below code:snippet output: [Assume_FINITE', ...]['base.py', ...]LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(n_components=None, priors=None, shrinkage=None,                solver='svd', store_covariance=False, tol=0.0001)As it seems your code goes wrong somewhere and somehow. Your best option for now is:1 - delete your scikit-image, sklearn and zope folders from folder ../site-packages;2 - delete folders + content of scikit_image-0.13.0-py2.7.egg-info, scikit_learn-0.19.1-py2.7.egg-info and zope installer folder into the trashbin;3 - delete folders from trashbin (prevents linkage to folders within the trashbin);4 -run pip install scikit-image/sklearn/zope with option  --no-cache-dir;5 Voila... you get a running skimage, sklearn and zope again.Enjoy!
It's not that you can't load them. As you can see, you did import them successfully with no error messages appearing.However, it seems that the modules zope and sklearn do not have the attributes that you are trying to use with them.try:from zope.interface import Interface and the same for sklearn:from sklearn import ldaI hope this helps. If not, try reinstalling the packages.Note that: you cannot simply just use pip install package because you are required to install other dependencies as well. Here are the pages with the installation instructions for:zope:https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/INSTALL-buildout.htmlsklearn:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
The Attribute error that you are presenting is the expected behaviour of Python3. Did you upgrade from Python 2 to Python 3 Because there are many differences between both version families... read more about this here: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.htmlTo load the sklearn.lda module you have to explicitly import the part of the module that you need.from sklearn import ldaor import sklearn.ldaI hope this answers your question!
A useful way to get around this problem in the future is to use virtual environments. It will allow you to have different versions of packages running on the same machine. This means that you can upgrade your packages for your new code, but you can still run your old code on the same machine. If you are using Anaconda then https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html is the description. If you are ever using a cpython distribution virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html is an amazing tool. While it doesn't solve your problem directly, spending an hour getting comfortable with this will stop dependancy issues for you in the future saving you a lot of time in the future.
