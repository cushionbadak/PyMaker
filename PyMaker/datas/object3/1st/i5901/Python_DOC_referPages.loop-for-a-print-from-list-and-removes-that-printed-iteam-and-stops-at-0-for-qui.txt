This is my code, is there anyway that i make a loop that keep printing my random choice question (and removes from the list the called one) need it for a quiz, when it calls the question i print options and input than use if elif else statements. Thanks!
When I see the way you're doing this, I don't like how you have 3 separate data structures when a single dict could combine them into one simple structure. Here's an example of what I'd do instead:This way, all the questions and options are in the same dict. The correct answer is, in this case, always the first element of the dict's value (first element of the list). These can be shuffled after you store it in a temp variable for comparison.
For the loop:That is just a sketch, because you did not post code that could be run link.Also you are mixing print('sth') (python3) and print 'sth' (python2)
