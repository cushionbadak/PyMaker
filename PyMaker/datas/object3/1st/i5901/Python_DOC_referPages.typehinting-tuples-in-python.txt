Natural Text
When I want to typehint a tuple in Python like:It is required to give the exact number of items in the tuple. That's different from list typehinting:That's consequentially, in a way, because of the type of tuples. Because they are designed not to be changed, you have to hardcode the amount of items in it.So my question is, is there a way to make the number of items in a tuple type hint flexible? I tried something like that but it didn't work:
Yes, you can make the number of items in a tuple type hint flexible:From the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TupleTo specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use literal ellipsis, e.g. Tuple[int, ...]. A plain Tuple is equivalent to Tuple[Any, ...], and in turn to tuple.
