For a list such as:What is the best way to iterate through the integers so that I get the return:aka getting every combination without rearranging the numbers.I tried an idea such aswhich returns but not quite what I want. Sorry if this is simple, still new to/picking up the syntax and functions of this language!
You could use a generator like this to produce all possible contiguous slices of the list and then make the case distinction for singletons:
Alternatively, you can use itertools to get the combinations (with replacement) for the bounds and then return a generator of those. Also, I'd suggest not returning a mixed list, but wrapping the single numbers into one-elemented tuples.Or shorter (thanks to @schwobaseggl), using just combinations without replacement but a slightly different range. Not sure which of the two is clearer.(If this is some sort of programming assignment, this might not be the expected output, but it will likely be much easier to handle in practice.)
