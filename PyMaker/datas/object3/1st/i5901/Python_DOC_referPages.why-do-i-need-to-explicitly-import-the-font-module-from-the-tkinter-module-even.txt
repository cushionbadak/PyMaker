I have tried to run the give python snippet:I get the output as:As well as a tkinter windowBut when I tried to execute the snippet as given below:I get an error:My doubt is that why do I explicitly need to import font from tkinter. As you can see that I have already imported the font module using the "*" notation in line 1. Please give some example so that I can understand how this is taking place. 
import * does not import everything. One way that it doesn't import everything is that it does not automatically search for submodules of a package. font is a submodule of the tkinter package, and if it has not already been loaded by some other import, from tkinter import * will not find tkinter.font.
The answer is simple: Python doesn't automagically import all module hierarchies, just because you import the top-level one. Those who do (e.g. os, which will make os.path available) have to explicitly write code for that .Just add import tkinter.font, and it worksHowever, as IDLE uses tkinter itself, it has already imported tkinter.font, thus you think you can get away without that import , I hope this helps : )
Modules can have submodules and/or functions, variables, etc. What gets imported by from <module> import * depends on how the module was implemented.  Most modules will not automatically import submodules. In this case, tkinter is the main module, and font is a submodule, and tkinter was not designed to import all submodules automatically.  So when you do from tkinter import *, you are grabbing all the functions and variables, but not the submodules.  The submodules must be explicitly imported to be used.  You can enter:Or you could also enter:The difference would be whether you want to use font.Font(... or tkinter.font.Font(...
