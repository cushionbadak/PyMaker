Natural Text
I want to create a dictionary from a text file in python. My text file is:The format of the text file is:I want to return a dictionary with the fruits as the key and the names as the values such as:I'm just not entirely sure on how to format the text file. Thanks in advance!EDIT: What I have done so farThis is where I'm sort of lost...
You can do the following, using some handy utils like itertools.groupby and collections.defaultdict:The conditional comprehension groups the lines in the file into groups based on the property of being empty or not and then only takes the groups of non-empty lines (if k). The subsequent use of a defaultdict avoids some bumpy code to check if keys are already present.
A little more clarity is needed on the format of the text file. For the sake of this answer I am assuming the format of the text file is something like this.Now if this is the case, i.e there's always a double line break('\n\n') after name of fruits and the sequence always starts with the name of person, then here is a way of getting this dictionary populated.Hope this helps
