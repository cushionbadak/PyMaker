Here is my issue.I am working on a system that acquires data from three different devices (each time, I would like to launch a process that executes a "read_data" loop).From the three data recorded in realtime, I would like to add a loop on top of that , that would perform an action regarding these data.Ex (with an obviously really bad semantic, but that's for understanding the idea):I tried to use threading and multiprocess, but I could not manage to launch the three threads that read and save in a variable the incoming data, then accessing when I want from an external loop to these data.
I'm going to try to be more specific:I have precisely :How am I suppose to use the Lock?Each thread has a different execution time by iteration as the reading of the data has a different time for each sensor.Thank you very much!
