Natural Text
I have a text file with data.In each line there is one or two words and one number, so the problem is, that sometimes there are 2 columns and sometimes 3.I only need those numbers. How to copy them to a list in Python?I tried withBut I don't know how to get rid of '\n' in the end of number? Because when I change result.append(line.split(' ')[-1])to result.append(int(line.split(' ')[-1])), it doesn't work.Is there a better way?
If the line number is irrelevant:
When python reads text files, it also reads in the newline characters ('\n' at the end of each line). You may want to remove these characters, and since these are numbers cast the value to int before appending to your list:output:
If you split each line by the space you would have a list of everything in the line. You can then use lst[-1] to get the last element in that list. for example:this should get you just the last column in each line. If you also need to store it as a number you can do lastCol=int(lst[-1]) as the last line.EDIT:You can use strip() to remove the "\n" and all other white-space at the end of the line:
