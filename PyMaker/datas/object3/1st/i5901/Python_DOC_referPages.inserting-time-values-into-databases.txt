I'm not sure why I get this error when I test this function. Can anyone please help me fix this?time_file.readlines()builtins.ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.I want to create a table for the time and insert all the values listed below, like idx, date, start, end, duration into the table.
@bigd since we are in the same class lol... here is the solution.. Your mistake is how you are reading the file, it should be time_file.readline(), if you do time_file.readlines(), using sqliteonline, the table would not appear.
