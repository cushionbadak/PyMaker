This question already has an answer here:x, = â€¦ - is this trailing comma the comma operator?                    2 answers                I've pass by some variables while documenting myself for animation with matplotlib which are written like this ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'ro', animated=True) or return ln, , and I don't understand what the comma stands for...It's probably related to tuple but I don't understand how, as the comma is supposed to be after the value and not the variable like i = 1,Thanks in advance for any clarification,
You can find it on 5. Data Structures - Python 3.6.3 documentationA tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas[...]Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking  or indexing
