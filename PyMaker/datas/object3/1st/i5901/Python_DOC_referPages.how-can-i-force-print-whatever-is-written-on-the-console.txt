I'm trying to build a piece of code that prints out whatever is written on the console, but still executing whatever a person writes on it. For example:I have this function:Whenever someone puts this: c = create_set() in the console. I want the program to create the set AND print out the string "c = create_set()" How can I do that? Some help would be much aprecciated
You could write a decorator that does this, but you'll have to add this to every method per hand or do some magic in the module __dict__ (which I don't recommend). This works (I tested it) in python 3.6, if you use the commented version it works in python 2.7. They changed the stack-signature from 2.X to 3.X.Use it like this:This will print x = test()to stdout. If you want this for debugging, that is totally fine, but if this is something your code relies on in production I would not recommend it, because it will kill your performance, see for example here.
