i'm new to python threads, as first task i wrote this:The code works, but i'm wondering if that is a typical use case for threads, or i simply could do something like that.In other words, is multithreading the right choice for my problem? many thanks
Yes, in my opinion it is good approach and pretty common. Threads are used in  cases such as: Asynchronous operations - when some process does not depend on output of the otherProcesses which can be parrallelized - like doing filtering on different parts of imageOperations running on backgroudI think your case can be treated as first and second groups. Each person object analysis does not depend on the outputs of other people analysis. However, in case you have big data of users and words, it can cause problems for your computer, since it have to manage creation and destruction of each thread. Anyway, it is personal decision use threads or not.
