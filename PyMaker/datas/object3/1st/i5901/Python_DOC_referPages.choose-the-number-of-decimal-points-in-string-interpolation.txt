Is there a way to use a variable to decide the number of decimal points in literal string interpolation?for example if I have something likeis there a way to replace the 3 with a variable?The end goal is to add data labels to a bar chart:But I can't think of an easy way to replace the 3 in the string interpolation with the variable decimal.
Format specifiers can be nested. In Python 3.5, this would look e.g. like this:But it turns out the same also works with Python 3.6 f"..." format strings.Also works in combination with round:
Yes, you can escape string templating literals with double curly braces:I don't think you can use formatted string literals for the second substitution, but I think it's a nice solution anyway.I think you made a mistake in the first code example in your question, the dot is in a wrong place in your formatter. (3.f instead of .3f)
