Ive searched on StackOverflow, but none of the  mentioned tricks worked.Here follows my code.
The documentation says:A pair (host, port) is used for the AF_INET address family, where host is a string representing either a hostname in Internet domain notation like 'daring.cwi.nl' or an IPv4 address like '100.50.200.5', and port is an integer.sendto expects the message & the address so 2 parameters. You're passing this:so viewed from sendto, the message is b'10.1.15.243' and the address is b'5000'. b"5000" is a bytes object, which explains the error message. The parentheses here have no effect (and even if they did define tuples, that would still be incorrect). Moreover, you also forgot to pass your payload...As address is a proper address tuple (('10.1.15.243','5000')), just do:(address is properly defined above)
