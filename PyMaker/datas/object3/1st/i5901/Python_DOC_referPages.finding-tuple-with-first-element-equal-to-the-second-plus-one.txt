Given a list of tuples:I want to check if the first number == second number + 1 in each tuple.In case they are equal I need to return False and else return True.I tried two different methods but both check only the first tuple ((4, 0))  and then return True, despite that it should return False (because the second tuple (2, 1) is 2 == 1 + 1).Attempt #1:Attempt 2:What am I doing wrong?
You are only testing the first tuple in your list. return ends the function.Test all tuples before you decide to return Truei:So when the first tuple is tested, the a == b + 1 test is still false, so you continue to test the next tuple. At that point (2, 1) is tested and False is returned. If you were to remove the (2, 1) tuple from the input, then the for loop ends and the return True line is reached.You can use the all() function, together with the inverse test (not equal) to make the above loop more compact:This returns False the moment a tuple that matches your criteria is found, True otherwise.
You can try this:Output:
