I have two lists:I want to create a new list l3 that contains the items of l2 that are not in l1. Something like this:So, I am expecting an l3 as:How can I achieve that?Any solution Using remove() or delete() in python..?
If you want to remove l2 sublists that are in l1 and create a new list with the remaining sublists, try this:
Just do:
Build a set of tuples for the O(1) membership test. (In your trivial example, that would not be necessary, but I am assuming big lists.) Then filter via list comprehension.
Use below code:
Using Itertool :itertools  offers the fastest and most powerful solutions to this kind of problems , and will be efficient in terms of time  , when the list size grows ,And it's the pythonic way to achieve the solution , as the saying goes "When you are in Rome, Do like Romans."
If order and types are not crucial, use sets instead.  They are fast and resemble your examples:The first two lines convert the lists into (unordered) sets of tuples, e.g. These forms allow set operations, i.e. one equivalent to the difference between set2 and set1.
