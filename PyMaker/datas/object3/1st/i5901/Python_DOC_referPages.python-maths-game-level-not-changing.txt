When I type level4 or level3 or level2 my game does not go to the requested level.It prints the entered level (e.g. level1) and stays on level one.
You should define the function before using it. You are calling functions before they are defined.Also the calls to them (e.g. level1()) after them is not needed.You may also move the imports at the begging of the file, and remove them from each function.You may also use an IDE, for example PyCharm.
In your if statement, you're using an input() method. It doesn't have to be there. Just write:etc. It's also better to use elif in stead of if.
