Here import-hooks it is written that meta hooks are registered in sys.meta_path. Also in this list there are kept finders. So what is the difference between meta hook and finder? Are they the same thing? And why are they kept in the same place?
The document you're quoting says:Meta hooks are registered by adding new finder objects to sys.meta_pathSo, I'd say yes, they're the same thing.
They are subtlety different. This document provides a thorough discussion of the import machinery.Meta hooks are called at the start of import processing. As a result, they can become involved in all types of imports including imports such as builtin modules or frozen modules as well as the start of handling disk based module location via sys.path. Basically, at this levelPath hooks are invoked later in import processing during the processing of each sys.path entry. They have the opportunity to return an object that will take full responsibility for locating modules in that particular path entry. For example, if sys.path contains [/usr/lib/Python3, /home/user/mypython], you could provide a path hook which would be able to do non-standard stuff to locate modules in your project mypythonBoth hooks allow you to supply a finder which can take complete responsibility for locating modules in specific contexts. For example, a meta path hook is used to import modules from zip files.
