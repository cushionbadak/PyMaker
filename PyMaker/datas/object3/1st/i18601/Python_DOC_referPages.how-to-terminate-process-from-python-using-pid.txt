I'm trying to write some short script in python which would start another python code in subprocess if is not already started else terminate terminal & app (Linux).So it looks like:Have problem of lacking knowledge to name proces by pid which app reads from file ".proc".The other problem is that interpreter says that string named dat is not equal to "x" ??? What I've missed ?
Using the awesome psutil library it's pretty simple:If you don't want to install a new library, you can use the os module:See also the os.kill documentation.If you are interested in starting the command  python StripCore.py if it is not running, and killing it otherwise, you can use psutil to do this reliably.Something like:Sample run:Note: In previous psutil versions cmdline was an attribute instead of a method.
I wanted to do the same thing as, but I wanted to do it in the one file.So the logic would be:if a script with my name is running, kill it, then exitif a script with my name is not running, do stuffI modified the answer by Bakuriu and came up with this:Running the script will do whatever the script does. Running another instance of the script will kill any existing instance of the script.I use this to display a little PyGTK calendar widget which runs when I click the clock. If I click and the calendar is not up, the calendar displays. If the calendar is running and I click the clock, the calendar disappears.
