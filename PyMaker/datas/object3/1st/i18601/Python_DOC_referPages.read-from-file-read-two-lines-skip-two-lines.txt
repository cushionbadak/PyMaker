I want to read two lines from a file, skip the next two lines and read the next two lines and so onAny ideas how to do this? Thanks!My solution:
You can advance the iteration of the file with the itertools consume() recipe - as it is fast (it uses itertools functions to ensure the iteration happens in low-level code, making the process of consuming the values very fast, and avoids using up memory by storing the consumed values):By doing this, you can do something like:We use enumerate() to count our progress, and skip ahead every two lines (note that enumerate() adds the numbers after the values are skipped, meaning that it doesn't count the skipped values, as wanted).This is a good solution as it avoids any Python looping at all for the skipped values, cutting them out completely.
Group them into pairs, and then skip every other pair, eg:Example output of file containing lines 1 - 9:Or to iterate over them as one long sequence:
Something like that?I.e. you anyway have to read all the lines, but just don't do an action with lines you don't want to read.
