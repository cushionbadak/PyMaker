I have a counter that looks a bit like this:I want to sort on keys specifically in an alphabetical order, NOT by counter.most_common()is there any way to achieve this?
Just use sorted:

In Python 3, you can use the most_common function of collections.Counter: This uses the most_common function available in collections.Counter, which allows you to find the keys and counts of n most common keys.
To get values as list in sorted order
