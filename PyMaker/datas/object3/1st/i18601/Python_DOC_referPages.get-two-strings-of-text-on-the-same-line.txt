In Python 2.x, where print is a statement, add a trailing comma:In Python 3.x, where print() is an ordinary function instead of a statement, pass an empty string for the end keyword parameter:If you use the from __future__ import print_function in Python 2.x code for forwards compatibility, then you'll need to use the function version instead of the statement version.
Use trailing comma, which will suppress the newlines added after print. Check out print statement:
Add a comma at the end of the statement:Output:This is from the documentation:A '\n' character is written at the end, unless the print statement ends with a comma.    
Use a comma:print 'Hi!', 'How are you?'
In python 2.x you can use a comma after the print statementwhich will output:You can also import the print function from python 3.x and do This puts an empty string as the ending character instead of a \n
In Python3:Is what you are looking for I guess! : texttextYou can also set the separator:Gives: texttexttext instead of text text text
You can also put all your string in one string like that :
