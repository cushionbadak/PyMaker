And while I'm not displeased with it, I was wondering if there was a better alternative in python. My script is a console based script where I'm using argparser to fetch for what the user needs.

I'm guessing you're starting Python scripting with a background somewhere else, where a switch statement would solve your question. As that's not an option in Python, you're looking for another way to do things. Without context, though, you can't really answer this question very well (there are far too many options). I'll throw in one (somewhat Pythonic) alternative:Let's start with an example of where I think you're coming from.Here's my alternative:You can also look into lambdas which you can put into the dictionary structure I used.But again, as said, without context this may not be what you're looking for.
This is the first thing that comes to my mind:Instead of doing this:You can do this:For more detail, see: PEP 308: Conditional Expressions!
