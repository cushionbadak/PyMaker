I have this simple code which fetches page via urllib:Now I can read the result via result.read() but I was wondering if all this functionality can be done outside the for loop. Because other URLs to be fetched will wait until all the result has been processed.I want to process result outside the for loop. Can this be done?
One of the ways to do this maybe to have result as a dictionary. What you can do is:result = {}and use result[BrowserName] outside the loop.Hope this helps.
If you simply wants to access all results outside the loop just append all results to a array or dictionary as above answer.Or if you trying to speed up your task try multithreading.Its a simple way of multithrading. It may break depending on your result processing. Consider reading the documentation and some examples before you try.
You can use threads for this:
Are you using python3?, if so, you can use futures for this task:
You could also do this with yield:This is still a synchronous call (browser 2 will not fire until browser 1 is processed) but you can keep the logic for dealing with the results separate from the logic managing the connections.  You could of course also use threads to handle the processing asynchronously with or without yieldEditJust re-read OP and should repeat that yield doesn't provide multi-threaded, asynchronous execution in case that was not clear in my first answer!
