I'm trying to find the best way to switch between the two python compilers  2.7 to 3.3If I run python from cmd, I would you use something likepython ex1.pywhere I set "python" from window environment variable from my computer properties to point to either python 3.3 or 2.7 one or another.I am wondering there is an easy way to switch between the two from cmd line ? 
For Windows 7, I just rename the python.exe from the Python 3 folder to python3.exe and add the path into the environment variables. Using that, I can execute python test_script.py and the script runs with Python 2.7 and when I do python3 test_script.py, it runs the script in Python 3.To add Python 3 to the environment variables, follow these steps - Right Click on My Computer and go to Properties.Go to Advanced System Settings.Click on Environment Variables and edit PATH and add the path to your Python 3 installation directory.For example, 
No need for "tricks".  Python 3.3 comes with PyLauncher "py.exe", installs it in the path, and registers it as the ".py" extension handler.  With it, a special comment at the top of a script tells the launcher which version of Python to run:OrFrom the command line:OrSee 3.4. Python Launcher for Windows
They are 3 ways you can achieve this using the py command (py-launcher) in python 3, virtual environment or configuring your default python system path. For illustration purpose, you may see tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynDlb0n27cw&t=38s
In case you have both python 2 and 3 in your path, you can move up the Python27 folder in your path, so it search and executes python 2 first.
You can try to rename the python executable in the python3 folder to python3, that is if it was named python formally... it worked for me
