I wanted to have a look at the python deque class. When I checked the source code , I found the following at line 10where exactly can I find this _collections module? I searched on my copy of the python source, but couldn't spot it.Where is this class located?
_collections is builtin extension module.You can find source for _collection module here.Setup.dist contains mapping between builtin extension module name to source file.
_collections is a private implementation of a class according to this answer: "Private" (implementation) class in Python.Being private, I don't think that you will be able to access its Python source but you can check out the C implementation here.
These days the CPython source code (including built-in modules) is hosted on Github, so you can find the collections module source code here.For the collections.abc module, see here.
