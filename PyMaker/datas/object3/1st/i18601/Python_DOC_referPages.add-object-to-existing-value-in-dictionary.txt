In order to make my own tile based rpg, I have a question.I have a dictionary where I want, during the creation of my tile map, to store pairs of tile type/ rect values e.g. My problem now is that I have to give every key multiple values, since there is only a limitednumber of tile types but multiple tiles of each type.So I tried this:Might be a bit complicated since I'm not very good at writing simple code.My problem is in the if else statements. I use them to check whether one type of tile in the dictionary collide_list already has one or multiple rects assigned.If so, the existing rect should be added as a second value to the key. This kind of works, but prints out this in the shell:This is only for one key (sorry for spamming). This is VERY complicated to read and very hard to work with later on.Isn't there a better possibility of concatenating a value to an existing value in a dictionary?Any help is appreciated.
You are collecting the existing tuple, then creating a new tuple with that existing tuple nested into it:Instead, append a new one-element tuple:You certainly should leave your one-element values to be just a rectangle, start with a one-element tuple:or, much better still, use a list, you are after all altering it constantly:If you make collision_list a collections.defaultdict object you don't even have to test for the key first:
