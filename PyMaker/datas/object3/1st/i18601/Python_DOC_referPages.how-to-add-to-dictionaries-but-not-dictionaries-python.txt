I need a dictionary, that I can edit to. Not add an entire new value, but add to a 'class'??? inside of the dictionary. For example character stats.if race == 'orc':    if Class == 'worrier':        stats = ['strength': 6, 'intelligence': 2]'How can i add to the strength? (I know you can't add with dictionaries, that why I need something similar).
I know you can't add with dictionariesActually, you can:However, as you can tell this is not really ideal. What you want more appropriately is an object that stores all the properties, provides methods to add the various attributes. Then you store a collection of these objects.Now, you want to give the Orc some strength:To make him weaker:That way, when you have a "fight" you can take the impact of each weapon, and then minus the damage inflicted, until of course the orc dies because his strength is less than 0 - that's why I added the is_dead() method.Here is what a "game" would look like:
It's unclear what your asking here, so I'm going to presume you want to know how to add to a value in a dictionary.Try this:However, in this case I would suggest you look at classes. This would allow you to do myorc.strength += 7 instead, and furthermore create classes of units that inherit from each other, eg. an ogre being like an orc but with 5 higher strength, without having to rewrite lots of code.Edit: from reading your comments, it looks like you might want to add a new key value pair to the dictionary. To do this, do dictionary[key] = value. It will create the pair if key isn't already a key of the dictionary, and update the value if it is.

why not stats['strength'] = stats['strength'] + n ?
