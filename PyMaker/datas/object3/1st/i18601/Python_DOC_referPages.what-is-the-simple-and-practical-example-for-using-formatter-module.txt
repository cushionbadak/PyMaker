I found a formatter module in Python 3.4 (Lib/formatter.py). I can import it.Then what? What is the purpose of this module? There is no unit test for this module so I can not find any examples. The documentation is very cryptic.Is there any simple and practical example for using this module? I want to know the purpose of this module. Thx.
The module defines an abstract class interface for use with the htmllib.HTMLParser. That module was removed from Python 3; the fact that the formatter module is still there is likely an oversight.Use it to turn HTML tree events into formatted documents. For example, if during parsing a HTML document a <H1> header is encountered, the formatter.end_paragraph() method will be called, followed by a formatter.push_font() method call.Use this module if you are transforming HTML documents; like building a HTML-to-plaintext converter, or a web browser.
If you are still confused or unsure about the formatter module, then there is a very good resource which explains it with simple terminology and good examples over here:http://effbot.org/librarybook/formatter.htm
