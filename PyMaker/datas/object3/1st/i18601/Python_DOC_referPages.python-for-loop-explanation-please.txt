I am new to programming but I have gone over tutorials in Java, C++, Javascript, PHP and have never comes across something like this.Can you please explain this code, especially the isinstance

If you're familiar with Java you can construct a nearly identical series of loops and checks like this:
So if movies = [1,2,3], then each_item will take on the values 1,2,3 in the loop.  Since 1,2,3 are not lists, the values just get printed out.If movies = [1,[2,3]], then each_item will take on the values 1 and [2,3] in loop.  Since [2,3] is a list, it enters inner for loop.  So nested_item will take on the values 2,3.
Assuming your code is this:It looks like you're printing out each item in a potentially nested list. isinstance(object, classinfo) returns true if the object (the first parameter) is an instance of the class (the second parameter). So the first time you call isinstance, you're testing to see if each_item is a list. If it is a list, you're for-looping through the list.Essentially, you're looking at the first item in a list. If it itself is a list, you look at the first item in it. If that item is a list, you look at the first item in it. If at any point you find an item that is not a list, you print out that item.So a list like this: [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]] would print out given your current code.If you were to just doit would printAnd if you were to doyou'll get an error telling you that you can't for loop over a number, because it is not an iterable.
Understanding isinstance(each_item,list) requires getting these two things:isinstance(A,B) answers the question "Is A an instance of B?"list is a python type (like dict, tuple, set, str and int) and can be used a couple of different ways:to convert things into lists:list("oink")  # ==> ['o', 'i', 'n', 'k']  convert a string to a list of characterslist((1,2,3)) # ==> [1, 2, 3]             convert a tuple to a listto help figure out the type of thingstype([1,2,3]) == list  # ==> True         discover the type of somethingisinstance([1,2,3],list) # ==> True
