I have been scripting for around two weeks, and have just learnt about reading from a file.What I want to do is get every other entry from my original list and store it in a new list. Is this the best way to do it?Please bear in mind that I have only studied Python for around ten hours so far - I'm quite happy that this even seemed to work.
There are at least a couple ways to accomplish the same thing with less code.Slice NotationPython has a way of iterating over every nth element of an array called slice notation.  You can replace the entire loop with the following lineWhat this basically means is to grab every 2nd element starting at index 0 and add it to the Username array.The range() functionYou can also use a different version of the range() function, that allows you to specify a start, end and step, list so.The range() function is documented here.
You could use a list comprehension:input_file:Python:Further reading: the enumerate() built-in function.
