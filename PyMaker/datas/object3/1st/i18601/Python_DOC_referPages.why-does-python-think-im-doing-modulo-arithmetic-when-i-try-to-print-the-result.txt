Natural Text
I am trying to create a class using PyDev in Eclipse, but when I try to run as Python I get an error:  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'int'.I've tried to select all text, then go under the source menu and select "correct indentation", but I could not find that option in my Eclipse.How can I fix this problem in Python 3?Here's the code (transcribed from here):
No, indentation problems aren't your concern - the way you're printing out your information is.In Python3, print() is now a function which returns None when done, then applying some operator to None, hence your exception.I notice that you're attempting to do the old style of string formatting by using the % operator to specify when the formatting begins - the use of this in Python 3 is discouraged.Here's how you get past it:  use the curly-brace notation and call .format() with the parameters you want to format.  It's positional, so multiple curly braces will format multiple arguments.Example:That's the most complex of your print statements; I feel that you can get the rest from here.
The problem is you have close the print function before entering all arguments, you should do the following: print("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount) <-By the way, in python 3, print have a new syntax and it requires parenthesis, so: You have to writeI hope it works
You have no indentation problems.You are using three spaces to indent instead of four. This is not a problem for Python, but Eclipse thinks you should use four and puts wavy lines under it. If you can't get Eclipse to fix that, simply just use four spaces instead.
