There doesn't appear to be a way to add headers to the urlparse command.  This essentially causes Python to use its default user agent, which is blocked by several web pages.  What I am trying to do is essentially do the equivalent of this:But using urlparse:So how can I modify this urlparse in order for it to take headers, or be usable with my Request that I created?  Any help is appreciated, thanks.Also, for anyone wondering the exact error I am getting:At this:
Headers are part of a request, of which the URL is one part. Python creates a request for you when you pass in just a URL to urllib.request functions.Create a Request object, add the headers to that object and use that instead of a string URL:However, urlretrieve() is marked as 'legacy API' in the code and doesn't support using a Request object. Removing a few lines supporting 'file://' urls is easy enough:    from urllib.request import urlopen
