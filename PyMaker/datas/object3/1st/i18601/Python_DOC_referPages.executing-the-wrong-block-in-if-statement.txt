Even though the clothes_total number will be greater than 200, the values in elif clothes_total >200 would not show up. Can you guys tell me why it doesn't show up? In elif clothes_total > 150 everything shows up nicely even if the number if greater than 200. Whatam I doing wrong?
This is happening because your program execution goes through elif clothes_total > 150 before it even considers the elif clothes_total > 200. Here's how if-statements work:This:is the same as this:If you want to execute what's inside the if clothes_total > 150 and the if clothes_total > 200, there are four options:Option 1 (just add everything from one onto the other):Option 2 (nested if-statement):Option 3 (no else, just ifs):This will execute the last two if blocks, which might not be what you want. Note however, that in executing all those if-statments' conditions, you lose on runtime, especially if they're complex conditionsOption 4 (range conditions):This gives you the short-circuiting of if-statements that you desire, as well as the guarantee that only one block will be entered at any given time.Hope this helps
That's because if-elif-else conditions short-circuit, if first elif condition is True the second one is not going to be checked.From docs on if-suite:It selects exactly one of the suites by evaluating the expressions one  by one until one is found to be true; then that suite is executed (and  no other part of the if statement is executed or evaluated). If all  expressions are false, the suite of the else clause, if present, is  executed.Use all if's in case you want all conditions to be executed:Another option is:
As others have pointed out, once the total>150 condition is true the total>200 will not even be evaluated.Try reversing the order of the statements like this...Also keep in mind that in your original code a value of exactly 150 would have been missed unless you change the < to <=.
Did you know that you can sum lists:clothes_total = sum([tot1, tot2, tot3, tot4, tot5])But I have to believe you have a list of your total variables going, in which case you can just do:clothes_total = sum(totals_list)
