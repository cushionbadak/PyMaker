So I have recently installed Python Version 2.7.5 and I have made a little loop thing with it but the problem is, when I go to cmd and type python testloop.py I get the error: 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external commandI have tried setting the path but no avail.Here is my path:C:\Program Files\Python27As you can see, this is where my Python is installed. I don't know what else to do. Can someone help?
You need to add that folder to your Windows Path:https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html Taken from this question.
Try "py" instead of "python" from command line:C:\Users\Cpsa>py  Python 3.4.1 (v3.4.1:c0e311e010fc, May 18 2014, 10:38:22) [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  >>>
I have found the answer... click on the installer and check the box "Add python to environment variables" DO NOT uninstall the old one rather click on modify....Click on link for picture...
Firstly, be sure where your python directory. It is normally in C:\Python27. If yours is different then change it from the below command.If after you install it python still isn’t recognized, then in PowerShell enter this:[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27",  "User")Close PowerShell and then start it again to make sure Python now runs. If it doesn’t,restart may be required.
Type py -v instead of python -v in command prompt
If you want to see python version then you should use py -V instead of python -VC:\Users\ghasan>py -VPython 3.7.1If you want to go to python's running environment then you should use py instead of pythonC:\Users\ghasan>pyPython 3.7.1 (v3.7.1:260ec2c36a, Oct 20 2018, 14:57:15) [MSC v.1915 64  bit (AMD64)] on win32Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.Here you can run the python program as:print('Hello Python')Hello Python
i solved this by running CMD in administration mode, so try this.
I have met same issue when I install Python, and it is resolved when I set a PATH in system, here are the steps.Navigate to "Control Panel" -> "System"Click "Advanced system settings" on the leftClick "Environment Variables"Search and click "Path" variableClick "Edit"Add "C:\"to the environment variables field, if you are using Windows7, then separate it by a semicolon from the existing entry. If you are using Windows10, just simply click "New" to add.Reopen the Command Prompt and tryenter image description here
From the Python docs, set the PATH like you did as above.You should arrange for Python’s installation directory to be added to the PATH of every command window as it starts. If you installed Python fairly recently then the command dir C:\py* will probably tell you where it is installed; the usual location is something like C:\Python27. Otherwise you will be reduced to a search of your whole disk  Use Tools ‣ Find or hit the Search button and look for “python.exe”. Supposing you discover that Python is installed in the C:\Python27 directory (the default at the time of writing), you should make sure that entering the commandThen execute the Python command using the full path name to make sure that works.
Another helpful but simple solution might be restarting your computer after doing the download if Python is in the PATH variable. This has been a mistake I usually make when downloading Python onto a new machine.
Just find out where you have these three files in your system then copy each path and paste it in environment variable one by one. Then click ok to all.C:\Anaconda3C:\Anaconda3\Scripts C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin Then Restart your Spyder kernel(left hand side) and type python in cmd to check if it is working.
Open CMD with administrative access(Right click then run as administrator) then type the following command there:Replace My_python_lib with the folder name of your installed python like for me it was C:\python27.Then to check if the path variable is set, type echo %PATH% you'll see your python part in the end. Hence now python is accessible.From this tutorial
