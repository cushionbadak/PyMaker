This is my line of code, but under else clothes_total1 > 200:, I keep getting:invalid syntax errorDon't know what the problem is. Can someone help me out help? Thank you.
It should be elif not else:From docs:And instead of using tot1 + tot2 + tot3 + tot4+ tot5, I think you should use a list.Example:and then use sum:If the list has more than 5 items and you want sum of just first 5 items then use slicing:
else cannot have predicate.Use elif instead of else.
else should be equal to elif.This is because in Python, else acts as a kind of "catch-all"â€”it doesn't require any additional requirements, and in fact doesn't allow them. If you want to specify conditions for an else clause, then you have to use elif.
else doesn't take a condition, but elif does.If you use else, that means, if EVERYTHING fails, do this.
