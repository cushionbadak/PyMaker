Suppose I have two lists of any, but equal length, for example:For these two lists, I would want output to be:Basically, the first element of the first list to the first element of the second list and so on.  How would I do that?  And note, that the lists can be of any length, not just what the example shows, but the length of the first list is equal to the length of the second list.
zip the lists to combine them, then join each pair of strings into a single string:
You can use map and zip to do the job:What zip does is it creates a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each list.  Then you can transform each tuple into a string by concatenation (using lambda(x,y): x+y).
If you want a functional approach you can use map and operator.addNo need for lambdas nor list comprehension to do the concatenation.NOTE: For those who say is not Python 3, this dump could make you change your mind:
The above answer seems to be valid also for Python 2.7. In addition, you can just use zip and an inline adder (lambda):1:2:or just in one line:3:map() allows mapping multiple arguments, which yields a short solution:
Here are some more ways to do it
