I was wondering if it makes a difference in using + str(var1 + var2) vs , var1, var2?  If it does, when should I be using one or the other?
Read the manual:All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end.So if you pass a single argument to print (e.g., "Multiply: " + str(a*b)), sep is not inserted between them. (So no extra space character.)All these lines are the same (the difference being how many times str is called behind-the-scenes and how many intermediate strings are constructed):
This use of , is specific to the print function. It automatically inserts a space. It is best to use for readability's sake when the space is desired, because it avoids the str call.But, if you need a string (e.g. to put in a variable), you need to use +str(...).
