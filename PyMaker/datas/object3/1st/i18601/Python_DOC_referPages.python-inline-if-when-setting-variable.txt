This question already has an answer here:Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?                    28 answers                In Java, setting a variable to a value based on a condition could be done in one line like so:This would result to '2'.Is there python equivalent to this code?Thank you.
General ternary syntax:This is called a conditional expression in Python, and is mostly equivalent to the "ternary operator" in C-family languages (although it's not actually an operator). The original proposal PEP 308 has more details.
