I am making a find and replace script to fix some stuff on my website. I am using Python 3.3.2.Here is my code:The problem is that python tells me that the file is not readable. If I changes this f = open('random.html', 'w') to f = open('random.html', 'r') to this, it says it is not writable. It makes sense why it needs both, but if I put both in, it tells me there must be exactly one read/write thing. I am positive that this is something basic, I just can't figure it out. Thanks for any help you can provide.
f = open('random.html', 'r+')Source: http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html 
You can use r+ or w+ as the second parameter to open it in both modes. Refer to here.Also, have you considered using a with statement? They are more pythonic:This has a great advantage that you don't need to manually do .close() afterwards.strToSearch can also be re-written as strToSearch = ''.join(f.readlines())Have you considered using a HTML parser such as BeautifulSoup for stuff like this? Better and easier than regex :)
