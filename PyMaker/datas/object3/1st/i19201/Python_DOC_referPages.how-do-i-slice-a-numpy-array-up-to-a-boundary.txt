I am using Numpy and Python in a project where a 2D map is represented by an ndarray:An object has a tuple location:and a view range:How do I write the function actor.view_map(map), such that the map returns the area surrounding the actor's location up to a range. For example (using the above map),but if the actor's range extends too far I want the map filled with -1:the easiest case is a range of 0, which returns the current square:How do I slice my map up to a certain boundary?

Here's a little class Box to make using boxes easier --
