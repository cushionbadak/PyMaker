This is the function I'm after: -http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.to_bytesI need big endianness support.
Based on the answer from @nneonneo, here is a function that emulates the to_bytes API:
To answer your original question, the to_bytes method for int objects was not back ported to Python 2.7 from Python 3.  It was considered but ultimately rejected.  See the discussion here.
To pack arbitrary-length longs in Python 2.x, you can use the following:This outputs the number in big-endian order; for little endian, reverse the string (s[::-1]).
You can probably use struct.pack instead:It doesn't do arbitrary lengths in the way int.to_bytes does, but I doubt you need that.
