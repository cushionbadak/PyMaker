I am working with python and I am trying to find powers of really large numbers but something interesting which happens is that this throws a math overflowbut this below seems to work although I do not know if the value returned is correctAnybody aware why this happens
math.pow:Unlike the built-in ** operator, math.pow() converts both its arguments to type float. Use ** or the built-in pow() function for computing exact integer powers.
Simple, the math.pow() method uses C float libraries, while the ** power operator uses integer maths.The two methods have different limitations. Python int size is only limited by how much memory your OS will let Python have, float numbers are limited by your computer architecture, see sys.float_info.max.
