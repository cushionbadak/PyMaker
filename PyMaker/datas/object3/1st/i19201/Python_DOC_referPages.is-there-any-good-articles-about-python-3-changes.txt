I'm returning Python developer. I was working with 2.7 last time. And i want to read full list of new things and changes in 3.3 since 2.7. Does anyone know something good?PS: Yeah, i know that there it is for me in the documentation, but i want a single article with some author's thoughts about these changes.
http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmlThis article explains the new features in Python 3.0, compared to 2.6.
I found this pdf very informative. It is a free 4-page cheat sheet of differences provided by the publisher of "Programming in Python 3" book by Mark Summerfield.In response to your PS, this is not an article, but a very easy to grasp categorized list of differences.
