I was wondering if there was a more pythonic, or alternative, way to do this. I want to compare results out of cumulative functions. Each functions modifies the output of the previous and I would like to see, after each of the functions, what the effect is. Beware that in order to get the actual results after running the main functions, one last function is needed to calculate something. In code, the thing looks like this (just kind of pseudocode):As you can see, for n functions I would need 1/2(n(n+1)) manually made loops. Is there, like I said, something more pythonic (for example a list with functions?) that would clean up the code and make it much shorter and manageable when added more and more functions?The actual code, where documents is a custom object:while this is only a small part, more functions need to be added.
You could define a set of chains, applied with functools.reduce()The reduce() call effectively does func3(func2(func1(textfile)) if chain contained 3 functions.I assumed here that you wanted to apply calculateandPrint() per textfile in path after the chain of functions has been applied.Each iteration of the for chain in chains loop represents one of your doStuffx loop bodies in your original example, but we only loop through for textfile in path once.You can also swap the loops; adjusting to your example:
