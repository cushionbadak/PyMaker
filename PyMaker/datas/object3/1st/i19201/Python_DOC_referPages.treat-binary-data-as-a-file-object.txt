Here is the important part of some existing code that I'm trying to adapt for my own uses. The notable part is that self.archive leads to a massive file and raw_file is binary data extracted (painfully) from this giant file.  The existing code extracts the contents of an archive-like file to disk, but I need to only read these stored files from this archive (if that makes any sense).I need to use Pygame to read a few hundred mbs of data from this file, mostly as images, using methods such as pygame.image.load().  Rather than having this code write all of the file's contents to disk and then re-reading it again in "not-binary", I'd like to directly do something like pygame.image.load(toVirtualFileObject(raw_file)).  Does anyone know of something like this?
This is what StringIO (in Python 2) and io.BytesIO in (in Python 3) are for.
