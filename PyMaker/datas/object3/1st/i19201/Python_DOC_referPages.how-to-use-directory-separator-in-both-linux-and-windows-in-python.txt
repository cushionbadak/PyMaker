I have written a code in python which uses / to make a particular file in a folder, if I want to use the code in windows it will not work, is there a way by which I can use the code in Windows and Linux.In python I am using this code:When I will use my code in suppose windows machine my code will not work.How do I use "/" (directory separator) in both Linux and Windows?
Use os.path.join().Example: os.path.join(pathfile,"output","log.txt").In your code that would be: rootTree.write(os.path.join(pathfile,"output","log.txt"))
Use:to see how separator looks on a current OS.In your code you can use:
You can use os.sep:
os.path.normpath(pathname) should also be mentioned as it converts / path separators into \ separators on Windows. It also collapses redundant uplevel references... i.e., A/B and A/foo/../B and A/./B all become A/B.  And if you are Windows, these all become A\B.
Some useful links that will help you:os.sepos.pathos.pathsep
If you are fortunate enough to be running Python 3.4+, you can use pathlib:or, equivalently,
Do a import os and then use os.sep
You can use "os.sep "
Don't build directory and file names your self, use python's included libraries. In this case the relevant one is os.path. Especially join which creates a new pathname from a directory and a file name or directory and split that gets the filename from a full path.Your example would be
