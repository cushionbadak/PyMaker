Natural Text
within my program I have a list, and I would like a loop until all of a column of the list equals 2. All of the items in the column are numbers but some are formatted as strings and some are formatted as integers, because they are changed in other parts of the program.Below are 3 solutions I have tried, I am running python 2.7.The problem I am having is that the loop is ending when only one of the list items (rather than the whole column) equals 2If anybody could tell me what I'm doing wrong or a better way of doing it, I would really appreciate the help
The expressions in brackets are evaluated to a single value: newlist[0-8] is the same as newlist[-8], and newlist[0 and 1 and 2 and 3] is the same as  newlist[0]. You want any:
Try using a for loop. Lets say L is your list, now we can iterate over the rows, each of which is a list itself, like this:Make sure the while loop terminates by increasing row[column] so it eventually fails the while test.
