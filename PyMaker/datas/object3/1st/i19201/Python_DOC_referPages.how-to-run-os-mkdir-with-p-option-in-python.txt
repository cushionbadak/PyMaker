I want to run mkdir command as:What's the method to do that in Python?
You can try this:
Something like this:UPD: as it is said in a comments you need to check for exception for thread safety
According to the documentation, you can now use this since python 3.2and it will not throw an error when the directory exists.
You can do path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) if you're using pathlib.parents=True creates any parent directories you need and exist_ok=True tells mkdir() to not error if the directory already exists. See the pathlib.Path.mkdir docs.
how about this os.system('mkdir -p %s' % directory_name )
