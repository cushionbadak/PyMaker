I am trying to create a hashing function with user interaction.The idea is that the user chooses which hash he/she wants (i.e. md5, sha1 and so forth) and the program does the rest. My code:finalHash is from a dictionary containing (lets say md5 is chosen) '.md5()' so the string from hashstring is 'hashlib.md5().I get the error: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'update', the error points me to the obvious: hashstring is a string (as i declared it), my question goes: How do i convert or in other way make it useable as it is intended?
You could use getattr:Note that the input must not contain dots or parentheses. If you want to allow the user to input md5() or so, you'll have to strip the parentheses first.
