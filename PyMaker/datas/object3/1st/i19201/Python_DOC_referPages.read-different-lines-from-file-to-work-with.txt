So, I have file like this:The name is obvious, below the name there is X lines with the ID and a VALUE in each line (there are blank lines too). I need to write out to a file every name, and the biggest VALUE's ID, like this:If there was only one name, I could do it simply, but with X names in it, I have no clue :(Any ideas or help?
got some spare time, so here is the code to create your dictionary. I'll let you as an exercise to understand each line :)
I think first you read every line and check if it beginns with a letter or a number (aka if ist's a name or an ID)* and then you create an element for each name with a list that contains all the IDs. You sort them using a sorting algorithm and after that, you simply write out everything (that should be no problem)*You also have to check for empty lines
