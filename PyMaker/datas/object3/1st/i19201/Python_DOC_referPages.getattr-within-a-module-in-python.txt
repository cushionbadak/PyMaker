I am working with python. I want to know whether or not any method is existed or not in same module. I think getattr() does this but I couldn't do. Here is sample code saying what really I want to do with.My main task is to dynamically call defined method. If it is not defined, just skip operations with that method and continue. I have a dictionary of data from which on the basis of keys I define some necessary methods to operate on corresponding values. for e.g. data is  {"name":"my_name","address":"my_address","...":"..."}. Now I define a method called name() which I wanted to know dynamically it really exists or not.
You need to look for the name as a string; and I'd use hasattr() here to test for that name:This works if my_module.exists_method exists, but not if you run this code inside my_module.If exists_method is contained in the current module, you would need to use globals() to test for it:
You can use dir,
