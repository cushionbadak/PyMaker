In Python is there a way to use the shutil.make_archive() function with file compression set to zipfile.ZIP_STORED? (that is, uncompressed)The document shows that there are many optional parameters, but none of them sets the file compression:
No, there is no way to do this with shutil.make_archive.If the lack of a relevant flag in the docs isn't sufficient evidence, you can look at the source.In particular, at line 683 you can see that it explicitly passes compression=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED if your Python has the zipfile module, while the fallback code at line 634 doesn't pass any arguments besides -r and -q to the zip command-line tool.This is meant to be a high-level function that makes trivial cases easier; if you want to do anything zip/tar/gztar/bztar-specific, you can, and should, use the underlying libraries.Of course if you need this frequently, you can write your own make_archive-like wrapper (just copy the relevant code out of shutil and modify your copy).
