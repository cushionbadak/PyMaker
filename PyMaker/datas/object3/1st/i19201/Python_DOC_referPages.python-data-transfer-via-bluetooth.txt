i need to send data computed by python program to my lego mindstorms nxt2.0  robot via bluetooth. how is this possible? what tools do i require?
I have been trying to do the same thing.  There is a information file about the blue tooth communication at the mindstorms web site.  If you are using python 3.3 or newer you can use sockets to communicate.  I still have not gotten this to work.  If you are not using python 3.3 you could use pybluez.
