executor.map()    TypeError: zip argument #2 must support iterationwhen I run it ,just generated TypeError: zip argument #2 must support iteration.can anyone help me fix this problem ?
concurrent.futures.Executor.map is semantically identical to the built-in function map.  The second and subsequent non-keyword arguments specify the iterables to apply the given function to.In your case, you're saying "Here are two iterables: a list of 100 elements (lst100) and the integer 60.  Please call the function str() on each pair of elements a and b coming form the two iterables respectively, and return the list of results."  But since the integer 60 is not actually an iterable object, it fails.Assuming you wanted to specify a timeout of 60 seconds, you need to pass it as a keyword argument like so:Keyword arguments are distinguished from positional arguments by the presence of the name= prefix before the value being passed.  In this case, the argument name is timeout.
