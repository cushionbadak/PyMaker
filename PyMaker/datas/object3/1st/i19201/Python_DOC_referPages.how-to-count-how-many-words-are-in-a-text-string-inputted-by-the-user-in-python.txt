Natural Text
I was wondering if anybody could help; I'm quite new to python.I'm currently creating a tool which analyses the text inputted by a user and shows which feedback to which list that phrase belongs to.So far the programme is on an infinite loop and counts how many expressions have been entered all together and then how many times something has occurred in a certain list.  So my question is this: how does one also get the programme to count how many words are in a sentence inputted by the user?Any help would be much appreciated!
