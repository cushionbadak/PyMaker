I'm working on an AI portion of a guessing game. I want the AI to select a random letter from this list. I'm doing it as a set so I can easily remove letters from the list as they are guessed in the game and are therefore no longer available to be guessed again.it says set object isn't indexable. How can I work around this?

You should use random.choice(tuple(myset)), because it's faster and arguably cleaner looking than random.sample.  I wrote the following to test:From the numbers it seems that random.sample takes 7% longer.
