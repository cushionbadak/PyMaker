This question already has an answer here:Understanding slice notation                    31 answers                I've got a string test_string like 'Hello, two is a number'" and I want to copy the characters between position 7 and 12. In the programming language I use:the value of new_string would be ' two i'. My example might be a bit stupid, but does a function exist in Python equal to string_copy?
This is a built-in feature, thatâ€™s called slicing:orYou seem to have miscounted though, as the result will be 'two i' (without leading space).edit: Or, as Zero Piraeus points out, your language uses 1-based indexing in contrast to pythonSee also https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists
