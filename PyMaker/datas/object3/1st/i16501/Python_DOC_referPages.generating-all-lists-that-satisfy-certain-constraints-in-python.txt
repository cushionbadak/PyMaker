I would like to generate the following lists in Python:There are always two "2"s and three "1"s in any list.My intuition suggests that I will need to use the itertools module to do this. However, I am not sure where to begin, though I have read the documentation and looked at examples. Any suggestions?
You can notice that the number of such lists is equal to the number of ways to place two "2"s in a sequence of length 5. This suggests the following solution:It's easy to see that the answer using permutations is iterating over n! solutions, while my solution iterates over n!/( (n-n2)! * n2!). For example if the input list is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], the solution using permutations is ~90,000,000 times slower (10! * 4!)
You can use itertools.permutations and set (to eliminate duplicates):If the combinations need to be in order, then you can use sorted:
