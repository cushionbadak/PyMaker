I have a script, in which I must download a file, then use the file in the rest of the script. How can I stop a running script until the download is finished, then complete the running using a wait function? 
You can't control downloading with webbrowser.open module?Use urllib.request.urlretrieve instead. It will block until download is done.If you use Pyhton 2.x, use urllib.urlretrieve instead.
