My code is as follows:How do a recieve the value of op1 times 1,000 instead of having it repeated 1,000 times? When I use the float() argument I get 
Simply: commas are not allowed in valid int declarations. Applying this to your entire question:Your code should work fine now.  Here's a little more background on how declaring number's in python works.
The error you posted indicates that you've somehow got a bad value in your box variable from user input, but the actual problem in your code is that you're creating tuples, not large numbers.You're attempting to use "," as a thousands separator. This is not allowed in numeric literals in Python. Instead, what the parser will see is a tuple:If you then want to multiply the result by 1000, you must still omit the commas:...or you'll just end up with the result above, inside a tuple with a 0 as the second element. This second problem is the same, although it's trickier to look at if you're not familiar with how tuples and precedence work in Python. Let's say we've fixed the first line, so that op1 is indeed a float (let's say 2.0) instead of a tuple. Then the interpreter encounters this line:This is equivalent to:Which results in:Once you've fixed the syntax problems, you might want to represent that nasty literal up there in a more recognizable form, to clean up your code:...or even better, put it in a variable so you can use it elsewhere and know what the heck is going on:
