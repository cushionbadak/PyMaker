I want to read data from a .yuv file using python. These data are uint8 integers. I use such command:I will get 100 bytes data as a string. I know I can use ord() to transfer 1 byte str to 1 integer one time. How can I read or transfer it to 100 integers in an array one time? 
Use struct.unpack:
You can use list comprehension to convert it all:
You might want to use numpy, as well.This can be said easier (and may be more efficient memorywise):Of course, with 100 or 1000 integers it does not matter, the struct solution is an excellent one and does not require any extrenal modules. But if you are into reading larger amounts of data, and you want to do some maths with them, numpy.array is a very useful data type. numpy arrays can be used with up to gigabytes of data with reasonable performance. If you have large files, you might consider using numpy.memmap. It has the benefit that it does not really load the array into memory at all. It is great for random access, as the array is loaded only when required. For sequential access it is not that great, as the operating system optimizes sequential accesses with read-ahead cahces and other techniques. For random access or access of only a small bit of an array it is hard to beat with large arrays.
