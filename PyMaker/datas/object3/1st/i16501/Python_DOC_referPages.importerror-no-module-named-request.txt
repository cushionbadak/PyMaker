The SpeechRecognition library requires Python 3.3 or up:Requirements[...]The first software requirement is Python 3.3 or better. This is required to use the library.and from the Trove classifiers:Programming Language :: Python  Programming Language :: Python :: 3  Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3  Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4  The urllib.request module is part of the Python 3 standard library; in Python 2 you'd use urllib2 here.
You can do that using Python 2.Remove requestMake that line: from urllib2 import urlopenYou cannot have request in Python 2, you need to have Python 3 or above.
