I'm working with someone else's Python code which imports a number of modules dynamically:Obviously the presence of the comment at the end is bit worrying, but having done some reading of other SO questions I think I'm starting to understand. It successfully imports a number of other modules, but falls over with one specific file:This gives the following output:As far as I can tell it's definitely that line that's giving the problem; if I change ['a'] to [] then I get an AttributeError instead.The start of the module I'm trying to import looks identical (syntactically) to the others which do import successfully:I'd be grateful for any suggestions anyone may have about why it isn't working. Should I be focussing on the misbehaving module itself rather than the __import__ statement (since that works for everything else)? Even just a hint at an answer would be good! I'm not sure if it's something weird, my unfamiliarity with Python, or just one of those can't-see-the-wood-for-the-trees days! Thanks.
Looking at the docs for __import__, it says that the sub-module is only returned if fromlist is not empty -- so I'm going to guess that whoever wrote that was trying to get http or whatever into mod, and not outputs, and fromlist did the trick although the reason why was unknown.The only other thing I can offer is that it is possible to replace __import__ with one's own function, and perhaps that is what the PP* did?* PP = Previous Programmer
Thanks everyone. Having worked out how to get a full traceback, it clearly shows that the problem lies with the module which I'm trying to load, and is nothing to do with any of the code above. Apologies for posting such an, on reflection, elementary question, but also thank you for steering me directly to a solution!
