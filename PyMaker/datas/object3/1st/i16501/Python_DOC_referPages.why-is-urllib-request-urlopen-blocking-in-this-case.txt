In the following code, the line print("finished POST", response) is never reached, while I can observe in the server logs that the request arrived successfully. The line print("created POST request", request) is reached however. Why is this the case?
The code makes thread daemon threads.According to threading documentation:A thread can be flagged as a “daemon thread”. The significance of this  flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads  are left. The initial value is inherited from the creating thread. The  flag can be set through the daemon property or the daemon constructor  argument.The program maybe end before the response is returned from the server.Instead of using daemon thread, use non-daemon thread, or explicitly wait the threads to finish started using Thread.join.
