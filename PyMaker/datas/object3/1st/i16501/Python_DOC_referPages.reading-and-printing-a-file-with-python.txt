Natural Text
I am very very new to python and will be using it to analyze data for astronomy research. To try my first code I wanted simply read and print a data table (a text file) that I already had in my directory. I continue getting a "No such file or directory" message, even when I give the direct path to the file.Also, when I try to use the file path in the print command it returns a syntax errorI'm using Linux, Emacs, and SDSS & GALEX data.I would love some suggestions and examples of simple codes like this along with explanations to why I am getting these error messages. Also when do I need to specify that is is a text file?Thank you so much.
