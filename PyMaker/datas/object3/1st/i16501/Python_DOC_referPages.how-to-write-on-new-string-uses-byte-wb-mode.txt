Natural Text
I'm working in 'wb' mode with array of bytesafter I have to write data to a file on new line, for example '\n' in 'w' modeHow can I do this?
To write a string to a binary file you, like "\n" into wb mode, you must first encode it by calling string.encode('utf-8') or any other encoding you need.For example, to write a message to a binary file:This would write 0\n\n. To write the numbers from 0 to 3, followed by blank lines:Encoded newlines are printed as newlines correctly, so the following lines are equivalent:To print a literal \n, and not a newline, escape the backslash with another backslash \\n or write r'\n' to create a "raw" string.
I think you need to write a newline bytestring to your file after each of your bytearrays:Note that a more natural (Pythonic) way of writing your loop is to iterate directly over mas, rather than iterating on a range and then indexing. You can also combine the two write calls into one:
