I have a data which has been generated dynamically. The output of the data looks like this and it is of dictionary type.I need to access these data and insert it into the database dynamically.How to get this into a structure which can be used to insertion operation?I am not sure of how to proceed after this. can someone suggest me a possible way of insertion into a database.I want the structure to look like this:
If you wanted to output a list of dictionaries, one for each 'column' in the values, you can use zip() to transform the values into grouped columns:Demo:If you really wanted to output interleaved sets of keys, then values, you can do:which results in:Note that I used a list here, not an (outer) set, as that'd not allow for multiple {'date', 'id', 'status'} sets; values in a set are unique, after all.
to some extend to update mysql  below format may be sufficient
