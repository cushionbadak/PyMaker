I have following string and I want to convert it to array/list so I can measure its length.The expected length for a should be 1 and the expected length for b should be 3.
a is a string, b is a tuple. You can try something like this:Although what you're doing is really weird and you should probably rethink your approach.
You can use something like this:In the above code, the conditional expression uses isinstance to test whether or not item is a string object.  It returns 1 if so and len(item) if not.Note that in Python 2.x, you should use isinstance(item, basestring) in order to handle both unicode and str objects.
There's a crude way to do this: check which is a string and which a tuple:Since a tuple object doesn't have an attribute find, it will raise an exception.
To measure the length of the string:for the tuple:combine the previous answers to test for tuple or list and you would get what you want, or use:
