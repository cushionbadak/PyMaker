Keeping in mind that they're running on the same computer, it's best to use sockets to create a server on the Python side, and a client on the processing side, and send your data from the client to the server that way. The Python server will sit and wait for a connection from the Processing client, and make use of the data once it's received.You can find examples and such all over the web, but here are the examples given by the Proccessing and Python docs:Processing client:Python server:
