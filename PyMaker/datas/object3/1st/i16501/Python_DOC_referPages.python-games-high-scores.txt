hi I have made a game in python were you need to input the specified number before the time runs out. I want to be able to save the top 5 high scores and display them at the end. i have surfed the web looking for solutions but being a amateur at python, I just cant tailor them to my coding. I want to save the name and the score preferably on one line using \t to separate them.any answers would be much appreciated. the game:
Run this and see if it gives what you have in mind: This runs simulates playing the game n number of times. Then the highest scores is printed out as a list of all scores. Right here I have used y = 5, if you need 5 highest scores, I presume you need to play the game at least 5 times then the scores compared and the highest values printed as your highest scores: in the for loop. The highest_scores is then sorted to pick out the n highest scores you require. That said, you should review your logic it seems to be problematic. vote the answer if it helps. Cheers
