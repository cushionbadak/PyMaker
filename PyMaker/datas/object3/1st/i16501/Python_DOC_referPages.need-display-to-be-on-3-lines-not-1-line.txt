Natural Text
My desired outcome is to have a python window with two buttons "Show Info" "Quit" next to each other and have the "Show Info" button display my name and address on 3 separate linesand then stop the program when "Quit" is clicked. I'm almost there - the text is all coming on one line though.thanks in advance.
The line breaks where you have defined your 3 lines don't do what you think ... Python will smash those strings together as if there was no return there at all (which is what you are seeing).  Instead, try putting this there:
It may seem simple, but for such few lines, the most elegant solution is to just end each one with a newline character (\n):If you have many lines though (such as a paragraph), you can use a multi-line string:
Just need to add some newline-characters (\n) to your infotext. Just writing it over multiple lines doesn't make it a multi-line text.
Add \n in your text
