How to just list all discovered tests?I found this command:But it's not exactly what I want, because the above command executes tests. I mean let's have a project with a lot of tests. Execution time is a few minutes. This force me to wait until tests are finished.What I want is something like this (above command's output)or even better, something more like this (after editing above):but without execution, only printing tests "paths" for copy&paste purpose.
Command line command discover is implemented using unittest.TestLoader. Here's the somewhat elegant solutionRunning example:This works because TestLoader.discover  returns TestSuite objects, that implement __iter__ method and therefore are iterable.
You could do something like:I'm not sure if there is an exposed method for this via unittest.main.
