Natural Text
I have a self defined class, say, Man, (class names etc arbitrary throughout) and a list of these objects men. My goal is to search this list for any object whose age attribute is a certain number, and perform an operation on this object. If no such entry exists, I'd like to make one. Now, I know I can do this:but use of year_found to keep a place in the array seems clunky. Does anyone know of a better data structure than a list of classes, or a more pythonic way to approach this?
You can try using next():
You probably want to use sets for this.
