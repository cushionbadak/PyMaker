How would I get the methods of an instance of a class, but not those of its superclass?Example:I want a way to get b and c from d, but not a. I tried using dir(d), but that lists a, b and c, not just b and c.
Use vars() on the class itself, through the .__class__ attribute:or use type() to retrieve the class:This gives you a dictionary (specifically, a mappingproxy), you can always just get the names by calling list() on it:
