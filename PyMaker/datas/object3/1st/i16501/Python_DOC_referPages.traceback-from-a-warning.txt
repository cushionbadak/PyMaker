Natural Text
I have a code which, at some point shows a warning, I think that it is having a problem calculating a mean()I would like to know if there is any way to force python to tell me where, or which line, or whatever more information than just this message:I do not know if it is possible to "catch" a warning.....If I have any error, usually I am using traceback package:import tracebackAnd then I usually do:
You can turn warnings into exceptions:Now instead of printing a warning, an exception will be raised, giving you a traceback.You can get the same effect with the -W command line switch:or by setting the PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable:You can play with the other warnings.simplefilter() arguments to be more specific about what warning should raise an exception. You could filter on warnings.RuntimeWarning and a line number, for example.
