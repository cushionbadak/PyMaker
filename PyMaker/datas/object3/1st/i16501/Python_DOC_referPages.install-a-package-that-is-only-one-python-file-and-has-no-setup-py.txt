How can i install a python package that does not have a setup.py file to call. I want to install a package that it happens to be only a .py. Do i just save it as a .py and put it somewhere in the directory and then import it?For example the zipfile package and the ElementTree XML parserP.S.: I have Python-3.x
Edit: As said in the comments, these packages come with Python 3 so you should not install them manually (and certainly not the 2.7 versions). I let my answer bellow for people wanting to install custom package.On a python interpreter, if you run:You will see a list of folder where your python executable search for module. You can put your file either in the site-packages folder or the lib folder.
Just put the file somewhere in PYTHONPATH.
