I have seen many examples of http servers written in python on the internet and they all includeCan anyone explain this line to me? Thanks
sys.argv is a list of strings containing the arguments that were passed into a Python script from the commandline.  sys.argv[0] is the name of the script and it is always passed in implicitly.  The arguments passed in by the user will be stored in sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], etc.With this in mind, the code can be explained as follows:
sys.argv is a list containing the command line arguments: if you start the program like this: ./foo one two 3, the list will contain the values ['./foo', 'one', 'two', '3']mylist[a:] is a part of the list mylist starting at index a up to the last elementif list is true if the list is not emptyall in all: port is set to 8000 if it's not specified as the first command line argument
At a guess, this code is setting the post used to communicate with whatever computer made the request. 8000 is the default TCP port, so that's what it will use if no port was specified.
