I want to use isinstance built-in function to judge the type of open(file).How to do that?Thanks! :D
In Python 2.x, all file objects are of type file:In Python 3.x however, normal file objects are of type io.TextIOWrapper:
As stated in the documentation for open:Open a file, returning an object of the file type described in section File Objects.Thus, open returns a file, and you should use isinstance(foo, file)
Its type is file.  You can tell by the output of type(open("file","w"))
