I am trying to use the multiprocessing packages for python. However, when I try to define a pool in IDLE it silently crashes (no error message or traceback, IDLE just closes). On the other hand, this same script has no problem running when executed from the terminal. What gives? I am using python 2.7 on Ubuntu 12.04.
The problem is your code: it is missing the if __name__ == '__main__': guard clause that is an essential part of every working example in the multiprocessing doc chapter, as it keeps each subprocess from running the start and finish code.  Running the following in Idle (or without Idle, in a console)almost immediately printsIf you run your original code in a console (or with Idle started in the console), you will see an endless stream of error messages as each process starts up more processes.Edit: the above behavior is on Windows 10I suggest you ignore opinions and decide for yourself what tools you want to use, based on current and real facts.  Try to use the latest bugfix release of whatever Python version you use.  For Idle in particular, there have been many fixes in the last 2 years after a couple of years or so of stagnation.
