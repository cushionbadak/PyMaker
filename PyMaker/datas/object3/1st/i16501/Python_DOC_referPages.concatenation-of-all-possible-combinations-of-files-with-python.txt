I'll preface this by admitting I'm very new to Python.  I have a directory of files that I would like to see all the possible combinations.  I've located a script that can concatenate one set list of files but I would like to see all the possible combinations of these files have them concatenated and save them as a jpg.  To make things more complicated I have two specific files that I always want at the beginning of all combinations and one specific file that I always want at the end.  Slapping some code I found from a similar question together I've come up with the below which obviously isn't going to to cut it.EDIT:  I realized I may not have articulated the question well enough I would like to combine the contents of the file per below:Combine:File1.txt ContentsFile2.txt ContentsFile3.txt ContentsOutput Result:CombinationFile.jpg And then again with the files in different order until all possible combinations have been run.
If you mean permutation saying combination:result
