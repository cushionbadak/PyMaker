Python allows the multiplication of strings by integers:How is this implemented in CPython? I would particularly appreciate a pointer to the source code; the Mercurial repository is a labyrinth beyond my abilities to navigate.
Note: I'm going to answer for Python 3, where the string type is called PyUnicode. Python 2 is similar.When a BINARY_MULTIPLY opcode is executed (in Python/ceval.c), there are two possible slots that can get called: PyNumberMethods.nb_multiply and PySequenceMethods.sq_repeat. (This is in PyNumber_Multiply, in Objects/abstract.c):PyUnicode implements the latter, in unicode_repeat:
For Python 3.x, the implementation can be found in Objects/unicodeobject.c.  Specifically, it begins on line 12175 where unicode_repeat is defined:Later, on line 13703, this function is supplied as the sq_repeat slot for the PySequenceMethods of the PyUnicode object.
