I have the following code:I was wondering how many times does Python sort the list using the sorted() method? Is it for each iteration or just once?In other words is the following code more efficient?
In both code examples, the list is sorted only once.  The expression on the right of the in operator in a for-loop header is evaluated just once, before looping commences. You can read about this in the documentation:The expression list is evaluated once; it should yield an iterable  object.In fact, the second code example is less efficient because there is an unnecessary assignment.
