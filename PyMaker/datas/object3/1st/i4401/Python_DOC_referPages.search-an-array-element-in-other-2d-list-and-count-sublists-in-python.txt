I'm new in python,I have a list like : A=['a','b','c']and a list like B=[['a','c'],['a','c'],['b','b']]i want to have a list like C=[2,1,2]C stores occurrence of sublists that each element of A comes in Bthat means 'a' is in 2 sublists'b' is in 1 sublistand 'c' is in 2 sublists,how can I achieve this?thanks
You can loop over b and update a collections.Counter for each sublist, using set to remove duplicates:
You can use sum:Output:
You can loop and compare in both lists
You can try dict approach :output:
You can use a list comprehension with sum to construct C.This has the same effect as using nested for loops:
Here is a solution with collections.defaultdict.Performance noteThis may not matter, but the performance differential is interesting as it shows clearly the Counter overhead (4x slower).
