This is my first question on here, so I hope I am asking the 'right' way. The code below is supposed to generate a class object, which should be named via the function createAccount() at the end. I was expecting the account to be a combination of surname and dob, however it creates the class object called accountName and not the product of the variable itself. I can see why it is doing this, but i cannot see how to correct it.
I think what you want is something like a "name" field in your Account object.  For example:The object returned by createAccount contains both the account balance and the name on the account.
You are creating a variable accountName and assigning to it a text string object whose contents is the name and date of birth.Next you're clobbering that and reassigning accountName with a new Account object you're creating.  The old value for accountName gets lost when you assign something new to it.What you need to do is pass name+dob to Account's init function, and in that function, assign the passed account name to an object variable such as self.accountName:Note that it's a bad idea to use name+dob as the account name, because later it'll be hard to figure out where the name ends and the date of birth begins.  But at least, this will get you started.
