I have a problem because I need to download a file using python but I cannot use the libraries urllib, urllib2 and urllib3 neither requestIf someone can help me I thanks him a lot
you can use subprocess module and curl command
You need to do wget in terminal to get the package. Why can't you use these!? (I can't ugh comment)Try using requests to get the data of the file and write it a path if you can't use urllib's package.To download files with requests use this example from hereHere's the aiohttp example for async functions: I recommend using aiohttp if you don't can't use requests.
Thanks to all, finally I could solve my problemI give you the solution that I usedI used the second print for obtaining all the data, because with the first I only get a 200 OK
