I have a string pizzas and when comparing it to pizza - it is not the same. How can you make a program that counts common letters (in order) between two words, and if it's a 60% match then a variable match is True?For e.g. pizz and pizzas have 4 out of 6 letters in common, which is a 66% match, which means match must be True, but zzip and pizzasdo not have any letters in order in common, thus match is False
You can write a function to implement this logic.zip is used to loop through the 2 strings simultaneously.
Optimised algorithm using dynamic programming:This will directly return the length of LCS.
