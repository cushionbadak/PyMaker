Defining your variables inside your class like this will make all instances of your class share these variables, which can lead to funky situations (especially for mutable objects). (refer to Python documentation) What you most likely want to do is to use this:
Not really sure if you are familiar with class vs instance methods, but try this:Given what it looks like you are doing (creating random Player stats), this would be more approriate if done per Player instance under the __init__ call upon instantiation. Read this SO for more information on the difference between the two methods.Edit: To illustrate point in comments...This is the problem you will encounter with your method (my above example only resolves your scoping issue, not your implementation one)To do what comments appear you want to:
Since you already pass the self argument in  your function definition, you should refer to these variables in the appropriate namespace:instead of
