Natural Text
I am trying to print only the lines with the specific string I need.I did this but I can't figure out what's wrong:
You open a file with open(..), you can then iterate over the file handler (iterating over a file handler will iterate over the file in a line-by-line fashion):By default the mode in which you open the file is 'r', so you read the file (you can not write to it), and you read it as text (not binary).Note that the path of the file is relative from the current directory (that can be the directory of the python file, but sometimes it is not).
You can open the file using open and use the readlines method for iterating line by lineYou can also use context manager that is with keyword that guarantees to close stream after you done, example already demonstrated by Willem Van Onsem
iterates over lines in file without removing line endings (usually the line return) so:will print the line and an empty line so it's better to write:to avoid extra line returns.
Use open('catastrofa.txt') instead of file('catastrofa.txt')like this:
