Using Python 2.7Existing list: Columns and same hostname multiple entries:  xlistNew list: zlistIn 1st list there are multiple entries for the same host with a different last_checkin date and/or id. For the new list I am trying add to the list when hostname does not already exist. But the new list seems to be an exact copy of the first list. It is like it is not checking for only the hostname in the new list. I do not care about the last_checkin date or id for either entry.How does it validate the entry if I am only checking the name of the host?i.e.:So when it looks for the hostname in zlist is it also validating the other columns and sees it is different based on the whole row?Hopefully this is not clear as mud.My goal is to have a list with no duplicate hostname entries regardless of id or last_checkin.
The problem is that zhostname is just a string so when you compare it to the Index objects using zhostname not in zlist the string zhostname will never match the Index's in zlist.I recommend using a dictionary using the name of the host as the keys.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
