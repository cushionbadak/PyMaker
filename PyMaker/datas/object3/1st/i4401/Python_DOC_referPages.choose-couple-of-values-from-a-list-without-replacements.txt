I search the fastest way to draw many couple of two values from a list so those two values are always different in the couple. The naive method I coded is very slow, so I'm pretty sure that they are more efficient way to do that.
My suggestion is to use itertools.permutations to cache all combinations in a list before drawing pairs from it with random.choice:By testing your solution with IPython, it takes an average of 489 ms:My suggestion is more than 25x faster:Note that for permutations, (x, y) is different than (y, x):If in your case (x, y) and (y, x) are the same information, then use itertools.combinations:Just one more thing: the major problem with your solution is the data[i] = operation, which is quite costly. Instead of creating an empty array and modifying it with the selected couples, simply creating a new array from a list comprehension can greatly speed up the solution:Look how faster it is:
This should be fast enough for most applications, see timings below:Timings compared with itertools solution:
You could use method combinations from itertools.The difference with Matheus Portela's answer is that combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order, so ['A','B'] will yield ['AB'], wherease perumation would yield ['AB', 'BA']
