Natural Text
In the below code, I am trying to take the path name (inclusive of file name) and converting them to another path name with text file.Now I would like to pass both variable as argument for another py which will take it as argumentBut individual command for pdf2txt.py works very well.
since thisdir[i] is not converted to its value during execution, so the error No such file or directoryReplace os.system('py pdf2txt.py -o text_path thisdir[i]')withos.system("python ./pdf2txt.py -o {0} {1}".format(text_path,thisdir[i])) 
Two Solutions:1)You can directly import and call the main method with paramsor2) Form a string and pass it as a command
Use SubProcess moduleNow, stdin, stdout, and stderr can also be redirected.
