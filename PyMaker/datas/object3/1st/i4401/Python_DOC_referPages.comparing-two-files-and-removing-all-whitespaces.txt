Is there a more elegant way of comparing these two files?Right now I am getting the following error message: syntax error near unexpected token (... diff <( tr -d ' '.Python seems to read "\n" as a literal character.
The constructs you are using are interpreted by bash and do not form a standalone statement that you can pass to system() or exec().<( ${CMD} )< ${FILE}${CMD1} | ${CMD2}As such, you will need to wire-up the redirection and pipelines yourself, or call on bash to interpret the line for you (as @wizzwizz4 suggests).A better solution would be to use something like difflib that will perform this internally to your process rather than calling on system() / fork() / exec().Using difflib.unified_diff will give you a similar result:
This will fail when you fix the syntax error because you are attempting to use bash syntax in what is implemented as a C system call.If you wish to do this in this way, either write a shell script or use the following:This is not an elegant solution, however, since it is relying on the GNU coreutils and bash. A more elegant solution would be pure Python. You could do this with the difflib module and the re module.
