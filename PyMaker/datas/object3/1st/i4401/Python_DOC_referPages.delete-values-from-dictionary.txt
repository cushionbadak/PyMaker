Doing a web scrapping project, and tangled myself into a problem.I have this "data" dictionary with duplicates.In the data dictionary:I have unique keys, I would like to remove all values of a particular key wherein the value "the first part of the string" before "," is same and keep the last value. For example:As 'Peter Rabbit (2018)' key has one values we will skip it. Now, Tomb Raider (2018) has 3 values, I need to split based on "," for the first value of each value, I will get Studio Movie Grill - DowneyAMC Norwalk 20AMC Norwalk 20I would like to remove 1 to n instance of duplicate entries and keep Nth valueThe final output will be My questions are: 1) What is the best-known method to achieve this output?2) Should I split the values based on "," or "\n"?3) Does python dictionary has any functions I can utilize?Any assistance will be apreciated.
I'd just advise to declare multiple values for a key like this:Then you can simply iterate over the corresponding keys' values and filter them appropriately.Also, take a look at Python3 docs:Dictionaries,Mapping types - dict
