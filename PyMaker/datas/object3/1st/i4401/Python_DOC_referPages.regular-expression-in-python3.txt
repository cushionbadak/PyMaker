How can I search a string with pattern "12 Apr 2018" in Python and convert it into a date object in python.
If its in the format like "12 Apr 2018" then you might be better off using strptime(). You might need to use regex though if its surrounded by other page content.Which will give you back a datetime object like below
You can useDemoIt's based on you regex with some slight changes. I've replaced beginning/end of the line marks (^$)with word boundaries \b. I've added spaces (\s+) between date parts and I allowed zero in the day and year.When you have it, you can use strptime, as Sam Collins suggested.
Assuming that the date is always in the format "(numerical day) (3-letter abbreviated month) (4-digit year)", the regex you want is [0-9]{1,2}(?#any one digit or any two consecutive digits) [a-zA-Z]{3}(?#three letters) [0-9]{4}(?#four digits)The comments (the (?#...) bits) can, obviously, be omitted.I'd also suggest using the findall (or finditer), rather than the search, function of the compiled regular expression object.To turn the result(s) into a Python date object, I'd suggest Sam's answer - time.strptime(result, "%d %b %Y") - where 'result' stores the matched str.Alternatively, for the regex, if you want it to be even more specific (though it might still catch invalid dates, like February 30), you could use ([0-2][0-9]|3[01]) (Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)(?#maybe make this bit case-insensitive, if you want) [0-9]{4}
