The importlib.import_module with relative module name can fail sometime.For example, I have a package structure like this:Test code like this:In Python3.5 it will fail the first test:In python3.6 it works:Is this expected or a bug?Update:    Python2.7.12 has the same behavior as 3.6.
The docs say:importlib.import_module(name, package=None)...Changed in version 3.3: Parent packages are automatically imported.Therefore, the 3.6.4 behaviour is correct and the 3.5.2 behaviour is buggy.  You seem to be hitting #30876, and the issue says that was fixed in the version 5 micro i.e. v3.5.5.Credit to vaultah in room 6 for finding the ticket.
