Input will be :Result would be :The goal is given [x1...xN, [y1...yN], [z1...zN]] to return a list where the values are [x1 + y1 + z1, ..., xN + yN + zN]
You can group your data by element type:Output:
Per user comment:So the inline comments can be helpful, but a quick breakdown and links may do you some good:isinstance checks if the element in A is a list object or not (since you have lists within lists)map does what its name implies, it "maps" a function (float) to each list element within Alist is used to convert the result from map() to a list object that shows with the [ ]zip simultaenously iterates over multiple iterables so we can call sum() on the iteratorlist comprehension is a fast way to make a list; this is the [i for i in x] syntax
