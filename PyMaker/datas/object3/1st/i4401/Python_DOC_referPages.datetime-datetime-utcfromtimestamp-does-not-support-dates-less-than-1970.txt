I'm trying to to build a program that should process a data which was acquired since 1830. I made a reference date datetime(1970, 1, 1) to compute the timedelta.The timedelta works good and I get some negative numbers which is normal. The problem occurs when I want to reconvert the dates to plot data in a proper way using datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). So  here "t" is negative. Looking for this on internet I found that it's a Python bug or limitation under Windows. I have the 3.5 version and windows 10. I found nothing which can be helpful. So if you know a solution to that or an alternative way using panda library I will be very thankful.The error it returns to me is : OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument
This seems indeed to be a bug on your machine. On my machine (Python 3.6.3 in Ubuntu 17.10) negative numbers work correctly as UTC time-stamp.As a workaround you can try datetime.datetime.toordinal and datetime.datetime.fromordinal. The ordinals start on January 1, 0001 and should therefore be able to cover your date range using only positive numbers:
