Natural Text
I have written a script that reads from excel workbooks and writes new workbooks.Each row is a separate object, and one of the columns is a date.I have written the date as a NamedStyle using datetime to get what I think is the correct format:The problem is that i need to import this excel workbook to an ancient database who for some reason dont accept a date-formating, only text like this "yyyy-dd-mm".I'm having trouble rewriting these cells as text.I have tried using the =TEXT formula, but that wont work since you cant use the cell itself to calculate the result unless i duplicate the column for referencing in the formula:I need to do this a bunch of places in a couple of scripts, so I'm wondering if there is a simpler way to do this? PS. I'm just a archaeologist trying to automate some tasks in my workday by dabbling in some simple code, please go easy on me if I seem a bit slow.
Most likely, it won't be enough to change the format of your date - you'll have to store the date as a string instead of a datetime object.Loop over the column and format the dates with datetime.strftime:
