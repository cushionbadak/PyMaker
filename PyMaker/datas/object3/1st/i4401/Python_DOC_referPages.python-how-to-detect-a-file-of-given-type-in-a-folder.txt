I want to use Python to move .xlsx files if they are in a certain folder.Is there a generic rule for this? What I am looking for is basically code for this:if there is a file that is an excel document in /user/documents/folder:   move it to trash.I'm happy with the shutil.move bit but what can I use to classify .xlsx files as a group?
Thank you for your help everyone. This turned out to be the easiest way of doing thisI can then add a shutil.move function with ""if item.endswith('xlsx') == True""to move the file elsewhere. Thanks for the support I.Renk and others :)
