Natural Text
So I want to write a program that writes 10 random numbers into a text file: I got a syntax error in the "%(y)". But I have no idea what causes it.
The problem is that % is an operator that is used between strings, see the documentation. This should work:Also, range(0, SIZE, 1) can be replaced by range(SIZE), see the documentation.You can use the syntax with open("data.txt", "w+") as f that is preferred according to the documentation.Also, I'm not sure about what you are doing, isn't the correct code:Also, be aware that write doesn't put any newline, maybe you want to write "Results: %d\n" instead.
This should solve your problem. Main problem here is % sign used improperly, I also suggest some code edits that is opening file using with statement ensures it closes every time so this is a best practice.
