This is happening because the backslashes in your file path string our being treated as special characters. To fix this issue you need to let python know they are part of the path you can do this by converting the string into a raw string by putting a r before the start of the string or by escaping the backslashes by putting another backslash before them so all backslashes become double backslashes.
