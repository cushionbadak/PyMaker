I am currently working on a program for my robotics team the prints out a team key(a string) and a value that ranks how good it is. So the current output I have is a dictionary with the team key as the key and the value as the value. However the dictionary is not sorted. I have read that you can change it to a list of tuples which I have tried and worked, but I have just 1 issue. Currently the team key has 'frc' in front of the team number, and I remove it by doing [3:]. However when I do the same for the list of tuples, it doesn't work. So I was wondering if there was a way to sort the dictionary by its values without changing it to a list of tuples?
You could add items to an ordered dict after sorting: https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDictBut if you wanted to use a tuple, changing a value in one won't work as they're immutable. However, you could slice before creating it.(An extension of the top answer here: Python 3 sort a dict by its values)s = [(k[3:], d[k]) for k in sorted(d, key=d.get, reverse=True)]
Output: This should work, if I undestand your problem correctly :)lambda functions are quite magical
