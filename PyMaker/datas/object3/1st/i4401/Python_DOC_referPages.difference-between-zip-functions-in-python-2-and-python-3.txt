This question already has an answer here:Getting a map() to return a list in Python 3.x                    9 answers                I was wondering what the difference is between the zip() function in python 2 and python 3 is. I noticed when using the timeit module on both functions that the python 3 function was a lot faster. Thanks so much in advance :)
Difference between Python 2 and Python 3 is Python 3 returns an iterators. Idea of this saving memory.
In Python 3, the zip() function returns an iterator, meaning that you can only exhaust elements once, whereas Python 2 returns an iterable itself.see here:Python 2 Doc, Python 3 Doc
