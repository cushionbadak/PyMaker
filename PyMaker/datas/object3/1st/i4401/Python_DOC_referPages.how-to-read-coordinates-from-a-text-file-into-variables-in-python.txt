Natural Text
So as part of my program, I have a button making subroutine that takes in several parameters in order to place it, colour it etc...Effectively, what I want to be able to do is have a text file with a set of x and y coordinates on each line to create a button. 10 unique lines in the text document would mean 10 buttons could be made.If I layed out the text document like this...300, 200300, 210300, 220310, 200310, 210310, 220 for example...How could I read through each line, place the first value into an "x" variable and the second value into a "y" variable so that they can both be used in the button creation subroutine, and then move onto the next line, until all lines in the file have been read and all buttons been made?Thanks
If you don't want to bother with CSV, you can just read the file straight, and then call the .split() command on each line to get the x and y.And do what you please with x and y. You may want to convert them to ints. 
You can open the csvfile, then for each line, use indexing to put the x and y into the function call:This will create a tile from each row passed in.
