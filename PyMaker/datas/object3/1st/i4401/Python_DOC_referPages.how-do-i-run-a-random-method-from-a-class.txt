For example, how can I randomly use one of the four functions (within the class) listed below?My attempt to do so came with an error. Why did I get this error, and how can I do this?
You can use getattr(), in addition your methods must be declared as staticmethod:
b is still a string. You need to evaluate it into an expression:Note you shouldn't be using eval() on any string that is a user input because it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
First, your methods should either be static or have self as first argument. Once that is fixed, you could use random.choice instead to choose the method out of a list. This has the advantage of not depending on the methods' names.
