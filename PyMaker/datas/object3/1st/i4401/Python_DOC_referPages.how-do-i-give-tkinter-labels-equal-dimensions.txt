The labels are currently side by side which is what I want.  However each label's width is different. Is there a way to make each label have the same width? Also is there a method that allows the labels to the have equal measurements and simultaneously fill all the way up to 250?Here is my current code:
you should try checking tkinter's documentation on pack:check if this is what you are looking for:Fill argument basically fills the parent container.Expand argument will use to additional remaining space.Also be sure to take a look at tkinter weight, here is an example.
You can use key word arguments width, and height with a tk.LabelNotes:tkinter is imported as tk in order to keep the namespace tidy.The tk.Labels are included in a tk.Frame, so once this is built,you do not have to worry about it until you pack the frame in yourGUI.The units for width and height are in "text units" when the labelcontains text.
To make the labels width the same, just add the width option to the labele.g. width=10 this will specifies how much space, in character widths.if you want to apply the same width to multiable labels, store the width value in a variable, lets say label_w = 10so your code might look like this:simultaneously fill all the way up to 250this depend on how many labels you'll create, lets say window_width = 250 and labels_all = 3 then the width option will be width = window_width/labels_allalso, if you don't write a geometry values, the window size will automatically fit to labels.if your window is simple enough, you might consider using the Packer Option expand as in expand=1, also include the fill option if your label has color, fill Legal values: 'x', 'y', 'both', 'none'. for more information, check label-options, packer-options
