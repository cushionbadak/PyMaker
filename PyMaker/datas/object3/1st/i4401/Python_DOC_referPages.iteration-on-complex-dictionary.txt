I have a dictionary like below, as you see I am trying to print key_p which is not in dictionary. I want to check if my key_p exist in dictionary, print the value and when the key_p is not in dictionary print 0.When I put condition elif, it will print two times 0 (= the number of element in the dictionary) but I just want to check only key_p, meaning if the key_p is in the dictionary print 1 if only key_p is not in the dictionary print 0.
Here is an example of how you can do it:
First of all sc_dict is a list, not a dictionary.Judging by your code, I understand your question as follows: out of the dictionaries inside the tuples held by sc_dict, you want to check whether any holds a specific key.Here's one way, using the any builtin function (which returns a boolean, which we convert to an int according to your requirements) and tuple unpacking:Depending on what your actual problem is, it might be beneficial to construct a ChainMap from your dictionaries. The following example introduces the concept and also solves the original question.
