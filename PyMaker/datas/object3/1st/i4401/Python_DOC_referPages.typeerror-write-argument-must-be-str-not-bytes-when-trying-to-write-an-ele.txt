I'm trying to write some XML as a byte string (to wit, a response from the Zillow API) to an XML file using the ElementTree.write method. Here is an example of what I'm trying to do:However, if I run this (in iPython) I get a TypeError:Is what I'm passing in not a "file object opened for writing" as specified in the docs?I've tried following the solution in ElementTree TypeError "write() argument must be str, not bytes" in Python3, but the tostring method appears to no longer be contained in the xml.etree module.
It turns out that the argument to tree.write() should just be the name of the file you want to create:which creates comparables.xml in my current directory.
