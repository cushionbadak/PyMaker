I have a dictionary containing lists of varying lengths and I would like a general algorithm to produce the combinations of all the elements within the lists. A piece of example code is given below:This is the desired output for the particular dictionary 'bob' and it produces the output:However, I would like a general algorithm. Could I use recursion to generalise this so it can handle dictionaries with an arbitrary number of keys, if so how? Extra Info: The values corresponding to the keys will always be 1D lists
The general algorithm is itertools.product:
Use product from itertools, it's very handy:if the order of bob's keys is not relevant, you can simplify this to:
