Natural Text

See image below.Now, I want to call this script from the command line by to call this particular project file and pass in parameters like the text variable to display the text james instead of Test. For example, typing the following command should give me video generated with the text james.blender proj1.blend variable=jamesNote: I am a beginner, and I hope I explained my question clearly.
