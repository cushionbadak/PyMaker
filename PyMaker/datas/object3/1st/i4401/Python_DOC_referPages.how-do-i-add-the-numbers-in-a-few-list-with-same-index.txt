this is what i have for the lists broken from a 2d list:and because they are broken from the same list, I don't know how to add them into a new list.Do I append them into a new list and zip them? But how do I append them(because they are from the same list, if I use index[3], it will only come out with the number in each line(for example, 0 for index[3],line1))This is what I expect:that is , all the numbers with the same index got add together.Please give me some hint. Thank you!
You can use itertools.zip_longest.Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.
welp, it looks from the example that the items that go to the target list do not overlap by their indicies in the source lists- if it is guaranteed you can do something like this:If that guarantee does not exist, then what are the precedence rules?There is probably a more efficient solution with numpy, but this should work.
