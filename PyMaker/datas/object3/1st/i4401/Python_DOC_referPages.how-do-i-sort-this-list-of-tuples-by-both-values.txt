I have a list of tuples: [(2, Operation.SUBSTITUTED), (1, Operation.DELETED), (2, Operation.INSERTED)]I would like to sort this list in 2 ways:First by its 1st value by ascending value, i.e. 1, 2, 3... etcSecond by its 2nd value by reverse alphabetical order, i.e. Operation.SUBSTITITUTED, Operation.INSERTED, Operation, DELETEDSo the above list should be sorted as:[(1, Operation.DELETED), (2, Operation.SUBSTITUTED), (2, Operation.INSERTED)]How do I go about sort this list?
Since sorting is guaranteed to be stable, you can do this in 2 steps:
In this particular case, because the order of comparison can be easily inverted for integers, you can sort in one time using negative value for integer key & reverse:result:negating the integer key cancels the "reverse" aspect, only kept for the second string criterion.
You can use this:
Another way using itemgetter from operator module:
