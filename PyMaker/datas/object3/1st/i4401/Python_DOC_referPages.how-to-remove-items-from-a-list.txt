Here is the code I have so far:Write code in remove() to remove the item in slot pos, shifting the items beyond it to close the gap, and leaving the value None in the last slot. Any ideas on where I should start?
Write code in remove() to remove the item in slot pos, shifting the items beyond it to close the gap, and leaving the value None in the last slot.You can use the pop method of list to remove the item and then append None to the list.
Given a list lst, the pop(i) method removes the item in the i'th index out of lst.Also I noticed in your test, you expect when removing an item, that None is added to the end of the list. This is not the case. None shouldn't be an item in list of strings, and if you remove an item from the list, that item is gone but the rest of the items stay the same and nothing else is added.If you do want to do that, just add lst.append(None) to the last line of remove() function.
Just using basic concepts, we can use a for-loop:and a test:Note that it is clearer to just use the built-in methods as @galfisher and @R Sahu describe.
