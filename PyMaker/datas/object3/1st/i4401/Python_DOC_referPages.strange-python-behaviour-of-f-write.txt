I was writing some python code and I found a strange behaviour in my code.This is the code:It generates the file test1 with lenght 1000000000 (1,0 GB) filled with 0.Is this supposed to happen(if yes, why?) or is a bug?
The bytearray() function creates an array of bytes from a parameter source and the documentation states:If it is an integer, the array will have that size and will be initialized with null bytes.So you are then just writing 1 billion null characters (\x00) to that file!
Initialising a bytearray with a single integer value creates an empty (i.e. filled with zeroes) bytearray of the size specified (as documented here). Your code therefore converts the string "1000000000" into an integer and then creates a bytearray of that size which it writes to disk.There is nothing strange or surprising about this behaviour.
