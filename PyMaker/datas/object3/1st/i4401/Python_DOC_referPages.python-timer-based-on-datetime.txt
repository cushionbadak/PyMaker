This question already has an answer here:Python : Basic countdown timer & function() > int()                    3 answers                I'm trying to program for a simple game. I want the countdown to be printed like 10, 9, 8, ... for seeing how much time is left to collect items. when the timer runs out I want the program to close.This is the error:can sombody correct it or better send me a working timer concept?Thanks
As the error message says, later - now is a datetime.timedelta.  If this were assigned to a variable, say diff_delta, then diff_delta.total_seconds() would give you its value in seconds.
A good way to get time that has passed is by using time.time()In terms of measuring a second, maybe have it pool time time using time.time(), and then have a loop to check when the current time minus that pooled time is greater than 1. That will be one second. Repeat for as many seconds as needed. Edit:Or duh, just use time.sleep() like a comment suggested. time.sleep(1) will sleep for 1 second.
