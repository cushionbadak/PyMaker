I have a piece of code that requires hours to run on long lists : My listCombinaisons_survivor contains all the possible combinations of 6 badges among 57 possibilities ([1,2,3,5,6,7],[1,2,3,5,6,8]...).For each possible combination, I pick in a dictionary the "Effect" matching the badge ID (Badge ID 1 = Damage), and I collect all the effects in the list "effects".I then count how much occurencies of each effect I have, and if I have more than 3 badges with the same effect in a combination, I delete this combination.Is there any way I could optimize this code to make it faster ?I also tried this but this is not faster : I don't want to know how much time it takes, but how to optimize this code.The whole code can be found there : https://github.com/yirkkiller/Python/blob/master/badgesRepartition-NEW.pyThanks !
Apart from the very unclear variable names, your algorithm basically comes down to this:PS. If I look at your complete script, I would recommend you first learn the basics of Python. There are a lot of things that can be done a lot clearer, robuster and simplerI suggest:A whirlwind tour of Python (link)Fluent Python (link)'Looping like a Pro' by David Baumgold
