For example if I have https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask I'd like to cut it to stackoverflow.com/questions/ask or if I have http://www.samsung.com/au/ I'd like to cut it to samsung.com/au/. I want to make a template tag for this but not sure what to return:templateAny idea?
Here is a quick and dirty way to isolate the domain provided it starts with something//
urllib.parse will do most of this for you: Note this does not cut off the "www.", but you shouldn't do that; that can be a critical part of the domain name. If you really want that, add:
For the use cases, you described. You can just split on the double backslash and go with that or work from there.However, because the subdomain (such as 'www') can be used as a significant part of the url, you may want to keep that in. For example, www.pizza.com and pizza.com could be links to different pages.Other things to consider are the urlparse library or regex but they may be overkill for this.
