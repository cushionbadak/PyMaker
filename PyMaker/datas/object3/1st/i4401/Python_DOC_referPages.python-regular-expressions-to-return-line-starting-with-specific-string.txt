Natural Text
i have this file (output.txt)I can get values after Username and domainbut don't know how to get TECH-XXX desired output:Code:I can return only [TECH] but it's incomplete and has brackets
Try
This can be done by splitting the text into items, further splitting to obtain the useful text within each item, followed by some simple conditional formatting:Or using comprehension:Output:
You don't need a Regular Expression for this, you can use the built-in str.split() and then e.g. a List Comprehension  to "bundle" your data:printsTo print that as desired:printsand combined
Finally found why nothing above worked: it's because of  ^M i had in file It's visible only when open it in vim, when open it using cat it's not visible,once removed it with and using @Wiktor Stribi≈ºew code:i got desired results, thanks everyone !!
