I have a string as below , I need to parse it and take the values after / and put into list as belowMy code:  [a[a.index('/')+1:] for a in val[1:-1].split(',')]Output : ['54"', '147"', '187"', '252"', '336"']It has double quotes also " which is wrong.After i tried as belowOutput :Is there any better way to do this?
You can do it in one line using literal_eval:Output:literal_eval() converts your string into a list, and then i.split('/')[-1] grabs what's after the slash.
Yeah ... assuming every value has a / like your example, this is superior:*edited to insert a forgotten bracket
Try using regular expressions!You can do it in a single line this way.Result:['54', '147', '187', '252', '336']re.findall generates a new list called with all the matches of the regexp. Check out the docs on regular expressions for more info on this topic.
You can try json module to convert the string to list
