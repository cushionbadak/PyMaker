I'm trying to scrape all the urls of the posts on this website: http://esencjablog.pl/ I'm new to python and web scraping, mt code works but it produces a lot of duplicates - what I am doing wrong?
Try the below approach. It should no longer produce duplicates. Turn out that your .find_all() method should include post_more class name as well in order for it to work the way you expect.. You can fix this by using .post_more a.qbutton such:Not recommended:However, the better approach would be to use something so that it can watch out as to the newly populated next_page link produces new items or getting stuck in a vortex:Go for this instead:
You are targeting also the a elements on the carousel, they are fixed on each of the pages you visit. You need to narrow the search down. You can either target elements with class qbutton small:Or you can use CSS selectors just like in SIM's answer to specify the class of the parent elements.
Assuming the requirement is to extract all links presented by the button text "Czytaj dalej", following code works.I believe OP is getting the duplicates because he is scraping links from the top slider as well.I have used html.parser instead of lxml because I am more comfortable with it.
