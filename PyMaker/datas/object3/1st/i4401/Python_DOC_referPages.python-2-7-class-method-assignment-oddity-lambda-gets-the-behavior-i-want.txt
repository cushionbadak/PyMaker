I have the following Python 2.7 code:The output is;So, what about the lambda is making the Point2._revert call work?A simpler, standalone, example, requiring no imports:
tuple is a class, that does not require a parameter to be constructed.Calling instance.tuple() returns tuple() which is just an empty tuple.The difference with your anonymous function is that it is a function. When calling a class function from outside of the functional scope using instance.function(), self is automatically passed in as a parameter. Classes don't have this same treatment.What's passed in is ._revert(instance), which calls tuple(instance) which actually reverts your tuple. 
The brief answer is that the lambda implements the method __get__:See the descriptor documentation for what this means, but basically, when the value stored in an attribute has a __get__ method, reading that attribute returns the result of the __get__ method on the value, not the value itself.So, in the code:these are three different things.Since tuple is a type object, it has no __get__ method, the access a.fTuple just returns tuple.
