I received data via TCP socket, it should be "12345678901" as value. I tried also to convert it by int.from_bytes in byteorder ='big' and 'littel',struct.unpack...However it didn't work well.Actual value I got is b'\xd2\x04.\x16\xc5"'( << data == conn.recv(2048))Which kind of way should I use for converting it to integer?EDIT: on Server side(really typical)on Client side(it is came from PLC)I'll put command line.It works, if is only 1234.It doesn't work, in this case 12340001.it doesn't work and structure itself is strange.
Alright, the last comment cleared things up. You encoded that integer in 3 words (2 bytes each). Previously, I did some tests trying to "decode" the value as a 64bit int as 12345678901 (0x2DFDC1C35) doesn't fit in 32 bits, but (obviously) without success.According to [Python]: Format Characters, for words we have the short correspondent (I chose the unsigned version: H):
