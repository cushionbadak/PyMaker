I would like to create a function that returns a function of the product of a list of functions. The list of functions should be of variable length and the functions should have different parameters.E.g.:In the example above this would be something like:This should return a function that can be used as if it was defined as:I would like to use this for iterating over a list of combinations of factors and optimising parameters for these combinations to select the most predictive one in a data science project.
You can do this with some help from the introspection utilities in the inspect module.Specifically, I used inspect.signature to find each function's positional and keyword arguments, and Signature.bind_partial to prevent clashes between positional and keyword arguments. The following is a generic implementation of a function that combines other functions:With this, you can easily define a bunch of functions similar to your product_function:And it correctly passes on only those keyword arguments that each function supports:
