I have a bitmap image and using this page I am attempting to read the file size.  In case the link breaks:FileSize   |   4 bytes  |  File size in bytesHere is part of the bitmap BM\xe6\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x006 I want to read from, which as I understand it the file size is between the 3rd and 7th bytes.  So \xe6\x04\x00\x00.I remove all the \x00 since they are null values and don't tell me anything about the file size, so I used:This returned me: [b'\xe6', b'\x04']Now I get all the values in the list using:Here are the results of the conversion:\xe6 > 230\x04 > 4This returns me 2304 (since '230' + '4' is 2304), while my bitmap image has the size of 1,254 bytes and 4,096 bytes on disk.  Clearly this is not the image size.  Where have I gone wrong?As a side note.  If I take another image of size 90 bytes and run the same process with Z\x00\x00\x00 it returns 90 as I expected.  (ord('Z') returning 90).
From poking around it looks like the byte order for the size in a bitmap is little endian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian).There's a built-in method for int that can convert bytes to a integer.  https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.from_bytesSo for example:
