Sorry if I don't know how to give this a proper title. I just cant explain properly since english is not my first language but i'll give it a try.So this is my code structureit executes this way:get_frame() --> process_frame() --> show_frame() --> get_frame()so it only get frames after processing and showing the frame which takes too much time. What I really want is for the get_frame() to execute again when process_frame() executes, and for the process_frame() to execute again when show_frame() executes, and so onSomething like this:get_frame() --> process_frame()&get_frame() --> show_frame()&process_frame()&get_frame() --> and so on
Ok, since your question lacks a Minimal, Complete and Verifiable example I am going to have to guess on what it is exactly that you want to achieve. However, my hunch is that you are trying to accomplish something along the lines of:Please note though that if you have many frames you want to process their might be far more efficient ways to achieve what you are after. My setup basically just shows a very basic setup that could be used to get, process and show many frames simultaneously. If you want more control over your threads you could take a look at python's queue module.
