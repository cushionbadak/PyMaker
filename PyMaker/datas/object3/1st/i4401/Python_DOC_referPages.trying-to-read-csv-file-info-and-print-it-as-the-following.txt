I have to use csv module to import data from this following information. So I have to get the information from row 2 and make it print as suchI am not sure how you can make it print line by line, and with the numbers on the left side. This is my code that I've tried doing so farMy output right now is the followingI CAN'T use pandas module for this either. It's for an introductory COSC class. :) I also think I am going to have to assign values to that table later  with questions. I don't want to make the question any more confusing, but I think  that's referring to indexing it.
