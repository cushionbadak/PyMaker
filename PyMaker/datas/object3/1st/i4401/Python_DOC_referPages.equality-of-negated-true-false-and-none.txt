When implementing a board game, a board cell can be in one of the three different possible states available: True (cell occupied by first player), False (cell occupied by second player) or None (cell is empty).My question is that:Why does   whereas that it should actually return False? And why does whereas that it should actually return False?Could this be a possible bug in Python that should be reported up to the developers, whom from among them, as soon as possible?
not is not a function, and not(True) is not a function call.not(True) == None is parsed as not (True == None), because not has lower precedence than ==.Please keep Python's operator precedence in mind when writing expressions, and don't treat things like functions if they're not functions.
