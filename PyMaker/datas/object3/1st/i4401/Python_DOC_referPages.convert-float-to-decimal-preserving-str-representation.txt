I am trying to subclass decimal.Decimal so that floating point numbers get treated as strings, which in turn are treated as decimals.Instead of:I convert the float to a str which in turn gets converted into Decimal:Since I find myself doing this a lot, I decided to subclass Decimal. But the following code throws an exception in Python 3.6.4:Traceback:What is the solution?
You're passing the wrong arguments to  __new__ and you're not returning anything.Documentation on how to use __new__That being said, you should probably be using __init__ here, since you're not doing any class type manipulation that requires the use of __new__.
Try:  def __new__(self, value="0", context=None): requires three positional arguments, self, value and context.When you do super().__new__(value, context) self (from your function) becomes value and context becomes value, the last two values do not need to be defined to use the function so there is nothing alerting you to this,context never actually gets passed to super().__new__()
