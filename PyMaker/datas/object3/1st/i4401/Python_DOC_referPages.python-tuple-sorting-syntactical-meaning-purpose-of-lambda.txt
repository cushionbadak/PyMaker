This question already has an answer here:Syntax behind sorted(key=lambda: â€¦)                    6 answers                Can someone explain that the importance of lambda in this format of sorting tuples? Further, what exactly does each element of this sorting method mean? I know that reverse = True allows for the list of tuples to be sorted in decending order, the tup[0] indicates what index you want to sort by, and that the first parameter is the tuple/list, but what does key = lambda mean and why is tuple referred to as tup?Thanks!
lambda is just a syntax shortcut to put a function as a parameter without defining it explicitly on the lines above.  Lambdas are restricted Lambdas are restricted to a single expression.  So for longer functions you do have to define them separatelyThe code above could be re-written asThis code is functionally equivalent to the one you posted in the question. The purpose of lambda is to extract the first field from the tuple that you are sorting.
