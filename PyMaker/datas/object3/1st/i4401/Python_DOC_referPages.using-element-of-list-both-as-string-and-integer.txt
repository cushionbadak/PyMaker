Is there a way to use the elements of a string-list first as strings and then as int?I tried to Play around with range/len but I didnt come to a solution.Edit2:This is what I have:The Output are 3 figures that look like this:But I want them to be in one figure:This code works, but only if the list NG is made out of integers [1,2,3]. But I have it in strings. And I Need them in the Loop.
How to access both the element of list and its index?That is the real question as I understood mainly from this comment. And it is a pretty common and straightforward piece of code:
Here is my 2 cents:To convert back to char
I think integer mean here is ascii value of characterso you can use again your ascii value to play with characters my solution is you have to type cast  your variables like this ,and use ord() function to get ascii valuesas because there is no meaning of having a int value of characters , int value of character generally refers as ascii value may be some other formats 
Use enumerate to iterate both on the indices and the letters.Will output:In your case, because you don't need the letters at all in your loop, you can use the underscore _ to notify coders in your future about what your code do - it uses the len of NG just for the indices.
