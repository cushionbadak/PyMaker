I'm trying to get the absolute path but I dont get the correct result. This is I'm trying:Given I have this html page url:and I have this relative path in the file:I'm doing:So I should get build/pub-assets/css/indexen.cssbut I don't get what is expected.Any suggestion much appreciated.
If your url1 is a file (instead of directory), you should modify the path by using urlparse and ParseResult._replace to modify the result. This is assuming that url1 is an absolute path and url2 is a relative path.
Python 3.6.1:Python 2.7.14:Note the changed import. I would double-check your Python version, import statement, and perhaps post more of your program.
