I have a list in python which looks like this:I need to process the list in some way such that I return individual sequences of P and N. In the above case I need to return:I have looked at itertools but have not found anything that can do this. I have a lot of lists to process in this way so efficiency is also important.
You can do it using itertools.groupby:We group according to item in {'N', 'P'}, and keep only the groups for which this is True.
