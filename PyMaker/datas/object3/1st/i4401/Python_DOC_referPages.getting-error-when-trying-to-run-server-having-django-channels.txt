I am trying to use django-channels in my django-project and getting this error while trying to run the server. I am following this tutorial to build chatting application. https://gearheart.io/blog/creating-a-chat-with-django-channels/
Channels 2 dropped support for Python 2.7 and 3.4. It now requires Python 3.5 or 3.6.The async def statement was added in Python 3.5. You get a syntax error because you're using Python 3.4.
