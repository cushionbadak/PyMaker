I work with language codes, especially with the ISO 639-3 standard, which uses three letter codes to represent languages (eng for English, jpn for Japanese, etc).However, codes in the range of qaaâ€“qtz are not proper language codes but are just empty ones that the user has to define.So, qaa, qab...qaz, qba, and so on.I was wondering how to write code that would be able to detect if a code is part of this series? In these codes, the last letter goes all the way through a-z, then starts at a new sequence in the second letter. Kind of like a three digit number, except instead of 0-9 digits, it's a-z letters. 
You can do this easily with a regular expression matching for the pattern 'q[a-t][a-z]'edit: forgot to do a length check. Without it the regex would find a positive match on 'qabx' which doesn't fit the pattern you are wanting.
