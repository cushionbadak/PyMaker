Trying to convert this string (put in the variable a1):to:I have tried print a1.split(',').reverse() but this returns null. Why? and how to achieve this without using a loop?Any help is appreciated.
Split on comma, split on colons, reverse, join colons, join commas:To understand this better just observe the output of these different calls:Some further reading:str.split - the method used to separate the strings at delimitersstr.join - the method used to join iterables back to stringsa good introduction to those one-line generator expressionsa section about slicing and how they can be used to reverse sequences
If you want it as a dict. Output:
First of all .reverse() method reverse the list and returns Noneso you can use reversed() which will return you iterator of reverse of the list
