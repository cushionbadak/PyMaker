Consider this folder containing two files:Calling glob.glob('*') on this folder won't list the hidden .bar file:But pathlib.Path.glob('*') will:I'd like to know if this is intended or possibly a bug/oversight.The glob module documentation states that files starting with a dot are special cased:glob treats filenames beginning with a dot (.) as special casesMeaning that the result given by glob.glob('*') is intended. But what about pathlib's glob? I couldn't find any relevant information in the docs. Is this the intended behavior? Shouldn't both functions produce the same results?
As per issue #26096 on the official bug tracker, this difference has been deemed not a bug and is therefore completely intended.Credits to @vaultah for the find.
