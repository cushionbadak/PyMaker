I have a usertable with a column 'routes' that has values like '[{"407": "410"}, {"410": "408"}]'. I need to select all rows that have values 408"}, so I'm using like keyword in MySQL to achieve this. The query looks as belowselect routes from usertable where routes like '%408"}%'This query works in MySQL Workbench, but when I take this to Python its not working, my query looks like below in Python(select routes from usertable where routes like'%{1}"}%').format(routes)`The error I see is as below:I did try using escape characters i.e. \" and }} but still getting the same error.Please suggest how to fix this.Thanks,Seema
'%{1}"}%'.format(routes)' should be '%{1}"}}%'.format(routes)' (note the double }}).that is how you can convice format not to try and fill a value but to return just one }. as stated in the doc:The parts of the string outside curly braces are treated literally,  except that any doubled curly braces '{{' or '}}' are replaced with  the corresponding single curly brace.
You should duplicate } and { if you intend to use formatting.In your case, edit your string so it looks like that '%{1}"}}%').format(routes). This will give results you expect.As forI did try using escape charactersIt seems you tried to escape characters you use for format, not the ones you don't mean to touch.
Try using following queryThe % that you are using is escape character you can use %% for instead of % (similarly instead of { use {{ and add \ before " ).This will help you.
