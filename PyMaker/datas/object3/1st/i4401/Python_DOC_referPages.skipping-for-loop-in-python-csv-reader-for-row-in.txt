I was a little curious because when I add a single line in my code, that counts the number of rows in the csv file, the for loop is stop working and just skipping everything inside.My code shown below, is working now, but if I uncomment the row_count it's not working, so my question is why?
The reader is an iterable (see the iterator protocol):... One notable exception is code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A container object (such as a list) produces a fresh new iterator each time you pass it to the iter() function or use it in a for loop. Attempting this with an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous iteration pass, making it appear like an empty container.The iterable is consumed when you iterate it. It is not a concrete data structure:You should count while you iterate (inside for row in sensor:), because once you iterate and consume it - you can't iterate again.Alternatives are using list for concreting the data, or if you need the iterable interface - itertools.tee (if you don't have a lot if data). You can also use enumerate and keep the last index.Example:Or:
