Natural Text
I want to change the string 'datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 15, 12, 59)' into the format '2018-04-15T12:59'.I created a function that looks like:And it works. However, I also want it to handle the case where if each unit is less than 10, I want to add a '0'. Right now it just adds a '0' regardless.I can do it in a very inefficient way, but I wonder how I can do it in a smart way.
I don't understand why you use the string representation of a datetime object but eval is your friend:eval documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval
I assume that you're trying to avoid using the datetime object, because it seems obviously confusing otherwise.I can do it in a very inefficient wayYou are actually not very far away, just one line.I'm afraid there isn't any smarter way if you're not using the datetime object.
datetime.strftime and eval would be perfect here.output: '2018-04-15T12:59'Reference: strftime() and strptime() Behavior
