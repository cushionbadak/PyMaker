I want to create my own list of ciphersuites using the cipher strings. The following code works if I put only one string in the set_ciphers function. But I want a customized list of ciphers. There is other format like: ALL:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT:!eNULL but this does not do the purpose I need. I have a customized list of different ciphers that I can not combine using the second format. The function set_ciphers can be found here.
I could include more than one cipher simple by separating the ciphers with : and send all the ciphers as one string.This way, the client offers all the ciphers. You can make sure from this by calling context.get_ciphers() and you will see only the ciphers you inserted using set_cipher. 
Even if ssl.SSLContext.get_ciphers() returns the ciphers in a friendly format (a list of dictionaries), the other way around, things don't work quite the same.According to [Python 3]: SSLContext.set_ciphers(ciphers):Set the available ciphers for sockets created with this context. It should be a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format.Following [OpenSSL]: CIPHER LIST FORMAT:The cipher list consists of one or more cipher strings separated by colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are normally used.Therefore, strings like 'DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256' are to be used.
