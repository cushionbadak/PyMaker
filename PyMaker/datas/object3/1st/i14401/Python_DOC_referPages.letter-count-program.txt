Natural Text
In my letter counting function, when is use this codeI get that the amount of a certain letter is 0, no matter what. For example, here is what I got in the command promptHow would you fix this to get how many times a letter appears in a string?
There's a method that already counts number of occurrences of a character. For case insensitive, use String.lower()
Considering you've imported Counter, the easiest way to do what you want is:
To count the exact character, you can use the builtin count method.If you want to count regardless of the case, you can use the str.lower method.You have to lower the string, because the character codes for T and t are not the same. They are 84 and 116, respectively.In your function, it would look like this:OrEDIT (thanks to abarnert)If you intend to use this in non-English languages, you should use the casefold method instead. However, this is only available in Python 3.
