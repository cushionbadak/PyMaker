If I have a dictionary, how can I take the keys, and allow a user to make unlimited versions of it with different values for each key? 
Variant 1 allows simple construction of any dict from both: a list of keys and values, while my_dict2 presents a varaint to create an "empty" (all values are None dict from an existing. You can also mix both (I leave that as an exercise;-).
You can use the dict.fromkeys() method:  My example function initalizes the values as None but you can easily adapt it to insert your own values by passing the value parameter to the .fromkeys(seq[,value]) method.
