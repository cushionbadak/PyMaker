For this string:looking to run regular expression to look like the below:I got this so far:that just returns one string. I know I need to just repeat this pattern, \S&+ using [], but can't see to figure out the best way to do this all in one regex
This works by splitting on either ? or & and then throwing away the first match, which is the part up to the ?.I'm making two assumptions here: first, that there are no ? characters in your fragments, and second, that you really want the first element of your list to be port=AAA-NY.
Using regex to parse URL is a bad idea when Python has built-in library to do the job:Python 3Use urlparse to parse the URL into schema, port, host, query, etc., then use parse_qs to parse the query string.Do check out the documentation for parsing options for corner cases. Example code:Printing query_parts:Python 2The code in Python 2.* is similar, but you need to import urlparse module, instead of urllib.parse. The functions are more or less the same.
