I received this exercise:Write a function enumerate that takes a list and returns a list of  tuples containing (index,item) for each item in the listMy problem is that I cannot insert the index and value in one or a combination of for loops. This is the code I managed to make:This is roughly the code I want to produce (must be on one line):How can I put it all one lambda line to get (value, index) back? The output should look like:
If you can actually index just add the value by indexing:If not  use zip and put range in the lambda:
outputs:EDIT: use range instead of xrange and print(...) instead of print if you are using python3
Python's zip and range functions solve this problem pretty handily.In Python 2.x, you should use itertools.izip, and xrange instead.
You could also do it recursively:list.pop(n) returns the nth  value form the list, and returns it.The only problem is that you must pass in a list:However, if you just blindly added calls to list, you would't be able to replicate the functionality required without using a slice.A neat trick for bypassing this requirement is to use another lambda:
