I have this dictionary:And I wanted to create a list with only the pair that are True. It would look like this:So I tried doing it this way:But I get the error: What am I doing wrong? 
You are close!  You just need to call the .items() method1 on the dictionary:Iterating over a dictionary in Python yields only its keys, not keys and values as some might expect.  To get those, you call .items() to return an iterable of key/value pairs, which can then be unpacked into the names x and y.1Note that this answer is in regard to Python 3.x.  In Python 2.x, you should call .iteritems() instead since the Python 2.x .items() method will build an unnecessary list.
(That's Python 2, for Python 3 you'd need to slap a list(...) around it.)I speed-tested it now with the numbers up to one million. Averages of 100 runs:References: filter() list() items()
You can iterate over items, and store off the key if the value is True
