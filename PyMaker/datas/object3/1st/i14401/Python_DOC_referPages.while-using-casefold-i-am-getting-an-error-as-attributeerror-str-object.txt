Error:
Python 2.6 doesn't support the str.casefold() method.From the str.casefold() documentation:New in version 3.3.You'll need to switch to Python 3.3 or up to be able to use it.There are no good alternatives, short of implementing the Unicode casefolding algorithm yourself. See How do I case fold a string in Python 2?However, since you are handling a bytestring here (and not Unicode), you could just use str.lower() and be done with it.
In python 2.x you will get an error when you use casefold().You may just use lower(), these are not the same but comparable.Read: str.casefold()Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it  is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example,  the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to "ss". Since it is  already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold()  converts it to "ss".
