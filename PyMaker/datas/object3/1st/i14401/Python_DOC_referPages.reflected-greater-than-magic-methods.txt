I am in need of a reflected magic method "greater than" and there does not appear to be one. Here is the situation. I have a class which keeps track of units. It is call Property. I have the magic method setup to handle comparisons, but it does not work when I put the Property on the right side. Here is an example:So if you run this you will see the output is: False, True, False because the middle example is executing float > Property which uses the built in > not the > I have defined using magic methods. I need a magic method that will be used when the Property is on the right hand side. Is that not a thing? If not, how can I write this so that any combination of values and my own class can be compared. I would like to not have any rules for comparisons. IE, I don't want to just never be able to compare a float to a property.  
You can use a functools.total_ordering decorator to create the missing comparison methods for you:Then you get False, False, False. Do make sure to read its documentation, though.
__lt__ is __gt__'s counterpart; you'll need to implement __lt__. While you're at it, you should probably implement __le__ and __ge__.
Since you've declared the __float__() method, you could always write it as:
