I have a string called group_data, which I want to read with Python's csv.reader. This is the call I am making.I want that this raises an exception whenever one of the following is the case:There is a single quote: "A";"B "bb" B";"C" insteadof "A";"B ""bb"" B";"C") Any of the fields is notquoted: A;B;C instead of "A";"B";"C"However, the excerpt above accepts both lines as correct, even with the doublequote=True, quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL, and strict=True settings. Is there another option I should set to make it fail? If this is not possible, is there another way to quickly notice if there is a single quote or an unquoted field?
For what it's worth, it looks like Python 3.4 does reject your first example:Although it allows the second:Looking at the docs, it seems like this is because QUOTE_ALL is strictly a writer setting, not a reader setting:Compare to: So it looks like you need to make this yourself if you want it. This is simple if you know that ; will never appear inside your rows (which appears to be the case, since you don't set escapechar):
