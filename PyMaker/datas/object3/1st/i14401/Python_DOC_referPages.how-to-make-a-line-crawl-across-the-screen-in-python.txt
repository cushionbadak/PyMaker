What I want it to do is print  Loading Documents... then have an animation of a line crawling across the screenInstead it prints Loading Documents and then after a couple seconds, all the dashes in the line pop up at onceAny Ideas?
Output is normally line-buffered, meaning when you print part of a line, it may not get displayed until you finish printing the rest of the line.You can change the buffering, but the simpler solution is just to explicitly call flush on the stdout stream (which print normally prints to) every time you want to force it to display what you have so far:In this case, it may also be cleaner to also use write directly on stdout, just to make it clear that you're doing low-level I/O instead of the normal high-level print mechanism:This is explained in the docs… but only if you know where to look, and already understand most of it…print explains that sys.stdout is the default file that gets printed to, then sys.stdout says:These streams are regular text files like those returned by the open() function. Their parameters are chosen as follows: … When interactive, standard streams are line-buffered … You can override this value with the -u command-line option.If you follow the link to -u, it says:Force the binary layer of the stdout and stderr streams (which is available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console…Then you have to follow a few links from open or text files to get to io and read almost the entire module documentation to figure out how to access and rewrap sys.stdout.buffer.raw or just call sys.stdout.flush.
Seems like you are wanting to display some kind of "progress" to your user.I recommend you use something like progressExample:You do have to install this 3rd-party package hwoever as it's not part of the standard library. Typically this as as simple as:
