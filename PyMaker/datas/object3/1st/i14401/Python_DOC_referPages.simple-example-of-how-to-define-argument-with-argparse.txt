This must be super simple, but I'm struggling with the official argparse docs - after 20 minutes of frustrated googling, I'm giving up and asking here! I'm working in Python 2.7. I just want to run a Django management command with an argument, like this:...and then from inside my script, get access to the value of db_name. Here's what I've tried:This gives me Is there an easy way (other than string-parsing args - surely that can't be the best way) to get the value of db_name?
If you are willing to make a slight modification to how you call your script, the below will work:You need to call it like this:Notice that you have to use traditional Unix command line arguments (--name value), instead of just name=valueThe output of the above script is:The db_name value is accessed with results.db_nameYou can also access these arguments from custom Django Management commands. Utilizing the example, I believe something like this will work:In this case, your variable is accessed in options['db_name']
