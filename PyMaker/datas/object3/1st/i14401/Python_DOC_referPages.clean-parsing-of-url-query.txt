Currently, whenever I need to parse a query string,  I was originally doingBut I didn't like the [0]s dotted around my code - it felt wrong in some hard to pinpoint way, so I realised I could doThat has the advantage of removing the [0]'s, but it risks discarding multiple values (which should be fine for my application, which shouldn't be receiving multiple values anyway).Is there a cleaner way of parsing urlencoded strings, that gives you a dict of minimal values: the value if there's only one value, or a list if there's multiple?A function to do so shouldn't be too difficult, but I'm curious if there's a library that does this so I don't need to reinvent the wheel.
In general, if you have such a dictionary query, you could always doHowever, I really dislike this code, as it just produces stuff that is unintuitive later on.
