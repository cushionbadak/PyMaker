I want to sort a python list from a specific index. Here is what I want to achieve.Consider a list al = [1,2,4,3]Now what I want to do is, start from the last index, go back and swap the number which is smaller than the last index, i.e 2 which is at index 1.now my list is [1,3,4,2]But, after swapping I want to sort the sub-list after the swapped index.instead of [1,3,4,2]I want to get to [1,3,2,4]Is there any way in python to only sort the sub-list?Right now if I use the sort method for a particular index for example:al[2:].sort() It creates a new list instead of changing the same. 
You could use sorted() on a slice and then assign the result back to the slice:
If you wanted to do it inplace and depending on what you have in your lists, you could use numpy where basic indexing using  always returns a view of the original array:
