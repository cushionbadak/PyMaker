I found the documentation for pep8 but wasn't able to understand how to write these. I couldn't even find any examples with options other than setting max-line-length and ignore.I am trying to write a .pep8.rc file in which, among other things, I need to do the following:enable show sourceenable statisticsenable countexclude a directory (say, for example ./random)Can somebody answer with an example or link to one?
The preferred way is to use a setup.cfg in the top-level of the project (.cfg has the same syntax as a .ini file), which should contain a [pep8] section. For example:Note: the error codes are defined in the pep8 docs.autopep8 find this same [pep8] section as pep8.flake8 needs a [flake8] section in setup.cfg.yapf looks for a [yapf] section in setup.cfg.
Sadly, the answer from Andy Hayden does not work for pytest / pytest-pep8 / flake8.pytest-pep8For that, you have to use eitherorStrangely, the following does not workpytest-flake8Add
