How can pickled data be written and read back from a BytesIO object?I tried:which gives for the pickle.load line:
You just did not rewind your buffer: bytes_io.seek(0) before pickle.load.Possibly you don't want to rewind to the front of the buffer, but just to the start of your pickled data. Then read out the stream position with bytes_io.tell() before pickling and seek to that position instead of 0.
