Natural Text
So I know that the character "Latin Small Letter Sharp S" ÃŸ is at Unicode Point U+00DF and I know  how to escape this in Python 3 as a string: \u00DF.  However, I know that there are other unicode prefixes for the larger codepoints (such as U+260E: Black Telephone)I have seen the uppercase U being used such as \U00DF and i have also seen \x being used.  My question is when do i use those.  For instance many emoji are just given as U+260x. And my thought is to use a capital U and fill in 12 0s before those digits but when do I use an \x and when do I know to use leading zeros (and how many)All of this is me guessing because I can't find any documentation.
The \x takes two hex digits.The lower-case \u takes four hex digits.The upper-case \U takes eight hex digits.https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-literals-in-python-source-code
