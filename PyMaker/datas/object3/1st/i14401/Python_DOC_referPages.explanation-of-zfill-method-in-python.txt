I'm using the ImageHash module to get hashes of images. I have this code:So imagehash1 is the basic usage of the module. Now what I don't understand is what kind of transformation the hashSize made to the original string in imagehash2 and how the 3rd function convert the imagehash2 into a 64 bit string.
During phash computation original image is resized. hashSize parameter basically controls height and width of resized image.  Algorithm can be found  here. Implementation of the first step (reduce size):See sources of imagehash.phashLets see what the line imghash3.append(bin( int(imghash2, 16))[2:].zfill(64)) does.First of all it converts hexadecimal string into integerThe builtin bin function is applied to convert the integer into a binary stringDrops first two characters using list sliceAdds 0 on the left side to make a string of 64 characters total
