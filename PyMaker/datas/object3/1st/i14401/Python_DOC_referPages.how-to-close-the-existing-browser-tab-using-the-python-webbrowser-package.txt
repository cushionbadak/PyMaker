Using Python webbrowser package I can open a new tab with a specified URL. Is there a way to close this tab? I referred the below official docs and nothing related to close action is mentioned. Python webbrowser package doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html
No, webbrowser doesn't have methods to close tabs nor browser itself as you may see in its documentation page:https://docs.python.org/2/library/webbrowser.html
You couldUse a hotkey using the pykeyboard library which you can read about at https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInputAnother (but probably worse) option is:You may use a "taskkill" command likeHowever, this will just kill all processes and close the chosen program (in this case chrome.exe)(This also may delete data from the browser, f.eks. you lose all you're windows even tho you have chosen in settings to save them for next time you open your browser)
