This question already has an answer here:Itertools equivalent of nested loop “for x in xs: for y in ys…”                    2 answers                If I have 3 lists - 'a', 'b', and 'c', and I want to find every possible combination which consists of one value from each loop, that's easy.  Or to write it so it can take a single argument, like this:But say i need it to accomodate an argument l that contains n number of lists inside?   How can I create nested for loops on demand?  I've tried writing recursively, but I seem to keep running into infinite recusion that way.
I'm not sure why Reut deleted a valid answer - so I'm re-posting my version to it (using itertools.product):OUTPUT
