I use below code add timestamp into print. but it is strange why it add two timestamp around message.  When I print True. it output as below.  Before and after True, there are two timestamp.why is this? I only want to add timestamp before True. 
It's due to the fact that the print statement or function performs two calls to write, one to print the message ('True') and one for the ending newline or space.You can see this using a script like the following:Called results in:Note:'True' and '\n' are the arguments for the two calls performed when doing print True.'False' and '\n' are the arguments for the two calls performed when doing print False'1', ' ', '2', ' ', '3' and '\n' are the arguments performed when doing print 1,2,3.An other way of seeing this is by using exceptions:Note: the 1 was still printed even though the 1/0 raised an exception. What python is doing is taking each single portion of the stuff to print, evaluating it and then calling write. Afterwards it calls write(' ') to print the space due to the comma and finally evaluates 1/0 which results in an exception.In the same way print True first evaluates True, then calls write(str(True)) and finally calls write('\n') to add the final newline.If you want to propoerly attach a timestamp to messages you should use the logging module instead.
Base on @Bakuriu answer, I am using below code to achieve my object as I am confident that I will not use "\n" in print message. :). I post here if others are also interesting.
