i'm trying to check if a certain object of mine is in a list of objects, and i want to do it without going in nested loops.i have for example an object of type X with fields of types W,E,R.i also have a list L of objects of type X.my question is - if i will ask, (myobj in L)will it return True if there is an object of type X in  the list, OR will it return True only if there is an object of type X in L, that have the same W,E,Rof myobj?======================= edited: ======================================first time i ran the above code (i.e. obj in L), for the above code i got an error because i had a log that wasn't in first_users[0].get_log() (it was different by one object)then i ran:and i didn't get any errors - which is good.i even tried to change a specific object in the logs:and it still didn't through an error - which isn't good
Go through this. It's the page on operator overloading in classes. Find the function that you need!Edit: You need to implement __eq__ to check if the members of two objects are equal.Eg:Output:You can choose not to check all the members and compare only the ones that matter to you.
