this code is supposed to take a user input for the type of shape. then take an input of the height then print a shape made of *'s (triangle/square for now)the code works until the user types in a bad input to start, then a correct function name and tries to close it. any ideas how to fix it? error:the whole code is     """ shape programme by jordan hampson""" 
It's due to your fonction get_valid_shape(), the fonction call the fonction main() so when you enter "sad" you start a new main() but in the fonction get_valid_shape() (on the main process your are still at the line get_valid_shape(shape)). When you press "q" you quit this line and pass to call_shape(shape) the prevous shape was a triangle so it ask you to input a size.To avoid this I suggest this codeI suggest you the module pdb in python. It's a debug module very useful (you can see how run your algorithme step by step, go to somewhere, into a function etc ...) link
You have used these return's in a wrong way, you don't really need any return'ed value since you're doing NOTHING with them in your code!In my opinion this is an awful code since you have used useless functions, when you could write your whole code without them.
