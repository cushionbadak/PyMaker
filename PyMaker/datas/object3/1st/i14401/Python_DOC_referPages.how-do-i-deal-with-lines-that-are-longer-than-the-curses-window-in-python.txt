I'd like my curses application to display the absolute path of the current file that it is working with as it iterates. These can get longer than the window, running into the next line. If the next file path is shorter, difference in length is not overwritten, leading to mangled strings. What is the best practice way of fixing this problem?Edit: Python 3 sample code on Mac OS X
Assuming you don't want to use a window, the simplest solution is:Use addnstr instead of addstr to never write more characters than fit on the line, andUse clrtoeol to erase any leftover characters after the new path.For example:If you want to do this by creating a larger-than-fullscreen window and clipping it to the terminal, read up on newpad. For a trivial case line this, it won't be any simpler, but for more complex cases it might be what you're looking for:
