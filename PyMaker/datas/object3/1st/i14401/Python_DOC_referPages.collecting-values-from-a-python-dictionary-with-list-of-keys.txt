My question is can we, without using for loop, collect the values (output) from a dictionary with a particular list ("myWord")?
This is what operator.itemgetter is for:
You can use a list comprehension:
Here are benchmarks of several different methods:For Python 2.7, prints:Python 3.4:PyPy:You can see that even with a dictionary of similar size (1,000,000 elements) to what the OP states, that a simple 'for' loop is competitive with fancier methods. A list comprehension is very competitive. You can also see that something that looks fancy is not that great.premature optimization is the root of all evil
or to use map, if myWords contains keys the dictionary Dict, to use
