I have a Python package that includes bin_win32, bin_win64, bin_osx, bin_lnx32, and bin_lnx64 subdirectories with binaries for the appropriate platforms, which I call through the Python file steamcloud.py. When I run python setup.py bdist_wheel --universal, the generated wheel does not include the files in those subdirectories, only the Python file. How can I get these included in the wheel?Note: I'm aware 1) that the --universal flag is meant for Python-only packages and 2) that I should be creating separate wheels for each platform. However, I don't have access to Windows or Linux computers for development, and there is no naming convention for Linux-specific wheels.The contents of setup.py can be found here.
Well, the first issue is that your project doesn't follow the expected layout, so you need to call setup() with the package_dir argument in addition to the packages and package_data arguments (See installing package data).However, the files you're trying to include aren't really package data, so you probably don't want to add them to package_data like you currently are. package_data interprets paths relative to your packages, not relative to the project root. Instead, use data_files so you can provide paths relative to your setup.py file.
