I have a list of record instances returned by SQLAlchemy.While the instances have many attributes, I want a new list with only one of the attributes. The java coder in me says:...which works, of course.  But What's the Pythonic answer? I know there a one-liner that includes these 4 lines into 1, but finding it is like googling for "for".
You are looking for what is called a list comprehension:The above is a concise equivalent to the for-loop in your example.In addition, you should be aware that there are dict comprehensions:as well as set comprehensions:which will construct new dictionaries and sets respectively.Lastly, all of these constructs allow you to add an optional condition to be tested for each item:This is useful if you want to filter the items from the iterable by the condition.
You want to do a list comprehension:
Alternatively to list comprehension you can use operator.attrgetter and map:(But the list comprehension variant is easier to read IMO.)
