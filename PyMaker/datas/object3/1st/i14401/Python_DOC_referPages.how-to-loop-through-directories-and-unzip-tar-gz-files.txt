I have a number of subdirectories that contain ...tar.gzfiles. I am trying to use os.walk() to go through the individual files and unzip them using the tarfile module. I am trying to iterate through the different directories and extract the ..tar.gz files. I've also tried to use: I am really interested in whether python can be used to move around directories (iteration) and perform some functions, such as unzipping files, etc. Any help is much appreciated. I'm new to Python. Thank you. 
As explained in the os.walk docs:Note that the names in the lists contain no path components. To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).And of course you saw exactly that yourself, printing out alpha.tar.gz, etc, which obviously aren't absolute pathnames or relative pathnames from the current working directory or anything else you could access, just bare filenames.Also notice that every example given in the docs does exactly what's recommended. For example:So, in your case:One more thing:This is almost certainly going to cause an error. For one thing, output and output_dir are not the same name. For another, ... doesn't mean anything; you probably wanted ..?
