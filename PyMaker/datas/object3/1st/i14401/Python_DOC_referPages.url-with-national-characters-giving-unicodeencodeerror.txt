I'm trying to extract dictionary entry:either with commented lines on or off, it keeps getting an error:
Your issue is that you have non-ASCII characters within your URL path which must be properly encoded using urllib.parse.quote(string) in Python 3 or urllib.quote(string) in Python 2.NOTE: According to What is the proper way to URL encode Unicode characters?, URLs should be encoded as UTF-8. However, that does not preclude percent encoding the resulting non-ASCII, UTF-8 characters.
