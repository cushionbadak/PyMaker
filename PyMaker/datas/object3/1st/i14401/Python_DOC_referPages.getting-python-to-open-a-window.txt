I want to write a program in Python but I cant find any help on where to start. All I want to do first is make Python open a simple window when I run the program. I want it to be green and about 500 pixels square. How would I do this?
You can do this using turtle, a builtin Python module made for drawing.First you initialize the screen using turtle.Screen(). Then you use screen.setup() and pass in the screen size you want. Lastly, you use screen.bgcolor() to change the background color.
You can use tkinter
