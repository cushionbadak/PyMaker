When using Python properties (setters and getters), usually following is used:However, is there any similar approach for appending / removing arrays? For example, in a bi-directional relationship between two objects, when removing object A, it would be nice to dereference the relationship to A in object B. I know that SQLAlchemy has implemeneted a similar function.I also know that I can implement methods likebut I would prefer to do it like "properties" in Python.. do you know some way? 
To make your class act array-like (or dict-like), you can override __getitem__ and __setitem__.If you want several attributes of your object to exhibit such behavior, you need several array-like objects, one for each attribute, constructed and linked at your master object's creation time.
