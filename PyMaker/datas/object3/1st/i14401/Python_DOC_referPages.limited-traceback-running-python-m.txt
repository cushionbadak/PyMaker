Natural Text
I am having a problem getting an informative traceback when I run a script with the -m flag.  I am using the -m flag so that I can properly use relative imports throughout my package.  When an error comes up, stdout does tell me the nature of the exception but not the location, such as file and line number./usr/bin/python: Error while finding spec for 'bin.load_ref_exps.py'  (: 'module' object has no attribute  'path')I would very much like to be able to run the script directly with a full traceback to quickly debug what is going on.Any ideas on how to run the script in a way that doesn't break all the package based relative imports and still gives me a full traceback?Thanks!
If you use -m, you shouldn't specify the .py extension, since you are specificying a module name, not a file per se.  See the documentation.
