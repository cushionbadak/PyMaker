I wrote a python script to search all .avi file in the current folder, and write their names in a file for later processing.However I only get an empty file, even if I have a .avi in my folder.Here's my code:
open file via "with":
in doesn't do such pattern matching. Assuming i is a string, just useBut for gods sake, don't call a string variable i.Or to check for multiple endings at once (thanks @msvalkon for the reminder):And you could use Python's glob module which does come with such pattern functionality:
file writes should be done like this:but you probably also have a problem with if i in "*.avi":so your code would beAnd now the nice version:
You can simply use the built in glob module which does exactly what you want:glob.glob searches for files that match a certain pattern. If you use what I wrote it will search for files in the current directory which have .avi or .mp4 file extensionsNote the use of a context manager (with open(...)) instead of f = open(...) and f.close(). This is more pythonic.Also, I used \n joining to skip the for loop.
What if i in "*.avi" is doing is asking "is i a substring of '*.avi'"?  That is not a glob-matching operation.The simplest solution is probably to use glob instead of sh.
modified the answer of Rain Lee a bit.1st) define a function:2nd) call that function and put the results in a list:3rd) you could display it
