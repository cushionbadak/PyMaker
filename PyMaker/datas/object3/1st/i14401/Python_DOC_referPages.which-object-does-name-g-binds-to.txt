Below assignment is taken from hereQ5. Define the repeated function from Homework 2 by calling reduce with compose1 as the first argument. Add only a single expression to the starter implementation below:To complete this assignment, I would like to understand, to what does g binds to? f binds to square function
First, what should repeated(f, 4) return?A function that, when called on some arbitrary arg, will return f(f(f(f(arg)))).So, if you want to build that with compose1, you'll need to return either compose1(compose1(compose1(f, f), f), f) or compose1(f, compose1(f, compose1(f, f))).Now, look at what reduce does, and figure out what it's going to pass to compose1 each time. Clearly your iterable argument has to either start or end with f itself. But what else do you want there to make sure you get one of the two acceptable results?And meanwhile, inside each call to compose1 except the last, one of the two arguments has to be the repeated function's f, while the other will be the result of another call to compose1. (The last time, of course, they'll both be f.) Figure out which of those is f and which is g, and how you get reduce to pass the right values for each, and you've solved the problem.
