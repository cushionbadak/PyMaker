I want to use blender to open up a csv file and use the motion data in that file to animate an object or hand Is there python code to do this
Probably not, but it would be trivial to write something to do it. Import Python's csv module, then use the data you read to update an object's location when the frame changes. Or you could transfer the data to an animation curve.This question might be better asked on the Blender Stack Exchange site.
