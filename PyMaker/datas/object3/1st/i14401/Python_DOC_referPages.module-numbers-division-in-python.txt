Python has got number modulesand the numbers module has something called division - I don't know if it's a function, a attribute, a constant.... What is that? No reference to it on the DocsIs that some internal feature of python or something?
This is one of the __future__ featuresdefined in the __future__.py as followsThe numbers module imports __future__.division into its namespace, making it available via regular attribute access.You can get more information about this feature from the PEP 238:The future division statement, spelled from __future__ import division, will change the / operator to mean true division         throughout the module.This kind of division is default, starting from Python 3+.
numbers does from __future__ import division which imports the name into scope.division happens to have that value.
To expand on vaultah's answer a little: When you work in python2, there's an option to do things in a more python3-friendly fashion (the two aren't fully compatible). from __future__ import division, for instance. Here's the difference in this case: __future__ is just a magical container that wraps certain other functions; in this case, that other function is held in numbers.Check out the docs for more info: https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html
