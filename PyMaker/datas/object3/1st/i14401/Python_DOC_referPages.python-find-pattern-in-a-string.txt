I am trying to find a way to match a pattern p in a string s in python.I just tried:Both return false; they are supposed to be true.
I convert your pattern into a regular expression that can then be used by re.match. For example, your xyzzyx becomes (.+)(.+)(.+)\3\2\1$ (the first occurrence of each letter becomes a capture group (.+), and subsequent occurences become the proper back reference).
If I'm understanding your question, you're looking for a pythonic approach to pattern matching across a set of strings.Here is an example demonstrating the use of list comprehensions to achieve this goal.I hope it helps you reach your goal.  Please let me know if I can help further.- JLDemonstrate No Match FoundDemonstrate Combination of Matches and No Match in the resultDemonstrate single statement
Compile a Python regular expressions object for some pattern of interest and then pass the string to its Match(string) method. You'll want to use a match object if you need a boolean output: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objectsExample: Check string s for any word character (that is, alphanumerics)Hope it helps!
You could make use of regular expressions.  Have a look here for some examples: LinkI think you could use re.search()Ecample:
