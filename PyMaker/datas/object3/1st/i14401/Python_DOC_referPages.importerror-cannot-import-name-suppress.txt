I am trying to install Taiga on my computer, and for one of the scripts its trying to import suppress but failing. I tried doing this manually:Could someone please help?
According to the documentation for Taiga, among the requirements is:Python 3.4So, you should not expect it to work in Python 3.3.And that's exactly your problem here. The contextlib.suppress function is "New in version 3.4."
