Natural Text
I have a CSV file that looks something like this: I was wondering how to delete a line if it includes the word "external"?   I saw another post on SO that addressed a very similar issue, but I don't understand completely...    I tried to use something like this (as explained in the linked post): The text file just held the one word "external" but it didn't work.... and I don't understand why. What happens is that the program will run, and the output.txt will be generated, but nothing will change, and no lines with "external" are taken out.    I'm using Windows and python 3.4 if it makes a difference.    Sorry if this seems like a really simple question, but I'm new to python and any help in this area would be greatly appreciated, thanks!! 
It looks like you are grabbing the first element after you split the line. That is going to give you the date, according to your example CSV file.What you probably want instead (again, assuming the example is the way it will always work) is to grab the 3rd element, so something like this:But, like one of the comments said, this isn't necessarily fool proof. You are assuming none of the individual cells will have commas. Based on your example that might be a safe assumption, but in general when working with CSV files I recommend working with the Python csv module.
Redirect output to a new file.  It will give you every line, except those that contain "external"
if you can go with something else then python, grep would work like this:would give you ONLY the lines that match the regex, while:gives everything BUT the lines matching the regex
