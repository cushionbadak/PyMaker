I have the following error when I try to split a string into two values.Error: builtins.ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpackWhen I debug, it shows that the first if statement is still true, even when there is no space in the string. I am wondering why is it not going into the second if statement.
'' in anystring will always be True because it's the empty string. The empty string is always going to be in every single possible string, just like the empty set is a subset of every set. You probably mean to check for ' ' which is a single space character. A better approach would be to split the string on whitespace and check the length of the list to determine if you have two items. For example:This is the method where you look before you leap (LBYL).And this is an alternative method where you ask for forgiveness rather than permission (EAFP).By the way, I took out the calls to str.strip, because using str.split takes care of that for you.
'' is the empty string. Asking '' in line is like asking whether you can make room in your daily schedule for something that takes zero time. Of course you can. Always. Ask ' ' in line instead.
use else: instead of second if.if ('' in line): should be if '' in line:
