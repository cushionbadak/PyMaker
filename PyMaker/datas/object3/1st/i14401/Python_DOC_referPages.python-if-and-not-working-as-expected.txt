I'm trying to set up the below code to ask the user to enter two integers (num_sides & num_rolls). If the user doesn't enter an integer for either input, then the code should print the statement "Enter  an integer".I find this code only tests the num_sides but doesn't test if num_rolls is an integer. What's going on here?Thanks in advance for your help!
Why do you have a nested loop? (Two while True one inside the other one)The following code is simpler and should work:If both int evaluate and do not crash then break is executed and you can leave the loop.As it is a function, you might want to return (num_sides, num_rolls) at the end of the function so they aren't lost. (You could also replace the break with the return, which will effectively stop the function too at the same time)Unless this is only the beginning of your code, then never mind what I just said. :)
You can just cast int and check for a ValueError:
