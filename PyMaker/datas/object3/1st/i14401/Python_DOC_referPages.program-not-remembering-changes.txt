Hello I have combed threw possible solutions and I can't figure this out, I got my program working for the most part but the problem is when I close the program it doesn't remember the changes made by the user. The program stored input into variables. It works like a dictionary (I wrote the code before I knew about the dictionary function) when I open the program I can enter the input but the problem is when I close the program it forgets all the changes and goes back to how it was when first compiled. Any ideas how I can allow the data to ramain available when I close the program and reopen it?
Probably you need shelve. It is awesome Python library, which allows you to read/write dict-like data from file. For example:It is very simple example which opens shelve storage and updates it with your data. Actually you can do whatever you do with regular dictionary object, because A “shelf” is a persistent, dictionary-like object.Another library that you could use is pickle. It allows you serialize every kind of Python objects, but since you have dictionary structure shelve should be better for your needs.Please fill free to ask questions/post your code, I will be glad to update my answer appropriate to you needs.
I think you need to implement two things here.1) Your program need to take an optional input file and the best way to do it is probably to use argparse. If you pass the input file, then you extract the data from the file and you initialize your dictionary_like object with that data.2) Just before quitting, you must save your data (key:value pairs) in the input file. If you want to save a dictionary like structure, a txt file with a key:value pairs for each line of the file should be good enough.And that's it.If you need more help on how to implement this let me know ;)
