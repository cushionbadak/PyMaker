Please consider this code:This gives in outputHowever, I expected it to give..because the h.id was already changed to "B" by the time the trigger method was called.It seems that a copy of host instance is created at the moment when the separate Process is started, so the changes in the original host do not influence that copy.In my project (more elaborate, of course), the host instance fields are altered time to time, and it is important that the events that are triggered by the code running in a separate process, have access to those changes.  
multiprocessing runs stuff in separate processes. It is almost inconceivable that things are not copied as they're sent, as sharing stuff between processes requires shared memory or communication. In fact, if you peruse the module, you can see the amount of effort it takes to actually share anything between the processes after the diverge, either through explicit communication, or through explicitly-shared objects (which are of a very limited subset of the language, and have to be managed by a Manager).
