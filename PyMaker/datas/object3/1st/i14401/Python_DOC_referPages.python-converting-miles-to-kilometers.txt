I am an undergraduate statistics major attempting to learn some programming on the side. I purchased a python book and am stuck on a problem. The chapter introduces For Loops and the preceding introduced functions. Question - Write a program disttable.py that prints a table of mile to kilometer conversions for distances between 100 and 1500 miles at 100 mile intervals. Write a function to do the conversion. One mile approximately 1.609 km.My code thus far - When I call main(), nothing happens. No error message. I tried to place the for loop inside main(), however, I am unsure how to define the local variable inside the main() when I move the for loop there, so I end up getting a error message stating the local variable isn't defined. 
That's because you're stepping by 1501 instead of 100:
You are using range incorrectly.  The documentation says:range(start, stop[, step])Going from 100 to 100 with a step of 1501 gives you no values, so your range is empty and the loop never runs.  You might have meant range(100, 1501, 100).
List comprehensions are now the most pythonic way of doing thisThe upshot is they evaluate lazily which for big lists means less memory pressure.
