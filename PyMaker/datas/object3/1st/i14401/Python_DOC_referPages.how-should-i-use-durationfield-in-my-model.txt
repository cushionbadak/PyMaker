In my model I want to be able to input duration, like 2 years, 5 months, etc.In version 1.8 DurationField was introduced so I tried using that:In my model I haveuser_validPeriod = models.DurationField()Trying to add a new User from my admin panel, If I try typing something like 2d or 2 days in the appearing text-field though I get Enter a valid duration.Can someone provide me with an example of how this field is supposed to be used?  
To use a DurationField in django 1.8 you have to use a python datetime.timedelta instance like this:Considering this model :You can set a duration this way :And query it this way :More info on datetime.timedelta here and on DurationField here.In your admin panel, you can enter a duration with a string with following format : [DD] [[hh:]mm:]ss
