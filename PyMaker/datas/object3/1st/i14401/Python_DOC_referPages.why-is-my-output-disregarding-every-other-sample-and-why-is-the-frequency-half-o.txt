I'm playing with Python's wave module, and I have run into two issues that I can't figure out.Every other sample has an amplitude of 0. The desired behavior is to have a continuous sinusoidal wave.The produced frequency seems to be half of the desired frequency. Looking at the math, I can't figure why. I understand how to fix it. I just can't figure out the reasoning. In my mind, multiplying the frequency by 2π, not 4π, makes sense to me.I'd greatly appreciate any insight.
I can not reproduce your issue. After running your code I get a perfect sine wave of the expected length (1/440Hz ≈ 0.0023s) when inspecting the .wav in Audacity:I do have one note for you, you can't simply round whatever comes out of sin * MAX_AMPLITUDE. You have to truncate towards negative infinity. This is because a (say) 8-bit sample goes from -128 to 127, not -128 to 128.
