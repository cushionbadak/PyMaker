I'd like to modify the arguments passed to a method in a module, as opposed to replacing its return value.I've found a way around this, but it seems like something useful and has turned into a lesson in mocking.module.pytests.pyI've tried something like the following, but not only is it repetitive and ugly, it doesn't work. After some PDB introspection.. I'm wondering if it's simply due to however this third party library works, as I do see the original functions being called successfully when I drop a pdb inside the side_effect. Either that, or some auto mocking magic I'm just not following that I'd love to learn about.Any guidance is appreciated!
You may want to use parameter wraps for the mock call. (Docs for reference.) This way the original function will be called, but it will have everything from Mock interface.So for changing parameters called to original function you may want to try it like that:result:
