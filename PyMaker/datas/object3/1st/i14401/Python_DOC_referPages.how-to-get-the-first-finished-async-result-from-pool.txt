Let's say I have 3 tasks.I want to run the 3 tasks in parallel so I put them in a thread pool.Then I need to get() these async result. Here is what I do:However, this method tries to get() these async results one by one. It is possible that task2 actually fails in the middle of the process and I want to know this by get() the corresponding async result. In this case, the method here will actually be blocked at the first task. I can only notice task2 fails after task1 is finished. I want to know if there is some way I can get the async result which is ready first.
I don't think multiprocessing's Pool is able to do this. You really should try concurrent.futures, it provides more functionality than Pool, and easier to use.concurrent.futures.as_completed is just for your task:And that's it.
You can look into Pool.imap_unordered:
