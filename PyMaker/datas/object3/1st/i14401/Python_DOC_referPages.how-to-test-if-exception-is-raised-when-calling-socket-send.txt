This question already has an answer here:How do you test that a Python function throws an exception?                    11 answers                This is my first time testing a socket interface using mocking. I have a class which invoked the _socket.sendto() method. I would like to test if an exception is raised. Update:I am writing some unit tests for the send method and one of the tests I want to do is to see if an exception was raised
If the send() method catches the exception, this will be rather difficult.  You might try monkey-patching the socket.send() method, but that's an iffy solution at best.  It seems to me that in this case, you're testing implementation details rather than conformance to an interface, which is a questionable strategy to begin with.If the send() method does not catch the exception, you can just use assertRaises().
