I have the following problem: in my directories I have numerous folders which all contain csv files with names in the following format:In order to make these files available on scale in python, I have to insert the name in the form of a formula ("xxxxxxxxxxxx-year-month-day-file-hour"). However, the first digits (in this case 00000562834) are random, so I cannot create a code that uses all files automatically. Hence my question: Does anybody know how I can remove these first 12 digits in all my csv.files? Changing all manually would not scale, unfortunately.

Using Regex. re.subOutput:
