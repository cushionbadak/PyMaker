I am trying to webscrape a page off of amazon. The part where I am stuck is how I get the data in a neat fashion. Currently I have a list, called a, with every item on the webpage of amazon. My code is this:This outputs the name of the products in an array called a. It looks something like this:Now my question is: How do i get the data out of this? I'm looking for the name and the price. So something like this:You get the gist. Is this even possible? I couldn't find it.Thanks alot!
you can pass you list of strings to the csv module, then take only first and fourth entry of each row. Split first entry according to opening parenthesis:result with your data:another method using csv writer for output only (but doesn't "space out" the fields, no space added before & after the separator):sys.stdout can be an opened file handle too.The most "complex" part is this:this is just taking first column, splitting according to parenthese, taking the first part (the left part), and remove leading/trailing space around.
