I am running a subprocess using 'Popen'. I need to block till this subprocess finishes and then read its output.I get an error that How can I read the output after the subprocess finishes, I do not want to use poll() though as the subprocess takes time and I would need to wait for its completion anyway.
This should work:However, subprocess.run() is preferred these days:
Use subprocess.check_output.  It returns the output of the command.
