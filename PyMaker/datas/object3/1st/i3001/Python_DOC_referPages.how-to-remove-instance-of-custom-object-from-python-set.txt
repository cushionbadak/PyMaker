I'm playing around with some basic card/deck manipulations in python. Below you can see my Card class and Deck class. Assume that I know that some cards are dead and would like to remove them from the deck.Raises the following error:What is the proper way of removing dead cards from my deck? And why the way I do it does not work?
You'll need two new methods on your Card class, for membership in sets and dicts to work sanely:This is because sets are implemented with hash tables, and unless you define how to hash and compare instances of your custom class, a hash based on the identity (memory location in CPython) will be used as a default.  Using id provides a fairly crappy default here - two cards with same number/suit would not be considered "equal" and the membership in a Deck is not recognised.
