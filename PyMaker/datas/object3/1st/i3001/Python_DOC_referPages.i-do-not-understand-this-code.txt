I want to understand it. Please help me. Thank you so much
First of all, you need to add missing indentations (as Colonbracket has mentioned)  You need to be careful with indentations in Python, since logic of Python program heavily depends on indentations.For more info on this see "First Steps Towards Programming" section of Python tutorialSecondly, based on what I understand about this code, its aim is to: Read lines from standard input (s = input()) until it gets an empty string from the user (break).Every line of this input is converted to an upper case (s.upper()) and stored in list data structure (lines.append)After user inputs an empty string, the program outputs all upper-cased strings to the standard output (for sentence in lines: print(sentence)) and then exits.
In python, input() method is used to get input from the user during runtime.By the way, I feel the code is not properly formatted. Basically, the code reads input from user and stores in a list as long as the user provides a valid string. Else it breaks the loop and prints all lines.
I am not the most adept in Python, but I think your indentation is off?Also, I didn't think thats how For works in Pyhton but I may be wrong. Anyways this is a start sorry for not being super useful ^^
Your indentation is wrong. The "else" statement has to be inside the while loop, or you will get an infinite loop. An empty string will be evaluated as false in python. Your program will ask the user for input and add it to a list as long as the input is not an empty string. If it is an empty string, it will break the while loop, and print whatever the user has entered before that.
The part that you commented is equivalent to:Its simply a shorter method of typing it
