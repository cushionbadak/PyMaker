I’m trying to install a Python script in ImageJ.  My preference is to use the script with ImageJ 1.x but can use Fiji if required.  I am trying to use the script with ImageJ 1.x by placing it in the plugins folder.  The script appears in the plugins menu but when I try to run it I get an error that it can't find __future__ This makes no sense to me as the __future__ module is being used to import the with_statement module and python version is listed as :from __future__ import with_statement is specifically designed for use with Python versions 2.5.xhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/future.htmlSo ... moving on ... I tired to use Fiji instead since it is based on ImageJ2.  I'm able to paste the code into the Script Editor using File > New > Script ... The code runs when executed from there.  However, when saved I can't get it to show up in the plugins menu.  I've tried saving it to :Fiji/pluginsFiji/plugins/ScriptsFiji/plugins/Scripts/PluginsThe file name has an _ in it.The version of Fiji I'm running is      ImageJ 2.0.0 rc-68/1.52e / Java1.8.0_172 (64-bit)The version of ImageJ 1.x I'm running is     ImageJ 1.52e / Java1.8.0_172 (64-bit)Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks
The canonical place to put scripts for ImageJ2 is scripts/Foo/Bar/My_Script.py, if you want it located in the menu at Foo > Bar > My Script.It also works for backwards compatibility to use plugins or plugins/Scripts. However, there was recently a critical bug preventing scripts from appearing in the plugins-based locations; see this thread. The bug is fixed in the latest release.
you might want to have a look here on the ij-wiki. Also, there ij2 has its own, very active forum where this topic is also activeley discussed.Best, Felix
