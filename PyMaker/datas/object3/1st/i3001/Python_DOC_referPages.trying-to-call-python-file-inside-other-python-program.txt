How to call one python file from another python fileExample : I have a file in C:\Python\a1.pyNow I am working on a2.py and want to call a1.py from a2.py. How can I achieve that?Also is it mandatory both should be on same location to call other either programs?
In a1.py:where some_func is a function you defined in a2.py. If you want to be more specific you could even doAs for whether the two files need to be in the same place: yes. If they're not in the same place, then you need to account for the directory structure, (e.g. import lib.a2 if a2.py is in a file called lib).It's possible for two files to not be in the same place, but then the files need to be on the pythonpath. This is a bit complicated for a newbie and I wouldn't recommend going too deep into it until you really understand the language better; all you need to know is that anything you install with pip, and all of python's built-in modules and libraries, are in a certain folder on the operating system. You can put a2.py in that folder, too, and it will work.
I assume you object to importing the code from a1 into a2 so you'll need the subprocess module:The argument should be the path to a1.py, which can be relative or absolute.I suggest you take a look at the module page https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocessAlthough, most of the time importing a1 into a2 will be the better solution.
If both files are in the same directory as shown below:Then you only need to import one into the other:test1.py:test2.py:Results:
