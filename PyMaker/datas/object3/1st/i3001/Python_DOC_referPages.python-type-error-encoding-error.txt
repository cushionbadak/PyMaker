what this error bytes like object is required not str..?I tried changing it to replaceb. Does not work
After performing tr=utf_string.encode('utf8'), tr is a bytes object. Methods on bytes objects expect bytes arguments, not str arguments. So you need to make the arguments to replace bytes literals, using the b prefix (you don't need the r prefix here; it's not a regex, and there are no backslashes in it in any event):
