I expect that I may have done something wrong whilst typing the vowel checker if argument as I am fairly new to the concept of reading characters in strings. I would appreciate if someone would help me on debugging this code.If that however is not the case, than I would, again, appreciate if someone would help on telling me what I've done wrong.
'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' in String:evaluates as('a') or ('e') or ('i') or ('o') or ('u' in String). Since 'a' is truthy in python, this evaluates to True.You can either writeif 'a' in String or 'e' in String ...oror perhapsif any(s in String for s in 'aeiou'):or (credit to Onyambu):
Your conditions is a tautology:
Looks like you are evaluating the character itself as a bool.It is detecting 'a' as True and returning true.Try something more like:see: How to check a string for specific characters?
'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u' in String is always true. What you meant to do is:Or, using any:
