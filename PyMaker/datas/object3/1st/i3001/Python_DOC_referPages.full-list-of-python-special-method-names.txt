This question already has an answer here:Is there a comprehensive table of Python's “magic constants”?                    1 answer                I'm wondering if there's a way to list all the special methods (like __getattr__, __lt__) programmatically instead of going to the Python data model documentation and copy paste all of them. Since I can use dir(builtins) to retrieve a list of builtin identifiers, so I was hoping there's also a way for the special methods.
No, there isn't a canonical way to get that from the language itself. You're stuck with the documentation (which is not a bad thing).I mean, you could always do that
