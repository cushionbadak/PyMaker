Natural Text
My input file test.sas file looks like below:When I use the following code I get the result that is right after the code:the result:But I would like to get the following result:I can't figure out what I am doing wrong. Basically I want to remove the text within the comment block and write the rest to the output file.
Change your finaltoThat way you can hit both statements if they both exist on the same line.
I've added some comments showing the status of your writing variable at the end of each line.Do you see where the problem comes in? Since the if-statement can is only evaluated once per line (once per loop), it does not set writing to True after lines that have both the /* and */.To check for both of the comment signs on a single line, allow both if-statements to work in one loop. Change elif '*/' in line: at the end of your program to if '*/' in line. This way, it can set to writing at the end of each loop, even if it set writing to False at first!
One Option may be to use regex (re.sub()) to match your quotes and substitute it with an empty string.More on RegexThe re.sub() method is for "substituting matches" with something elsere.sub(pattern, substitute, string)Pattern: (/*[\s\S\w\W]**/\r?\n?) - catch everything between quotes followed by maybe a return or newline
