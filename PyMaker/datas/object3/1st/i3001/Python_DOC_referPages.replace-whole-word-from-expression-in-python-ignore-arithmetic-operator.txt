Natural Text
I have an expression as string like"(addtwodecimalp_cost)/(cost+density)".I want to replace cost only but but its replacing p_cost as well like -p_"replaced value" . I have tried word boundaries but no luck please help. 
Using regex.Output:
Insert all characters inhibiting the replacement of search word in the square brackets before ((?<![_])) and after ((?![_])) of the search word (cost in this case) in the regex pattern string.
