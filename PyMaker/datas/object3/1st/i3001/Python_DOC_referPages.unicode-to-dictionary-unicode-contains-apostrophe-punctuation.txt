Given that there is an apostrophe within the string, you'll have to do some pre-processing before you even attempt to parse it into a dict. Assuming that all strings within the target dict are unicode and that closing strings have to be followed immediately by a control character (i.e. }, :, ,, }, whitespace...) you can search for all apostrophes that do not match these two categories and escape them. Then you can use ast.literal_eval() to parse it into a dict, something like:Keep in mind, tho, that just a simple:Will throw it off - sure, it would be an illegal dictionary in the source as well, but keep in mind these limitations and adjust your pre-process regex accordingly.
