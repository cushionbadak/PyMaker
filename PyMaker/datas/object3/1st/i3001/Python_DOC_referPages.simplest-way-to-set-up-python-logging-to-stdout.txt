I have the following to set up a basic logger to print output in a cron job:Is this the most straightforward way to do this, or is there a better method?
If you just need to print the messages to the stdout, then logging.basicConfig is a handy shortcut for the configuration you listed. It will create a StreamHandler, attach the default Formatter to it and attach the handler to the root logger.Check out the docs for more configuration possibilities; for example,will configure writing to file some.log instead of stdout.Note that logging.basicConfig won't do a thing if the logger is already configured (meaning that there are handlers attached to the root logger already). So this code:will not configure logging to stdout anymore; you will have to do it yourself.
