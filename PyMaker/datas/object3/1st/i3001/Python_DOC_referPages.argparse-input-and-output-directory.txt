So I am trying to use python's argparse to get images from a directory modify them and store them in a new directory but I'm having trouble. For example say I have a directory named classes which has 50 different classes each having 100 different images.Then I should so something with these images and save them into a new different directory classes_2 I want to be able to specify something How can I use argparse in order to do this. Also I'm using scipy imsave however I have to change the path in my code every single time.Edited:Ok thank you @nosklo, Now the problem that I'm having is this I'm using imgaug library for image augmentation and my code is this:suppose I have all the imports needed, cv2, imgaug, argparse, os, sys, etc. I've also tried for the last part:However when I call the file python filename.py --input /path/classes/A --dest /path/classes/B I do not get any of images saved in the new directory. Like for example if I had 5 images in directory A I was expecting to have 50 images in directory B since I have augmented each image 10 times and want to save all versions of my original images.
I will help with the argparse part, so you can focus on your "something" you must do to the images:This assumes your function do_something will be able to return a result and a new result_filename that will be used to write the file in the --dest directory - if you want to use the same filename just use the filename variable instead.
