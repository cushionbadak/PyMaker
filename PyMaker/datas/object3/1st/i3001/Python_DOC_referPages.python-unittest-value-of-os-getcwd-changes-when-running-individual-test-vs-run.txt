I have a test which uses os.getcwd() to determine the path to a file. When running pytest -k test_name, I see the value of os.getcwd() to be my project root where as when running pytest --cov --cov-report html the same test fails because the value returned by os.getcwd() is some other path, some nested directories inside the folder test (containing all the tests) in my project root.Is there an easy way to standardise this behaviour or getting the result of os.getcwd as when running for individual tests by some other library method such that I don't need to write long path names in my source code?
os.getcwd() returns a current working directory, which means that any part of the script or other module may perform actions, that will make it's value change.Depending on your purpose you can use value of __file__ (along with helpers provided by os.path) to determine path to your module/test in the filesystem.
