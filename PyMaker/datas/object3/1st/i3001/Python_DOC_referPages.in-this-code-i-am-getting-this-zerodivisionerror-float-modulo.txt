In above code I am getting this error:My Expected output is:Here I want at least two perfect square elements from b. In other words, I want c to be a list of each tuple in b that contains at least two perfect squares.
We can solve this task by testing each item in each tuple and counting how many of those items are perfect squares. To determine if a number is a perfect square we use a helper function, is_square. To count the perfect squares we can use the sum built-in.outputis_square(u) returns True if u is a perfect square, and False if it's not. But True has a numeric value of 1, and False has a numeric value of 0. So sum(is_square(u) for u in t) adds up how many numbers in each tuple t are perfect squares.
You could count the perfect squares with a collections.Counter(), and retrieve the tuples that have atleast 2 perfect squares:Which Outputs:Note: The above Counter() can also be written as:But this becomes hard to read.
