Natural Text
I want to print {alias fmtime='find . -type f -printf "%T+\t%p\n" | sort'} exactly. I don't want to escape any characters. Is there a function that prints exactly anything we give it without having to escape any special characters? 
Wrap your string in triple quotes (either ''' or """) and prefix the quotes with r (for "raw string").That way you won't have to escape \, ', or ".Limitation:[...] a raw literal cannot end in a single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part of the literal, not as a line continuation.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
