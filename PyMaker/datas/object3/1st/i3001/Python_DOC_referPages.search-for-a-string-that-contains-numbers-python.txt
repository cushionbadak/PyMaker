Natural Text
So I have the following code:The line: if '"xe-" + #anynumber + "/" #anynumber + "/" + #anynumber' in line: Is what I'm struggling with syntax-wise.I am looking to see if a line in the file contains the following string: "xe-number/number/number" (ex: "xe-6/1/10"). It will always have this format, but the numbers will change. What sort of syntax would I use to do this most efficiently.Thanks!
You can use regular expressions for this.  Regular expressions allow you to specify a pattern of text (though not all patterns can be expressed as a regular expression).  We can then compile that expression into a Pattern object, and use that object to search strings for the pattern.
Sounds like a job for the Regular Expressions library!Is this number a date? You can restrict the amount of digits. The regular expression: xe-\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{1,2} matches "xe-" followed by 3 groups of digit pairs with a slash separator. Each group of digits can be 1 or 2 characters in length.SidenotesYou don't need to close config_file since the with statement does that for you when you exit the block.I'm not sure what you were trying to accomplish with cus_str += i when there is no match for the pattern. As it stands, it will just repeat the same i from the previous line, unless you indent that line by 1 level. Or give you an error if the first line doesn't contain the pattern.
You can test a regex with a simple program like with some online tools like https://pythex.org/ , and then make your program, a little sample to point you in the right direction would be:
