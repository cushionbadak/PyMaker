Natural Text
I have an old file written using python2, which contains things like 148191387849281587952L.When I try to read it (using ast.literal_eval) in python3, I, naturally, get SyntaxError: invalid syntax.Is there anything I could do to read the file into python3?PS. The only solutions I see at this time require modifying the file:Convert to JSON: read the file into python2, write it using json, then read into python3 using json.Remove the offending L using sed -i 's/([0-9]+)L/\1/g'.Convert the file using 2to3 (suggested by @user3080953).Is there anything better?
After your clarification, there is a simple answer:No, you cannot modify ast.leteral_eval() or the python interpreter to be "backwards compatible" with the L syntax.
