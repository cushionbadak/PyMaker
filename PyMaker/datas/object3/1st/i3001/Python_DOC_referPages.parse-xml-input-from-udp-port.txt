Natural Text
I'm a newbie in python, just done only a couple of scripts.Now I need to listen and process a xml text that is being received from a udp socket.By the moment I have the first part but i don't know how to proceed.I'm receiving the data ok, and it's printed on the screen:But I need to get or parse de values in bold:and asign to something like a var with it's sub objects:power.ch0 = 609.00power.ch1 = 42.00power.ch2 = 538.00with that variable, then I will do a request to my porwer monitoring system api to send these values.I usually use bash for scripting, and I'm pretty happy with it, but I think that this time not rich enough and python seems to be my solutionThanks in advance for your help!!
There are several ways to do this.  First, I do not see where you are using the xml.etree module.  Take a look at the docs real fast: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html Also, you can achieve this with BeautifulSoup as well: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/Lastly, you can achieve this with the .replace() and .strip() functions as well
