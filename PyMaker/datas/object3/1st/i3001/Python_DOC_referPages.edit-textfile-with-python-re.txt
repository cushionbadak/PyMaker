Natural Text
I have a large textfile (>200mb) with 70k rows. Now I want to find some special text in each row an place it again at the end of each row (separated with a $-symbol). N++ and Regex works, but is a bit slow, so I want try it with python.With the code I'll get a "TypeError: must be str, not list" for fn.write(text+run+"\n")Does anyone know the error and also knows if there is an even faster way (code)?
re.findall returns a list of strings - i.e. all matches found in the text given to it.To include it again at the end, you can join all the matches together:If you only want one match, you can use re.search instead:It works with your example:But since re.search will give None if there isn't a match, you can check that you get a proper match before attempting to retrieve the group (as you do in your findall above):
