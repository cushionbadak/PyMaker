I am attempting to start a simple HTTP web server in python and then ping it with the selenium driver. I can get the web server to start but it "hangs" after the server starts even though I have started it in a new thread.The server starts but the script execution stops after the server has started. The code after I start the thread is never executed. How do I get the server to start and then have the code continue execution? 
Start your thread with function create_server (without calling it ()):If you call create_server(), it will stop at httpd.serve_forever().
