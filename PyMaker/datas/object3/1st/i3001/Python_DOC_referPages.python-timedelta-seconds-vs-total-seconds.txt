Looking at the datetime docs, I can't seem to get the difference between the attribute seconds and the method total_seconds() used on a timedelta object. Is it just precision? Begin that the former is and int and the latter a float? Or am I missing something?
seconds is the number of seconds within a day, which is in [0, 86399].  total_seconds is the entire timedelta converted to seconds, and can be any value, for example 604800.0 for one week, or 0.1 for 100 milliseconds.
