I need to automate some pdf documents downloads with python and selenium. The preferences of chrome and firefox are already done to automate download, but I have a problem with this especific website, it does not download the document automatically, it opens a new tabwebsite: http://sistemas.sefaz.ma.gov.br/certidoes/jsp/emissaoCertidaoNegativa/emissaoCertidaoNegativa.jsf  Select CPF/CNPJ and use this number to access the document 22977333000108.After filling the form I get the document in a new tab with the same url like on the screenshot Documment Screenshot (Sorry, had to hide the documments numbers). If I manually download it and rename as PDF file it works fine.How can I download it as a pdf file with selenium?My code is like:Then I try to download the file with glob like this:but it prints something like:[emissaoCertidaoNegativa.jsf;jsessionid=44297D6C88452FC479FC0E94013D3C0A]and when I try to rename it to pdf I get an empty file... can someone help?
As per documentaion:Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname, which  must be a string containing a path specification. pathname can be  either absolute (like /usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile) or relative (like  ../../Tools//.gif), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken  symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell).so you have to specify the path to the file. Example:lets say we have two output.txt files in two different directories:C:\\Test\\output.txtC:\\Users\\userName\\Desktop\\output.txtthen if we try the following code:output will be:So you have to specify the path to the directory, where your file is saved. You can use **, but as documentation says:Note Using the “**” pattern in large directory trees may consume an  inordinate amount of time.
