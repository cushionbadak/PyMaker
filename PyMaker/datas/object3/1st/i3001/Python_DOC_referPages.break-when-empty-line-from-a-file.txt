If there's lines after an empty line (or your text editor inserted an empty line at the end of the file), it's not actually empty. It has a new line character and/or carriage return You need to strip it off 
You can do this relatively easily by utilizing an optional feature of the built-in iter() function by passing it a second argument (called sentinel in the docs) that will cause it to stop if the value is encountered while iterating.Here's what how use it to make the line processing loop terminate if  an empty line is encountered:Note the rstrip() which removes the newline at the end of each line read.
Your code is fine, I can't put a picture in a comment.  It all works, here:
