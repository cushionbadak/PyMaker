Let's consider given a list [4, 5, 2, 19, 3, 8, 9] and given number is 8then the output should be [4, 5, 2] because in output list there is no element greater than 8 and it is the only list with highest number of consecutive number. Please tell me the code in python 3*NOTE: Please tell the logic without using import module.Here is my codeI am trying to get the explained output for list_of_eligible_plots() in my code. Please any one help or suggest any logic.Thanks in advance
Just keep a "max list" and update it as you go.I'm pretty sure that will work
Time for  takewhile:How?Make an iterator that returns elements from the iterable as long as the predicate is true.
For grouping elements you can use groupby from itertools (docs here). This code snippet will find sublist with maximal consecutive elements that each element <= number (8 in this case): This will print:EDIT (to explain):1.step is to find groups where elements are <= of selected number:Prints:2.step is filter out False groups:Prints:3.step is find sublist with maximum number of elements (max() function with key argument, as key we use len() function):Prints:
You can use itertools.takewhile for finding all sub lists that are less than 8 and then use max to find the biggest listIf you dont want to import itertools methods chain and takewhile, you can define it yourself
