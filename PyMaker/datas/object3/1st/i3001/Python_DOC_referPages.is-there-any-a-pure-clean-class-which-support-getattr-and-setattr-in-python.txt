I use a Context class:So I can use this class to define a object which support getattr and setattr. I want to use the object to communicate between some threads.However I think it is stupid to let the user define such a class. So I want to find out is there any a primitive type or a class from the standard library which support getattr and setattr.I have tried the object class, but the object of it can not set attribute:I can set c.d = 1, but a.b complains 'object' object has no attribute 'b'ã€‚
Try types.SimpleNamespace:A simple object subclass that provides attribute access to its namespace, as well as a meaningful repr.Unlike object, with SimpleNamespace you can add and remove attributes.
