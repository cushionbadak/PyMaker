Building off of the answer to How to wait until the page is loaded with Selenium for Python? I am attempting to create a method that allows multiple elements to be polled for presence using Expected Conditions. I receive an error 'bool' object is not callable on the line containing: wait.until(any(expectations)). The thought process was to allow an number of Xpaths to be passed as expected conditions, then using any(), in a similar manner to this java based answer, Trying to wait for one of two elements in the page using selenium xpath, check if any of the conditions are present.What would be the proper way use any() in this case? Or better yet, what needs to be done for this method to work?Assume that the Selenium .get('url') has already been executed immediately prior to calling this method.
You can have an expected condition class to wait for a combination of expected conditions.  Here is an example of one.This would then be used by building an array of the expected conditions and checking for all of them in the same wait.  (Example lines split for clarity.)This will perform one five second wait while checking for visibility of two different elements.I have documented this further in a blog post here.
Once I realized Xpath has the ability for unions, the following method works. I will leave this answer open in case anyone else has a better one.
