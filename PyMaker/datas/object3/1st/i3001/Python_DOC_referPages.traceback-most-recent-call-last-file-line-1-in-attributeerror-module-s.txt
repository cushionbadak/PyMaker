I need to write a program that retrieves the IP addresses of a list of domain names. The simple example can be shown here:After I try to close the socket, I get this error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in   AttributeError: module 'socket' has no attribute 'close'How can I close this socket? I need to close it because my actual program has loop where in each domain name in the list I needs to get its IP, so I need to close the socket in each iteration for the new host.Can you tell me what is the problem? 
The socket in your code refers to the socket module, which has no close function. A new module level close function has been added in Python 3.7, but it requires a socket descriptor as an argument. If I get it right, you want to call the close method of socket object, not the module. In your case you don't need to close any connection.
You don't create a socket here neither you bind it to any port. What socket.gethostbyname('google.com') does is translate a host name to IPv4 address format. The method .close() has effect in open connections.
