i was working on a programm, that changes your MAC adress in python. I'm really struggling with this error. This is my code so far:This is the error that I'm getting: This error refers to my print line. I have already tried:  print("[+] Changing MAC address for " + str(interface) + " to " + str(new_mac)) but that didn't work. When I do that, I'm getting this error: Changing optparse to argparse in the entire code, didn't solve the problem.I didn't give any command line arguments, because I want the user to be able to give them themselves. Hope you can help me out. Thanks.
Turnes out my code was perfectly fine. I just had to pass some command lines in the terminal first before running the code. Instead I wanted to run the code and then pass arguments.
