This question already has an answer here:How to access the type arguments of typing.Generic?                    4 answers                I have some list types (coming from inspect.signature -> inspect.Parameter) and I'd like to get to know the type of their elements. My current solution works but is extremely ugly, see minimal example below:What would be the correct way to get the type of a List's elements?(I'm using Python 3.6 and the code should survive a check with mypy --strict.)
I believe that you should be able to check the __args__ parameter:But note from the docs:Note The typing module has been included in the standard library on a provisional basis. New features might be added and API may change  even between minor releases if deemed necessary by the core  developers.So this probably isn't future proof.
