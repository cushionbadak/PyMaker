trying to replace comma between 2 words Durango and PC in the second line by & and then remove the quotes " as well.

So the expected output is:So far, I could think of reading line by line and then if the line contains quote replace it with no character but then replacement of symbol inside is something I am stuck with.How to achieve this, any suggestion? Learning Python.
