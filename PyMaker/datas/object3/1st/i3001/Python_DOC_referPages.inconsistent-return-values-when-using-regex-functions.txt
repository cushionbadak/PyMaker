This question already has an answer here:Why can't I call read() twice on an open file?                    7 answers                Python : The second for loop is not running                    1 answer                My code is behaving strangely, and I have a feeling it has to do with the regular expressions i'm using. I'm trying to determine the number of total words, number of unique words, and number of sentences in a text file.Here is my code: The output is the following:What is really strange is that if I comment out the sentence_count() function, the word_count() function starts working and outputs the correct numbers.Why is this inconsistency happening? If I comment out either function, one will output the correct value while  the other will output 0's. Can someone help me such that both functions work?
The issue is that you can only iterate over an open file once. You need to either reopen or rewind the file to iterate over it again.For example:Alternatively, f.seek(0) would rewind the file.
Make sure to open and close your file properly. One way you can do this is by saving all the text first.The with statement can be used to open and safely close the file handle. Since you would have extracted all the contents into file, you don't need the file open anymore.
