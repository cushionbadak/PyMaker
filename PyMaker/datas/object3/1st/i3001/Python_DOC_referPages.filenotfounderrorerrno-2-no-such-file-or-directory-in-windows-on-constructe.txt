My file path is There are many folders in that directory. I need to look through those directories and open files that starts with 'RC_'Here's my code:But it seems there is some mistake in the path. I get an error Traceback (most recent call last):   File  "C:/Users/Ratul/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37/test02.py",  line 36, in       with open('C:/Users/Ratul/Downloads/Machine_Learning_Data/reddit_data/reddit_data/{}/RC_{}'.format(timeframe.split('-')[0],timeframe), buffering=1000) as f: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or  directory:  'C:/Users/Ratul/Downloads/Machine_Learning_Data/reddit_data/reddit_data/2015/RC_2015-05'I'm not sure what wrong I did there. Please help. 
Use How to debug small programs (#1) and  instead of open. Check if all exists - because for some of your values it does not exist. Hence the error. If most of your files exist, it is far easier to handle the error itself:The open() command does not care about you using \ or / - if using \ you should escape it or use raw strings (aka: r'C:\some\dir\file.txt') - your syntax is ok as is - open() will use the appropriate directory delimiters under windows even if you give it 'c:/somedir/file.txt'Readup: About error handling
