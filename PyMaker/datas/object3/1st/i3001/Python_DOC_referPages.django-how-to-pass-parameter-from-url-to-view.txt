I'm trying to append a parameter no_rep at the end of my question url as a signal to show different views. I'm using Django 1.8 and following the url pattern from askbot.This is the url.py:I'm trying to show different displays depending on the value of no_rep in my url.This is the view:I couldn't find information on what the +,%,? do, which is probably where the problem is. Could someone explain how the regex work with the base url? When I enter the url http://localhost:8000/question6/test-question/no_rep:1, request.session['no_rep'] should be set to true, but it's not. What am I missing?
Your url looks like this after all substitutions (%): r'^question(?P<id>\d+)/(/no-rep:(?P<no_rep>\w+))?', so:1. Missing part for test-question2. You have odd grouping around named group no_rep (which is legal, but not recommended)  So for url like http://localhost:8000/question6/test-question/no_rep:1 your url pattern should look like this:r'^%s(?P<id>\d+)/test-question/(?:no_rep:(?P<no_rep>\d+))?' % QUESTION_PAGE_BASE_URL.strip('/') (you can change \d+ in the last group for \w+ if you want letters to match too).About non-capturing groups (?:...) and meaning of + and ? you can read in the documentation of Python re module.
Change your url patterns to something like this,ORNOTE : It's not good idea to use named groups like id along with some string or char like urls, (localhost:8000/question6/)
