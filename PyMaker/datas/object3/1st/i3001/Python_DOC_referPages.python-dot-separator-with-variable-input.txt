I'm currently attempting to write a program that takes in a user input of units and magnitude and converts them to a user defines the unit. So basically just a unit converter (still doing beginner projects with Python).But for the module pint, it uses a dot separator as the way to get the units, like so:Now 8 is tied to meters. But say I want to let the user define the unit. So have a variable defined by an input attached to ureg like so:The problem is python thinks I'm trying to access an attribute called inp from ureg, which doesn't exist. if inp=meters, why won't it work as ureg.meters worked? How can you attach variables to call attributes from a module?
You could use getattr(object, name):
