My plan is to take every value in a python dict, so I have done that.now I want to compare the VALUES in this dict and return the result of max-min. How could i do this ?thanks in advance
You can get the values of a dict with data.values(). That gives you a perfectly good iterable that you can pass to max or min:Or you can get the key-value pairs with data.items(), and pass the result to max or min with a key function that compares on the second part of the pair instead of the first:Or, instead of writing the key function manually, you can use operator.itemgetter to do it for you:Or you can get the keys (either with data.keys(), or just using data itself as the iterableâ€”dictionaries are iterables of their keys), and use the dict's data.get method as your key function:Or, if you need to do a lot of these value-based searches, you might want to create a reverse dictionary:
If you want just the values:If you want the key (getting the value later is easy):
