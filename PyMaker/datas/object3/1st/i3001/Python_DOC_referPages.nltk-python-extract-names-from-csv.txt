Natural Text
i've got a CSV which contains article's text in different raws. Like we have column 1:Hello i am John Tom has got a Dog... more text.I'm trying the extract the first names and surname from those text and i was able to do that if i copy and paste the single text in the code. But i don't know how to read the csv in the code and then it has to processes the different texts in the raws extracting name and surname. Here is my code working with the text in it: So i would like to remove all the text from the code and want the code to process the text from my csv. Thanks a lot :) 
CSV stands for Comma Separated Values and is a text format used to represent tabular data in plain text. Commas are used as column separators and line breaks as row separators. Your string does not look like a real csv file. Nevermind the extension you can still read your text file like this:Your text file is now available as my_text in the rest of your code.
Pandas has read_csv command:
