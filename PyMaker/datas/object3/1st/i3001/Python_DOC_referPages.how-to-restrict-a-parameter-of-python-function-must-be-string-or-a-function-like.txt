For example, the following, the first parameter should be restricted to a string, and the second parameter should be a function. However, this is wrong syntax for both. Anyone can help suggest the correct syntax to impose the type restriction?It gives errorand
You can use the typing module.assuming your function converter takes a string a returns a string, and that get_arg returns a string. Note the code has also been modified to follow python's naming convention and uses f strings over older style format strings.Also note that these type hints are just that, hints. They are not checked statically or at runtime. Although, certain IDE's will help you ensure they are correct.
You should use str instead of String and Callable instead of lambda:That is, unless you have a specific class called String and you are expecting an argument of its type.When you write lambda you are defining a new lambda, not specifying a type for a function, whence the error.I believe it is also important to point out that types in python are only a useful notation but it does not raise any error by itself, for example I could still call GetArg(1,2,3) and don't get any error just by the type hinting (of course I would get an error trying to pass an argument to an int afterwards).
