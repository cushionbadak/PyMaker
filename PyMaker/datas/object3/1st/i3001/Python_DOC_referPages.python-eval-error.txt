Getting Error:    Why am I getting above error? Also, How to specify only a few built-in methods for eval() function? For example, allowing only max and min functions.
From the builtins docs:The value of __builtins__ is normally either this module [builtins] or the value of this module's __dict__ attributeTo fix your error: To specify a few built-in methods, provide it to __builtins__However, limiting __builtins__ is still not safe: see https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html 
Why am I getting above error?Python tries to look for the name 'x' within the builtins you've provided, and fails like that:You would need to include x in scope too:How to specify only a few built-in methods for eval() function? You can not sandbox this way.  It's always possible to escape the sandbox, for example via an attribute access on literals.
Is the same reason why you don't get defined 'x' if you do:you get: NameError: name 'x' is not defined because you override all your context.but if you just do:will print '6' but will use ALL the builtins functions, probably you just wanna do:
One of the possible solutions would be to get current globals end clear the builtins
