Natural Text
I have the following line in a code. I know more or less what it does - allocates some memory for an array of buffers. I am trying to investigate the meaning of the syntax - what are the additional parenthesis used for? The content inside the first parenthesis doesn't look like a function. I saw that the construct of double parentheses is used if one function is embedded in another one, but it still doesn't look like that. Moreover when deleting no_ofBuffers variable (as if it was just 1) does not make a 1 - buffer array, the variable itself is necessary, otherwise in next parts of the code the application crashes.Does somebody have more experience with constructs like that?
First of all, here's the official ctypes doc page: [Python]: ctypes - A foreign function library for Python (you might want to take a look at the Arrays section).The rule that always applies when dealing a complex expression is: break it in simpler ones. I'm going to start from the inside (pointing all the intermediary steps), and do it in a Python console (also changing some variable names for clarity):
