I have a long script to match devices names by regular expressions. However, the devices names looks alike and some times the other types of the machines just a letter extra. e.g. yel15 is the HP machine, but yel15e is the Cisco machine. However, it matches with the first match When I set the device name to "yel11x" The output for that will be "This is the HP Machine" which is wrong.Also, I am not willing to change the order of the matches. So, How I should make the regex stop at the exact match ?
Like Alex already mentioned you need to add the $ character, but you also would need to add the + character to tell python that it can expect one or more numbers.I would change the regex like so:I would also change the elif clause, otherwise there won't be a match, the regex is expecting only one digit and your string has two, my suggestion:
From the re.match documentation:If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object.You can specify the that the match should go until the end of the string using a $:
