I have array2D = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]. What I want is a function which takes an index and returns the elements in 1D array.I need a fast way to do this.
you can use lambda and list comprehension:as suggested in the comments, you may apply the same concept with a function definition:Lambda functions are pretty useful, and let you define operation in a really clear way.In our example, our lambda accept a variable x, which represent the index we want of each item in array2DThen you have list comprehension, similarly to lambda function, they are a really powerful tool and a must in pythonIn this situation you should prefear the function definiton, as suggested by PEP-8.
The following list comprehension will work:
You can use operator.itemgetter:If you want to define new functions for retrieving a specific index, you can do so via functools.partial:
Here are my two cents using slicing (I have to use additional np.array() for this because your original data was a list):
How about a generator?We could use zip to pack them, then create a empty list to store the generated data:The benefits of this is we do not need to produce all data at once.
