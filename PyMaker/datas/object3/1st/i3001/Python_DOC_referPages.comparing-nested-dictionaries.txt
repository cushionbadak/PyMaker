I would like to compare nested dictionaries as following:d is the total full dictionaries that will be use to compare with e, f and g.If e happens to found in siteA-00000000, then I would like both value (in this case 3 and 5) add up to become 8.If f is not found (in this case, it's true), I would like to append the dictionary into the d['siteB'].If g is not found, would like to append into d.Thanks!
collections.Counter is useful for summing values in dictionaries and adding keys where they do not exist. Since Counter is a subclass of dict, this should not break other operations. Apart from a one-off conversion cost, it is efficient and designed specifically for such tasks.Result:
You can use Counter from collections in combination with defaultdict.As the name suggests, the counter counts the same elements, and a defaultdict lets you access non-existing keys by providing a default value (an empty Counter in this case). Your code then becomes
Given the format of your dictionaries dict[site][address], let's say, this merge function will take the values from dictFrom and insert them into dictTo according to your rules.This may be preferable to jpp's answer because the objects at dict[site] are all still basic dicts.
