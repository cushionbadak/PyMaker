Natural Text
I have a text file in the following manner: From this text file, I want to extract the URLs i.e only the main domain like 'en.wikipedia.org','www.bbc.co.uk' etc into Links.txt And the Title i.e 'Scotland - Wikipedia','VisitScotland - Official Site' etc into Titles.txt I'm new to regex, tried using some regex function to extract but wasn't successful.

If your file is an html file you can use Beautifulsoup
Write To FileOutput:
Even though regex solutions will work, using regex to parse HTML is almost always a bad idea. You can get all sorts of issues if previously unexpected symbols are encountered or tags have additional arguments, etc.Here's a way to do it with python's built-in libraries for parsing HTML and URLs.Used modules are html.parser and urllib.parse
