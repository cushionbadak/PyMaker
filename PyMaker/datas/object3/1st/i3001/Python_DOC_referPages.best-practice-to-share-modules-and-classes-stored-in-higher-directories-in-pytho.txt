I am writing some scripts for a bigger machine learning application. To keep it nicely structured, I have some subdirectories for different steps, e.g.So what I would like to have, is a clean possibility to use code from utils in preprocessing and training modules. However, the problem is that I run the code directly in the subdirectories, e.g.So this means that preprocessing is my main module and this cannot see anything that is contained in a higher directory, thus I also cannot import modules form utils. I know that there would be some possibilities that include changing the PYTHONPATH, but I find this somehow ugly. Everybody using my code would have to do this. So my question is if there is a clean and recommended way of importing code from parent or sibling directories.
You can use relative imports as it presented in documentation. So you can try something like this in your preprocess module:
