I want to convert a stringto in python, how can I do that?
You can use the str.encode() method to convert a string to bytes. Please refer to: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encode
You can use b = bytes(mystring, 'utf-8') notation to turn your string into bytes object. But there are many similar questions and related answers in stackoverflow to your question. You should have searched for your question first.
