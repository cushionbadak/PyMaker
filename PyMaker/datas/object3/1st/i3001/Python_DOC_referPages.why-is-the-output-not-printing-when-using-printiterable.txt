I am not getting why  output is not printed for case 1 and in second case after using list it's working.Case one:OutputCase two:Output
From the Python documentation:reversed(seq)Return a reverse iterator. seq must be an object which has a  __reversed__() method or supports the sequence protocol (the  __len__() method and the __getitem__() method with integer  arguments starting at 0).list([iterable])The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same  order as iterableâ€™s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a  container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable  is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to  iterable[:]. For example, list('abc') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] and  list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3]. If no argument is given, the  constructor creates a new empty list, [].So:reversed(string) will return an iterator that travels backwards through the string. list(iterator) turns that iterator into a list. list(string) will split a string up into its constituent characters.Thuslist('india') returns ['i', 'n', 'd', 'i', 'a']reversed('india') returns <reversed object at 0x1090b48d0>, which is an iteratoryou can convert the iterator into a list using the list operator:list(reversed('india')) returning  ['a', 'i', 'd', 'n', 'i']or you could iterate through it:which prints out
If you want the reversed string, try the following:This is because reversed outputs an iterator, which doesn't hold values, but rather computes them on the fly. The ''.join part consumes the generator and makes a string.See here for more information on generators/iterators.
