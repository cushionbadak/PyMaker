7, but also need to use libraries that I have installed on a different version of python - 3.7My main script runs with python 2.7, from which I need to pass some parameters to a separate python script which requires python 3.7Is this feasible ?Thanks
Maybe you could use the pickle module to save the parameters from the 2.7 script and then load the pickle object in the 3.7 script. https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
