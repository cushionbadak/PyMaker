I am writing a python script to automate some simulations with Aspen Plus via its COM functions. But when I want to get access to molecular weights values, I have to write something like this:But it launchs a syntax error in REVIEW-1, due to hyphens can not be used as identifiers. How can I use them like that?EDIT:I replaced dot synax for FindNode function of Aspen COM like that:But I still get a None object, however this:works, getting the "COMObject FindNode" so I think that the problem is in the hyphen as well.Thanks in advance!
Thanks for the tip For cases of having hyphens, the following should work instead of escaping the "\" character:
Ok, I was breaking my head trying to solve it in Python, but was easier solving it in Aspen renaming the node. I've noticed, also, that spaces sometimes give problems too, so should be renamed as well. In some cases it can't be done or I don't know how, for example:It returns a None object and I don't know hot to rename "MW ACID", but there is a tricky way to get the value:For now it works for me, however it will be slower due to iteration. So if someone knows how to solve the problem in Python without renaming names, it will be still helpful. I tried to use unicode and bytes notation for non-breaking hyphen but it didn't works too.Regards!
