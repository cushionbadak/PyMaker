An external device provides me a titmestamp IN LOCALIZED TIMEZONE.This means I get the number of seconds since 1970 January,1st 00:00:00 IN LOCALTIME.I need to convert this to UTC timestamp (or any other standard notation) to use it to set the Linux clock (e.g.: "date -s @< timestamp >").My current TZ is CEST (Europe/Rome), but that might change.What is the right way to do that?
Just apply to your retrieved timestamp the local time zone's difference from UTC - the easiest way to do that is to use time.altzone (if you don't want to account for DST, use time.timezone instead) and add it to your timestamp, so:
You can add/take the difference between your current timezone and UTC in seconds.For example, if your are in CEST, then this is UTC+2, so you can simply do: 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute, 2 because we are 2 hours away from UTC and -1 because we are ahead of it.
