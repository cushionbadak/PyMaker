I am trying to run PCA on my dataset. I came across a tutorial by Ritchie Ng: https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-project-customer-segments/ and i am trying to recreate it on my dataset. However, the blog uses a package called "renders" which i am unable to find in Anaconda. How and where do i get and enable this package from? I have searched for this package in Anaconda navigator and google but i cant seem to find it.
here's the link to 'renders', as provided in the tutorial:https://github.com/ritchieng/machine-learning-nanodegree/tree/master/unsupervised_learning/customer_segments
