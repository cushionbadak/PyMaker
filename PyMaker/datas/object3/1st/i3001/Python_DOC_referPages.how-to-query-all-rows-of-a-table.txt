I'm using Python Sqlalchemy for MYSQL db. I wrote the following script to create the class object and then added some rows in the table.Now, I need to get all the rows from the table "User" so I am doing this:but the output I am getting is not the table data but this:How would I get the actual data from the table? Any help would be appreciated
The output you will get is a tuple of records.So, use a loop
