I'm having problems figuring out how to get the Censys Python API to export search queries into a CSV file. Apparently, it has an EXPORT API and I've tried importing it into my code, but it still gives me an undefined function call.I can get the search query information I specified to display in a terminal with Ubuntu 14.04, but I get this error after it finishes displaying them:Traceback (most recent call last):   File  "CensysAccumulationScript.py", line 60, in       censys_start_export(d, format = c("csv"), flatten = TRUE, compress = FALSE, delimiter = ",", headers = TRUE)  NameError: name 'censys_start_export' is not definedI thought importing censys.export would allow me to use the censys_start_export function, but that's not how it works apparently. I tried importing the whole censys library, but that didn't work either.Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
Really here censys.export.CensysExport class isn't required. You can read at the end about how to use censys.export.CensysExport.The result returned from the censys.ipv4.CensysIPv4.search method call is a generator object.You can consume values (dictionary objects whose keys are fields_IPv4) yielded from the generator and write them to a csv file this way.This is possible since csv.writer.writerows accepts an iterator to be passed to it.Using censys.export.CensysExportHere is the source code for censys.export.CensysExportTo use it you must pass a SQL query to run against the API. e.g.Currently, this raises a CensysNotFoundException as there is no export endpoint and I confirmed this in the online API documentation.
