In many functions in views.py the is a parameter called vars() that is passed to the render.I want to know what is the use of this parameter and is it better than passing local variable individually to render?
render():  accepts a 3rd argument to be dictionary vars():   Return the __dict__ attribute for a module, class, instance, or any other object with a __dict__ attribute.So we can make use of vars() as an argument in render().
