I have a large-ish list of strings (no more than 2k) and I want to find the most common partial string match within the list. For example I'm trying to satisfy the following test case in an efficient manner. I've tried this with inspiration from this stackoverflow post, but the fact that some elements in the list are completely different throws it off. 
You probably have to tweak this and perfomance test it.I essentially feed all partial substrings up to the lenght of each word in data into a Counter and create a ranking based on len(substring)*occurence - penalizing occurences of only 1 by multiplying wiht 0.1:Output:You would have to tweak the sorting criteria a bit and only use the first in the resulting list - but you can use that as starter.Tweaking could be done by multiplying the length by a faktor if you prefer longer ones over multiple short ones - that depends on your data...
