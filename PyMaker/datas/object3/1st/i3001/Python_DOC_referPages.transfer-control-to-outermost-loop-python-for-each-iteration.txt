Consider the code the expected output is [1 4 8 9] and [2 5 8 9] for each iterationand actual is [1 4 8 9 ],[5 8 9],[6 8 9],[2 4 8 9],[5 8 9],[6 8 9]
You cannot achieve your desired output with simple nested for loops like that.Incidentally, the continue statement says to perform the next iteration of the loop that contains it, skipping any statements that are below it in the block. But your continue is at the end of the block, so it has no effect. But even if there was a statement similar to continue that passed control back to the outermost for i loop it still wouldn't do what you want because the for j loop will simply start counting up from 4 again.However, we can achieve your goal by creating an iterator using the built-in iter function. We can then use next to get each item from that iterator when we want them.outputIf we change the 1st statement to the output becomes
