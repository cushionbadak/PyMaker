I have two lists named extra and be in my code.extra output is [7,27] andbe output is I need to find the 7th and 27th word elements of extra (i.e. elements don't count if they are an empty string). It should be Nonsocial Play and Groom but the for-loop I have only prints Nonsocial PlayThese are the for-loops I am using:If you have any idea why it isn't working, please let me know!EDIT: I want to print these statements but I also need to delete them
You can also just do 
I created simple function filter_iter(itr) that filters the iterable in argument itr from any empty values. Then you can access the resulting filtered list with values from list extra:Prints:
Single line of code using list comprehension with enumerate and filterTesting for speed:
Python 2Python 3['Nonsocial Play', 'Groom']
Here is a solution using using filter the elements, enumerate to iterate over the resulting iterator along with its index, and itertools.islice to get only certain range of indexes from it
When the count reaches x, print the current item from beDeleting items from a sequence while iterating over it doesn't work.Make deques of extra and be and use the rotate method to visit the items in be.  Design the logic so that be items are popped off when they meet the criteria and extra items are popped off when a be item is found.  Keep track of rotations so the order can be reconstructed.
This:
It isn't working because the indentation isn't correct.It would also be a good idea to include a break once the element is found since you are starting a new count after finding the first element. You are also printing be[x] which wrong. It should be y instead as y is the string you want to print.
