I am new to python and implementing stack.I am calling stack functions using dictionary.However, push() requires me to pass a parameter.How do I do that?
Here's a version where the push parameter is supplied on the same line as the key. This makes the code a little more complicated, but it's a bit nicer to use. We use the .strip method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string. Then, after we check for the '5' exit key, we split the input line if its longer than 1 character. The first item on the line becomes the key, the following characters after the space become the parameter for the push function.   This code also checks that a key is valid before attempting to use it. I've added import readline, which gives line editing and a history buffer to the input line, so you can hit the Up arrow key to get to previous lines. At least, it does that on GNU systems, it does nothing on Windows, although there's a 3rd-party pyreadline you could use instead. Here's a short demo
So here's a working implementation. As you can see you will have to add an optional second parameter (called element here) to dictionaryCall and then pass it to the selected method. EXAMPLE:A couple of things you need to pay attention to:return print (...) is not valid syntax (just write print (...))arguments read from the command line via input are evaluated (that means you have to enter e.g. '1' to push an element since your dictionary has string keysto run a python program from the command line you need to wrap it in if __name__ == '__main__': ... otherwise the file will be parsed but not executedas @Pm2Ring said in the comments, pop should print the popped element
