I want a part of my code to only execute when I manually stop the program (like pressing stop button in pycharm). I thought finally statement could do it for me. Like this:but it doesn't work. I tried both finally and except but none of them worked. I thought when we stopped the program from running, a keyboard_intrrupt error occurred so finally must have worked.Any idea? 
You could use the atexit library.From the documentation:The atexit module defines functions to register and unregister cleanup functions. Functions thus registered are automatically executed upon normal interpreter termination.This can be implemented like so:However this is only called during normal program termination, not if keyboard interrupt occurs.
