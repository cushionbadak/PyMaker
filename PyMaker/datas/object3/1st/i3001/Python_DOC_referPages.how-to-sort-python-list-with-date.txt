I have a list in Python like thisi want to sort this list by the dates

Using sorted with lambda in keyEx:Output:
You can split each string, take the last part, and sort by this part:Output:
You can also sort the list by applying datetime.strptime() to key:Note: This might be over complicating it slightly, since ISO formats dates, and sorts string dates perfectly fine, as shown in the other answers. Using strptime() is to just ensure that the dates are sorted by correct date format.
