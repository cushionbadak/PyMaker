This fragment of code raises errors. Here is the json: I don't understand because when I try type(data) I get type<str> which means that I am passing a string argument as this method requires. 
The error you see shows exactly that there is some character after closing } in a data buffer in which you received that json.Here is my test:So this works correctly. But look what happens, when I add \0 at the end of json data:This means that if you have additional null character at the end of received json or any other character, you will get this error. It is quite possible that you receive that json using socket.recv from external system with this trailing 0 and you should get rid of it before trying to parse as json.
Apparently the last character was unrecognised and couldn't be passed as argument to the json.loads method so I did like so to get rid of the last character of the data str object and then it worked fine.
