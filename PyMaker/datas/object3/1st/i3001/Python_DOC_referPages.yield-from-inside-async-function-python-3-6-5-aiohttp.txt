SyntaxError: 'yield from' inside async functionUsed python3.5 before, found pep525, install python3.6.5 and still receive this error.
You are using the new async/await syntax to define and execute co-routines, but have not made a full switch. You need to use await here:If you wanted to stick to the old, pre-Python 3.5 syntax, then mark your function as a coroutine with the @asyncio.coroutine decorator, drop the async keyword, and use yield from instead of await:but this syntax is being phased out, and is not nearly as discoverable and readable as the new syntax. You should only use this form if you need to write code that is compatible with older Python versions.
