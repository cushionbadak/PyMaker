I am having some trouble understanding how argparse works and I've combed through the documentation but am still having some difficulty understanding.The code above works fine, but once I remove "--row-limit" on line 5, I get a Why does removing the "--row-limit" present me with this error?
args = parser.parse_args() actually adds an attribute to the namespace args for each parser.add_argument call. The name of the attribute is generated from your argument name, here --row-limit is transformed to row_limit because you can't have dashes in variable names. See the argparse documentation for details.So when you call parser.add_argument(..., "--row-limit", ...), it creates args.row_limit once you invoke parse_args(). As Amadan mentioned, you use args.row_limit later on in your code. But if you remove the --row-limit argument from the parser, the attribute  row_limit won't exist in args.
