May I get some help on how to combine lines 1-7 so that they appear on a single line inside a csv file?  I tried to put this into a dataframe but the formatting messes up the data in the first column.There are thousands of lines in each csv files that I'm working with and these lines happen randomly within the file.  I'm thinking that maybe a for loop would work to check if the first char is a number and if not, delete the line break so that I can get what I needed:How can I accomplish this?  Here's my pseudo code so far:
This is one approach.Demo:Output:
Most csv data uses " as the quote character.  Yours uses ' instead, which can be controlled with the quotechar parameter, supported by both csv.reader and pd.read_csv:Once you've got this, you can strip as appropriate.
I tried to make it similar to your code and easy to understand.Results with If you need to make sure everything looks fine use pandas.
Read the original file one line at a time and write the lines to the output file without line breaks, unless a line starts with a number (in which case it is the next row and a line break must be inserted before it):The variable lineno prevents the code from inserting a line break at the beginning of the file. Using this method, you can process arbitrary long files because you always deal with at most one row.
