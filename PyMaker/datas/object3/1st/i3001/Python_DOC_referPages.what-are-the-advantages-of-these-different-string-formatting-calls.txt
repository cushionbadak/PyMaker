Natural Text
All are viable ways to concatenate and outputs the same thing, but why would I choose one over the other?
#1 won't work if name isn't a string.#2 is fine on any version but is a little unwieldy to type. Generally the best for compatibility across python versions.#3 If the best option in terms of readability (and performance). But it only works on python3.6+, so not a good idea if you want your code to be backwards compatible. There's also #4, old style formatting ala %s, %d, etc, which are now discouraged in favour for str.format.
