This question already has an answer here:Python date string to date object                    7 answers                Is there a quick way to convert a string to a datetime object in Python WITHOUT having to specify the format?I know I can do:But since this is the default format, is there someway to get it to autoparse? Seems like I should be able to just create a new object from this without having to specify the format since it is the default system format.
use parser.parse method from dateutil module. You can install it by doing pip install python-dateutil
