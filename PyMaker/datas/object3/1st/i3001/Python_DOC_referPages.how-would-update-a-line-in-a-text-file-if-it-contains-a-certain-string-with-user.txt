Natural Text
Currently I have a program that accepts a text file as a setting parameter. The format of the text file is like so:What I would like to do in Python is to be able to parse the file. I want to read each line and check if it contains a specific string and if the line contains it, be able to append/update in place a user input text right into the end of that line. For example, the "PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE=" (highlighted) is found in the text file and I want to update it from "PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE=100-300" to read for example "PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE=500-1000". I want to be able to do this for several of the parameters (that I have chosen for my needs). A few tools I've looked into would include fileinput module, doing a regular file open/write (which I can't do in place editing apparently), and a module I found called the in_place module. Some preliminary code I have using the in_place module:I'm a noob programmer to preface so any help or guidance in the right direction would be appreciated. 
You need to open the file for reading (default) and then you need to open a file for writing:
For this task, regular expressions are the way to go. I refer you to this post.Concretely, something like this might do the trick:Here, s would be the entire string in the text file.
You can use re for changing/manipulating strings (explanation of this regex on external site):This prints:For reading/writing to file you can use this snippet:EDIT:Extended version of change_parameter():Prints:
