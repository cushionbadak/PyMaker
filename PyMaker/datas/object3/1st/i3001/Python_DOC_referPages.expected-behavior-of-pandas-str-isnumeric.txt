I have a multi-dtype series pd.Series like [100, 50, 0, foo, bar, baz]when I run pd.Series.str.isnumeric()I get [NaN, NaN, NaN, False, False, False]Why is this happening? Shouldn't it return True for the first three in this series?
Pandas string methods follow Python methods closely:Any type which yields an error will give NaN. As per the Python docs, str.isnumeric is only applicable for strings:str.isnumeric() Return true if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and there is at least one character, false  otherwise.As per the Pandas docs, pd.Series.str.isnumeric is equivalent to str.isnumeric:Series.str.isnumeric() Check whether all characters in each string in the Series/Index are numeric. Equivalent to str.isnumeric().Your series has "object" dtype, this is an all-encompassing type which holds pointers to arbitrary Python objects. These may be a mixture of strings, integers, etc. Therefore, you should expect NaN values where strings are not found.To accommodate numeric types, you need to convert to strings explicitly, e.g. given a series s:
Using the string accessor is converting your numbers to NaN, it is happening before you even try to use isnumeric:So the NaN's remain when you use isnumeric.  Use astype first instead:
