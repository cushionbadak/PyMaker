I'm practicing the basics of Python and I had a exercise of doing a function that asks for the user for a number and the function will return him all the divisors of that number so I done thisand for example the output for the integer 50 wasI really want to keep it simple and I don't understand what is not good about it, I searched for so many answers but none of them was on my level of understanding. Why is my function not working as expected?
Your modulo is backwards.Your example is evaluating to i % 50 when you want 50 % i.
Your division is backwards.I think you meant:Think of it this way, if integer is 50, and divisor is 2, with the way you had it, it would be:If numerator is less than the denominator, that check will never be true, except for the when the numbers are the same. I always walk myself through this mental check just to make sure I didn't accidentally put the numbers backwards. And, as mentioned in the comments, don't create variables called list. list is a built in function, and shadowing it has the potential to cause errors later. 
Here is the correct version (I am using python 3.6.1). You need to switch the position of integer and divisors. And you need to start your range from 1 otherwise you get division by zero errorBy the way, in case you are also interested in a bit concise and different solution to your problem, here is another solution (you don't need it though necessarily):
