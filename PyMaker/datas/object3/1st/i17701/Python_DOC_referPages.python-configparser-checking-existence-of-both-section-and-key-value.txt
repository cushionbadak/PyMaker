Using ConfigParser's has_section() method I can check if a section exists in a file, such as:What would be a command to check if a key exists as well? So it would be possible to verify that both a section and key exists before querying the value using:Thanks in advance!
In addition to has_section, there is also a has_option method:From the Python documentation:has_option*(section, option)* If the given section exists, and contains  the given option, return True; otherwise return False. If the  specified section is None or an empty string, DEFAULT is assumed.
