I'm trying to use some C++ method in my python code and I'm using ctypes library. I have wrote a simple C++ code using a simple main with no arguments and another simple method named printArgs which takes an argument of type char *. I also have wrote a simple python code to import these two methods. I made two linked libraries(one .so and one .a because I'm using Debian) with this command:And then used export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/the/path/to/the/linked/libraries/directory.There is no problem in getting the main method, bu when I'm trying to get printArgs I get AttributeError. Here's the C++ code:Here's the Python code:I get this output:I also tried cdll.LoadLibrary("hello.so") and/or helloInCPPPrint = helloInCPP_lib.printArgs(None); got the same error in both conditions. Any idea?I'm using Debian 32 bit on a VMWare Workstation and Python 2.6. 
Declare the printArgs using extern "C":BTW, you should pass a string (c_char_p), not None:About argtypes, see Specifying the required argument types (function prototypes).
