Natural Text
I want to create an on-screen input box that a user can interact with.The user would see a window with an input field they can click with the mouse. The user could type or erase text in the field, then press OK once they have finished adding text. Lastly, my program would store this text for later use.How can I create a text box in Python which allows user input?
You could try the Tkinter module:Result:Of course, you may want to read a Tkinter tutorial.
The simplest way to do it is to set an input equal to a variable for later use, and then call the variable later in the program.
