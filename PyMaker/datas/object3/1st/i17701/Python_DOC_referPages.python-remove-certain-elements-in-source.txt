I have some source where I am trying to remove some tags, I do know that using regular expression for removing tags and such is not advised but figured this would be the easiest route to take.What I need to do is remove all img and a tags along with the contents of the a tags that are only inside a p tag but I am unsure how to do this using regular expression.For example when it comes across:The output should be the following where all a tags and content and img tags are removed.The problem is like I stated i'm not sure how to do this, and my regular expression removes all of the a and img tags in the source, not just the ones inside of a p tag.
Your regular expression indeed will remove all tags without using some type of assertion. Although you possibly could use regular expression to perform this, I do advise not going this route for many reasons.You could simply use BeautifulSoup to pass a list of what to remove.Note: This will replace all <a>, </a> and <img> elements (including content) that are inside of a <p> element leaving the rest untouched. If you have BS4, use find_all() and replace_with()
