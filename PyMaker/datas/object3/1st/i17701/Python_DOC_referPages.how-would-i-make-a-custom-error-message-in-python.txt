In a python program I am making, I want it to only take integers, and if it gets a string say "There has been an error in the system." instead of murmering sensless information the user will not understand
Use a try-except block to capture the error and use the raise statement to say the error message of your choice:
You need to use a try except block to catch the error - see the documentation. Then you could just print a message, and, if necessary, exit the program:
If you do not want to add another indentation level by using a try-except block, you can change the handling of all errors by adding the following to the beginning of your code:In case of an error, only your specified error message is printed out. In addition, this prevents the stack trace from being displayed.
import ctypesctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW(None, u"CUSTOM MESSAGE", u"TITLE BAR", 0)
