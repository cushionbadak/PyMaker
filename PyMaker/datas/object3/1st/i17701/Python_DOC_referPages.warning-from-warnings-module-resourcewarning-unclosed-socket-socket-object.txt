Hi guys getting this warning help me out to know what is wrongWarning (from warnings module):  File "C:\Python33\lib\site-packages\selenium-2.37.2-py3.3.egg\selenium\webdriver\firefox\firefox_binary.py", line 95    while not utils.is_connectable(self.profile.port):ResourceWarning: unclosed 
It's a known bug:http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5923It's safe to ignore it though. If you're using Python 3, you can do:See Python 3 unittest docs. In Python 2, you'd use something like this:cf the Python 2 warnings docsIf you'll forgive the shameless self-promotion, there's lots more info on selenium in a wee book I've written, here.
I run my tests with the -W flag thus:   or  that suppresses the ResourceWarning but still allows assertion error reports.  BTW I found that:  works when invoking python my_tests.py when every test is to be run, but this invocation precludes running individual tests.  I couldn't figure out how else to use unittest.main(warnings='ignore') without encountering errors I put down to recursive inclusion of unittest libraries. (selenium==2.44.0 under Python 3.4.2)
