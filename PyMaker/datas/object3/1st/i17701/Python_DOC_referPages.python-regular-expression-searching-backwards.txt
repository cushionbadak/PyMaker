I need to extract a string from a directory like this:I need to extract 'mega' from the above my_new_string. At the moment the above just gets mega_1237665428090192022 so how do I get it to ignore the ID number?To be honest I don't understand how these expressions work, even after consulting documentation. What does the r' do? And how does the ?<!.{%d} work?edit: Thanks guys!
There are a couple of ways to do this, although I'm not sure you necessarily need a regex here. Here are some options:I don't think you are looking for a negative lookahead assertion or a negative lookbehind assertion. If anything, you want to match if numbers DO follow. For example, something like this:The r simply makes a raw string (so that you don't need to constantly escape backslashes, for example).
