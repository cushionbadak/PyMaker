This is how I'm downloading:So I've got the URL and I'm just opening it with the webbrowser module. This downloads whatever is on the other side of that URL to the default download location of my default browser. How can I change this location to something I specify in my program? I feel like this should have a simple solution but I can't find anything about it on the web. I tried os.chdir() and that had no effect.
Use urllib.urlretrieve (urllib.request.urlretreive in Python 3.x):NOTE the second argument should be file path, not directory path.
http://docs.python.org/library/urllib.html#urllib.urlretrieveUse This :
You should list or get all files from that directory by using .read() functionThen you can get these files in that directory one by one using urlretrievePlease note this is untested code and mainly a logic on how you can solve the problem. Also this is one link with BeautifulSoup and urllib.
