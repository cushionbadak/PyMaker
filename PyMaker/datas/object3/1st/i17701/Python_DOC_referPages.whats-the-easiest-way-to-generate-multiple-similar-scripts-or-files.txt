I've been submitting multiple matlab scripts to a cluster as an array job, which is efficient. But I've been generating each of the scripts manually! For say x = 1:1000, I would like to change:filename = foo_x.mand parameters within the mscriptI.e. the task is to generate multiple files which are exactly the same, except for their values of x. x appears both within the script and the filename.I have a small amount of experience with python, sed and vim. Any suggestions on the best way to tackle a task like this, or any tutorials out there? 
A quick solution in Matlab using diary:If you need file names of the form "foo_0001.m" (i.e. fill numbers with zeros to the left), replace the first line within the loop by
Python solutionUse str.format. In the following code template contains {0}. Think of it as placeholder. Using str.format, you can replace that with argument with the first argument of the str.format.Replace foo_{}.m with foo_{:04}.m if you want filenames look like foo_0012.m instead of foo_12.m.
