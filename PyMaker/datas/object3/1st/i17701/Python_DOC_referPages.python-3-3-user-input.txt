I need to create a Python 3.3 program that searches a file for a specific string and prints the line if the string is found. I have code that works but I am forced to rewrite the program each time I want to run it. Is there a way to accept user input for the fileâ€™s path, i.e. C:\Web_logs\ex130801.txt? 
Sure, you can use the sys.argv list to read a filename from the command line:You need to invoke your script with the filename on the command line:Another option is to use the input() function to ask the user to enter a filename when the script is running:
You can use the argparse module, new in 3.2.First, import the library at the top of your file:Then, create a parser object, and tell it that you're looking for two command-line strings, the first one the filename and the second one the string you are searching for:Then, run the parser object on the command line, getting back an object that contains the fields you are looking for, as strings:Now, "args.filename" contains your filename and "args.searchstring" contains the search string, so rewrite your loop this way:From the command line, one of your users can now just do:The best part is, if you user fails to give the arguments you are looking for, the script nicely tells them the syntax you are looking for:Even better, the user can enter the --help option to get documentation for your program:Don't forget that you can also add #!/usr/bin/python3 to the top of your code and change the executable flag and then it isn't necessary to type python3 on the command line.
Remember to close your file when you're done! A more Pythonic way, assuming you don't need to do something else to the file:The with statement closes the file object once you leave that block.
