I have an AI routine that stores various kinds of data as Memory objects. Memory objects have different parameters based on their 'memory type' which is passed to the constructor (in retrospect, each type of memory really should have been a subclass of Memory, but that's not important at the moment).I need to set up a __str__() method for Memory-s. In another language, I might do something like this:But the Pythonic (and fast) way to do this sort of thing is to use dicts. The problem is, though, that these strings need to have values inserted before they're returned. I suppose this could be done with lambdas, but that strikes me as a bit inelegant and overcomplicated. Is there a better way (str.format() springs suddenly to mind...)?
Yes, using str.format():By passing in self as the first positional parameter, you can address any attribute on self in the {...} formatting placeholders.You can apply more detailed formatting to the values (such as floating point precision, padding, alignment, etc.) too, see the formatting syntax.Demo:
