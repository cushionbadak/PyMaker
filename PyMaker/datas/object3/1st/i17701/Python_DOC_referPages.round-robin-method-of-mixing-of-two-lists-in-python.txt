If input is i need o/p asI triedbut it gives error as How to modify the code to get the desired o/p
You could find a series of iteration recipes here: http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/itertools.html#recipesEDIT: Python 3https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes
You can use zip function and then flatten the result with list comprehension, like thisOutputzip function groups the values from both the iterables, like thisWe take each and every tuple and flatten it out with list comprehension.But as @Ashwini Chaudhary suggested, use roundrobin receipe from the docs
You can leverage itertools.chain (to unwrap the tuples) with itertools.izip (to transpose the elements in order to create an interleaving pattern) to create your resultIf the strings are of unequal length, use izip_longest with a pad value (preferably empty string)
list(roundrobin('ABC', 'D', 'EF'))Output : ['A', 'D', 'E', 'B', 'F', 'C']
For anyone looking for Python 3, use thisThe difference is that Python 3's iterator has __next__() instead of next().https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#recipes
A mixture of the two itertools roundrobin recipes for Python 2 and Python 3 looks like this:
