I'm writing a script to help me manipulate .csv files.  The goal is to read the specified .csv, then split the data into several temporary files for further manipulation.  A blank row (a list of empty strings) in the input .csv denotes where I want to split up the data.I apologize if my code runs against anything in PEP 8.  Python (and coding in general, for that matter) is still very new for me.However, when I run the code, I encounter this:The part that puzzles me is that when I do print(temp), I still get a list of lists.What am I doing wrong here?
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() object is opened in binary mode, by default; quoting from the documentation:The mode parameter defaults to 'w+b' so that the file created can be read and written without being closed. Binary mode is used so that it behaves consistently on all platforms without regard for the data that is stored.You need to open it in text mode instead:The error is thrown when the dw.writerow() method tries to write unicode str values to a file object that'll only support bytes (objects supporting the buffer interface).
