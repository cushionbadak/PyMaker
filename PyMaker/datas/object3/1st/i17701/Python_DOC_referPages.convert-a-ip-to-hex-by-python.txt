I am writing a script to convert a IP to HEX. Below is my script:My Problem is that for IP like 115.255.8.97, I am getting this:Answer Coming : 73FF861Expected Ans :  73FF0861Can anyone is clever enough to tell me what mistake I am making.
hex function does not pad with leading zero.Use str.format with 02X format specification:Or you can use binascii.hexlify + socket.inet_aton:
Since hex don't have leading leading zeros you can use zfill(2)We are taking the hex number only with [2:] (remove '0x') and then we are adding 2 leading zeros only if needed.Example output:Example output:Edit1:by @volcano request you can replace with list comprehensions:

Since python v3.5 you can just do:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typebytes
In above IP to hex conversion output, if the output start with '0' ex. 0aff0861 then I want to  delete the 0 and output should looks like as aff0861. Is there any direct method available in conversion.
