I thought range() returns a list of numbers . why does the all() function return a false for this 
Your range(100) contains 0, and the boolean value of 0 is False:while for any other number it evaluates to True. The function all only returns True when all of the elements of its argument evaluate to True, see its manual (the if statement in the given example implicitly takes the boolean value of every item). See here the difference of including 0 or not:
Because the first number generated by range is 0.
