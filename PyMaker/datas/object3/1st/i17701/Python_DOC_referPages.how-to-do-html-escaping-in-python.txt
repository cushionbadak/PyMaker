This question already has an answer here:What's the easiest way to escape HTML in Python?                    9 answers                I am trying to implement a function which replaces the following values: I keep getting an error with my function. What exactly is wrong?Note: This is more of a fundamental programming question. My focus is the reason why my function isn't working. I cannot use outside libraries for this project. 
Use cgi.escape:If you use Python 3.2+, use html.escape as documentation suggest:cgi.escapeDeprecated since version 3.2: This function is unsafe because quote is false by default, and therefore deprecated. Use html.escape() instead.
There are builtin functions to do that. You can use cgi.escape if you are using Python 2.x. It is deprecated in Python 3.2. So, if you are using Python >= 3.2, you can use html.escape
You could also use replace, which is a bit more universal.For example,However, keep in mind that if you're trying to replace double quotes, you'd need to enclose them in single quotes, and vice-versa
You could use xml.sax.saxutils which ships an escape method.See escaping HTML.
