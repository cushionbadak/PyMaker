I'm trying to set the newline character for SiRF binary messages, but the IO wrapper doesn't seem to accept the newline chars.Code:Output:Note: It does accept '\x0d'
You can not just use any character as the newline. From the io.TextIOWrapper() documentation:newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.You'll have to handle those bytes manually instead of a newline, directly.
