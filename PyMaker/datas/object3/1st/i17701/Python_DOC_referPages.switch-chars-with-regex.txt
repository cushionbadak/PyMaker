Say I have something like s='abaabbab'. Is it possible to change this to s='babbaaba' using regex? I mainly want to know if this is possible, not if it is reasonable.I thought perhaps one of these would work (having previously imported re):But they just result in 'bb'.I know I could replace all a's with c's, then replace all b's with a's, then replace all c's with b's, but this seems so long.gnibbler suggests this:But I doesn't seem to work in python 3.

In Python 3.x, you should pass a dictionary that map unicode ordinals to unicode characters. ( str.translate documentation)Why the re.sub code does not work?Because a argument passed to substitution function is not a string, but a match object; Comparing a match object with a string produce False (0); the substitution returns the first item b.Use group method to get a matched string.
