I was using python dictionary built-in methods and found they behave a bit differently in terms of giving the output on 2.7 and 3.3 version of Python. Here is an example:Let my dictionary be the following:Now when I use the keys() or items() or values() method in 3.3 it is giving me the following output:While ideally it should give me a list of the keys or values or items as given by 2.7 version below:I see that in the help on dict.keys() or dict.values on 3.3 it now says it returns a set of keys. unlike a list of keys on 2.7My problem is that since it is also appending dict_keys or dict_values or dict_items keywords in the output I am unable to use the list of keys or values or items to store it in some variable in 3.3 unlike in 2.7Can anyone help on this why is this happening?Thanks
Python 3 switched to using more efficient data structures and methods throughout; you can get the same dictionary view objects in Python 2 with using dict.viewkeys(), dict.viewvalues() and dict.viewitems().If you have to have a list, simply use list() to turn collect all values in the view into a list:For just the keys, you can also call list() on the dictionary, directly:
