Is a faster to check if a subtring (in my case a whitespace) exists in a string before removing it, or to use relace() globally, as a matter of speaking;Use case:Any other suggestions are welcome, too. 
Using re.search was absolutely slower than other options.This was done in CPython 2.7.3, Ubuntu Linux 12.10 64bit.UPDATE: In CPython 3.3.0 (the same machine).NOTE couldn't time str.translate, because str.translate in Python 3 does not accept deletechars parameter.
If you are talking about removing only the spaces, you can use translate.
