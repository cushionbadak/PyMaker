This might be a fairly straightforward question, but given the path:or any other directory located in a user's home directoryHow do I get the absolute path to this folder?os.path.abspath just gives me the absolute path for my current working directory. But that's not what I need to work with.
You are looking for the os.path.expanduser method.
