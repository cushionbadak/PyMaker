I'm getting a bit confused here as to why this is happening. Here's the short and simple code:RETURNS: (I changed the actual output for security reasons)However, if I use re.search I get the following:(edited output just in case, for security reasons)Any idea why this is happpening? From the examples I found on Python's docs and on this website, re.search should be returning a string as well. Addding the .groups() at the end results in the following error:I'm using Python 2.7
re.search returns a MatchObject or None - See the re.search docs.re.findall returns a list of strings or tuples - see the re.findall docs.
