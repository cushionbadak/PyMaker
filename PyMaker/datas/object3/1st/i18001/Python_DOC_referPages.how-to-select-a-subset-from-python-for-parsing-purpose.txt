I am working on assignment and need to develop a python to openmodelica translator. For which I am using flex and bison in initial stages. Initially I need to define a subset of python language on which I could perform a whole demo. I am new to Python language, Can anybody suggest how can I define a subset of python language? Thanks.
Well as you are probably not interested in writing it in Python itself, I guess the language reference is the best starting point. It defines the whole grammar of the language. So this is likely a good starting point to find some features of the language you want to implement on your own; and then you need to write your own grammar and a parser for it in your language of choice.Otherwise, you could use the built-in Python language services to actually parse real Python code and extract it into abstract syntax trees for example.But if you are meant to only have a subset, I donâ€™t think having the full language capabilities will do you any good. So you better start off with a real subset of the grammar. A good way to get to know which features you want to take over is probably by using the language yourself for a bit. Do some tutorials etc. and see how the basic syntax works.
