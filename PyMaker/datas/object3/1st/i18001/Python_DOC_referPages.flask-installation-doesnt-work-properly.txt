I'm using Merverick OSX. I have installed Python 3.3.3 Into my computer and I would like to install FlaskWhen I type this in terminal terminal shows this error to meSo I have access as root user and then typeand it says like this but there is a warning about *.egg what is that? something goes wrong? and how to fix it?
Every time when we meet anything we cannot undestand like this, we should read the explainin detailã€‚did you find the "WARNING", it tell you it's not error; and tell the truth is that you have installed virtualenv successfully.Now you can according the docs given by Flask, learn Flask;
An issue is that the easy_install that is on the path is The Apple supplied one for python 2.7, so you have installed flask for python 2.7You need to guve the explicit path to the python 3.3 version.Also virtualenv is part of 3.3 see the python docs soyou do not need to install it.
For install vertualenv run this command :  sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv  and Flask installation follow these: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/   or  http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world .
