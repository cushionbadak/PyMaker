So in the code above i dont understand the line I marked with confused, 4 lines before the last. Might be because I am new to python or just stupid.What happends in the first case? When the range is [ ] ? ... "for each c in the range of empty array....?i dont get array[i] = a on the line under aswell. If a is the first element in the counting array which might be zero, how can it be added....? Really confused...Cheers!
You've apparently figured out that count[a] will be 0, and that range(count[a]) will therefore be [].So, what you're asking is, what does this do:The answer is that it loops over each of the 0 elements—in other words, it doesn't loop at all. It just does nothing.*This is explained in the docs for the for statement:… The suite is then executed once for each item provided by the iterator… When the items are exhausted (which is immediately when the sequence is empty…) … the loop terminates.And that implicitly explains your second bit of confusion:If a is the first element in the counting array which might be zero, how can it be addedWhen count[a] is 0, you will never get into the loop, so that case cannot ever arise.* If the for statement has an else clause, it does run the else clause.
range will give you a list with specified start and end values. For examplewill printWhen you say, range(m) or range(count[a]) it will generate a list till m or count[a] starting from 0.About array[i] = aIn the range(m), for each element, the code checks the count[a]. If the count[a] is 0, the second loop will not be executed. (range(0) will produce an empty list) So, for when a is 0  array[i] = a will not be executed.
I simplified part of you code, maybe it it can help you understand the core of the algorithm well . After counting all the elements in the array, we can reconstruct  a sorted array only with the information stored in count[].
