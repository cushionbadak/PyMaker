How can one reprompt this this input if the input is anything other than 1 or 2?
Use a loop:BTW, don't use eval. It can evaluate arbitrary expression. If you want convert the input string to int, use int instead.
@falsetru, has answered with my preferred way already. Here is a couple of alternatives you may see elsewhereThis is not desirable due to the duplication of the promptThis is just ugly in my opinion, but some people dislike using breakOne reason I prefer @falsetru's version is that it's easy to convert for a for loop when you want to count/limit the number of retries.
