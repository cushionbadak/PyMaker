I have a list that looks like the one bellow, with the same item of a pair repeated some times.I would like to convert it to a list of  dictionaries in which I would merge all repetitions of the first item into one key, so the end result would look like:I was trying something like:orBut I get the wrong result. I am very new to python and would really appreciate any tip on how to solve this or reference to where to find the information that would allow me to do this. Thanks!
Use a collections.defaultdict() object for ease:Your first attempty will overwrite keys; a dict comprehension would not merge the values. The second attempt seems to treat the lists in the data list as dictonaries, so that wouldn't work at all.Demo:
If the items in L are sorted by the first element you can use groupby
