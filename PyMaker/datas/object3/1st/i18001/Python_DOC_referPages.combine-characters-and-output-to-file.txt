Natural Text
I have a quick question, is there a way to have python combine a range of characters, combine them, then put them into a text file?What I mean is, if I have the characters, "a", "b", "3", "F", "@", etc, is there a way to combine them in various ways to make, "abF", "F@b", "3F@ab", etc and then print them each on a separate line of a text file?so far, what I've got is this:I would like it to be able to output something like, "abF3" AND "3Fab" AND "Fb3a"Any suggestions?
based on above but with some fixes
From your sample output, it looks like you want all 120 of the 4-element permutations of the 5-element set. That's simple with itertools.permutations:You also seem to want them in random order, but that's easy:If you want all permutations of any number of characters (well, any number from 1 to 5 inclusive), you just chain together the permutations for each number:There are 120+120+60+20+5=325 of these. And again, if you want them in random order, just shuffle them.Almost anything reasonable that you want to do will be easy to doâ€”but until you know, and can explain to a human, what it is that you actually want, you won't be able to explain it to Python either.
It's not 100% clear what you mean, but I guess this is what you want:
Try this.You'll get every permutation of those characters.  In this example, there are 325 permutations.Hope this helps.
One liner (list comprehension) approach (because I don't want to add a duplicate answer)
