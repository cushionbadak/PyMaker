I have an Excel file(that I am exporting as a csv) that I want to parse, but I am having trouble with finding the best way to do it. The csv is a list of computers in my network, and what accounts are in the local administrator group for each one. I have done something similar with tuples, but the number of accounts for each computer range from 1 to 30. I want to build a list of lists, then go through each list to find the accounts that should be there(Administrator, etc.) and delete them, so that I can then export a list of only accounts that shouldn't be a local admin, but are. The csv file is formatted as follows:Any help would be appreciatedEDIT: Here is the code I am working withThe issue is with the second for loop. I want to be able to read across each line and for now, just print them.
This should get you on the right track:Last two lines will print all of the row (including the "computer"). Do... to avoid printing the computer twice.Note that f.close() is not required when using the "with" construct because the resource will automatically be closed when the "with" block is exited.Personally, I would just do:That's a reasonable way to iterate through the data and should give you a firm basis to add whatever further logic is required.
This is how I opened a .csv file and imported columns of data as numpy arrays - naturally, you don't need numpy arrays, but...
