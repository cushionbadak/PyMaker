So i've been trying to code a section in my cash-register class. Im trying to make it so that it keeps track of the total price as an integer. so for example 18.66 would be 1866. But i still want it to be considered as 18.66 if that makes sense. this is so that it avoids the accumulation of roundoff errors. But i dont want to change the public interface of the class.wouldn't i simply change the 0.0's to 0's? or would i go along the way of doing a split method and concatenate them back together?
You should keep the data as is.You can achieve what you want by mean of formatting. If i were you i will add a new function like this:This approach will give you more flexibility in the future
