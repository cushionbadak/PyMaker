I have a long running processes which may have a resource leak.  How can I obtain a list of all instantiated objects (possibly only of a particular class) in my environment? 
Try gc.get_objects():
There's a few ways that you pretty much have to combine. I've used this module in the past to check for exactly that, memory leakshttps://mg.pov.lt/objgraph/It can make your process use a TON more memory and be pretty slow though, depending on how you use it.
All instantiated objects (I'm assuming just for Python itself in a single module):globals().keys().For all of these that are instances only of a particular class:filter(lambda x: isinstance(x, some_class), globals().keys()).
