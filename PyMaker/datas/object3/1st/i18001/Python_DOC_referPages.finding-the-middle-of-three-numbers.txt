I'm looking for alternative or more concise ways to return the middle of three unique values. What I have right now is a function:Anything better?
This should return the middle number. But if you actually meant maximum numberEdit: As suggested by abarnert in the comments section, instead of y>x and x<z use x < y < z, which is more readable and pythonic.
With Python 3.4, statistics.median is in the standard library:With 3.1-3.3, after you pip install stats:I believe a backport for 2.6-2.7 is in the works, but does not yet exist. (For 2.5 or 3.0, just upgrade already.)Of course if you had 4 values, you'd have to decide what "middle" means; median would use the mean of the two middle values, but you might want something different.
Just for the fun of it.
Just for funâ€¦ We don't really need to sort all three values; we just need to keep track of the 2 largest as we go through the whole list, right?In general, this can be useful, so the standard library has a way to do exactly that: the heapq.nlargest function.In practice, a heap is much slower than sorting a list, so unless the list is pretty big (3 is nowhere near big enough) and the number of elements you need to remember pretty small (2/3rds is nowhere near small enough), this will actually slow you down a lot. As a quick test will show:So, don't use this here, but keep it in your toolbox for the next time you need the 10 top scores out of 500000.
for fun:
You can also make some kind of a median function which works not only for 3 values
