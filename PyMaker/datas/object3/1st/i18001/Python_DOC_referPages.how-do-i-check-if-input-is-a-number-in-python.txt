Natural Text
I have a Python script which converts a decimal number into a binary one and this obviously uses their input.I would like to have the script validate that the input is a number and not anything else which will stop the script.I have tried an if/else statement but I don't really know how to go about it. I have tried if decimal.isint(): and if decimal.isalpha(): but they just throw up errors when I enter a string.Without the if/else statement, the code works just fine and does its job.
