Natural Text
For instance, we have:is there a better way to print double quotes around a variable?
Update :From Python 3.6, you can use f-stringsOriginal Answer :You can try %-formattingOR str.formatOR escape the quote character with \And, if the double-quotes is not a restriction (i.e. single-quotes would do)OR like others have already said (include it in your declaration)Use whichever you feel to be better or less confusing.And, if you need to do it for multiple words, you might as well create a functionAnd (if you know what you're doing &) if you're concerned about performance of these, see this comparison.
How about json.dumps:The advantage over other approaches mentioned here is that it escapes quotes inside the string as well (take that str.format!), always uses double quotes and is actually intended for reliable serialization (take that repr()!):
You can try reprCode:word = "This is a random text"print repr(word)Output:'This is a random text'

It seems silly, but works fine to me. It's easy to read.
Use escape sequenceExample:O/P
