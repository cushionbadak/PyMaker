What is the best way to write data retrieved from for loop?
You re-open the file for writing each loop iteration, which clears the file each time.Move the file opening out of the loop:Opening a file in w mode explicitly truncates it (removes all data). Quoting the open() function documentation:Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists) [...]If you have to open a file for each iteration, at the very least open the file for appending instead, using 'a':
This is how:In the end, the file will look like this:Your current method is opening the file in write mode with each iteration of the for-loop.  This means that its contents keep getting overwritten.Remember that each and every time you open a file in write mode, all of its contents are cleared.
