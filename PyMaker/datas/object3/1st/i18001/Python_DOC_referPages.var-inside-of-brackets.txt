I have this ....i'm getting this error...But if i explicitly put a string inside the metadata brackets it works.What gives, how do i include a var inside the brackets
You can use a nested dictionary as well for keeping file extensions and content like thisthen you will be directly using handler in metadata, like this
You are constructing two different objects here:is a set, whileis a dictionary. You can of course reference variables when constructing a dict:A dictionary maps keys to values (hence the :), while the set is only a collection of distinct values. The funciton you're calling expects a dictionary, so you have to create one. If you have a dictionary and want to pass that (continuing from above), you can do that like this:(note that the links go to python 3 documentation, but sets and dicts have not really changed since python 2)For the edit: As the accepted answer said, you have to use a nested dictionary. The question is, why doesn't it work otherwise?Otherwise, you're creating a set containing the string you previously stored in the fileExt dictionary, for example "Content-Type: 'image/png'". Python will not interpret this string, which is why it does not create a dictionary when you write {"Content-Type: 'image/png'"}.
When you say {go} you are actually creating a set, not a dict. And sets don't have keys.OutputBut when you say {'Content-Type': 'image/png'}, you are actually creating a dict and thats why it works.
