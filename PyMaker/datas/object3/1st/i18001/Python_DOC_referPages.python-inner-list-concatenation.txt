Ok, while I maybe wrong, I have the feeling I can solve this without the help of a function.With this kind of input list:I want a resulting list where inner lists sharing a common element are concatenated:I already found the syntax that seems helpful for my problem, but now I'm stuck.[EDIT]one of my trials:While if I initialize result with result=[input[-1]] it works:
This is a more simple and well-performing approach to solve your problem:It's about two times faster than J.F. Sebastian's answer to the other question, even if the other question wanted a different sorting.I used myinput because input is a built-in function, and it's better to not masque it.About sets and their operators: http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets (Python 3)By the way, your solution is wrong, user1189129. Try your code with this input to see the problem: input = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 8], [1, 9], [4, 5], [7], [5, 4, 6], [5, 4]]
You can convert your list to plain list (extract all variables from sublist into a bigger list) and then split them into the chunks:
