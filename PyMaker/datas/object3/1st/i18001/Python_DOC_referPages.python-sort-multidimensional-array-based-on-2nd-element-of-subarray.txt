I have an array like this:I'd like to sort it based on the 2nd element in descending order.An ideal output would be:
list.sort, sorted accept optional key parameter. key function is used to  generate comparison key.
Use itemgetterOutput : [[1, 3, 5], [17, 233, 1], [2, 511, 7]]itemgetter can also be used to sort by multiple subarrays.
