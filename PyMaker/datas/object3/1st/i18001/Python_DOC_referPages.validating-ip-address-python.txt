This question already has an answer here:How to validate IP address in Python? [duplicate]                    11 answers                I need to write a script that prints out a statement stating whether an IP is valid or invalid.IP addresses are made up of four bytes (each with a valid range of 0-255).valid examples: 127.0.0.1 , 123.244.100.1 , etc.invalid examples: 124,44,2,2  ,  127.0.2,4  , 355.23.24.43 , etc.I'm guessing the easiest way would be to use regex? but i am having some trouble with that.I also thought about using split(), but im not sure how I would handle any other special characters that aren't a "." Any help or advice would be great, thanks
to test for valid IPv6 addresses you can use
You could use the IPy module which specialises in handling IP addresses.https://pypi.python.org/pypi/IPy/Python 3 offers the ipaddress module.http://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress. Instead of using IPy, you can do this:and that will throw a ValueError exception.
