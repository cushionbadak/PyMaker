I am trying to write a program that writes the same letter to each recipient and each address, but each letter will have the different names and address.This is what i have so far.When it writes out to the file it just writes one letter and just puts everything together.What i want to be done is for a letter to DIFFERENT people and Different addresses in the SAME file. Ex. This will all be in the SAME file.Any help?Using Python 3.xThanks in advance
There are several issues with your code.First off, you're requesting a list of names and addresses, but you only get a single string from input. If you expect your user to specify several values, you'll need to parse that input string somehow to split up the values. For instance, you could split on commas:The next issue you have is that your loop doesn't do what you appear to expect. In Python, a for loop gives you the values from the sequence you're looping on, not indexes. So, try:Or, since you also have a list of addresses which should correspond to the list of names, use zip and get both name and address together:Next, you have issues with the code to create your letter string. You're currently making a tuple of strings, not a single one. A much better approach would be to use str.format to handle inserting the various values into the template:
You need to write to a separate file for each recipient, rather than writing to the same file as you are currently doing: Be mindful that you'll be prompted for a new template file name for each iteration of the loop. You'll also need to ensure that each template name is unique so that prior files are not overwritten.
your problem is that you need to write a unique file for each letter, the section of code below should be modified to create a file for each letter, you could do something like creating a counter and appending it to the filename to keep them unique.
