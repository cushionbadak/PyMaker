What is the best and most elegant way to retrieve the contents of the csv file as the lists? Note that the required columns such as Country, Area, and Population are to be identified automatically as in the program below.Above program works, but looking for pretty short and readable program. Update:To prevent error when certain column such as 'Country' does not exist in some file, the program can be improved by:How it can be done using csv module??
Use the csv module for CSV files:where the DictReader() class automatically uses the first row of headers as keys for the rest of the file.Or use:if all you have are 3 columns, country, area and population, in that order.
