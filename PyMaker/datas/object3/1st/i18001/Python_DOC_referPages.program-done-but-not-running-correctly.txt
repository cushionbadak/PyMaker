The point of this program is to match an authors signature (style of writing ) to their pieces in order to figure out who the author is. I'm basically done with the program, but when I go to run it, other than the first prompt where it asks for the name of the file, it does nothing. I can't figure out why it's not moving on with the file. It gives me a "That file is not found" print message but the file IS in the right directory so I don't know what's going on.Pretty big program relatively speaking, so I don't expect people to really get in depth, but I just cant figure it out by myself.  
In the following line (appear twice), path is generate by joining dir part and filename part with space.You should use os.sep to join them.or more preferably, use os.path.join:
Are you sure it reports "That file does not exist." rather than "That directory does not exist."?In read_directory_name(prompt) the author uses os.path.isfile(path) and the docs for it are "Return True if path is an existing regular file. (...)".Since you are looking for a directory you need os.path.isdir or os.path.exists.
