I need to know if a python module exists, without importing it.Importing something that might not exist (not what I want):
Python2To check if import can find something in python2, using impTo find dotted imports, you need to do more:You can also use pkgutil.find_loader (more or less the same as the python3 partPython3Python3 ≤ 3.3You should use importlib, How I went about doing this was:My expectation being, if you can find a loader for it, then it exists.  You can also be a bit more smart about it, like filtering out what loaders you will accept.  For example:Python3 ≥ 3.4In Python3.4 importlib.find_loader python docs was deprecated in favour of importlib.util.find_spec.  The recommended method is the importlib.util.find_spec. There are others like importlib.machinery.FileFinder, which is useful if you're after a specific file to load.  Figuring out how to use them is beyond the scope of this.This also works with relative imports but you must supply the startingpackage, so you could also do:While I'm sure there exists a reason for doing this - I'm not sure what it would be.WARNINGWhen trying to find a submodule, it will import the parent module (for all of the above methods)!comments welcome on getting around thisAcknowledgements@rvighne for importlib@lucas-guido for python3.3+ depricating find_loader@enpenax for pkgutils.find_loader behaviour in python2.7
After use yarbelk's response, I've made this for don't have to import ìmp.Useful in Django's settings.pyfor example.
Python 2, without relying ImportErrorUntil the current answer is updated, here is the way for Python 2Why another answer?A lot of answers make use of catching an ImportError. The problem with that is, that we cannot know what throws the ImportError.If you import your existant module and there happens to be an ImportError in your module (e.g. typo on line 1), the result will be that your module does not exist. It will take you quite the amount of backtracking to figure out that your module exists and the ImportError is caught and makes things fail silently.

I came across this question while searching for a way to check if a module is loaded from the command line  and would like to share my thoughts for the ones coming after me and looking for the same:  Linux/UNIX script file method: make a file module_help.py:  Then make sure it's executable: chmod u+x module_help.py And call it with a pipe to grep:Invoke the built-in help system. (This function is intended for interactive use.) If no argument is given, the interactive help system starts on the interpreter console. If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console. If the argument is any other kind of object, a help page on the object is generated.Interactive method: in the console load python If found quit reading by typing qTo exit the python interactive session press Ctrl + D Windows script file method also Linux/UNIX compatible, and better overall:  Calling it from the command like:  Would output:  Help on module site:  NAME     site - Append module search paths for third-party packages to sys.path.FILE     /usr/lib/python2.7/site.pyMODULE DOCShttp://docs.python.org/library/siteDESCRIPTION  ...  :and you'd have to press q to exit interactive mode.  Using it unknown module:  Would output:  no Python documentation found for 'lkajshdflkahsodf'and exit.
Use one of the functions from pkgutil, for example:
You could just write a little script that would try to import all the modules and tell you which ones are failing and which ones are working:Output:Word of warning this will try to import everything so you'll see things like PyYAML failed with error code: No module named pyyaml because the actual import name is just yaml. So as long as you know your imports this should do the trick for you.
Python 3 >= 3.6: ModuleNotFoundErrorThe ModuleNotFoundError has been introduced in python 3.6 and can be used for this purposeThe error is raised when a module or one of its parents cannot be found. Sowould print a message that looks like No module named 'eggs' if the eggs module cannot be found; but would print something like No module named 'eggs.sub' if only the sub module couldn't be found but the eggs package could be found.See the documentation of the import system for more info on the ModuleNotFoundError
You can also use importlib directly 
A simpler if statement from AskUbuntu: How do I check whether a module is installed in Python?
in django.utils.module_loading.module_has_submodule
There is no way to reliably check if "dotted module" is importable without importing its parent package. Saying this, there are many solutions to problem "how to check if Python module exists".Below solution address the problem that imported module can raise ImportError even it exists. We want to distinguish that situation from such in which module does not exist.Python 2:Python 3:
