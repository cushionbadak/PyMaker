I'm writing a code to analyze PDF file. I want to display the output on the console as well as to have a copy of the output in a file, I used this code save the output in a file:but could I display the output into console as well but without using classes because I'm not good with them?
You could make a function which prints both to console and to file. You can either do it by switching stdout, e.g. like this:or by using file write method (I suggest using this unless you have to use stdout)Note that:The file argument passed to the function must be opened outside of the function (e.g. at the beginning of the program) and closed outside of the function (e.g. at the end of the program). You should open it in append mode.Passing *args to the function allows you to pass arguments the same way you do to a print function. So you pass arguments to print......like this:Otherwise, you'd have to turn everything into a single argument i.e. a single string. It would look like this:I still suggest you learn to use classes properly, you'd benefit from that very much. Hope this helps.
sys.stdout can point to any object that has a write method, so you can create a class that writes to both a file and the console.Result:Console:result.txt:This method may be preferable to codesparkle's in some circumstances, because you don't have to replace all your existing prints with logging.info. Just put everything you want logged into a with block.
(This answer uses Python 3 and you will have to adapt it if you prefer Python 2.)Start by importing the Python logging package (and sys for accessing the standard output stream):In your entry point, set up a handler for both the standard output stream and your output file:and configure the logging package to output only the message without the log level:Now you can use it:
