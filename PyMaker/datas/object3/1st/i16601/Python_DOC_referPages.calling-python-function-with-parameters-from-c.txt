I created embedded python interpreter which is calling a function, that has 3 parameters. I successfully managed to do this for function without parameters, but when I execute PyObject_CallObject the program crashes with SEGFAULT:The source code of call is:Full source code of this .cpp file is https://github.com/huggle/huggle3-qt-lx/blob/master/huggle/pythonengine.cppWhat is wrong? Is this even proper way to call the function? I am following https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html and https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/tuple.html
Here is an example from the python documentation.It seems to me you should take care of the refcount. https://docs.python.org/3.0/extending/extending.html#calling-python-functions-from-cSegmentation fault is discussed here.Calling python method from C++ (or C) callback
