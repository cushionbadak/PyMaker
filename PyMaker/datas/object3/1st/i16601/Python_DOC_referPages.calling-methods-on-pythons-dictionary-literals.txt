I'm trying to concatenate some dictionaries.  The best way I've come up with to do that is to use dict1.update(dict2).  This is the code I'm trying to run, but it evaluates to None.  Why?
Since update doesn't return a reference to the updated dictionary, you can use the following instead:
The dict.update method works in-place and therefore always returns None.  It is no different than other in-place methods such as dict.clear and list.append.Note too that this behavior is mentioned in the docs:update([other])Update the dictionary with the key/value pairs from other, overwriting existing keys. Return None.Emphasis mine.
