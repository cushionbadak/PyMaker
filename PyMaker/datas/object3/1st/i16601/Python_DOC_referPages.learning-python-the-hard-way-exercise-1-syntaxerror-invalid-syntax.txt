Natural Text
Extremely new to this so this is likely caused by my own inexperience, so apologizing in advance here.I know this is said a lot on these questions but I'm trying to learn python using 'Learn python the hard way.'. I've become stuck on exercise 1: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex1.htmlOn windows we have to create a text file in notepad ++ called 'ex1.py' and run it in PowerShell using the command 'python ex1.py'.Problem is every time I try, I get this error:These types of errors are mentioned on the tutorial page but it only explains they point out errors and to use what it says in the 'SyntaxError:' to search for the answer if what it says is too cryptic to understand. Why is the caret pointing towards the "? What am I doing wrong?Any help would be greatly appreciated by this newbie.

You have a syntax error because Print should be print.
