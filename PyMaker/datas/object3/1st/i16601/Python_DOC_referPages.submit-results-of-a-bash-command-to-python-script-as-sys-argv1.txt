I have a list of files to be used as input that is very long. I was looking at the file input module, which seems to have some attractive features, [https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html][1]But I could not figure out how to use it without entering each file name by hand, which would be prohibitively long.What I would love to do is submit something likeOr I could push this same bash command to filelist.txt and submit that way; either way the trick would be to submit without having to type each file.
You could use the os package or subprocess. You would just have to figure out the exact command you would need to run in the terminal then read it and split it.Now you have a list of inputs that you can pass to the function
I'm pretty sure you cannot use sys.argv for this. Try using subprocess.Popen():
