I know it is possible to get access to builtin functions with something like:object().__reduce__()[0].__globals__["__builtins__"]And this seems to work for most functions. However, I cannot seem to be able to find exec(). I am pretty certain it is a builtin function, so why wouldn't it appear in __builtins__? Both eval() and execfile() are there.I am using python 2.7[EDIT]A much simpler way to get to globals is with the builtin function globals() :) So the above can be reduced to:globals()['__builtins__'].__dict__
In Python 2.x, exec is a statement, not a function:In Python 3.x however, exec was converted into a function:
exec is a keyword, like print. Therefore it is not a function.You can see this if you attempt to assign to it:If you're hellbent on calling exec without using the word exec, you can do something like this:which abuses the CPython API to execute a piece of code (which can be arbitrarily long).And if you need control over the globals and locals, use PyRun_String:
