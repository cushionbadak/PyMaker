This question already has an answer here:Python - getattr and concatenation                    2 answers                What I have is a value found in:number.odd is an input by the user, in x.and so if x='number.odd', I was hoping that:would display what value.number.odd would, but it doesn't. Instead I get:EDIT:Input x can also be something like X='number', or 'number.negative.prime'
You can use reduce for this (functools.reduce in Python 3.x):See a demonstration below:
getattr(getattr(value, 'number'), 'odd')Or taken from Python - getattr and concatenation by Cat Plus Plus
