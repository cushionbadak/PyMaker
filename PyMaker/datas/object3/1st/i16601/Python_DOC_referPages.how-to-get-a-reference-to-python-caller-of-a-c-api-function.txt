I am implementing an embedded python interpreter following https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.htmlThere is a way for me to easily create my own APIs to my C program so that a user can call my own internal C functions from a python script.This all works fine, but I would like to be able to know from which script the function got called. Every function must have these parameters according to manual:But the manual doesn't explain what self is so I assumed that self is a reference to module that called the function, which was probably wrong. I tried to call PyModule_GetName on self and it returned the internal name of my application which I set during initialization (using PyModule_Create).Is there a way to recognize which module called my C function?
If you were doing this in Python, you could use the following line:You might be able to do something similar in the C API, but I have never worked with it.
