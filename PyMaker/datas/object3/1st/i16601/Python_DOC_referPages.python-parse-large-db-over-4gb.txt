I'm trying to parse a db file with python that is over 4 gb.Example from the db file:I want to parse each block starting with % Tags relating toand out of the block I want to extract the inetnum and first descrThis is what I got so far: (Updated)
as it's over 4gb file you don't want to read all the file in one time by using f.read()but using the file object as an iterator (when you iterate on a file you get one line after the other)the following genererator should do the joband you can use it as the followingresult on the test file:
If you only want to get first descr :If you want inetnum and first descr :I must admit I make no use of % Tags relating to, and that I suppose that all descr are consecutive.
