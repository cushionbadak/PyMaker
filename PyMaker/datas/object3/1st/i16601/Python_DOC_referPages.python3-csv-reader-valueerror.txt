I searched through the python csv questions, can't seem to find anything addressing the reader error I'm getting.I have a csv file with 6 columns, trying to access two of them:I'm not done coding, but this is my first time using the csv module and I'm just trying to get a feel for it (relatively new to python in general).I can get the columns I want withbut I know there's a way to assign each column a name with python as well; any help much appreciated.
You have 2 for loops when you only need one:
Why are you assigning newline=''? That tells open() to treat each empty string as the end of a line. Try this instead: newline='\n'. Or try it without passing newline. Vor's comment below is useful too. See docs on open for more information.
You're close, but you need to use Hope that helps....
