Natural Text
I get the error: AttributeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object has no attribute 'replace'
You should open files in a with statement:the with statement ensures that resources are released properly, so you don't have to worry about remembering to close them.The more substantial thing you were missing is that data is a file object, and replace works on strings. data.read() returns the string of text in the file.
