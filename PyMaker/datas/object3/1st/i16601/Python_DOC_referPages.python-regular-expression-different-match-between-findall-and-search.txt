Natural Text
How come using the two ways to extract the matched string end up with two different results?EDIT: the space after Paris is what I'm concerned with. Isn't the parenthesis suppose to exclude the space? Blender says there is group(0) and group(1). I tried to match on c- something like r"(c.+?)\s" and group(0) is 'capital ' and group(1) is 'capital', no group(2).
Capturing groups in regex match objects are numbered somewhat differently than most things in Python, using 1-based indexing. I think this is done in order to be compatible with the regex codes from other programming languages, where the \1 has always been the syntax for a backreference to the first captured group.The text matched by the capturing group can be accessed by m.group(1), not m.group(0) like you might expect. If you use m.group(0) (or m.group() with no argument) you'll get the whole matched text, not the captured group. You can read more details in the docs.Note that if you don't actually want to consume the space with your pattern, you might instead want to use the \b escape sequence instead, to match a zero-length word boundary.
