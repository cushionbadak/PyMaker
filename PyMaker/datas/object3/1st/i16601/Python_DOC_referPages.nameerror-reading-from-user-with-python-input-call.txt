This question already has an answer here:NameError from Python input() function [duplicate]                    1 answer                I am a python newbie and have written a short program. The first part works but the if statement part has a traceback/syntax? problem. Advice?Here is the error:
The problem is that input is evaluating your input, so eval(y) is raising the error:Compare to:Docs:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#inputAs noted in the docs, "Consider using the raw_input() function for general input from users." Making this change prevents 'y' from being evaluated, thus treating is as a string, like you're expecting.The problem doesn't manifest on the integers because eval(10) is still 10.Confirmed via Python 2.6.5. Your code would likely work as-is in Python 3 -- docs for input in Python 3 do not include the implicit eval: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input
