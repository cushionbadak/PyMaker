this is my codeI've searched the topic but I don't understand.
You need to put your arguments for string formatting in parenthesis:Otherwise, Python will only see name as an argument for string formatting and the rest as arguments for the print function.Note however that using % for string formatting operations is frowned upon these days.  The modern approach is to use str.format:
You need a set of parenthesis:'%s %s' % 'a', 'b' is evaluated as ('%s %s' % 'a'), 'b', which produces an error in '%s %s' % 'a' since you have fewer arguments than format specifiers.
