I have a list of strings as such:  I want to sort this in such a way that the string with the largest number of words is first, ie,  Its a bit tricky, since if I sort in place by length  I'm back where I started.  Has anyone come across a graceful solution to this?  Thanks.
Assuming that words are separated by whitespace, calling str.split with no arguments returns a list of the words that a string contains:Therefore, you can get the output you want by sorting mylist based off of the length of these lists:You will also need to set the reverse parameter of list.sort to True, as shown above.
