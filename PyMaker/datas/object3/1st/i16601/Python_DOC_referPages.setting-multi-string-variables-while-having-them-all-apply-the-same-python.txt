I'm new to programming and I need some help for a ai robot I just started onHere is my code:If I type in something other than "nice" it goes to the else statement.Or statements don't work
First, the and keyword does not do what you want. It is used as a binary comparison. Due to the inner workings of Python, your variable complements will receive the value "wonderful". You want to put these words in a list (see here). You will then be able to manipulate these words using concatenation as such (for example):Furthermore, raw_input is a function. It must be called as such: raw_input(). Otherwise, you just create an alias of the function which you named input. You would still have to call it by appending () to it in order to receive the user input.I also don't understand your if var in input: statement. var is a sentence you made, why would you search it in the user input? It would be clearer to do if raw_input() in complements, or something along the lines of it.If you are beginning to learn Python, I would recommend you to use Python 3 instead of Python 2. raw_input() was renamed input() in Python 3.
