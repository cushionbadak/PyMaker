I hit this TypeError exception recently, which I found very difficult to debug. I eventually reduced it to this small test case:This is very non-obvious, to me anyway. The workaround for my code was to decode the byte string into unicode:What is the meaning of this exception? Is there a way it can be made more clear?
bytes objects do not have a __format__ method of their own, so the default from object is used:It just means that you cannot use anything other than straight up, unformatted unaligned formatting on these. Explicitly convert to a string object (as you did by decoding bytes to str) to get format spec support.You can make the conversion explicit by using the !s string conversion:object.__format__ explicitly rejects format strings to avoid implicit string conversions, specifically because formatting instructions are type specific.
This also happens when trying to format None:That took a moment to work out (in my case, when None was being returned by an instance variable)!
