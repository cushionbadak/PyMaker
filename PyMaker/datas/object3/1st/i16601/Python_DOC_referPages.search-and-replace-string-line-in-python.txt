Natural Text
I have a strange case for search and replace a string in text file using python. Input Data: I have a text file which looks similar as shown below.I have 2 problems to be addressedSearch and replace 1.0 with 0.0. The desired output is: In the above lines I want to increment the values by some value like 0.2 or 0.4. The desired output is:The "many lines" above indicates there will many lines in that section. In simple words my issues can be summarized as belowFirstly search for all the lines which contains QA1, QA2, etc. and replace all the values in the last entry to 0.0.Secondly increment the values by given increment like 0.2 or 0.4 in the last columns of lines with QA1, QA2, etc.Note:I have tried file open and replace option but that did not solve my problemI have not tried regular expression because of lack of knowledge in regular expression.The text file might contain about 5000-6000 lines, the lines QA1, QA2, etc. lines will be about 100-150 lines.
Python provides a module, fileinput, which is particularly convenient for this task:I don't think you need to replace all the 1.0s with 0.0 before replacing the 0.0s with a number incrementing by 0.2. Instead, just find the lines that begin with QA, and replace the last number with the desired number.
u can acheive this in following steps:open a new file to write the datasearch for the word 'QBFLUX' in linenow replace the 1.0 with the 0.0(val)increment the val by 0.2
