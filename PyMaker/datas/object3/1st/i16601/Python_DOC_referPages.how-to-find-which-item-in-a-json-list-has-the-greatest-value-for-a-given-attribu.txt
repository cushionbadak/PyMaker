This question already has an answer here:In List of Dicts, find min() value of a common Dict field                    5 answers                I'm using JSON data from the SFG WorldCup API.What I need to do is to find the most recent goal scored by a given team in a given match. To do that, I need to sort by the value of the attribute key in each element of the array that is the attribute of the away_team_events attribute. Let me illustrate. Here's sample JSON for France from the ongoing (at the time of writing) France v Switzerland.So what I need to do here is find which "id" attribute is greatest, because that will be the latest goal. How do I sort by a specific attribute like this?I've seen this question, but I can't really make sense of the answers.EDIT: rephrase, sorry for the confusion. I don't need to necessarily rearrange them, but how do I identify which item in the list has the greatest id, and use that?
Here is my solution, which use the max() function. All I have to do is to tell max how to sort, in this case, by the id field:Output:Discussionevents is a JSON data with just one key: away_team_eventsevents['away_team_events'] is a list of 7 items. From this list, we are going to select an item with the greatest event ID
If you want "the most X" item in a list, where X is "recent" or anything else, you use max(), which can take an optional key function. operator.itemgetter() is the one you want in this case:Or (as Martijn and Burhan point out) if you can guarantee that the list of dictionaries is already sorted by id, just getting the last one will work:
