This question already has an answer here:Prompt the user to input something else if the first input is invalid                    2 answers                I'm wondering why my code is not calling/running the function:This is what I'm using to call the function, and this is the function itself:So how can i Call the function (Function is before the first bit)?The difference between the one you marked as a duplicate and mine, is that the function is not running which in this case is classMain().
