Summary: I have a variable called 'parent' that is a dictionary in python. I want to check if it is a dict object. However, using "type(parent) is dict" gives me 'False'. NOTE: I have the following library loaded in my python script: Why is this happening? I suspected at first it is because this variable 'parent' is created using the json library's 'loads' method.However, even when I create parent like so,I get the the same results as observed below:What's going on here? Is this a python version issue? Or does this have to do with the fact I've loaded google's app engine library? When I execute the following commands in a normal terminal, with no libraries loaded (Python 2.7.5), I get the following results, which are what I expect:Thanks in advance for any guidance!
What's most likely happening is that GAE is using some subclass of dict behind the scenes.The idiomatic way to check whether an object is an instance of a type in python is the isinstance() built-in function:... which works for instances of the type itself, and of subclasses.
