As an alternative, you can consider using some library functions to get the free space:
use os.popen instead of os.systemNote: os.popen is deprecated as of Python 2.6 and subprocess is available since python 2.4 so if you want code to work on Python >= 2.6 use subprocess and if support for Python < 2.4 is important use os.popen.
