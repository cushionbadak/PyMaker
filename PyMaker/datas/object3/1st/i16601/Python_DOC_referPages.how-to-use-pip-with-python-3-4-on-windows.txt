Just installed a fresh copy of python 3.4.1 on windows 7. Here says that pip is included by default. but i could not find any pip.exe or some pip commands. Do I need to install it separately or it exists somewhere?
i have Windows7  Python 3.4.1; following command suggested  by Guss worked wellOutput 
Assuming you don't have any other Python installations, you should be able to do python -m pip after a default installation. Something like the following should be in your system path:C:\Python34\ScriptsThis would obviously be different, if you installed Python in a different location.
"On Windows and Mac OS X, the CPython installers now default to installing pip along with CPython itself (users may opt out of installing it during the installation process). Window users will need to opt in to the automatic PATH modifications to have pip available from the command line by default, otherwise it can still be accessed through the Python launcher for Windows as py -m pip." Have you tried it?
From the same pageNote: To avoid conflicts between parallel Python 2 and Python 3 installations, only the versioned pip3 and pip3.4 commands are bootstrapped by default when ensurepip is invoked directly - the --default-pip option is needed to also request the unversioned pip command. pyvenv and the Windows installer ensure that the unqualified pip command is made available in those environments, and pip can always be invoked via the -m switch rather than directly to avoid ambiguity on systems with multiple Python installations.So try pip3 or pip3.4 in Command Prompt.Also, ensure that environment variable are set for pip command, if you missed to opt-in for automatic PATH configuration.
Usage of pip for installation of packages in Python 3Step 1: Install Python 3. Yes, by default an application file pip3.exe is already located there in the path (E.g.):C:/Users/name/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36-32/ScriptsStep 2: Go to Step 3: Now, open cmd bash/shell by  Pressing key Windows+R.Step 4: In this same cmdAs Example just write:C:/Users/name/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36-32/Scripts/pip install matplotlibPress Enter now. The Package matplotlib will start getting downloaded.Further, for upgrading any packageOpen cmd bash/shell again, thentype that path of pip3.exe followed by /pip install --upgrade 'package name'  Press Enter.As Example just write:C:/Users/name/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36-32/Scripts/pip install --upgrade matplotlibUpgrading of the package will start:)
I had the same issue. The problem is that pip install tries to use C:\Users(username)\AppData\Local\Temp to unpack. You have to explicitly set those directories to R/W.I still couldn't do it because it was a work laptop and there were some permissions issues with trying to set these directories to R/W. The alternative is to go to your Env Variables, and set both Tmp and Temp to point to a writeable directory such as C:.  The installation went fine. I was able to install pip.The way I stumbled onto this is by not defaulting pip install in my installation. Even though the pip install was failing, the installer was not giving any errors. Removing pip and then trying to manually add it later is what pointed to what was going on.
"py -m pip install requests" works fine with Windows and its up gradation. Just change the path after installing Python 3.4 in the command prompt and type in "py -m pip install requests"command prompt. pip install
I had the same problem when I install python3.5.3. And finally I find the pip.exe in this folder: ~/python/scripts/pip.exe. Hope that help.
