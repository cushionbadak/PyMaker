Python Docs: os.popen: Open a pipe to or from command. The return value is an open file object connected to the pipe, which can be read or written depending on whether mode is 'r' (default) or 'w'.I'm able to use the next method X.__next__() / X.next() (2.X) but not the next(x) call, aren't __next__ method and next(x) the same ? why can't we use next(x) for os.popen's object ?Last but not least, how do next() and next method really work ? 
Looking at the source code(Python 3.4) it seems the __next__ method is not implemented in_wrap_close class, so the next() call fails because it fails to find the __next__ method on the class. And the explicit __next__ call works because of the overridden __getattr__ method.Related source code:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#next says about next:Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its next() method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.The error message:indicates that it's not an iterator. Most probably the __iter__ method is missing.It's strange that you're getting an error, because this works for me in Python 2.x:
