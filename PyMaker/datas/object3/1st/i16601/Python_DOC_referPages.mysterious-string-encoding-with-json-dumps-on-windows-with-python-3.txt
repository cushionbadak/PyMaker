We are discovering different behaviour of json.dumps on Linux and WindowsOutput on Linux: (python3.3)Output on Windows: (python3.4)Are we missing something? test.json looks like {'name': 'MÃ¼ller'}.How is it possible to read UTF-8 Files with Python 3 on Windows?
Don't rely on the default encoding when opening files; your JSON file is encoded to UTF-8 but you are opening it with a single-byte codec instead (probably CP1252, the Windows Latin-1 codepage):From the open() function documentation:The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns)Emphasis mine.
