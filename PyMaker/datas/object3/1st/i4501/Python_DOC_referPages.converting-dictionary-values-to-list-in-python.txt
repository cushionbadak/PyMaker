Suppose I have a dictionary (dict) with keys and values as below: print(dict) I want to extract the values from the dictionary in the form of a single string, i.e. type(values) = str, such as:but what I am getting is below under dict.values():dict.keys() dict.values() How can I achieve the required result?
You can use itertools.chain to do this:If you want to convert this output to a single string, just use an str() call on it, or use ", ".join(x for x in chain(*dct.values()) if x)
I believe this is what you are after if you want them output as a single string:Outputs:
Do you want something like?String manipulations are fairly straightforward after that
Just use extend method:If you need to delete the empty strings, use:See this SE entryThen you can convert it to a tuple if you wish :)
This is another way to do without import any module.Output:
You can try list comprehension in one line :output:
