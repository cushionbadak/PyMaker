I tried to use setUpClass() method for the first time in my life and wrote:and got: What does it mean and how to satisfy it?
You need to put a @classmethod decorator before def setUpClass(cls).The setupClass docs are here and classmethod docs here.What happens is that in suite.py line 163 the setUpClass gets called on the class (not an instance) as a simple function (as opposed to a bound method). There is no argument passed silently to setUpClass, hence the error message. By adding the @classmethod decorator, you are saying that when TestDownload.setupClass() is called, the first argument is the class TestDownload itself.
