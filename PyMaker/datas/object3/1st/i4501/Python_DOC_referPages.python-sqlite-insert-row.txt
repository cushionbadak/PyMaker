I have more than 100 rows of data and it would be really messy to have a line for insert table for every row. So I am trying to somehow quicken how I insert rows into my sqlite database. So I came up with the following:However, it returned with this error:Not sure what went wrong, the string is returning the correct value that I want but the function is not working.Thank you
You define a bunch of tuples, then an empty dict then try to access a value in said empty dict.  What you want to do is to load those tuples into that dict (or a list) to start.  Or, even betterYou really should read up on how to use a dict
Use executemany for Bulk inserts. Insert all the objects as tuples in listeg. 
I found a way to loop through the INSERT INTO with locals()This works perfectly, just that you need to manually key in the range.
