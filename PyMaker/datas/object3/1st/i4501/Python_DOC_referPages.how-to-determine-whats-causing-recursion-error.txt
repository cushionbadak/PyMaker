On my code I'm getting RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceededand only clue that I'm getting from a traceback is File "q.py", line 523, in __init__     self.background = Background(source='images/space.png')repeated like 30 times. I checked the line but can't see anything wrong with it. I should also mention that this error occurred out of the blue. The code worked flawlessly.Is there a way how to determine what exactly is causing it ? I'm aware that recursion usually means that some function is calling itself but I haven't found anything. Can't share the code because it's extensive.
Your recursion goes too deep - this might be a problem with your break condition or with your algorithm and the data it operates on. If you "do not use" recursion - your code is at fault and we can not help much without seeing a MVCE of it.You can increase the recursion size, see What is the maximum recursion depth in Python, and how to increase it?If your algorythm works for smaller data sets and only crashes for bigger ones, you should probably search for a non-recursive solution to it. Giving better advice without an mvce that replicates the algo and data that creates this error is difficult.Read How to debug small programs (#2) - see if you can somehow locate the portion of code that recurses and fix it.
