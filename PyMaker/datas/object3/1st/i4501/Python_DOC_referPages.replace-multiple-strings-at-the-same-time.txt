Lets say I have this string "abcd"Now I want to replace all 'a's with a 'd' and I want to replace all 'd's with an 'a'. The problem is that string.replace does not work in this situation."abcd".replace('a','d').replace('d','a') abcaExpected output is "dbca"How would I acheive this?
You could use .translate().Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through the given translation table.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translateExample:
You can use a list comprehension to switch the values that you want'dbca'Without a list'dbca'TimingIt turns out the list comprehension is slightly faster.
you can try python replace recipe :output:
