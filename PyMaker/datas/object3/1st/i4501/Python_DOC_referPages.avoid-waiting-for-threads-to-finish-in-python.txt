I've wrote this script here to read data from a txt file and process it. But it seems that if I give it a big file and a high number of threads, the more it reads from the list, the slower the script gets.Is there a way to avoid waiting for all the threads to finish and start a new one whenever a thread is done with the work?Also it seems that when it finishes processing, the script doesn't exit.
The script probably seems to take longer on larger inputs because there's a 3 second pause between each batch of printing.The issue with the script not finishing is, since you are using Queue, you need to call join() on the Queue, not on the individual threads.  To make sure that the script returns when the jobs have stopped running, you should also set daemon = True.The Lock will also not work in the current code because threading.Lock() produces a new lock each time.  You need to have all the jobs share the same lock.If you want to use this in Python 3 (which you should), the Queue module has been renamed to queue.Simpler example (based on an example from the Python docs)
