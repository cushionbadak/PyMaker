How to get an sh script for starting a new terminal, execute a python script and keep it running? The python script is supposed to run continuously in a perpetual loop, spitting out results as they pop in. Whenever trying with sh-script for gnome-terminal just getting: child process exited normally with status 2Manually it would just be: python home/ubuntu/pyscript.pyCould someone give an idea how to do this?I have a list of scripts to run, so resorting to the manual solution is tedious.
You can use gnome-terminal with the -x flag.Suppose you have a spam.py script; then the following command will spawn a new terminal, run spam.py in it, and close the terminal once the script has ended.Try with this script:Then the previous command will spawn a terminal, that will be printed eggs five times, and then will be closed.If you want to leave the terminal open with the Python interpret still running after the script ended, then Python's -i flag (doc then CTRL+F -> -i) is what you want:
To run the Python script in a new instance of your favourite terminal, write:This will start the Python script and run it until it ends, then display a Python prompt to stop the terminal emulator from closing.This will work with x-terminal-emulator substituted with any of the many, many terminals installed on my computer, so will work with little modification across all POSIX-compatible systems with the standard terminals installed. This won't work on a Mac, however. For a properly cross-platform Python implementation of something slightly different, see here. Most of the techniques should be transferable.To run the Python script in the same terminal whilst carrying on with the rest of the shell script, write:Note the &, which runs the program as a new process (but still connects the output to the virtual terminal).
