I would like to know how to transfer a number.For example: [1,0,2,3,4]Remove the one and transfer the one to two's positionResult: [0,0,1,3,4]
If your manipulations are purely index-based, you can do this:Alternatively, if you need to work out the index of 2:
Since you have not described your question with clear instructions, There is case when there will be more than one 2 or 1 in vector then what you want to do ?My solution is only for that condition when there is single 1 and 2 in vector because when you use .index method it always returns first value index no matter there are other values too.Since in your dataset there is always 1 times 1 and 2 in all vector so here is the solution for that If there are more than one 1 or 2 in vector like [1,0,1,1,2,2] then describe your logic and edit your question for that.
