Example data:with a desired result of ie) The most common pair.Approaches that don't seem to work:Using statistics as numpy arrays are unhashable.Using scipy.stats.mode as this returns the mode over each axis, eg) for our example it gives
You can do this efficiently with numpy using the unique function:Returns: [ 0.  0.]
One way via the standard library is to use collections.Counter.This gives you both the most common pair and the count. Use [0] index on Counter.most_common() to retrieve the highest count.The only complication is you need to convert to tuple as Counter only accepts hashable objects.
