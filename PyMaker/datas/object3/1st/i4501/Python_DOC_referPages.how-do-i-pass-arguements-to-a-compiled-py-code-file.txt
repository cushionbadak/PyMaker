I have written a python file which I want to use in a C# application,but I Don't want having to install python and dependencies every time I run it in a new computer, so I want to compile it to an .exe, pass the parameters to it, and get the output.my code file looks something like this:how do I pass the parameter to the function, and recieve the function's output?
From the Python on Windows FAQ:How do I make an executable from a Python script? See http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/ for a distutils extension that  allows you to create console and GUI executables from Python code.  py2exe, the most popular extension for building Python 2.x-based  executables, does not yet support Python 3 but a version that does is  in development.Also seehttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freezehttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2exehttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyInstallerAnd on SO:py2exe - generate single executable file
