I am creating a call in DRF to POST to the site. I am a bit confused why I get this error. I do not understand why this expects it to be a str. I know there are similiar posts but they still elude be to the solution. Errorserializer.py looks like and if I remove instance.id i get the same error but just for the next line. Viewurls.py
You passed to serializer userid instead of user object. To update object with serializer, you should pass instance as first argument. Change view to this:
AttributeErrorThe issue lies in the line serializer = UserProfileSerializer(userid, data=data) where you're passing userid to the serializer instead of a user or user profile instance, I say or because the logic is not very clear to me (using a UserProfileSerializer but updating User instance?).ImprovementsWhat you are trying to accomplish with your code can be done in an easier way:Use a ModelSerializer instead of a SerializerUse a ModelViewSet instead of a function-based view (user_profile_list)A generic version using ModelSerializer and ModelViewSet would be something along the following lines:serializers.pyviews.pyI highly recommend going through DRF's official tutorial, it will save you alot of development time if you understand which parts of your app are already implemented in DRF and can be directly used with little code.
