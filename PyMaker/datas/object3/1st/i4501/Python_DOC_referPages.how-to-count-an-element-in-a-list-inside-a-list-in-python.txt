Let's say I have a list like this:The first number is the user_id, the second is the tv_program_code, and the third is the season_id. My questionHow can I find out the program_code with more than 1 season subscribed, and then print the user_id and the tv_program_code?  For example:Or do you have any suggestion of which data structure I should apply?
One method is to use collections.Counter.The idea is to count the number of series per (user, program) combination using a dictionary.Then filter for count greater than 1 via a dictionary comprehension.Note on Counter versus defaultdict(int)Counter is twice as slow as defaultdict(int), see benchmarking below. You can switch easily to defaultdict(int) if performance matters and none of these features are relevant to you:Missing Counter keys don't get added automatically when querying.You can add / subtract Counter objects.Counter offers additional methods, e.g. elements, most_common.Benchmarking on Python 3.6.2.
There are many ways to do this task first using detaultdict :output:Second using itertools groupby :output:Third approachAt last you can also try manual approach instead of using any import :output:
