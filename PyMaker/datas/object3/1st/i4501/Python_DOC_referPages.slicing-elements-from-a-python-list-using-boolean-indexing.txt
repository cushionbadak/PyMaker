I recently came across this way of slicing a list in Python. I've never seen this one before, so I would like to understand this clearly. I have a list ["Peter", "James", "Mark"] and if I slice it using the boolean value False it returns Peter and if I slice using True it returns James, as given below["Peter", "James", "Mark"][False] => Peter["Peter", "James", "Mark"][True] => JamesI would like to know what happens here and what is this method called as? 
The datamodel hook here is the __index__ magic method:The value returned by on obj's __index__ is used when accessing with subscripting, allowing arbitrary objects to be used with slices:This is somewhat independent of the fact that bool is a subclass of int!  You may achieve the same with any object.Whether __index__ is resolved for int subclasses depends on implementation detail.CPython 3.7.1:PyPy 5.0.1:PyPy behaves correctly according to the Python datamodel.  Looks like CPython is taking a shortcut / performance optimization.
In Python, bool class is derived from of intHence True=1 and False=0print (True + True) will give an output 2So on a list ['peter', 'john', 'abhi'][True] returns 2nd element of the list i.e. john
