I have a line of code that assigns a variable to an array, it looks something like thisthis sits inside of a for loop with the 'data0' changing on each loop.  the issue the code should look like this:with the %s populating from pair.data1 however i get an error :self.data1.close[0] is not a string, it is actually a pointer to an array.  How can I properly change the structure to get the "data0" to update.maybe that issue here is I am using a string to define what is already a path to an array? 
It seems you want eval.
