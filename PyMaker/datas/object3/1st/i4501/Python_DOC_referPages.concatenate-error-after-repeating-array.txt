I have 5 arrays I want to repeat 600 times and then make into one big arrayI do this for all my arrays A, B, C, D and E. E is shorter then the other arrays. When I try to combine then the error is:This is because Lat3E is a combination of 600 arrays. It looks like this:How do I make this long 600 array into 1 long array to make the error go away?Thanks in advance.
You can concatenate multiple lists of arrays like this:np.concatenate takes a sequence as input, so a list or a tuple will do. If you have multiple lists, you need to convert them to a single list, for example with + (or you could also do [*Lat3A, *Lat3B, *Lat3C, *Lat3D, *Lat3E], or use itertools.chain, ...) and then pass it to the function.If all the original arrays are the same sizeAnother way of solving the same problem with NumPy only could be this:
Instead of Lat3E=[E]*lenE you can use np.repeat(E, lenE) function.
