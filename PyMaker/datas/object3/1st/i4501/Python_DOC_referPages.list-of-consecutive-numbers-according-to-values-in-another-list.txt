Natural Text
My target is to get a list of consecutive numbers, repeated accordingly with the initial list values. Lets say I have: And I want to get:...I'm totally new with Python, sorry for this -probably- very first steps question. Tried many searchs but the results didn't match with my needs, unfortunately. Thank you very much in advance.
The newbie-friendly solution is to use two loops:If you prefer one-liners for whatever reason, you can combine enumerate and range to get
IMO, this is a more maintainable functional solution:Note that this is all lazy (on python3) so everything will "happen" only when you actually call list.
Here is another way using repeat and chain.from_iterable
You can use enumerate:Output:
My solution
Another easy way:
This is possible via itertools, if you wish to remove the need for nested logic. itertools is part of the standard library.For improving your understanding of Python, I recommend you see @Ajax1234's solution for some nested list comprehensions.Note: you can replace [i]*j with itertools.repeat(i, j) or numpy.repeat(i, j) if you use numpy. The former may be preferable as it is lazy.
Very simple solution using sum and enumerate
You can try this approach:Just for fun I tried with lambda :lambda result is in nested list.
