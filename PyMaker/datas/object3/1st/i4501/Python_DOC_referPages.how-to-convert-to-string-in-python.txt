How to convert \x03a, \x03d, 0\x16 to string in Python? I searched the web but cannot find the solution.Can anyone please help?Thank you.
The default string type in Python3 is Unicode.You can verify this by writing type(u'\x03a') in the Python3 interpreter.It would give <class 'str'> which is the same result as would be if you write type('\x03a').To convert the Python3 string to bytecode, you may use your_string.encode().For information regarding the encode function, you may follow this link.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=encode#str.encodeYou may also convert the Unicode string to bytecode by writing b'your_string'Also, if you just want to print these characters without the Unicode format, you may just write print('\\x03a'), i.e. using the backslash escape character.
