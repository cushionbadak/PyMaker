Natural Text
I want my program to be able to extract a column of text from a .txt file, based on a command line argument.For example, say I have a fruits.txt file like this,In the command line, if I were to run python my_program.py 1 fruits.txt I want the output to be just the first column, E.g.If it was python my_program.py 3 fruits.txt, I would expect the output,And say I happen to also have a veg.txt file with the same format... e.g.Then in the command line, I would expect the same to happen if I did python 2 veg.txt And get,So far I've only figured out how to do it statically. I.e. I have to hard code infile = open("fruits.txt", "r") and specifically printing the field. E.g.
You can use argv from os module.You can call this script with this command python print_col.py 1 test.txt.
