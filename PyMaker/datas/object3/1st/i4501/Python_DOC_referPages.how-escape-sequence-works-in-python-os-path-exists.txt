I am working in a Ubuntu system. How does os.path.exists() resolve the below path to True.I know its a basic question, but does Python consider './' as escape sequence here.
This isn't a Python issue, you are using a valid path on any POSIX system.. is the current directory. /existing/directory/ and /existing/directory/. are one and the same path. Compare this to .., a reference to the parent directory.// is seen as a single / separator.So /home/.//<user>/ is the same as /home/./<user>/ is the same as /home/<user>/. In Python or in your shell.If you need to compare paths, you'd want to normalise the path, with os.path.normpath():For cross-platform applications, you can use the os.curdir variable if you need the correct string for the 'current directory' for the current platform.
