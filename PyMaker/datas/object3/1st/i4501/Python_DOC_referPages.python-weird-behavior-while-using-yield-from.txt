In the following code, I have run into a RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded.This works fine if I use some_list = [1, [2, [3]]], but not when I try it with strings. I suspect my lack of knowledge in python. Any guidance appreciated.
Strings are infinitely iterable.  Even a one-character string is iterable. Therefore, you will always get a stack overflow unless you add special handling for strings:Note: using hasattr(i, '__iter__') is not sufficient to check if i is iterable, because there are other ways to satisfy the iterator protocol.  The only reliable way to determine whether an object is iterable is to call iter(obj).
