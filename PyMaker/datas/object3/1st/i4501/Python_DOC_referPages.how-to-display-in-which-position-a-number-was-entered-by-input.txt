I have a list and once I sorted it to find the "biggest value", I need to display in which position this number was entered.Any idea how to do it ?I made this code to receive and sort the list but I have no idea how to receive the initial position of the "data".
Instead of finding the biggest value of the list by sorting the list, use use the max function:To find the first occurrence of a value in a list, use the .index method.
Another solution with sorted() (for more generic cases e.g. if you also want the 2nd, 3rd, etc. "biggest values") :enumerate() gives you a list containing tuples of (index, value).The argument key of sorted() is a lambda to "preprocess" the key values to sort - here we tell sorted() to use only value (x[1]) from the (index, value) elements(x).
