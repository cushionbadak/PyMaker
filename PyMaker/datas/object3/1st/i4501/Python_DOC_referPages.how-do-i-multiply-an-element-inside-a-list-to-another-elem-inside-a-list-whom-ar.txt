What do I do after this? I want to multiply the elem in a if it's the same as the elem in b then check if the answer is in answer.
There's a fantastic function in python called zip that's a bit easier to understand then a list comprehension.What zip does is allow you to iterate over all three lists at the same time, take a look at the following example:Notes:This assumes that A B and answers are all the same lengthIt doesn't check that mult is anywhere in answers, only that it's at the exact same index as the a & b multiplied.
Try using "zip" like this:Then you can compare that result list against the answer list you provided. A good way would be to do a truthy comparison like so, again using zip:if you merely want to check if each answer exists anywhere in the answer list, use "in" instead:
One way to achieve what you are looking for is:This approach does not consider the order or the index of the elements.If you also need to consider the position of the elements in a and b and intend to only compare elements with the same index then you can use:Using the generator expression you can compare the elements in a with the elements in b. Since they have to be equal you can use x**2 to get the result of their multiplication. The results can be filtered using the python filter which returns only elements which are in the answer array.
I would keep it simple and use something like this:Output would be:
If you are happy using a 3rd party library, numpy is convenient for this task.Relevant: Why NumPy instead of Python lists?
Given:Another approach is using numpy.multiply:Or, instead of list comprehension for element-wise equality testing, using np.equal:Or, simply falling back on the == operator for a numpy array and a same-sized list (-> element-wise comparison):
