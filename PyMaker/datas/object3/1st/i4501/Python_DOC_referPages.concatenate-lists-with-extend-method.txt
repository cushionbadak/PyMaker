Suppose such a dict with multiple items:I'd like to produce Try to implement it within one line using extend method.What's the principles behind list comprehension to output [None, None] ?It's facile to be achieved by Is it possible to be done with extend methond in single line?
straight answer: The result you desire can not be constructed in one line with extendAs many already mentioned in comment extend modifies list and returns None. You are not getting result because you wrote:[].extend(i) in list comprehensionfor each iteration your code will construct new list element [] and extend it with iteration value i you passed but it isn't stored anywhere so your code will perform operation but you won't get desire result because you didn't constructed a list before to avoid it you need to write code like this:
This comply with the principle of Commandâ€“query separation - Wikipedia devised by Bertrand Meyer.It states that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both.Design by contract - WikipediaFluent interface - Wikipedia
