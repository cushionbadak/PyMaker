Why when I do a simple store, does it goof up the help menu? It's adding the all caps destination for some reason and I dont know how to turn it off. Below you can see the difference. The first is using store_const which doesn't goof up the help menu, but of course doesn't suit my needs. The second is the simple store. See the difference?Constant StoreSimple StoreHere is the actual code for both simple and constant:Perhaps this is just expected and the reason it is adding START and END is to tell the user that the flag expects an argument. Its just a little confusing. Also, since it word wraps the menu, it makes it difficult to read at first. How can I clean up the menu? Perhaps suggest a way to increase the size of the help menu to fix the word wrap issue first and then if possible, maybe also a way to change START and END to something else that is easier to understand. Maybe <value>?
The string is indeed a placeholder for an expected argument, and it is called a metavariable. The string used is controlled by the metavar keyword argument to add_argument. The default (None) specifies the destination name in all caps. Use the empty string to suppress it, or passany other string (such as '<value>') to change it.
