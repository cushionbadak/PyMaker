That code below starts fine in pycharm.

The set_start_method in multiprocessing was introduced in Python version 3.4The error you are facing is due to the fact that you are using an older version of Python. Upgrading to Python 3.4 and above will fix the error.For more information, refer to -https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_start_method
