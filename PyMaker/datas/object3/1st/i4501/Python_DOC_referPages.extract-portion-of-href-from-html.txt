I'm looking for a way to get portions of href's into a pandas data table.Can anyone help me with extracting JUST the numerical characters that come after "playerid"? I've managed to scrape the data from the website but it's worthless without having the player's corresponding ID. Thanks in advance.

There is definitely a more efficient solution, but this should give you a basic idea on how to approach this problem.
