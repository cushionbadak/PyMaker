Your code is correct. The only problem is that you are trying to convert json dict object back to str as is mentioned in another answer what  doesn't make a sense at all. What did you want to achieve with sorted(py_str[0].keys())? Try it without [0].Small detail: You can use one with statement instead of two:
I'm not sure if I'm missing something here, but in this block:you're j is a dictionary containing the JSON data.  But in this line:you're converting that dict to a string (essentially undoing what you just did).  The error you're seeing is stating that strings don't have keys.You should instead use j instead of py_str when calling the keys() method.
j is your JSON-like object; it's a dictionary. Without knowing exactly what you're trying to do, I think you don't need the py_str=json.dumps(j), as that turns your JSON-like dict back into a string (which doesn't have keys).Python json documentationSome example interactive terminal commands:
