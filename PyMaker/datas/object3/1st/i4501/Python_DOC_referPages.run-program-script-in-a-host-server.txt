i'm currently working in a project that i have a python code injecting data in a database. But i need this code to run 24/7 or "fulltime". Does anyone know how can i do it? Not injecting data to a database, but the possible ways to make a script, software, console program and things like that, run full time in a server or a host without supervision, without needing to "Turn On/Off", you just put the code/file there and tell it to run indeterminately.I have seen that Python Anywere can do schedule runs of scripts, each hour, day, minute... but it's not a solution for me. Is it possible to be done with the paid version of it?I don't know much about databases, hosts and servers and things like that, but i'm looking for more informations about all those things to reach a best approach for this problem.Thanks for your time.UPDATE1:People on forums used to say that VPS is a good solution for that
you could use cron job to schedule you code to run. in side of your python code you could check the file exists first than do anything you want to dohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron
