Is there a way to specify bounds for a float variable in Python? For example, when I import data, I would like to either check if it within certain range such that min <= variable <=max. Further, if possible, I would like assign a specific value to such variable if the imported value is outside of these bounds (or even missing). I can perhaps do the first part if the variable was a float.x = var_check(5) returns 5, while x = var_check(50) returns 13.Any ideas on how to do this for a float variable?
You can do almost exactly what you wrote in your question:You should do the same with integers, by the way, at least in Python 2. In Python 3 (or with xrange in Python 2), it doesn't matter so much.
A solution could look like this:Output
You can define a class and override its __float__Then while importing your data you can do
