Natural Text
This is part of codingame chucknorris game, when we want to start for a string, and then convert it to "unary", a code with only 0 and spaces. Here is my code, my problem is that nothing gets out my print. Ex : CC => 10000111000011 :CC gives : 0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00
There are 4 mistakes in your code.The way you convert the input string to binary is incorrect. You're padding each character to 8 bits instead of 7, and since you're calling str on a list, strings with more than a single character will get commas between characters. The correct transformation isindex = bimsg.index(n) will always give you the index of the first occurence of n in the input. If your input is 1010, bimsg.index('1') will always return 0 and bimsg.index('0') will always return 1. This is not what you want.To get the correct index, use the enumerate function:Since bimsg is a string, n will also be a string. When you do if n == 1 or if n == 0, you're comparing a string to a number - that will always evaluate to False. You have to compare n to strings instead:Your code doesn't put any spaces between chunks of zeros and ones here:The zeros you're adding there just melt together with the zeros at the end of to_chuck, giving you incorrect output. To fix this, just add a space:Now we get the correct output:
