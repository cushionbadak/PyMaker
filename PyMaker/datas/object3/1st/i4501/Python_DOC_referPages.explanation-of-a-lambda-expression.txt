Natural Text
Can anyone make me understand why there is a '[0]' used after the split function. I am learning python and came across this. Any help is appreciatedThank You
Because [0] is the get operator of a list. The function split will return a list that consist of text string parts separated by colon (:). The lambda when invoked will return the first part of a text before any colon.Best of luck!
