I'm making a minecraft console client script for a friendIt opens the console client based on a txt fileI figured out how to kill/terminate the window but this part doesn't physically close the window it just sets it to a normal command prompt window because it's created using a batch commandHow would I close a program completely by name as if I pressed the "x" button in the top right hand corner of the application.Neither of those actually closes the .exe it just changes it into a command prompt window. And I don't want to have to run through the for proc in psutil.process_iter() again just to close the command prompt windows.EDIT 1:How it opens the MinecraftClient.exe please keep in mind it is a console client that you download from githubSome things I'm not using because they were just tests
I just checked, and I can't find anything called MinecraftClient.exe running for me. The Minecraft process is actually called javaw.exe - try killing that instead. If this is not the problem, I managed it with the subprocess module as such:shell=True prevents it from opening a command prompt on your screen.EDIT Your screenshots show that it ends up becoming cmd.exe - try killing that instead?Okay, after downloading the program I managed to successfully kill it using subprocess.call('taskkill /f /im MinecraftClient.exe & taskkill /f /im cmd.exe', shell=True)
