I'm new to unit testing and I am writing a class to model the behavior of a pinhole camera.I have several unit tests in Python using the unittest module, and my Camera class has a lookAt method which makes it look at a certain point, i.e it rotates the camera frame such that it points at the target.I also have a method which projects a 3D point into the camera's picture.My scenario here is that i first test the lookAt method, then if the test passes, i use the lookAt method to make my camera look at a cube and then project that cube onto my camera's picture (the projection is the thing to test here).Is there a possibility in the unittest module for me to run a test in another test? Or should i just make a lookAt matrix by hand and then test the projection separately(I think this would be the best practice here)?
Take a look at the skipIf decorator and applying it to your dependent tests based on a condition set in your first test.For example (from the above link):There is also subTest(), but the docs describe the purpose of subTest as being for "When some of your tests differ only by a some [sic] very small differences."
