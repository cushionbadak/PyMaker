This question already has an answer here:Read file from line 2 or skip header row                    7 answers                I have this piece of code:And I need to ignore the first (header)line. Of course I can work with a virgin boolean, check it's value during the run of the for loop, when False digest the line and set it to False otherwise.

Try this:enumerate and skip the first line
