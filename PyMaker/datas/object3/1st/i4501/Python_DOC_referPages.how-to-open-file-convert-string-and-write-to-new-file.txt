Natural Text
I am trying to open a text file, remove certain words that have a ] after them, and then write the new contents to a new file. With the following code, new_content contains what I need, and a new file is created, but it's empty. I cannot figure out why. I've tried indenting differently and passing in an encoding type, with no luck. Any help greatly appreciated.
This should work @firefly. Happy to answer questions if you have them.
