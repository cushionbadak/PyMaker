I'd like to use future module in exec function. But it looks like it only take effect in the current exec function, but not the following exec calls. The following code shows the issues. The second future module take affect as you can see the output hello world is what I expect. Is there anything that I miss here ? Thanks
from __future__ imports are really compiler switches, and only apply to single units being compiled. You have two separate exec() calls, future statements do not carry across. Compilation flags are not stored in the global or local namespace you execute code in.So yes, you'd need to prepend the line for each call to exec().You could also use the compile() function to first produce a code object, that you then pass to exec(); compile() lets you set flags instead of having to spell out the switches as from __future__ import lines:
