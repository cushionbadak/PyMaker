I want to convert this '2018-03-15T05:13:24.000-0400' datetime format to the epoch time format. While converting I am getting the time format error. Plz help me with this issue.Here is my python Code:Expecting output:Thanks :)
First, your strptime format has to actually match the string you pass it. Let's break it down:2018, 4-digit year: %Y-, literal hyphen: -03, 2-digit month: %m-, literal hyphen: -15, 2-digit day: %dT, ISO-style date/time separator: T (not a space as in your format)05, 2-digit hour: %H:, literal colon: :13, 2-digit minute: %M:, literal colon: :24, 2-digit second: %S., literal dot: .000, 3-digit millisecond, which you can parse as a 3-digit microsecond and fix later: %f-0400, 5-char UTC offset, %zNext, since for some reason using the time module instead of datetime, and using the struct_tm type which doesn't support sub-second times, and then truncating to int anyway, even though you apparently want milliseconds, that %f microsecond value is going to end up ignored, so you don't even have to fix it up.So just put this string together, and you're done.
