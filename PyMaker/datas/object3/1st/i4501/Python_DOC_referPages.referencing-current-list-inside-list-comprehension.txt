*Apologies if the title makes no sense. I am trying create a new list, which contains elements from list a that are also found in list b (without duplicates). My current code works, except it includes duplicates. What I am trying to do (see below) throws an error message. I know why it is not working, but is there a way to get around this, while keeping the code on one line?[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]NameError: name 'list2' is not defined
You should use a set here, because:Set objects support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference
The best way to solve this would be to use sets and the intersection method.Edit: Chris beat me to it :)
