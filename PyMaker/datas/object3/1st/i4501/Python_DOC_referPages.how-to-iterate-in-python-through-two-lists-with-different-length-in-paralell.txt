This question already has an answer here:Python: zip-like function that pads to longest length?                    4 answers                I have two lists:And I want to iterate over them. What I want to obtain is something similar to this:I have thought of using the zip function but it doesn't seem to work with different length lists as by using the following code:I get this: So the number 7 is missing. I wonder how could I adapt the code or ifthere is any other option I am missing to iterate in parallel when the lists are of different lengths? 
I think you need zip_longest:Even more specific to your question, use fillvalue with zip_longest:
You need zip_longest:
Check zip_longest() from itertools (a very useful module in Python Standard Library)
