I need to convert datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 1, 16, 22, 9, 920000)  into the Delphi TDateTime value 43191.68205925926, on Python versions < 3.2.I triedbut timedelta.total_seconds() works only if the python version is 3.2 and above.Delphi TDateTime values are expressed as a double floating point value counting days since midnight 1899-12-30.
The Delphi value is the number of days since a specific epoch, 1899-12-30. Construct a timedelta from the value as the days argument and add the epoch to go from Delphi to Python, and to go the other way, produce a delta between the Python datetime and the epoch, and divide the result by a timedelta(days=1) value (Python 3.2 / Python 2.7 and newer) or just add up the seconds and microseconds components and divide by the number of seconds in a day for older Python versions:This just uses an adjusted version of the equivalency documented for timedelta.total_seconds() to get the exact number of days as a floating point number.Demo:
