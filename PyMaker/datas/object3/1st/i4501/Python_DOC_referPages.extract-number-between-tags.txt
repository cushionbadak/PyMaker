I want to get the number 8 from the string <div class="abc">+8</div>.You're not being specific enough.gives you '8'. This works if abc is xyz, too.Do you expect that the numbers are always prefixed with +? (I'm guessing - is an option, too). Are they always inside <div> tags? Are <div> tags used for anything other than keeping these numbers? Can the <div> that surrounds a number also contain other things than the number? Could any <div> contain user-defined text that looks like these numbers in the source code? Before you can define your problem more concretely, you will risk false positives.
