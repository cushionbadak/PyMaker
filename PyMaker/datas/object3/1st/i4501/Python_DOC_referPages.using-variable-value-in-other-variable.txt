I have a variable such as:I want to access a DIC using the following stringwhich inherenlty should meanwhat is the proper way to do this in python?  What is the proper term for this type of variable? 
Assuming self.dname is a dictionary:x is an "index" variable - you are using it to find the data you want.  Here's a related question going the other way.Example: (tested in Python 2 and 3)You asked about self.x.  If x is a regular variable, you don't reference it with self. (as in the example above).  If x is a member of your class, then yes, you will need to use self.x.

I'm not sure to understand the question, but you might want to have a look at the getattr builtin function (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr).For example, in your case (again, if I understand correctly) :
