The built in function map returns an iterator in Python 3, which is the object you've observed here. This has some advantages when processing large amounts of data, because it will process each item on demand, and not build a list of all results when only a few were of interest. A related effect is that it will use cache better if you have more layers of processing. In Python 2, map returned a list instead, and the iterator version was called itertools.imap. Because of this change, some code that previously showed the results might only show the iterator object; the simple way to reproduce the full result is to apply list(). 
You need str.split with select second lists by str[1]:If want use custom function (failed if NaNs) use Series.apply or Series.map:
