Natural Text
I've written a code for a GUI that lets me input a phone number in 3 Entry widgets and returns the whole phone number in a separate widget to the side. I've managed to use input validation to limit the number of characters that can be typed into each widget, and also limited them to numbers only, however there are some issues.Once the first digit is typed into each Entry, that digit cannot be deleted with the backspace key, also after that first entry, the spacebar key is allowed to fill the remaining space in each Entry. How do I validate out use of the spacebar (whitespace?) and also allow the backspace key to delete all contents of the Entry widgets?Here is the code:Also, could the validation for all three be done more easily using a Class? I tried, but failed.Thanks.Mike
The first thing you should do is to turn your three near-identical entrycheck functions into a single function. They all do exactly the same thing, just with different values. The obvious solution is to make those values function parameters.The problem with this is that tkinter will only pass a single argument to this function. We need to find a way to include values for the other 2 parameters before we let tkinter call this function. This is easy to do with functools.partial. Using this, we can rewriteto(You have to take care to create all the widgets entry2, entry3 and button1 first before you do this, otherwise you'll get a NameError.)With that out of the way, we can now rewrite that function to accept empty strings and reject spaces.
