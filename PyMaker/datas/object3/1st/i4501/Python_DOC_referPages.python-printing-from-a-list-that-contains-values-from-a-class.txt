I'm trying to print out the values of the variable called Deck that is a list of values that use a class:But whenever i try to print: It gives me:
The printed version of your class can be overridden in a custom __repr__ method:Result:[2 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts, 4 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, J of Hearts, Q of Hearts, K of Hearts, A of Hearts, 2 of Spades, 3 of Spades, 4 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 7 of Spades, 8 of Spades, 9 of Spades, 10 of Spades, J of Spades, Q of Spades, K of Spades, A of Spades, 2 of Clubs, 3 of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, 5 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 9 of Clubs, 10 of Clubs, J of Clubs, Q of Clubs, K of Clubs, A of Clubs, 2 of Diamonds, 3 of Diamonds, 4 of Diamonds, 5 of Diamonds, 6 of Diamonds, 7 of Diamonds, 8 of Diamonds, 9 of Diamonds, 10 of Diamonds, J of Diamonds, Q of Diamonds, K of Diamonds, A of Diamonds]
When the print function is asked to print an object, that output is text. So, if the object is not itself text, print needs some text representation of that object.You can either do that explicitly – for example, by some explicit function call to get a text string – or implicitly, with the magic methods for text representation.An example of the explicit option:See the Python documentation for text formatting.An example of defining string-representation methods for a class:See the Python documentation for the magic __str__ and __repr__ text-representation methods.
Try using a namedtuple, which has a repr for humans:
