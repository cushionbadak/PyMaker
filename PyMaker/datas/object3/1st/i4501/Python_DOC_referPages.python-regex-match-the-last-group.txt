I have a string that looks like this:I want to match the last group, which is 10 in my string. So, something like this: 2017-11-02T00:00: and 10I tried re.match(r':\d+$', a), re.match(r':00$', a), re.match(r':00+$', a)But none of them seems to work. Can anyone please explain why my regex expression isn't working, and how to capture the last group from my string?The output can be lenient as long as I can confirm that the last millisecond equals 10
This problem doesn't need regex and can be solved easily with .split()Timing:If you really want to take the regex route which is a lot slower:
This is because re.match() implicitly anchors at the beginning of the string, meaning it only succeeds if the match appears there.  Because it anchors at the beginning of the string but not the end of the string, this behavior can be confusing.  You may find it simpler to always use re.search() instead of re.match(), and to use ^ and/or $ when you need anchoring.
Regular expression is generally not the best solution (in term of perfs). If there are tools for do the job you should use them. Here's datetime.strptime is your friend:Timing:See also strftime() and strptime() Behavior.
You may try this too
