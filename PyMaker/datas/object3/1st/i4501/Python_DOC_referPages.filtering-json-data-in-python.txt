I have a CSV JSON file of movie casts with 5000 items. The first item looks like this:I only need the values of "name" in this file. For eg in this item it would be:Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, Samantha Morton, Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, Ciar Hinds, Dominic West, James Purefoy, Bryan Cranston, Polly Walker etc. Meaning values with key as "name".How should I go about doing it?
Something like this should work. You use the csv library to convert the rows into an array to iterate over. The ast library will turn a string into a dict/json object you can key into. 
What you've shown is a single JSON array, not a CSV. (File extensions don't matter to Python) Parse the names from the objects in each JSON array row 
This is a very rudimentary example based on what you provided:Basically, this iterates over the different dictionaries in the list and then pulls the value associated with the "name" key.More information is required to do this over an entire csv file, but this might get you started.
