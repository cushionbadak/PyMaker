Natural Text
I am fairly new to python and am having difficulties with this (most likely simple) problem. I'm accepting a file with the format. e.g.,They are already separated into a nested list [year][name]. I am tasked to add up all the repetitions from the list and display them as such in a new file.My code is as follows-This is so wrong its funny, but I planned out where to go from here:Take the file separate into the names listadd 1 for each repetition display in name(tab)number formatclose the file.Any help is appreciated and thank you in advance!
From what I understand through your explanation, the following is my piece of code:Let me know if it helps. 
There's a built-in datatype that's perfect for your use case called collections.Counter.I'm assuming from the sample I/O formatting that your data file columns are tab separated.  In the question text it looks like 4-spaces — if that's the case, just change '\t' to '    ' or ' '*4 below.Once you've read the data in, it really is as simple as passing it to a Counter and specifying that it should create counts on the values in the second column.And printing them back out for reference:Output:
One of the great things about python is the huge number of packages. For handling tabular data, I'd recommend using pandas and the csv format:That being said, I would still highly recommend to go through your code and learn how these things are done from scratch.
