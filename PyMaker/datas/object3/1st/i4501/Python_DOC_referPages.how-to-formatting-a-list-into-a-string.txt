I am trying to format a string in python that takes arguments as items from a list of names.The catch is, I want to print all the list items with double quotes and backslash and one after each other in the same string only.The code is:The output should look like this:But instead, I keep getting like this:I've even tried using .format() and json.dumps() but still the same result.Is there any way to print the desired output or can I only print each list item at a time?
Without changing much of your code, you could simply format the repr representation of the list that's converted into a tuple.If you want to get your exact output, just do some string replacing: if you're trying to pass string_to_print to some other place, just try the proper way first, it might actually work for you.If you were mindful enough, you'll find that the previous "improper way" contains a small bug, try this adding "Alex's house" into list_names, the output would look like this:To take care of that bug, you'll need to have a better way of replacing, by using re.sub().But if things like this wouldn't happen during your usage, I would suggest to keep using the "improper way" as it's a lot simpler.
There is no function for formatting lists as human-friendly strings You have to format lists yourself:
This is one way using format and join:
