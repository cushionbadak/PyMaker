I'm having some difficulty in understanding how python converts between int and byte data types and specifically why it isn't consistent with representing it as hexadecimal numbers.Consider the following where I convert the number 13 into a 2 byte representation:Why does it use the character r in the second byte location? In this case I would have expected it to output:Doing the reverse in both cases outputs the correct answer.And both have the correct number of bytes
There is a difference between bytes and a hexadecimal representation. bytes is a datatype; hexadecimal is a way of representing bit patterns on the screen.A bytes is an immutable sequence of 8-bit values. The interpreter displays it, where possible, as characters or as string escape sequences, and where not possible, in hexadecimal. The corresponding literal is called a bytestring. In other words, hexadecimal is a sort of last resort. You can construct the bytes b'ABC' using hexadecimal notation: b'\x41\x42\x43' but the interpreter will still report it as b'ABC'. That is no different from the way quotes are handled:The interpreter has a standard way of displaying its data and takes no account of the way you entered that data in the first place. This isn't a roundtrip failure, because no information is lost. You are seeing an equivalent representation rather than the same representation, is all.If you want to see a hexadecimal representation then you should ask for it explicitly, instead of relying on the interpreter's default way of displaying a particular datatype. 
There are some special escape sequences which are so common that they are not explicitly represented with their hex values:you find a full list of escape sequences and how they work here.Note that there is also \0 <-> \x00 in the C language.
