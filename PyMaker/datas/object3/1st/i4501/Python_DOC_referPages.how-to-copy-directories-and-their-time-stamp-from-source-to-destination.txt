By using the code below, I am getting the directory from the source to the destination. However, the time of the destination directory and the source is changed.I would like to copy the source directory with their time stamp. Any ideas?
First warning on the docs:Even the higher-level file copying functions (shutil.copy(),  shutil.copy2()) cannot copy all file metadata.On POSIX platforms, this means that file owner and group are lost as  well as ACLs. On Mac OS, the resource fork and other metadata are not  used. This means that resources will be lost and file type and creator  codes will not be correct. On Windows, file owners, ACLs and alternate  data streams are not copied.shutil.copytree uses shutil.copy2()by default:Permissions and times of directories are copied with copystat(),  individual files are copied using shutil.copy2()
