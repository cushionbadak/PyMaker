Read your dictionary as key/value pairs (dict.items()) and then just format them in a string you like:The order, tho, cannot be guaranteed for a dict, use collections.OrderedDict() if order is important.
One way is to iterate via dict.items and use multiple str.join calls.If you need items ordered by key, use sorted(d.items()).
This joins all the keys into a large string containing replacement fields that we then format passing the dict values as args. There wasn't a trailing replacement field so we concatenate the last value in the dictionary to our large string.
