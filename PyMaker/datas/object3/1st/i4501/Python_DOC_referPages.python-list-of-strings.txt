Given a list of strings, return a list with the strings in sorted order, except group all the strings that begin with 'x' first.For instance:yieldsHint: this can be done by making 2 lists and sorting each of them before combining them.
You can use sorted with a custom key function:The key function creates tuples like (True, 'apple') which the sorted function uses to determine sort order. Words that start with "x" will have False as the first value in the tuple, and other words will have True instead:Since False < True, this guarantees that all words starting with "x" are sorted first.
You can sort the 2 different lists and return the concatenation of the 2, like this :To call the function:The result is :
A more pythonic way:First we separate the list into two lists, those starting with X and those that don't. then we sort and join them together.
