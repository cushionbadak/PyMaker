I have the formatday/month/yearAnd I have a task to define a function that takes a date and returns the date with 1 day increasedExample:next_day("13/1/2018") returns 14/1/2018next_day("31/3/2018") returns 1/4/2018How can I do that, I don't know how to do this when the function takes date not day, month, year.
This is one way using the 3rd party dateutil library and datetime from the standard library.Trying to perform the same logic with datetime will be more restrictive, which is probably not what you want since it's not obvious you can guarantee the format of your input dates.ExplanationTry parsing sequentially with month first (default), then day first.Add a day using datetime.timedelta.Use string formatting to remove leading zeros.Pure datetime solution
You can try this function to return the current date at least.extension Date {Then use the extension..((Date().withWeekDayMonthDayAndYear))It's a start..
