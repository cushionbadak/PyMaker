Natural Text
I need to figure out how to fix this code:It needs to be able to write to the text document "Test.txt" in the folder named "Folder"
First your path should be relative:if you want to write to a file you need "w" instead of "r" in the open functionRead:Write:Using "w" will replace all the current content of the file. If you want to append to the file instead, you should use "a".
path should be in /absolute/location/of/file/filename.That means either "C:/file/path/you/want/filename" in Windows or "/absolute/path/of/your/file/filename" in *nixYou can also use relative paths if the path you want is nearby (shares a directory, etc.)For example: if the script is in /user/scripts and you want to save in /user/textfiles/Folder, you can do ../textfiles/FolderAlso make sure that the folder exists, else, it will cause an error as well.Anyway, as you go further in python, it is recommended that you check out the os module as it can help you a lot with file paths and other things
