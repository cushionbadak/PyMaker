I am representing category hierarchy in flat manner.Category Hierarchy is  I am storing this as list using dictionary  What can be best approach to convert this category list to hierarchical list like

We start with a way to make_tree given an index and a root node identityNow we need a way to make_node - this is where we convert to an element in your input data to an element of our output treeNow of course we need a way to make_index based on your input data. We use itertools groupby so that we can perform efficient lookup of all child nodesLastly we write main to tie it all together. Note the data is not re-indexed or filtered for each iterationFull program demonstrationProgram output
Your problem is very similar to that I answered at: Calculating the Path from Parent Child RelationshipsI note that you seem to have a lot of superfluous fields in your data structures. Essentially you could represent the information in the post by:Reworking the code for you. outputs:To turn this into a nested dictionary I refer you to What is the best way to implement nested dictionaries?
