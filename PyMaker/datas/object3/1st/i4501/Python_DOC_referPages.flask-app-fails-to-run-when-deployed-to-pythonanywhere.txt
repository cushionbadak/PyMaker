I'm working on a web app that makes calls to the movie database. Everything runs fine when it's running on localhost. I'm attempting to deploy it on pythonanywhere. I have created a virtual environment and installed all the dependencies. I believe I have edited the WSGI file correctly. At least from the error messages I get it appears to have found the files.When I try to load the page it fails to run. It appears that for some reason the code won't import my own functions src.models.search.   Do I need to alter the file structure or file paths in the python code for the app to run? I followed the tutorials on python anywhere and feel that I have set everything up correctly. This is what my directory structure looks like
Since you set your path = '/home/gcmatt/capstone/src', the src module is not available on path. Only models, templates etc are. Python is only going to recognize a package if it can see a subdirectory with an __init__.py in it. It will not recognize the current directory as a package, regardless of whether the current directory has __init__.py or not.Try setting path = '/home/gcmatt/capstone' and it should be able to detect the package src. Edit here: you may also want to say from src.app import app as applicationSecond edit here: In your app.py you should also change your imports to import subpackages instead of src.[something]. For instance: from models.search import Search. Your WSGI will see the package src, and import src.app from it. And then src.app imports packages relative to itself (i.e. import models). Source: I use PythonAnywhere for a lot of my apps :) Here is some further reading on regular Python packages.
