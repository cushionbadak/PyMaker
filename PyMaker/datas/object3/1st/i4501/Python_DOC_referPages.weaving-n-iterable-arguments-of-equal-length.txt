Natural Text
In the snippet below I have a segment of code that is currently acting as I want it to:However, I am wondering if there is a more efficient and/or more Pythonic way of formatting text that is being returned by my weave_iterable function?  Specifically, I'm wondering if there is any way I can avoid using .format() twice, due to the unknown number of arguments passed into this function.  I am developing in Python 2.7, but would be happy with an answer in Python 3.x
You can use zip to group corresponding elements of your iterables and itertool.chain to flat the resulting grouped iterables. Then you can directly pass the result to join method:Your function will become
You can invoke ''.join() once more to avoid the {}*len(xx).Full program:Aside: If you always want hyphen-separated clusters of letters, you can specify that with '-'.join(...), like so:
You can also interleave the strings and intersperse the dash at intervals using the more_itertools third-party library:
