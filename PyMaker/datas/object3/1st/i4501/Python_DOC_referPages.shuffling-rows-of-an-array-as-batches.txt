I have an array of dimension (m,n). The values in the first column of the array is common to a certain subset of rows, and I would like to randomly shuffle the rows of the entire array while keeping together the rows that share the same value in the first column.If I use numpy.random.shuffle() it shuffles all rows indiscriminately. But I want to ensure all rows with the same value in the first column remain together sequentially in the array. Any ad-hoc methods that I could create seem a bit cumbersome, but here is essentially my goal: Exampleinput:output (which should be randomly shuffled in batches):
You could use itertools.groupby() to accomplish this:Output (several runs):
