Natural Text
I was wondering if anyone could help provide some insight on the following problem that I am currently struggling with.Let's assume that you have a file that contains the following characters:You have another file that contains a pattern, such as:How would you go about replacing the characters in the pattern with the characters from the first file BUT at the same time - you can only print the specific number of *'s that are in the first file.Once you have printed say the 10 stars, in total, you have to STOP printing.So it would be something like:Any hints or tips or help would be greatly appreciated.I have been using .replace() to replace all of the characters in the pattern with the '*' but I am unable to print the specific amount only.
Here's my aestric file(aestricks.txt), which contains:And pattern file (pattern.txt), which contains:And here's the code. I know it can be optimized a little more, but I am posting the basic one:OUTPUT:
You can use regular expressions and sub() function from re module.sub() takes an optional count argument that indicates the maximal number of pattern occurrences to be replaced.OUTPUT:
Instead of replacing every character at once you can replace items one at a time and use some count on number of replacements. But str object doesn't support item assignment at specific index, so you have to convert the str object into list first. Then do your operations and convert back to str again.you can write something like this.
Syntax of subOutputDemohttps://repl.it/repls/ObeseNoteworthyDevelopment
You just need to keep track of the number of * in the input line and then continue to replace the dashes until the counter runs out. Once the counter runs out then replace the remaining dashes with empty strings.OUTPUT
Added one more re.sub line to remove the left out characters if any.
