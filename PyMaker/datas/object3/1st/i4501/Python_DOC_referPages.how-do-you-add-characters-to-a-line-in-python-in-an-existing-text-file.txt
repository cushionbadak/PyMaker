Natural Text
Suppose i have the text file:    how would i get that to :  Is there a way to do this in python ?
I use fileinput.input() and its inplace parameter for tasks such as this. Taking advantage of Python3.6's f-strings, here is a complete example:Sample usage:
First open your file and read each line with readlines() to return a list of the contnse.  Then initerate through your list giving a variable the number you wish to give it.  Add the value of i (as a string) to the desired ., write over your existing file adding part of the list by slicing.
