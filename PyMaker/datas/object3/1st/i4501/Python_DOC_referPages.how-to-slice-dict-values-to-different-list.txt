The function bids returns a list with two values for each index, first is price, second is amount.Its possible to slice this list into two lists, one with price and another with amount?or put this into a nested dict key, for me to use later?Instead of returning a list it will assign the two values of each index on the list to a nested dictLike new_orderbook['bids']['price'] for the first numberAnd new_orderbook['bids']['amount'] for the second number
@ekhumoro is correct.You can unzip these pairs by passing zip() the iterator it contains preceded by the * operator.
