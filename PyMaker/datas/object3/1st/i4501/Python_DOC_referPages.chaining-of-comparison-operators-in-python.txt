This question already has an answer here:Multiple logical comparisons on a single line for an if statement                    1 answer                I am confused on how does the != operator works in python. I am new to python programming.I know simple != simply checks whether the LHS expression and RHS expression are not equal.for eg: returns True.My Question is how it works in series of != operators.eg: when I type in my python interactive session it returns False, but if I solve it step by step I get the answer True.Solving it step by step:-5 != False returns True True != True returns FalseFalse != True returns TrueSo it should return True but it returns False. I don't know why.A little help will be highly appreciated.Thanks in advance.
In Python, this comparation is equivalent to:I.e., See more in:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons.
