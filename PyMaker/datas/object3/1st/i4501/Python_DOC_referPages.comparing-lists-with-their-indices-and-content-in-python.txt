I have a list of numbers asAfter some calculations, for each element in N, I get the following list as the answers.That is, for the first index in N (which is 13), my answer is 4 in ndlist. For some indices in N, I get the same answer in ndlist. For example, when N= 13 and 31, the answer is 4 in ndlist. I need to find the numbers in N (13 and 31 in my  example) such that they have the same answer in ndlist. Can someone help me to that?
You can use a defaultdict and put those into a list keyed by the answer like:Code:Results:
Here is a way using only a nested list comprehension:To explain: the inner list comprehension ([i for i in ndlist if ndlist.count(i)>1]) gets all duplicate values in ndlist, and the rest of the list comprehension extracts the corresponding values in N where those values are found in ndlist
