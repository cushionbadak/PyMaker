How can I remove duplicates from the dict list below, while summing up the corresponding values thanksDesired output
You can get your desired output by using the following{'ACT': [['Civic ', 69.0]],  'NSW': [['Queanbeyan ', 25.0]],  'VIC':  [['City West ', 40.0], ['Thornbury ', 0.0]]}I would however suggest sing a dictionary of dictionaries for simplicity you can do the following{'ACT': {'Civic ': 69.0},  'NSW': {'Queanbeyan ': 25.0},  'VIC':  {'City West ': 40.0, 'Thornbury ': 0.0}}
You can rebuilt the dict using dict-comprehension. During rebuilding, you can use itertools.groupby to group the nested lists on first value of each sublist and sum the second value using a list comprehension:The above expression can also be rewritten using operator.itemgetter instead of lambda to get some performance
Throwing my hat into the ring with defaultdictI've used a vivified hash map to do this, which in turns uses defaultdict. I like the automatic grouping feature it creates.
