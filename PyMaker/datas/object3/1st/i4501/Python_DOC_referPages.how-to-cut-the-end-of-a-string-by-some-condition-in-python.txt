The function .replace() doesn't work here as I need to provide path and filename as separate parameters. The reason why I want to do is that I am accessing images through their paths and doing some stuff on them and when saving them I need to create another directory (in this case IMAGES) and the next directories after that (in this case AAAAA) should remain the same ( together with the name of corresponding image). Note that images may have different names and extensionsIf something is not clear by my side please ask, I will try to clear up
As alluded to in the comments, os.path is useful for manipulating paths represented as strings.At this point, how you want to handle capitalizing "images" is a function of your broader goal.

But you seem to be asking for a more generalized way to capitalize the second to last directory in the absolute path:
