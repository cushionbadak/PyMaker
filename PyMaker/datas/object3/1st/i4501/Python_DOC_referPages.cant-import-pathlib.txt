I'm just beginning at python (and coding ) so I still feel confused anytime I get an error message. whenever I write or I got this : ImportError: No module named pathlibI tried also naming it os.pathI'm on python 2.7.14Is pathlib in python 2 or only in 3 ? If it's not available, what else can I use ?Thanks 
Read the docs:11.1. pathlib â€” Object-oriented filesystem pathsNew in version 3.4.While a very small number of things released after 3.1 made it back to 2.7, the fact that no pathlib docs exist in the Python 2 docs should be a giveaway.The os.path module does exist in every version, so import os.path should work just fine.
