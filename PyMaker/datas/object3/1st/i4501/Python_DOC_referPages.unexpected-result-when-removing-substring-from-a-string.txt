This question already has an answer here:Python string.strip stripping too many characters [duplicate]                    3 answers                I have a string s, and I want to remove '.mainlog' from it. I tried:Why did the n get removed from 'ntm...'?Similarly, I had another issue:Why does python insist on removing n's from my strings? How I can properly remove .mainlog from my strings?
If you read the docs for str.strip you will see that:The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.So all the characters in '.mainlog' (['.', 'm', 'a', 'i', 'n', 'l', 'o', 'g']) are stripped just from the beginning and end.What you want is str.replace to replace all occurrences of '.mainlog' with nothing:
From Python documentation:https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.stripCurrently, it tries to strip all the characters which you mentioned ('.', 'm', 'a', 'i'...)You can use string.replace instead.
You are using the wrong function. strip removes characters from the beginning and end of the string. By default spaces, but you can give a list of characters to remove.You should use instead:Or:
The argument to the strip function, in this case, .mainlog is not a string, it's a set of individual characters.That's removing all leading and trailing characters that are in that list.We'd get the same result if we passed in the argument  aiglmno..
