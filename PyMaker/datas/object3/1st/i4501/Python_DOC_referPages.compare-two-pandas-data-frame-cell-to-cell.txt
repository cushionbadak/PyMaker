I am new to data science , I want to check which element from on data frame exist in another data frame.for example:df1 = [1,2,8,6]df2 = [5,2,6,9]for 1 output should be Falsefor 2 output should be Truefor 6 output should be Trueetc ..Note:- I have matrix not vector. I have tried using following code:import pandas as pdimport numpy as npI am doing something wrong in if priority_cell in converted_file_cell_array[:] ?Is there any other efficient way to do that?
You can take the .values from each dataframe, convert them to a set(), and take the set intersection.
You can flatten all values of DataFrames by numpy.ravel and then use set.intersection():
