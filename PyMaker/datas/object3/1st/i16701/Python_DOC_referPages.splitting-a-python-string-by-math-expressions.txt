Natural Text
I have a lot of python strings such as "A7*4", "Z3+8", "B6 / 11", and I want to split these strings so that they would be in a list, in the format ["A7", "*", "4"], ["B6", "/", "11"], etc. I have used a lot of different split methods but I think I need to just perform the split where there is a math symbol, such as /,*,+,-. I would also need to strip out the whitespace.Currently I am using the code re.split(r'(\D)', "B6 / 11"), which is returning ['', 'B', '6', ' ', '', '/', '', ' ', '11']. Instead I want to get back ["B6", "/", "11"]. 
You should split on the character set [+-/*] after removing the whitespace from the string:
There is a way to solve this without regular expressions by using the Python tokenizer. I used a more complex formula to show the capabilities of this solution.Result:
