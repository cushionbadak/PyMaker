I have this list: and the code below the list was used to select a random image from a list. My problem is that it isn't unique and lots of pictures repeat.. Is there any way to overcome that? 
Use random.sample to choose random non-repeating elements:random.sample returns a list object.Side note: there's no need in list comprehension, unless you're planning to filter the result of glob.glob.
