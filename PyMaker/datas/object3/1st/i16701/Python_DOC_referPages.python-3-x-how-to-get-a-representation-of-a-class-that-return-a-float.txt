I have a class that return a float number, and I want to print it in the __main__ as a representation of the previous class, formatted to trim some numbers over floating point. If I override the __str__ method I obviously get TypeError exception, as the following example:So, how can I "fix"? Using the __repr__ doesn't seem to help
You can convert the float to a string within the __str__ method before returning it.
You could implement the __format__() special method to customise how your custom class is interpolated into a string format:This delegates to the format() function to handle the actual formatting, but it gives you a hook to determine what format is being requested for your custom object.The __format__ method is passed the full Format Specification Mini Language string. Like __str__ you still need to return a string object.Demo:
