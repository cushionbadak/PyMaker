I am trying to reproduce the simplest examples from the Bokeh tutorial, on a 64-bit Windows machine with Python 3.3.0.Here is the code in its entiretyThis gives me the following error:I understand that this has something to do with the encoding that Python is using to write to the output file, but don't know enough about setting the encoding of the output file or the encoding that is being used by Python to write out to fix this. Help appreciated.Edit:I tried to implement the advice given here, to always pass stdout output through a streamwriter:but some of the interface appears to have changed, and there is no sys.stdout.encoding variable.
I have opened an issue to track this problem: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh/issues/682As you have discussed with eryksun, it seems easily fixable.I will keep you updated here, but if you want to participate in the issue, you are very welcome.Cheers
fg nu,We can not replicate the issue in our win platforms... can you please join us in the opened issue: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh/issues/682 to get more information about your setup and architecture? We will very grateful if you can give us more info to replicate the issue and get a quick fix.Thanks.Damian
