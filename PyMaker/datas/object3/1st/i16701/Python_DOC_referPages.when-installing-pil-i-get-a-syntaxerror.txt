When I try and use easy_install PIL it will give me the error:It is extremely annoying and I have tried installing it from a package as well. I've downloaded Imaging-1.1.7 and it gives the same error. I am trying to get the Image module in Python 3.4.1. I've tried installing Pillow 2.4 but it doesn't show up in the module list when I type pydoc3.4 modules and none of the applications even detect it's existence. Please help because I am getting desperate. I am on Mac OS X 10.8.4 with Python 3.4.1.
That syntax for print only exists in Python 2.x, where print is a statement.  However, it was removed entirely in Python 3.x when print became a function.  This means that your version of PIL is incompatible with Python 3.x.  So, you now have two options:Get a version of PIL that is compatible with Python 3.x. This question has more information on that.Downgrade to Python 2.x.
I have also tried brew install PIL and pip install PIL and I encountered the same issue, because I'm using python 3.4. But I just solved the problem today. This is thanks to Ned Deily's answer above, which i need to figure out first how to do since i'm not well experienced with pip stuffs.So to do it, you need to head over to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/ and click the latest version. (found version 2.6.1 at the time of this writing). You should see something like Pillow-(version).tar.gz (found Pillow-2.6.1.tar.gz). Just right click it and copy link address if you're using chrome browser and type in the following in your terminal.that should do the trick
