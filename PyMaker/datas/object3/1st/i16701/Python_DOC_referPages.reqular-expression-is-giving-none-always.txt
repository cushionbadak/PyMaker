You need to use re.search() instead of re.match(). The first one is looking to the pattern anywhere in the string, and the other one looks if the pattern can be applied to the string exactly.From the documentation:re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)Scan through string looking for a location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding match object. Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.Example:
Use re.search(), not re.match(); the latter only matches at the start of the string:If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding MatchObject instance.Demo:
