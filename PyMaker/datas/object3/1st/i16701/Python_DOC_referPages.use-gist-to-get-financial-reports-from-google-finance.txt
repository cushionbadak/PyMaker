However i am used to downloading a git repository go to the file directory where the downloaded git is and with the use of the cmd excecute the setup.py to setup and then use the git in my machine.However once I download the gist i getpax_global_headerA folder named gist6952087-f454536fdd54c47d42017aa1e9f286524b9bd9e8 which inside has a gistfile1.txtHow can i actually put this thing to work with my python from the cmd?EDITAnd it throws an error
gistfile1.txt is the script; the gist author just didn't give it a name.If you want, give it a name with a .py extension instead, and run the script with Python:gives you the command-line help message.Do make sure you have pyquery installed first.The file is written for Python 2. If you have Python 3 installed, it is easy enough to have it converted:This will replace the script with one that will work just fine on Python 3.
