Natural Text
I have the following problem:  The unicode object testclass contains several unicode strings like test.ScreenshotCounterTest or FileExistTest I need a way to initialize these Objects with the property argumenta way to dynamically create objects from this testclass list object.Thanks for your help
If I get what you need, then this should help you:importlib interface may have changed between p2.7 and p3k, I'm not sure. Also, there is (was?) __import__ built-in function, but I find importlib most reliable.In your case testclass/e['class'] will be used instead of qual_name, and tester should be assigned like class_inst in this example.
