Natural Text
I'm trying to write a simple Python IRC client. So far I can read data, and I can send data back to the client if it automated. I'm getting the data in a while True, which means that I cannot enter text while at the same time reading data. How can I enter text in the console, that only gets sent when I press enter, while at the same time running an infinite loop?Basic code structure:
Another way to do it involves threads.
What you need is an event loop of some kind.In Python you have a few options to do that, pick one you like:Twisted https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/Asyncio https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.htmlgevent http://www.gevent.org/and so on, there are hundreds of frameworks for this, you could also use any of the GUI frameworks like tkinter or PyQt to get a main event loop.As comments have said above, you can use threads and a few queues to handle this, or an event based loop, or coroutines or a bunch of other architectures. Depending on your target platforms one or the other might be best. For example on windows the console API is totally different to unix ptys. Especially if you later need stuff like colour output and so on, you might want to ask more specific questions. 
You can use a async library (see answer of schlenk) or use https://docs.python.org/2/library/select.htmlThis module provides access to the select() and poll() functions  available in most operating systems, epoll() available on Linux 2.5+  and kqueue() available on most BSD. Note that on Windows, it only  works for sockets; on other operating systems, it also works for other  file types (in particular, on Unix, it works on pipes). It cannot be  used on regular files to determine whether a file has grown since it  was last read.
