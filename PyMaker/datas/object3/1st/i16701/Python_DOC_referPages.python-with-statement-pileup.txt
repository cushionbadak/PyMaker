This question already has an answer here:Create a “with” block on several context managers? [duplicate]                    5 answers                I tend to use the Python "with" statement quite often. Mostly for cleaning up a directory after I have symlinked or copied some files into the directory, as the tasks still gets executed even if the python script crashes. Here is an example of on of my functions that can be used with the "with" statement.The way I use these with statements they tend to pile up quite quickly.Is there a better way to do the above with the same ease and safety of the powerful "with" statement?
You can put multiple context managers under the same with statement:On Python 3, you could use the contextlib.ExitStack() to manage multiple context managers:The use_symlink context managers are then torn down in reverse order when ExitStack() exits.
