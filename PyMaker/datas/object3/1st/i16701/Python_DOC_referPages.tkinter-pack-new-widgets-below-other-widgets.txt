Natural Text
I'm trying to pack the button below the Text and Scrollbar widget.This is what it looks likeI want the button to be below and not in between the other widgets.I have tried the following:How may i pack the button at the bottom?Another issue is that the scrollbar does not work, when i try to scroll nothing happens. (Yes, i have tried to fill the Text widget with alot of lines, more than it can view.)Also, why is the scrollbar viewed/packed outside/"far" away from the Text widget?
Try using the grid geometry manager instead.http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/grid.html
I think you should consider replacing the text field with a ScrolledText field.It's a lot easier to use and doesn't require manual scrollbar placement.(Don't use pack to place it though. Use grid)
