How can I use the latter as a subscript of the former? I.e. I would like to extract the second and fourth element of a.Put otherwise, in Matlab I would useHow can I do the same in Python?
You can use operator.itemgetter to do it:
You can use a list comprehension like so:
numpy supports indexing with arrays, as well as a bunch of other array and matrix operations, in Matlab style. Consider using it for computationally intensive tasks:
you can try like this it can be explained like this
