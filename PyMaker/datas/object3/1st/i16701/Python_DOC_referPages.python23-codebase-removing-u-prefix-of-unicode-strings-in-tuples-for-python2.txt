I am writing my doctests like this:This works fine for Python version 2.5, 2.6 & 2.7 but fails for Python 3 with following error:Problem is that if I write my doctests like this:They will work only for Python3 and fail on Python2 version. My question is how do I make it cross version compatible?
I ran into the same problem with doctests in IPython. There's no neat solution, but I wrapped all of the u' prefixes in {}, i.e. {u}', and made a little function that would include or exclude them as appropriate.You can see the u_format() function and a doctest using it.But that's rather messy, so I've moved many tests away from doctests.Alternatively, you can test it like this:If you need some unicode strings in the keys, you can use u'ab√æ', and use distribute to run 2to3 on the doctests. But that only works on input code, not output reprs.
If you use pytest, you can just do:And the u will be stripped if you are running Python 3, and kept in Python 2.
I run into the same issue with doctests in NLTK; it was solved by using a custom doctest output checker (that treats u'foo' and 'foo' the same) which is installed by a custom nose plugin: https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/develop/nltk/test/doctest_nose_plugin.pyThis solution is not pretty, but it works quite well (there are about 0.5 megabytes of doctests in NLTK) and it doesn't make doctests less readable.EDIT: found a simplified standalone version of this nose plugin: https://github.com/gnublade/doctest-ignore-unicode
