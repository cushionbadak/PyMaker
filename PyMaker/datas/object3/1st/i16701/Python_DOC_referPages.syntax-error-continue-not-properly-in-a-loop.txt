it says Syntax error 'continue' not properly in a loopwhen I run the file.
You cannot continue from an if statement. You need it to be in a loop.Whereas,is wrong.Python Docs state this:The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:
The continue keyword is used to go directly to the next iteration of a loop, skipping the code after the keyword. So, the errorindicates that the  elif clause is not inside a loop (like for or while).What can you do?Check your logic. Do you really want to use continue?Put the code inside a loop:
continue must be inside a while or for loop, check if your elif statement is within a for or while loop. if yes, check your indentation.
The continue keyword is reserved to skip the iteration of a loop and not a if condition block. What you want to do is more this:From the documentation:continue may only occur syntactically nested in a for or while loop, but not nested in a function or class definition or finally clause within that loop. It continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.When continue passes control out of a try statement with a finally clause, that finally clause is executed before really starting the next loop cycle.
