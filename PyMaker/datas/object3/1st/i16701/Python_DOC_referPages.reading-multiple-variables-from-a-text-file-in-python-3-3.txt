Natural Text
I have a text file in the same directory labelled test.txt. It contains the following 3 lines:The output this gives me is:My code is below.How would i go about making it pick up the full variables? Ie test1 = 10, test2=3, test3 = 5?Very new to python :(
You don't have to give f.readline() an argument at all:otherwise you limit the number of characters read. f.readline(1) does not mean 'read line 1'; instead you say: 'read a line, but no more than 1 character should be read'.Quoting from the IOBase.readline() docs:Read and return one line from the stream. If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.Emphasis mine.
