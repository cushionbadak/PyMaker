How to extract string (i.e. link with arguments) with "?" in it? When I tried to use :string is just overlooked. It would be excellent to separate ?ver=1.3 in third group. Any help?
The attribute values are surrounded not only by ", but also '.Modification to the regular expression is required:use ["'] to match either " or '.UPDATETo get ver=1.3 part, you'd better to use urlparse.urlparse (In Python 3.x, urllib.parse.urlparse).
It has nothing to do with the character ? (and I'm not sure why you'd assume it does).You don't use the character " to delimitate the URL, you use the character '. Just change the string to :And it will produce the correct result :
