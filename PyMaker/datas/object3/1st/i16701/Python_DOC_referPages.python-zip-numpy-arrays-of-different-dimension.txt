Natural Text
I'd like to zip numpy arrays befor saving it via np.save. For zipping one dimensional arrays I usewhich does exactly what I want. Now I have more data, say likebutdoes not work. I could doinstead, but the "depth" of c changes. My solution isbut that reads kind of suboptimal. Thanks for an advice.
I would use numpy.hstack/vstack:Edit: I actually mostly use np.row_stack/column_stack nowadays, as I find it more natural than hstack or vstack:
Use the * opertor to "unpack" c when calling zip:(You can avoid zip and use a direct numpy approach (e.g. using vstack, as @metaperture suggested), which is arguably a better approach. However, this answer demostrates the correct way to do exactly what you were trying to do originally)
I would not recommend using zip if your only objective is to save multiple arrays of different dimensions, as the title of this question suggests. Use np.savez or np.savez_compressed instead. These functions were meant to save multiple arrays (of arbitrary dimensions).Using zip is particularly bad as it won't port to Python3, where zip returns an iterator and not a list of tuples. Calling np.array on the iterator creates an array with a single element of dtype object, which is probably not what you want.I was not able to recover the zipped data after a save and a load.
