Basically, I'd like a function ConvertIntToFruit(int) that returns an enum value.My use case is I have a csv file of records where I'm reading each record into an object.  One of the file fields is an integer field that represents an enumeration.  As I'm populating the object I'd like to convert that integer field from the file into the corresponding Enum value in the object.
You 'call' the Enum class:to turn 5 into Fruit.Orange:From the Programmatic access to enumeration members and their attributes section of the documentation:Sometimes it’s useful to access members in enumerations  programmatically (i.e. situations where Color.red won’t do because the  exact color is not known at program-writing time). Enum allows such  access:In a related note: to map a string value containing the name of an enum member, use subscription:
I think it is in simple words is to convert the int value into Enum by calling EnumType(int_value), after that access the name of the Enum object:Or as a function:
