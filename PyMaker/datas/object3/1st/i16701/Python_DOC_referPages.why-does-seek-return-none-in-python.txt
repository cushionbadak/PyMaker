The doc clearly says:Return the new absolute position.However, seek appears to return None (same behavior also on Linux):Is this a know bug?Is this a doc or implementation bug?
You are reading the wrong documentation. You need to look at file.seek() when using Python 2:There is no return value.Using io.open() is fine, and if you do, you'll get a different object, whose seek() method does return the current position:The io module is the new I/O architecture for Python 3, available in Python 2 as well. The Python 3 built-in open() function is an alias for io.open(), but not yet so in Python 2.
Following up on Martjin's answer, use type() to inspect the variable's type:By inspecting the object type, you will see that the variable f is not a member of io, but of file, and so the documentation to look up would be different.
