I am trying to write a program that loops a prompt 10 times or until the correct input is entered. Wrong input entered should not count towards the 10 tries to enter the correct input. I am not sure if I should keep the prompt within the for statement or not. Here is what I have so far regarding the bad input issue:
A better construct to use would be a while loop.Instead of looping for 10 times, you could loop until you have a valid input, i.e.However, that said, if you only want to loop for a maximum of 10 times, the construct that you have is perfectly fine - you just need a way of exiting the loop when a valid number is entered,After seeing your comment, I would still advise using while loop, just with an extra variable (and a few changes made from DarinDouglass's comment
You need to break the loop when you get the correct input:See a demonstration below:
