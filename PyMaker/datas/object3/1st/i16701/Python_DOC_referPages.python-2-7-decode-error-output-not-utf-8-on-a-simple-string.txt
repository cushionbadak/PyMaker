When I try the following code:I get this error:Decode error- output not utf-8Although there are other questions which seem related, they mostly seem to be from people actually trying to encode something, whereas I am just trying to make sure my file path does not error out when I call it. How can I fix it?
You need to escape your slashes:  write \\ instead of just \ when you want a backslash.Alternatively, you could use a "raw string."  Whenever a string is a raw string, a slash i just a slash, and you don't have to worry about weird stuff happening.Right now, Python is interpreting the \777 as a single character, with the octal value 777, which does not exist.  So Python is puking.  Check out this link to the reference and scroll down a bit for the escape sequences in Python strings. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#strings
