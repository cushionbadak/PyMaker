Natural Text
I got this data returned b'\\u041a\\u0435\\u0439\\u0442\\u043b\\u0438\\u043d\\u043f\\u0440\\u043e from an API. This data is in Russian which I know for sure. I am guessing these values are unicode representation of the cyrillic letters?The data returned was a byte array.How can I convert that into readable cyrillic string? Pretty much I need a way to convert that kind into readable human text.EDIT: Yes this is JSON data. Forgot to mention, sorry.
Chances are you have JSON data; JSON uses \uhhhh escape sequences to represent Unicode codepoints. Use the json.loads() function on unicode (decoded) data to produce a Python string:UTF-8 is the default JSON encoding; check your response headers (if you are using a HTTP-based API) to see if a different encoding was used.Demo:
