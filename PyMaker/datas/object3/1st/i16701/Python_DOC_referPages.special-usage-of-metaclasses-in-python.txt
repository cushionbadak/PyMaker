I was messing around with python metaclasses and I came across something very intriguing that I didn't know existed or was valid:When you run this, 'foo' is printed.So apparently, classes can have extra keyword arguments if their metaclasses allow for it.If a scenario in which this functionality may be useful is found, is it okay to take advantage of it? Or should it be left alone in favour of other methods (such as defining a class wide variable extra_thing)?
The behavior is documented, so it's probably safe to use, if perhaps confusing to other programmers reading your code. Here's what the docs say:Any other keyword arguments that are specified in the class definition are passed through to all metaclass operations described below.The "operations" it describes are __prepare__ and calling metaclass itself (which will usually call the __new__ and/or __init__ methods of the metaclass).
