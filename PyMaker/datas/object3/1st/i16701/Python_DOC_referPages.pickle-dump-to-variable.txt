I'm new in python and i wanted to know if there is a solution for this problem:I know that this may sound strange but i want to save the pickle.dump data into a variable.I begin to think that may i could bypass it by making a fake class to instead of writing in a file, writing in a variable:and then:Nothing is presented as error, but the output is just a '.'So is there a solution to instead of saving that in a file saving into a variable?
You are looking for an in-memory file object; in Python 2 that's cStringIO.StringIO(), for Python 3 io.BytesIO(); these act just like file objects and you can have pickle.dump() write to these.However, the easier path would be to use pickle.dumps() to dump straight to a string object instead.Under the hood, what pickle.dumps() does for you is create an in-memory file object, write the pickle data to it and retrieve the string result for you; see the source code:but this way you don't have to do that extra work yourself.
