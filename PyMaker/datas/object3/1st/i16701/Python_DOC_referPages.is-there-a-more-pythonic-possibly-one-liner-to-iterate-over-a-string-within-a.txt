Strings are iterable.Lists are iterable.And with a List of Strings, both the List and the Strings can be iterated through with a nested loop.For Example:Out:It seems we can then iterate within the iteration over the string, i.e. iterate over each letter of 'abcdefg'. Is there a more pythonic way to iterate as above, possibly in one statement? I've re-read through Learning Python Chapter 4, Chapter 1 of the Python Cookbook, and looked here in python: iterate over each string in a list, and here Displaying and iterating a list within a string?.
You can use itertools.chain.from_iterable():
Use itertools.chain:
What you've written is already the most pythonic way to do it; there are already two levels of nesting (letters within strings within a list) so it's correct to have two nested for loops.If you really want to use a single for statement, you can collapse the loops with a generator comprehension:
That is good enough, everything else is just an academic puzzle
