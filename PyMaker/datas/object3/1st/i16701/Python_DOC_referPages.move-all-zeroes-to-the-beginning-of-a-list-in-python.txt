I have a list like below:  and I want to push all zeroes to the beginning of that list. The result must be like below.  How to do it in Python 2?
You could sort the list:The key function tells Python to sort values by wether or not they are 0. False is sorted before True, and values are then sorted based on their original relative position.For 0, False is returned, sorting all those values first. For the rest True is returned, leaving sort to put them last but leave their relative positions untouched.Demo:
This can be done without sorting. SolutionsInitialization:list.count and itertools.compressSame as before, but without list.countlist.count, itertools.compress, itertools.repeat, itertools.chainSame as the previous one, but without list.countBenchmarksFor small lists:For large lists:As you can see, in some cases itertools-based solutions tend to be slower, because of the big number of function calls.
Here are some better timings, with two new methods:First the sorting:Then frostnational's methods:Then methods more directly working from lists:And again with larger sized input:Sorting:frostnational's:New:That said, despite being relatively slow, Martijn Pieters' decision to use sorting is actually pretty competitive for reasonably-sized lists and premature optimisation is the root of all evil.FWIW, here are some timings for very long lists:
Try this simple process:-
