I wanna scroll sys.argv from the second to the penultimate argument. why it doesn't work?
You have a mistake in your code: you shouldn't put two colons, but just one. Here's how it works:In order to exclude n first elements, the syntax is [n:].In order to exclude n last elements, you don't need to count the number of elements in an array. Instead, you use: [:-n] syntax.If you want to exclude first x elements and last y elements, you can combine both: [x:y].In your case, to get the array without the first and the last arguments, you may simply do:Like this:
Your problem is that you have too many colons, resulting in an extended slice.Because of the extra colon in [1::len(sys.argv)-1] (the space between the colons in your version is unnecessary, and may be what confused you), you're saying:Give me all the elements from index 1 ......to the end (because there's nothing between the first and second colons) ...with a stride of len(sys.argv)-1.Obviously, if you start at the 2nd element of a sequence and then stride forward by len(sequence) - 1, you get to the end, and there's nothing left.If you drop the extra colon, your code will work ... ... but Python allows you to use negative indexes to count from the end of the sequence you're slicing, so you can replace the whole thing with:
sys.argv is a list, so you can apply slicing in order to get only a certain part of the list, for example if you only want to iterate from element two to the penultimate.Generally, if lst is a listis the first element of the list, andis the last.Example:With slicing, your for loop should look like
