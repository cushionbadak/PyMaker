To my knowledge, indexing with -1 will bring you up the last item in a list e.g.But when you are asking for a sequence from the list, -1 gives the second to last term in a list, Why? I would have expected, and would like to get DEFG
It is because the stop (second) argument of slice notation is exclusive, not inclusive.  So, [3:-1] is telling Python to get everything from index 3 up to, but not including, index -1.To get what you want, use [3:]:Also, just a note for the future: it is considered a bad practice to use list as a variable name.  Doing so overshadows the built-in.
It's for the same reason that list[3:4] doesn't include the character at the 4th index; slicing is not inclusive.  In addition, you can slice from a character to the end simply by omitting the second slice parameter, as in list[3:].
