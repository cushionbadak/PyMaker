Natural Text
So I have a huge string of words separated by spaces and tabs and was wondering what I could do to quickly append each individual word to a list.EX.The string has tabs and multiple spaces varying between words and I just need a quick solution instead of manually fixing the problem
You can use str.split:Without any arguments, the method defaults to splitting on whitespace characters.I just noticed that all of the strings in your example list are lowercase.  If this is needed, you can call str.lower before str.split:
str.split() should do it:If you want all lowercase (as @iCodez also points out): From the link above:If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.sep is the first argument of split().
