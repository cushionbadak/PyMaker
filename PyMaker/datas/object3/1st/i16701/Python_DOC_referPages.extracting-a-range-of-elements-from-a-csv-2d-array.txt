I want to extract elements from a range of elements is a specific column from a csv file.I've simplified the problem to this:I thought that meant 'show me all columns for just row 0 and 1''show me all the rows for just column 0 and 1'But the output is always just showing me rows 0 and 1, never the columns,when I want to see this:Is there a nice way to do this?
Your problem here is that data[:] is just a copy of data:... so both your attempts at slicing are giving you the same result as data[0:2].You can get just columns 0 and 1 with a list comprehension:... which can be rearranged to the order you want with zip():To get a single list rather than a list of 2 tuples, use itertools.chain.from_iterable():... which can also be used to collapse data[0:2]:
