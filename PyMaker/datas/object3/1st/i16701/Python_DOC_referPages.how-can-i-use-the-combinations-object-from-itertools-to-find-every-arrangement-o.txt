My code Whenever I input a word for the "original" variable, it returnsWhat would I change here in order to take the input string for "original" and have it print all the possible rearrangements of the characters? I'm also running Python 3.3 if that makes a difference.
You're looking for:permutations returns an iterator (not a list) of tuples containing all the permutations of original (e.g. ('t', 'e', 'n'), ('t', 'n', 'e'), ...). So you need to iterate over the iterator, and join each tuple in to a string.
DSM (in the comments) is right that you want permutations rather than combinations.As to your reported problem - like everything else in the itertools module, permutations and combinations return iterators. So, you can either iterate over the result:... or convert it to a list:
