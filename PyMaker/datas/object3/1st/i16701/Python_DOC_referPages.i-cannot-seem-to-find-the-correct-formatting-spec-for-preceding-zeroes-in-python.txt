When adding decimal places, it's as simple as     and I get 2.00 back, as expected. But, what's the format spec for adding preceding zeros? I would like for the output to be 0002, and the only spec I've found with Google for that is using %04d, which did not work. If it matters, I am running Python 3.3 on windows.
Several Pythonic ways to do this,:First using the string formatting minilanguage, using your attempted method, first zero means the fill, the 4 means to which width:Also, the format minilanguage:the specification comes after the :, and the 0 means fill with zeros and the 4 means a width of four.New in Python 3.6 are formatted string literals:Finally, the str.zfill method is custom made for this:
Use zfill:
You were nearly there:
You can add the leading 0 to a floating point f format as well, but you must add the trailing digits (2) and the decimal point to the total.
