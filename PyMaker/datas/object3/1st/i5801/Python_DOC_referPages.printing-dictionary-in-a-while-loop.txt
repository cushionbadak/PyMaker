I have been looking around to see if anyone has actually done it but couldn't find it so hoping I can get some help here.I created this dict and I want to use a while loop to output it this way: I am able to do it with a for loop, just curious how it can be done with a while loop. 
You can make your dictionary an iterator calling iteritems (Python 2.x), or iter on the items() (Python 3.x)Note: We're importing print_function on Python 2.x because print would be a statement instead of a function, and hence the line print(*item) would actually fail
Here's another option, using the .pop method.typical outputThis code doesn't modify the contents of newDict, since in Python 2 dict.items() creates a list of the (key, value) pairs of the dictionary. In Python 3 it returns a dynamic View object, which doesn't have a .pop method, so this code won't work there.Bear in mind that a dict is an unordered collection, so the output order may not be what you expect.
Use following code:
You can do this with while loop.
This is an absurd requirement, but here is one way to do it:CAUTION:After the while has finished executing, newDIct will be empty.
You can use iteratorPython 2.7Python 3
