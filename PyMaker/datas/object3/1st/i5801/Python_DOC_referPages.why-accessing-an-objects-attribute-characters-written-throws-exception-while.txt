I was trying to list all attributes/values of an object in interactive shell of python3.6:gives an attribute list like ['\__cause__',...,'characters_written',...]but throws an error:  AttributeError: characters_writtenwhenexecutes normally.Why is characters_written attribute special in this case?
That's an attribute of OSError that's made available for BlockingIOError. dir shows it because it does exist, it's __get__ just raises an AttributeError if it is accessed from an instance of a class that doesn't use it.When accessing it from the class, it simply returns the attribute object itself (it doesn't invoke the attribute objects __get__ which raises the AttributeError)
In Document It is written that characters_written attribute is accessible by IO classes. so you cannot access it byFileExistsError Objectcharacters_written  An integer containing the number of characters written to the stream before it blocked. This attribute is available when using the buffered I/O classes from the io module (Document Link Here)this topic also discussed herehttps://bugs.python.org/issue30554
e = FileExistsError() So when you are writing e.characters_writtenit is FileExistsError().characters_written which will not work because of the paranthesis.If you correct your assignment that is e = FileExistsError it will resolve your issue
