I would like to create attributes of an object based on a dictionary passed in as an argument. Here is the code. But it does not work as I get the following error: 'Obj' object has no attribute 'c'The code read "name" as a literal, and not as the variable defined.
This is what will work :
Use setattrSome additional advice:Your code is very strange. I'm not sure why you expect self.name to evaluate as self.(eval('name')) when that clearly doens't happen elsewhere in python There is no need to iterate over dictionary.keys(), especially in python 2. for k in dictionary: works just fine. If you want both keys and values use dictionary.items() (or dictionary.iteritems() in python 2).name = 'k' + '_' + 'series' just makes the string 'k_series'. You need to be able to tell the difference between a string and a variable name. I think you mean k + '_' + series but series is never defined. Don't use + to concatenate strings like that anyway, use .format.
