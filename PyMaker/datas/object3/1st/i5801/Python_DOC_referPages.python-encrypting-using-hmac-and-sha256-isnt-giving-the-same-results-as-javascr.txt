I am trying to get the same results in python and javascript but when the in encryption I am having troubles, the encryption gave me the same result in javascript and in python but if I put the data in json format and then encrypt I get different results.I can change the javascript code because is for an api the python code can be modified if it is needed.Python code:JS code:

You're hashing different data.In the Python version, msg_data is:In the Javascript version, json is:Note that there's no space after "timestamp": in the JS version. Not all JSON implementations will generate the exact same output for the same data. (You'll run into more problems when there's more than one key in the dictionary -- JSON doesn't set any requirements on what order the keys appear in.)
