I have the following code:and I want to use the character # in my url because itÂ´s a value that can be used for dtmf. Is there an encode function in python which can help me in this? Or should I forget this scenario?
You can use a replacement: replace # with %23.
Use urllib.quote (Python 2) or urllib.parse.quote (Python 3) to escape your dtmf value or anything else that might contain reserved characters.
