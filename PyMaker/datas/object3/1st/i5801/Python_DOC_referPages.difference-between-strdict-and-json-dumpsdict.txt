What is the difference between the output of str(a dictionary) and json.dumps(a dictionary)? If I print them, they look the same. Their attributes (as per dir) also seem to be identical (see below). Yet I know there must be a difference. Could you please explain it to me?
str(aDictionary) (as well as repr(aDictionary)) produces a Python representation of your dictionary. This representation is helpful for debugging and nothing more. For the built-in types such as dictionaries and strings, you'll be given a representation that is valid Python syntax. Python syntax and JSON syntax may look similar, but are not the same thing.Python uses single and double quotes for string literals. JSON only allows double quotes.Python Unicode strings use \<single letter>, \xhh, \uhhhh and \Uhhhhhhhh escape sequences to encode Unicode codepoints; the latter form is used for non-BMP codepoints. JSON uses a smaller range of \<single letter> escapes as well as the \uhhhh form, and encodes UTF-16 surrogate pairs for non-BMP codepoints (so two \uhhhh sequences per codepoint).Python uses None objects, JSON uses null to as a special "doesn't exist" sentinel value.Python uses True and False as boolean values, JSON uses true and false.Python dictionary keys can be any hashable type, JSON only supports strings.So str(dictionary) will not produce valid JSON output, most of the time; only if all your keys and values are BMP strings with at least one single quote in the value could you end up with a document that can also be parsed as valid JSON.In terms of your specific example, note that str(aDictionary) produces a document with single quotes; json.loads() can't load this document as that's not valid JSON:Never use str(pythonobject) as a serialisation. Although the ast.literal_eval() function can load a reasonable number of Python built-in types from a string representation, it is a lot slower than using JSON for the same job, or a more sophisticated data persistence format if JSON doesn't fit your needs.
