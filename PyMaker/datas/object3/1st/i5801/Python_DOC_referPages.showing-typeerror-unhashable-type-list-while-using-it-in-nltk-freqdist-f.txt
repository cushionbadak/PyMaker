Natural Text
I am trying to get the frequency distribution of the word in a phrase according to its degree using nltk. It is showing "TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'" though. Don't understand what the problem is. Please help.P.S: The code has a whole lot of bugs so don't mind that. I am trying to build a keyword extractor using code snippets from many many programs as I am a noob to python. If anyone wants to shed some light on the other bugs are also welcome.Code:Full Traceback:
This error occurs when you are trying to use a list as a dict key. lists are not hashable and can't be used for keys (e.g. tuples can be used).In your case in this lineyou are using degree as an index for word_degree that doesn't make sense cause degree itself is a list.
