I've the following scriptThat "name" in the last line is what I need to match the matched name in the line. I tried to check the any() documentation but couldn't find a solution.Thanks in advance.
Change this:To this:any() goes though the iterator trying to find any value that returns True but does not tell you which one it was.next() will only return the next value that returns True. The catch here is that there might be multiple that do so. Do not use next if you want to get them all.Finally, note that next() can also take a default argument in case nothing is found. You might wanna use that. If you do, you do not need the except part. It is handled internally.

Just change the any to a loop over a list from a list comprehension:
