Natural Text
I am a python noob and am having trouble trying to extract a number. Its a SQL query, but i turned it into a string type. If there's a better way to do this, please let me know as well. My string contains many words that are similar, so I want to extract the number after a distinct set of words. ExampleOut of this, I want to extract the "37" from they key "id". Store it in a variableI tried it with .split(), but I am not sure that works because there are characters that don't work with the index because of the apostrophes and the colon. I know that there is a way to use SQL to get result (query.get('id')), but I want to know a way to extract this in a string.Please help! Thank you!
this looks like a dictionary - so you can simply access it by set["id"]Output:Done.If it is a string, you can split it into a dict like this:Output:
You can use the ast module to convert string to dictionary   Output
