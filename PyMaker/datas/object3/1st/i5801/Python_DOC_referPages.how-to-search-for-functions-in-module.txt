I want to have a search function like a man page inside a Python module.Is there a built-in or module function to search a string/wildcard char in function name/class name/object name or function of class?e.g. find(get_*)?This would find all get_* functions, such as get_height, get_weight, get_area, get_volume as well as square.get_area,rectange.get_areaor have a find(get?int) to find get_int, etc.I can have a list in help(module) but there is too much clutter and no search function I can find.If not, how can I write a function to do the same?
As an alternative to using re, for simple matches of the type you've given, use fnmatch.  That provides much friendlier matching.Then:
So... From what I can glean from your post, you want to be able to find and return a list of all the functions within your module that matches a given pattern. Sounds to me like a job for re!Here's my python.
You can use the re module to do this as illustrated below. You need to learn how to write regular expressions to use it, but that's extensively documented. For a good start see the Regular Expression HOWTO in the documentation.
