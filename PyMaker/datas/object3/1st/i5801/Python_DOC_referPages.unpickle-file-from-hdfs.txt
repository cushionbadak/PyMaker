I'm currently using Python 3 and would like to load a pickle file out of HDFS. I get a type error at the pickle loading stage. I found an option to open the file using pydoop and then unpickle it. But unfortunately, I can't use Python 2.7. Any similar options?
Per BluBb, pickle.load requires a Python FileHandler. hdfs.read_file returns bytes in this case and using pickle.loads read the model properly.
