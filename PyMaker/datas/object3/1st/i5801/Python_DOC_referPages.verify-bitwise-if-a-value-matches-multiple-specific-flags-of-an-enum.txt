I would like to check if a value corresponds to a set of flags (from an enum or object alike).Right now, I have come up with the following function in javascript (praise the snippet :3):In python the function would look like this:Is there a better way (that is, more idiomatic ... or more pythonic) to do this same verification?Edit: Solutions in both python and javascript are appreciated, but I am  especially looking for an algorithm (whatever the language), as I've searched a lot across the web and never found any, while it seems to me that it's a common problem.
One option in Python is a set of flags, where flags are elements of (for example) an enumeration from the enum module. This also has the benefit of the subset operator already being defined, so you can just do needed <= flags.Your final code would look something like this:
When combinations of flags are represented as bit-masks you can do mutations and tests on all the flags at once, directly, using bit-wise operators.
You could check with Array#every, which exit if a condition is wrong.
