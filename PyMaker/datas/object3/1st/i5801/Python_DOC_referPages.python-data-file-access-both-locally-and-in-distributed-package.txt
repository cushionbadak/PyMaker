Is there a pythonic way to access data files both in local testing of a module and in the distributed package (e.g. with wheel)?Specifically, I have the same question as the comment linked below.Python Access Data in Package Subdirectory
Putting packages in setup.py in the argument setup(..., data_files=[('', YOUR_DATA_FILES)],...) (the '' is the significant part) copies them in-place, and they can be accessed as they would otherwise be, both in local testing and when distributed.
