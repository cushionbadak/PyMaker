The put method takes a path to a local file (and an optional user token). request.files[key] returns a custom object that represents the uploaded file. Flask documentation links: file uploads quickstart, incoming request data api, FileStorage class.You need to store the uploaded file data to a local file, and the pass that file name to the put method:Look into the tempfile module to generate random temporary file names (instead of using the hard coded some_filename.ext, which obviously is not a very good idea with concurrent requests).
