I have the following code and I would like it to jump back to a line if a certain eventuality were to occur:What I would like to happen is: if change = round((change - product_1_price),2) would end up being negative, then I would like the program to return to the top (number_of_10ct = int(input("How many 10 Cent coins would you like to insert? "))) and allow the user to enter more "money".How can I do that?
Use a while loop and a continue statement:
What you can do is put all your code in an extra while loop that would keep running until change becomes positive (so you would need to initialise change to a negative value before the loop).With this, you will enter your while change > 0 loop after change has been set to the good value. Once change becomes negative, then you get out of this loop and go back at the top, where the user can add coins.Then, if the customer decides to buy nothing before using all their change, then change is still positive, and you get out of the main while change < 0 loop.
