numpy.copysignI know how this function works, but I can't fully understand what this title description mean.Like x2[, out] what does this parameter mean? Is it a datatype in python?and " = <  ufunc 'copysign'> "I have see something like this several times when I look through the documents.Can anybody help? Thank you so much.
The brackets are standard Python documentation syntax for optional parameters to a function call. From the Python Language Reference Introduction:a phrase enclosed in square brackets ([ ]) means zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional)You'll notice it all over the place in Python & its libraries' documentation.The = <ufunc 'func_name'> bit is to let you know that the function is an instance of the numpy.ufunc class. From the NumPy docs on Universal Functions:A universal function (or ufunc for short) is a function that operates  on ndarrays in an element-by-element fashion, supporting array  broadcasting, type casting, and several other standard features. That  is, a ufunc is a “vectorized” wrapper for a function that takes a  fixed number of scalar inputs and produces a fixed number of scalar  outputs.In NumPy, universal functions are instances of the numpy.ufunc class. Many of the built-in functions are implemented in compiled C code, but ufunc instances can also be produced using the frompyfunc factory function.
