I'm just getting started with dictionaries in python and I got stumbled at the following code snippet:I suppose the False is returned maybe due to the incompatibility of types like "draw" is a string and word in the loop is a some sort of string key type maybe.But when I inspect the types I can see both are <class 'str'> type only !!How do I convert the string key I provide like "draw" to be acceptable as a key and it returns True? I guess this is a simple oversight but I need to know what the problem here is !
I think you are kinda lost here.for variable in dict_var: - iterates over dict keysdict.get(<key_name>) return value for key <key_name>Will return all values of your dict, since you iteration over all of its keys.some_var in word_dict - checks if value of some_var in list of word_dict keys, so print("draw" in word_dict) just print True/False if key exist in your dict.And i would strongly advise you to read docs on dictionaries. 
Are you sure "draw" is one of the key of word_dict? check your dictionary.
Thank you all for your time into this.I actually split the words in a file to keys in the dictionary and while doing so the keys also had a trailing \n. That's the reason I get False when I give a string without newline. I found this out when I inspected by looping through keys of word_dict.keys()Thanks to schwobaseggl for leading me into the solution.
