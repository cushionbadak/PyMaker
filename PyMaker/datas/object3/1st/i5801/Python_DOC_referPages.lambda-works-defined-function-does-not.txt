This is working:But gives me a PyCharm warning: PEP8: do not assign a lambda expression, use a defI follow the advice, but this is not working:I get:I have two questions:Why is the lambda working and the def not? Aren't they supposed to be equivalent?How can I stop PyCharm complaining about this specific error? I tried preceeding the lambda with #noinspection but it is not recognized.
Lambda expressions come with an implicit return. Therefore your lambda expression is returning the return value of self.represent_mapping but your function definition is not due to the missing return.
