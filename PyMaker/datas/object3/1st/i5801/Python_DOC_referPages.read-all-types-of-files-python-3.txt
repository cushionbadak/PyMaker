Natural Text
I'm working on an application in Python 3, but what I want is to upload any type of file. e. g. in c function :you can load any file type. Is there any way to do that? already tried with :but it throws me errors: UnicodeDecodeError:' charmap' code cant decode byte.Help :(
f = open(file, mode='rb') opens file in binary mode.  f.read() then returns the file contents as bytes.
Command open() as default opens it text mode which tries to decode text to unicode.If you have to open other file then better use binary mode.Use "b" in open(filename, "rb") to do it.Python 3 doc: open()
