I have this Django REST API that I want to customize the list query result for the json response. The reason is because of date formatting and potentially other formatting as well.This is the Rest API, the issue is created_at I want it to formatted like this: ('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'). The following code doesnt have any formatting, it will just list and create a json on the result.This is the model. Notice I have .as_dict() function. For individual record like using emp = Employee.objects.get(id=6), I can do like this emp.as_dict() and the result will have the formatted date in created_at.This is the json response result of the list. Notice the date is not formatted. Question: How can I have a json list response with the formatting I want ?
Use serializers of django rest framework, create a serializer classNow parse your employees queryset using serializer class.Format strings may either be Python strftime formats which explicitly  specify the format, or the special string iso-8601, which indicates  that ISO 8601 style datetimes should be used. (eg  2013-01-29T12:34:56.000000Z)
You can try to define time formt setting in project settings.py file,there are 4 types of time format setting:DATE_FORMAT、DATETIME_FORMAT、TIME_FORMAT 、 SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT.for example：if you use DRF， You also can use this method to define project global date format settings.You can get ref from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/settings/#std:setting-DATETIME_FORMAT
