How do I suppress error messages in python for chromedriver and pyinstaller exe? I noticed that when I use chromedriver in pyinstaller and run it I get a list of error messages. I have been trying to remove them but no luck thus far.UPDATE: It seems the headless flag is causing a lot of grief. Code:What I have tried:The error message appears to loop. Perhaps rewriting may fix...
Those logs are issued by Chrome. You can disable them by launching Chrome with the log level set to Fatal: Though some messages are not filtered by this flag like DevTools listening on ....To avoid them, you'll have to override the selenium.webdriver.common.service.Service and call subprocess.Popen with close_fds=True to avoid the inheritance of the file descriptor.
I had a similar problem and the following was my sollution. I was using the selenium module in a python script to open up chromedriver.exe and automate some online downloads.I run the script using a BAT file. Originally if I ran the BAT file, chrome was opened up and the files where downloaded, but the command line hanged on the log statementDevTools listening on ...The way I got around this was in the bat file I added the lineSo my BAT file looked like thisThe log statement still appears but killing chromedriver.exe seems to end the run.
question now is how to remove error messages and suppress messages in  relation to chrome driverTo switch off chromedriver logging, use DesiredCapabilitiesSee here for possible loggingPrefs values.
