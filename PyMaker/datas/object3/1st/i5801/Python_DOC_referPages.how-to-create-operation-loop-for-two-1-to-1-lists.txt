Say I have 2 lists:The lists are one-to-one.So how do I create a loop that operates (any operation):
Since your lists are one-to-one, then they must both be the same size. In this case zip() is the best option here. This function makes an iterator and aggregates elements into tuple pairs from each of the iterables:This means that you can apply a function on each of the tuples within the zipped iterable:You can also achieve similar behavior with map():I'd also suggest writing a zip() function with iterators to see how it works:Additionally, another less preferred way would be to loop over the first list, and use the indices to also access the elements in the second list:This is not very pythonic, but it also works. I recommend using zip() over this. 
Use zip
Just to process:If you want to keep results,The zip builtin sews together two or more lists elementwise into a list of tuples that we can then iterate on, either by an explicit loop or by a comprehension.
