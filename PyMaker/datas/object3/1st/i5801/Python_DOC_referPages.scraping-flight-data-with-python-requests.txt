What would be the correct approach to access the data?
The page makes 3 XHR requests as you said. You can make these requests using POST. You just need to get the right parameters for the payload. You can do this using BeautifulSoup and urllib which you may need to install if you have not done so already. This is for Python 3, Python 2 has a different implementation of urllib.
The contend of this page is generated by javascript. In order to scrape the content you need to use some tool which processes and renders javascript generated objects, i.e. Selenium.
The url you tried returns 404. Please check the url in the browser. Please try this:Added the extra params("nature" and "ref") which gets shown in when inspected. Passing this with the url returns us the xml data. Maybe we can use python's Elementree for parsing the XML data.
