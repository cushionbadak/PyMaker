I have a pandas DataFrame with hundreds of thousands of rows, and I want to apply a time-consuming function on multiple columns of that DataFrame in parallel.I know how to apply the function serially. For example:But how would I apply function foo parallel, utilizing all available cores on my machine?
The easiest way to do this is using concurrent.futures.Specifying chunksize=1_000 makes this run faster because each process will process 1000 rows at a time (i.e. you will pay the overhead of initializing a process only once per 1000 rows).Note that this will only work in Python 3.2 or newer.
