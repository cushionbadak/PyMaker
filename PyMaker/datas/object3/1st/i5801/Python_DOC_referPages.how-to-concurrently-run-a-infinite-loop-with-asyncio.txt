How to continue to next loop when awaiting? For example:How can I make the while True loop concurrent? If it is awaiting deal_with_message, it can go to the next loop and run get_message?EditedI think I have found a solution:
Your solution will work, however I see problem with it.As soon as main started it creates new task and it happens immediately (ensure_future creates task immediately) unlike actual finishing of this task that takes time. I guess it can potentially lead to creating enormous amount of tasks which can drain your RAM.Besides that it means that potentially any enormous amount of tasks can be ran concurrently. It can drain your network throughput or amount of sockets that can be opened same time (just imagine you're tying to download 1 000 000 urls parallely - nothing good will happen).In concurrent world this problem usually can be solved by limiting amount of things that can be ran concurrently with some sensible value using something like Semaphore. In your case however I think it's more convenient to track amount of running tasks manually and populate it manually:Output will be like:Important part here is how we got next message to be utilized only after amount of running tasks decreased to less than five.Upd:Yes, semaphore seems to be more convenient if you don't need to change max running number dynamically.
The easiest solution is asyncio.ensure_future.Keeping track of the tasks yourself is optional if all your tasks can be awaited at the end.
