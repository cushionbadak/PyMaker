The docs on Dict show it being used as a generic type, like this:It would also, of course, be correct to type-hint word_list above as dict:But is it correct to use Dict as a type-hint on its own to indicate a dict with keys and values of any type, like this?(And likewise, can other generic types like List and Sequence be used bare in this way?)
Yes, Dict is considered to be an alias for Dict[Any, Any]. (And dict is also an alias for Dict[Any, Any]).This is the case for any generic type, whether it's a builtin one or a custom-made one: if you omit the type parameters, they always default to Any. This is specified in the Generics section of PEP 484 (emphasis added):Additionally, Any is a valid value for every type variable. Consider the following:This is equivalent to omitting the generic notation and just saying elements: List.That said, I think the general recommendation is that you should fully write out Dict[Any, Any] instead of using just Dict -- explicit is better then implicit, and so forth.The only downside is that your function type signatures are now longer. But we can work around that by using type aliases:
