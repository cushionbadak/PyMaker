I want to sum values of the same key: H, C, O, N, S according to dictionary composition for the string input which is a combination of letter A, C, D, E. The expected result should beI am trying to use Counter but stuck at unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Counter'
sum() has a starting value, from which it starts the sum. This also provides a default if there are no values to sum in the first argument. That starting value is 0, an integer.From the sum() function documentation:sum(iterable[, start])Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. start defaults to 0.When summing Counter objects, give it an empty Counter() to start off with:If you then assign the result to a key in a dictionary assigned to out you get your expected result as Counter instances:
Three nested for loops should do the work.
