I have following snippet.I am using this snippet to connect to ftp server and fetch list of files and its facts. This snipped will return something like this:I would like to know what is the unit of the size? Like size = 1556 Is this in bytes? In KB? The documentation says:Return a generator object yielding a tuple of two elements for every  file found in path. First element is the file name, the second one is  a dictionary containing facts about the file name.
ftplib.FTP.mlsd uses the MLSD command (RFC 3659). Its response contains the size in "octets" (see Wikipedia), so more likely you "Bytes" then "KB"See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659.html#section-7.5
