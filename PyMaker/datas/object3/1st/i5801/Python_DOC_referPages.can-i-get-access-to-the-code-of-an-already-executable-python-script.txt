I run script test.py, for example, and accidentally change the executable file, but the script from this file continues to work.In the top I can see what executes "python3 test.py" but it is not quite right.Can I get access to the code that is executed after I changed it?
A possible way of recover the source code is using the tools pyrasite and inspect Pyrasite is used to inject code into Python processes and inspect is used to retrieve the source code of modules, classes, methods, functions, tracebacks, frame objects, and code objects.E.g.Initial file: foobar.pyRun and modify the file (I changed the printed string by "test2"):It still printing test1 and if you use pyrasite and inspect you can see the source code of the function that it is running. Also, It works if you deleted the file too.
