This question already has an answer here:Occurence of characters in common in two strings                    2 answers                I'm just wondering how I can check how many chars two string have in common.For example if I have "car" and "cars", the result should be 3. Anybody a clue?Cheers and thanks in advanceMax
Here's a solution using Counter.  We make a Counter for each of the words, then find the intersection of those Counters.  That itself is a Counter, and we can just sum the values to find the number of shared characterswill print In case of Counter, intersection is the minimum of corresponding counts.
Since you didn't write any code, I won't either. But basically this:-convert strings to list-use set to get letters they have in common-get length of your setBiggest hazard here would be if you wanted to count repeating letters
Something like this
