I have CSV file with the following format I want to convert the data with name Column_dateExample: 08-jun-2017 00:00 to UP (ENG) should be converted to 17W23D4 to UP (ENG)The format is year within century 17; week of year W23; day of week D4. The days go from Monday (1) to Sunday (7).So the final CSV should look like:It would be great if can do in a .bat file, but another scripting language is also okay.
In Perl, you can use Time::Piece:You first need to extract the date and time from the string, though.You can use -F, to split each line on commas into the @F array, then use a regex to extract the timestamp:IIRC, on MSWin you need to switch single and double quotes.See pop, perlre, join for more details.
I want to convert the data with name Column_dateThe following Python solution is based on datetime — Basic date and time types documentation. Please scroll down to strftime() and strptime() Behavior section for meaning of %y, %V, %u, … directives:Read and follow CSV File Reading and Writing as well.
