I was reading this link about using getters in Python, quote:The Pythonic way is to not use them. If you must have them then hide  them behind a property.That same page includes various examples, but my question is, if getters are not the Python way, how would I indicate to someone reading my code that a variable should be read-only after construction. Suppose I have the following class:If I wanted to indicate to another developer that self.engine is read-only after being set in the constructor, how would I do so? In orders words, if clients violate the rule, and attempt to set it, it's there problem if the implementation of self.engine changes(for example, from object of the class Engine to Dictionary).
You can use the @property decorator and not define a setter to communicate that engine should not be modified:Note that the user can still go around the property and set _engine directly. Note that the @property decorator only works with new style classes.
