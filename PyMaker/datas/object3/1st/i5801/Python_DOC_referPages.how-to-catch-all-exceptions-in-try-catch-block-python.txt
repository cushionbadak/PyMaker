I am writing python code to install all the library packages required by my program in the linux environment.So the linux may contain python 2.7 or 2.6 or both so I have developed a try and except block codes that will install pip packages in linux. Try block code consists of python 2.7 version pip install and Catch block contains python 2.6 version pip install. My Problem is the peace of code is working fine, when i tried to install pandas in python 2.6 its getting me some errror. I want to catch that exception. Can you please tell me how to improve my try except blocks to catch that exception
You can catch several exceptions using one block. Let's use Exception and ArithmeticError for exceptions.If you need to catch several exceptions and handle each one on its own then you'd write an except statement for each one.You can also check if the exception is of type "MyCustomException" for example using if statements.As for your problem, I suggest splitting the code into two functions.Note: I didn't test this, I'm no expert as well so I hope I can help.Useful links:Built-in ExceptionsErrors and ExceptionsCompound statements
