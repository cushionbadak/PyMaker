Can I interrogate the exception object for details using some method or function on the exception object?I assume that the obvious answer is to refactor. My question specifically regards the cases where that would be inefficient or simply not possible (if there are any such cases at all).

It seems then that the best you could get is to use args which returns the string in a tuple:
