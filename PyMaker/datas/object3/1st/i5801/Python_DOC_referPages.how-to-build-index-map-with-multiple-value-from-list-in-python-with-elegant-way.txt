I want to build a dict in python from a list, the key of the dict is the first column and the value of the map is the second column. Is there any elegant way to implement this?For example,A= [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]The result isM={1:[2,3],2:[3]}My own way is for row in A:    if row[0] not in M: M[row[0]] = []    M[row[0]].append(row[1])Is there any better solution? Functional Programming methods are preferred.
One way to do this is with a defaultdict
You can use setdefault:If it must be functional (Disclaimer: wasteful, not recommended):
