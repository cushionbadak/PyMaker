Ok, since you not provided details, I made some assumptions (some of them are in code comments). Particularly, I assumed text file format (CSV with headers, separated with semicolon), Excel file format ('old' XLS file format).Your task breaks into next major subtasks:Text file reading String parsing Writing Excel filesI suggest install packages into virtual environment (see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) as a best practice in all of your projects.This code is far from perfect code and should be used as a starting point for your work.
