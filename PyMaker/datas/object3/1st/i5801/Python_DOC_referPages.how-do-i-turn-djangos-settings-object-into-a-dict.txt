What I have:What I'd like (using Django 1.11):I've tried:which is close, but __dict__ only gets a small subset of the settings, which I assume are hard coded ones as opposed to added attributes. Thanks for any help!
Use the following code:Then you will have the whole settings dict in instance as dictionary.
This turns the entire settings object into a dictionary:This is very exhaustive and it contains all possible attributes of settings.dir() is a Python builtin. Read about it here
Check settings.__dict__['_wrapped'].__dict__ in your shell. It seems there is everything inside. Not sure however if it's the right way to access this.
