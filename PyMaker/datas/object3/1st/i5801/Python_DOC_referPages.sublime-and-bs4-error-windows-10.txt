Natural Text
I have created a virtualenv (i named it scrape), i activated it and i have installed packages and beautifulsoup4. I am trying to make sublime text 3 to work (ie show build results) within a virtualenv. I created a new build system like this:Then i run this code (i know that Betfair has an API,but this is not the point here):When i run the above with Powershell and virualenv activated, i am getting "200" and then all the html data (ie as ti is supposed to be). When i run inside sublime text, i am only getting "200" inside the build results panel, with no any html data. The fact that i am getting "200" means that my build system works ok, but why aren't the html results shown? Note that i am not getting any error.Now, if i change the url from https://betfair.com to  https://ubet.com.cy/sports (that contains some Greek characters), everything works ok if i do it in Powershell (ie i am getting "200" plus the html data.If however i do it in sublime text, i am getting the "200" plus the following error:This is line 19:In general, what i am looking for is a solution to have sublime text to work like if i run python inside Powershell (as it looks that everytime i will be coming across a new error). Is there something you can help me with.Many thanks.
This is indeed a Sublime Text specific problem. Sublime Text has this env dictionary that is going to update environment variables before executing Python.Dictionary of environment variables to be merged with the current process’ before passing them to cmd.Use this option, for example, to add or modify environment variables without modifying your system’s settings.Go to Tools -> Build System -> New Build System and set the PYTHONIOENCODING to utf8:See more at:printing UTF-8 in Python 3 using Sublime Text 3Unicode Encode Error in Sublime Text 3 console
