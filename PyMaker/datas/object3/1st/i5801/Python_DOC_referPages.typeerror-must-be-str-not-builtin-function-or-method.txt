I have a bit of a problem at the moment, I'm quite new to python and to people who code a lot this might seem really easy to answer. We've been tasked to do a '99 bottles of beer on the wall' challenge and I wanted to make mine slightly better by asking the user what they'd like in the bottle. However I keep getting an error: TypeError: must be str, not builtin_function_or_methodany help would be much appreciated, thanks :3
input() method returns value to be assigned to a variable. Compare with the docs. Now you are referencing a method not a variable.You need something like
input is a builtin function, so when you do 'of'+input+'on the wall', you just try to concatenate a function to a string, which doesn't make a lot of sense ;)(the interpreter is explicitly telling you that)input returns a string you doesn't assign to a variable, so try user_input = input("What would you like inside the bootle?") and then using user_input instead of input in your code.
