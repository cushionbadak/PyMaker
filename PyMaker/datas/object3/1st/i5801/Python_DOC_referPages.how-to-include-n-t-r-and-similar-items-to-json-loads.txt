Natural Text
I want to include \n not as newline but as a string literal in json.loadsfor example, json.loads('"hello\n"')how do i handle the \?
\n is the escape sequence for line feed. Use the \\ escape sequence: json.loads('"hello\\n"')Alternatively, use a raw string, which treats a backslash as a literal character: json.loads(r'"hello\n"')
