Natural Text
I have a code which takes a user's input which is supposed to be a first and last name. My code then takes that input and searches a csv for projects and hours that the input name is associated to. The problem I'm running into is if I misspell or don't capitalize the first letter of each name the code will not work. Is there a function or a way out there where if the user inputs the first 3 letters right or something similar the code will automatically assume the correct spelling and change the input accordingly? I'm a very novice coder so any help would be great. Here's my code for reference:
You can use str.lower on both the user input and the value from the csv to ignore case.You can use str.startswith to match the user input against the beginning of a value from the csv. You could also use in to detemrine if the user input is in a value from the csv.
