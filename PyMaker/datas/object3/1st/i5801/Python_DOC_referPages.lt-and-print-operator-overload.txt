I have this assignment in which I have to define a class named Person with attributes name, surname and age. I have done getter and setter methods; now I have an issue with overloading operators.First, I need to overload a print operator (which I have done); second, I need to overload "less than" operator which gives me the following error:And in the last step, I need to compare the ages of different persons e.g.:My problem is: 1. the type error and 2. I have already overloaded print method and they want me to use the default print() later.Here is my code: Ok, just finished my task, thank you all!!!
First, self._alter is a field/property/value (name it whatever you want) and not method. This should help you:When it comes to second problem::I have already overloaded print method and they want me to use the default print() later.Refefine __str__() method.
