I was wondering if it is possible to set multiple setFixedHeight() properties using a for loop:currently I have twelve QLineEdit boxesLineEdit1, LineEdit2, ... , LineEdit12 and I'm hoping to do this with less code. I tried the above method, and it did not iterate through the LineEdit boxes as I had expected. Would self.LineEdit[num] only work for a list?
for this task you can use getattr():
You may use findChildren() function.e.g.Please note this will call setFixedHeight() on all Line Edits.
