For example in mystring it has a fake match with sand rock and output as follows.Howver, I want it to be as;Is there a better way of doing this in python?
The problem is that str.replace() doesn't allow you to specify that you only want to match whole words (or phrases). The re module allows you to use regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching. With regex, you can specify word boundaries using the \b escape. Place the \b escape before and after your phrases to cause the match to only occur at word boundaries. The re.sub() function works like the str.replace() method and you can use it in your code like:
Part of the trick of your problem is that you don't want to match partial words. That's why the replace() method does not do what you want it to do.  You can achieve what you want through regular expressions.  One of the nice thing about REs is that you can match on word boundaries using the \b flag.
Using re.sub and applying \b (word boundary) to match exact string
