Natural Text
The following program is giving me output that includes URLs with and without the forward slash (e.g. ask.census.gov and ask.census.gov/). I need to eliminate one or the other. Thank you in advance for your help!
You can always right-strip the slash - it would be removed if exists and nothing will be done if not:
This snip of code will check to see if the last character in your string is a '/', and if it is, it will delete it.Good examples of python string manipulation:http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/string-manipulation-in-python
