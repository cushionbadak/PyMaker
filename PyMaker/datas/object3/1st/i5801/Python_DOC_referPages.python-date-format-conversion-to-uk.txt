I have a CSV file which has a date column with some dirty data i.e. dates stored in different formats (US and UK). I'd like to create another CSV file with the dates converted so they are consistently stored in the UK format enabling me to import correctly into my SQL database. I'd like the dates to be converted to the following format:'05-12-2017''07-11-2017''24-04-1999''28-01-1987'..I tried the following code:, but it throws an error while trying to convert the US datesCan someone please help?Thanks
You could use a Try-Parse-Else-Approach:Output:HTH
