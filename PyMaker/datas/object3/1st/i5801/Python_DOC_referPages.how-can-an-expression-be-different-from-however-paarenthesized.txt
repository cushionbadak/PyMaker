This question already has an answer here:Why does the expression 0 < 0 == 0 return False in Python?                    9 answers                python operator precedence of in and comparison                    4 answers                Consider this statement:However:It is incredible. What's the reason and the interpretation?
dis.dis to the rescue and a bit of my interpretation.Anyway, it looks like this. Consider three expression X, Y, Z and two operators O1, O2. Thenis equivalent toas can be seen byexample. I find this behaviour very counterintuitive.And the docs:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).Note that in is a comparison operator.
