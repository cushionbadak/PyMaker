Natural Text
I'm pulling in a text file as a multidimensional array and giving the user a choice to pick one of the items and it is stored in another array. I'm trying to figure out how to find the index of the first array with the elements in the second.Code:Text File:I have triedIf i select B12, I want the result to be 0 0 for the index numbers.
Issues:You are overwriting chosen in the line for chosen in books:.Loop prompting for more books just appends last selected book id when y is entered for more.The word select colors in my editor as a module select exists. You may want to change the name.Replace choice() with this change.The index list contains i.e. [[2, 0], ...]The 2 being the index to find the book in books.The 0 being the index of the book id.If the result not exactly what you want, you can make the any changes needed.Storing the book ID means searching later. You could store the index of the book instead.i.e.This function is storing the index of the book chosen rather than the ID of the book ID as it is more convenient to use the index later as the use of list comprehension shows at the end.
