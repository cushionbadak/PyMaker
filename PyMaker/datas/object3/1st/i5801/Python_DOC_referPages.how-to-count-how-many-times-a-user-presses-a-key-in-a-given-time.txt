I'm trying to count the number of times a person presses a button a certain number of times.shots was declared earlier.That's what I've done but I need to set some type of time limit, so the user can only press it for say 4 seconds then if shots are bigger than a number it's do something. Is there any way to do this, thank you 
You can use the turtle.ontimer function to implement a timer. In the timer function I increment the global time variable and call turtle.ontimer(timer, t=100) which automatically calls timer again after the specified timer t.
