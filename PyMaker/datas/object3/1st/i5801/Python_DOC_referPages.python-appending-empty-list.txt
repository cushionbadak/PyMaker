I am very new to Python and trying to learn by trial-and-error, so my question may sound naive for the community.Let's say I have two empty lists with only the first element defined:I want to use a for loop for creating the other elements of the lists:What I obtain is the following error:TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple.Basically I am trying to reproduce the fibonacci series (a famous starting point in Python tutorial), but I would like to experiment other ways of obtaining the same output.Thank you!
The problem is on this line:Notice the comma at the end? That makes python think you're dealing in tuples. Remove it and the error will be gone.
