I'm trying to display my full time zone along with my current local time.And the result would look something like:The problem is I have to import the Time library (sorry if I call it wrong, I'm coming from C#) along with the Datetime library.I've looked into the naive and aware states of time, but still can't seem to get the desired result.Is there a way to get the full timezone name (i.e.: Pacific Standard Time) from Datetime without having to import Time? 
The example for writing your own local timezone tzinfo class uses (scroll down one page from here) pulls the tzname from time.tzname, so Python doesn't have a better built-in solution to suggest.You could copy that example LocalTimezone implementation, which would allow the use of the %Z format code for strftime on an aware datetime instance using the LocalTimezone, but that's the best you can do with the built-ins. On a naive datetime the tzname is the empty string, so you need an aware datetime for this to work.
