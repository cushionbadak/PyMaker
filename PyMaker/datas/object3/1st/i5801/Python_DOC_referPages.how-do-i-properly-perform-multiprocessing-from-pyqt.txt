I create a button and try to run multiprocessing when I click button ,but the UI is become blocked . I hope process run in backgorund .How can I fix it ?
I have never used multiprocessing, but docs says that the join() method blocks the caller until it is finished. Putting the method in an infinite loop will block the caller(the UI) forever.
Bendegúz Szatmári already answer the main question.I just want to let you know that use Process is not best idea in most of usage.Different process does not share memory with your program. You can not control them so easily as different thread.Here is simple example how you can Start end Stop different thread.
