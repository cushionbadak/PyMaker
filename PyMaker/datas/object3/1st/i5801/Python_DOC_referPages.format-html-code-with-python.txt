I have a list of URLs in a column in a CSV-file. I would like to use Python to go through all the URLs, download a specific part of the HTML code from the URL and save it to the next column. For example: From this URL I would like to extract this div and write it to the next column. I have this code, the HTML code is saved in the variable html:Currently the HTML-Code is pretty ugly. How could I delete everything out of the variable html except the div I would like to extract? 
Given that all of your webpages are have the same structure you can parse the html with this code. It will look for the first div with the id product_bullets_section. An id in html should be unique but the given website has two equal id's so we obtain the first one through slicing and convert the parsed div back to a string containing your html.
In this example, you can use BeautifulSoup to get the div with a specific id:
Why not use html.parser - Simple HTML and XHTML parser?Example:and then use parser.feed(data) (where data is a str)
