(Except to output the data to the file)Supplementary explanation 1:My os is Win10 64bit (both contain python2 and python3)In short , I want to know how can I pass the Data(produced by python2) to python3. Supplementary explanation 2:I have a A python script and it need to run in python2.A python script will generated some data(maybe json , dataframe ..)And then I want pass this data to B python scriptB python script must run in python3.My os is win10 64bits(both have python2 and 3).I am a new to python , I have tried "out the data to the file ,then B.py read the file". However this I/O way is too slow , so I want pass data in memory , how can I do that?(My English is not very good, please entertain me )
