This question already has an answer here:how to get the return value from a thread in python?                    21 answers                I have written this sample code that generate random numbers using multiple threads.I can print each random number without any problems. But what I am trying to achieve is, I want to collect all the returned integers into generated_numbers array.
I would suggest using multiprocessing instead of threading, with the Pool class you can map a function generate_random_number to an iterable range(1,100).Here is an example that does what you want:N.B. 100 threads is a little overkill for such a small iterable.
Do something like t.join() will wait for thread to execute, we are doing this by using list comprehension as thread.join() would resolve once last thread has completed which could happen before all of the started threads run.
