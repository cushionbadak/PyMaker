I have a function that I want to use multiple times, on every use I want a variable outside of the function to increment. Along the lines of - etcI thought col would increment on every use, but it stays at 0. Should I be returning a value from the function?
You are incrementing a temporary variable x in the function namespace, therefore col is not modified. If you want to change col you can:use a class with a classmethod and a class attributeuse a decorator as in Paul Panzer's answerreturn the value of x and affect it to coluse a global statement.If you are unfamiliar with namespace check this linkFirst using a class with a classmethod and a class attribute:This would be my preferred option as the namespaces are not polluted and the code is cleaner than with returning a value.Now returning a value:Or with a global:
You could create a function attribute to hold the counter. Here is a decorator that does this:Please note that the purpose of the decorator here is twofold: (1) it adds convenience; but more importantly (2) it protects the namespace where the function or rather its wrapper finds itself. Without that the following accident can happen:
Two options, pure functions which don't modify anything outside their scope, Most recommendedas our friend Jacques Gaudin has added: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47680265/7579116the other one, less fancy, and not recommended but is what you asked for is to declare x as global
