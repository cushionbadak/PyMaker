Didn't know how to correctly write the title, so i will try to explain it here. I am making a game, similar to tic tac toe. The play field is 4x4 and i am saving it as an array. I want to make changes in the array during the game, but it will not print out the array each time, rather it makes changes statically. Lets say at the beginning i print out the whole field and under it the user is asked to type a position. He gives it and the changes are being done in the first printed playfield, without calling it again in the shell. Kinda sloppy explanation, sorry about that.This is the function, which will display the playfield.I've done it with tkinter already, wanna try it without.
You could try using the curses modulehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html
