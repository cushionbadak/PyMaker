I have coded a flask application on server.I run it like below :-The python script has logger statements like:The logger statements are printed in both the logger file and nohup.outWhat is the way to avoid printing logger statements in nohup.out ?
You need to have your logger in lower level than root logger:In this example I set root logger to logging.WARNING (30) level and my test_logger is set to logging.DEBUG (10) so the root logger ( which nohup is listening to ) will not print anything (only string that you printed or have higher logging levels than 30) and there are logs that has more levels than logger's level in example.log.
