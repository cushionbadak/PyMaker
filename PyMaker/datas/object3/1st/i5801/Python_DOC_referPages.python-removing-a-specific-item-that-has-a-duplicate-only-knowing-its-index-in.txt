What I want this program to do is to delete all the 1's that are in the list that follow by index all the 2's.This is the code:I really put this program into the basics but the point is that I have only got the index of the 1 that follows the 2, tho when I do this the result is:This means that it doesn't delete the 1 I want but just the first 1 it finds. Tho this is really a problem in a real program situation where the first 1 is an important value.How can I fix it? Thanks 
You can use list comprehension:Output:
I would use a good-ol' explicit loop for this one:Note that a does not get modified but rather a new list b is created.
If you want to remove a specific index you use del.Output:
The del keyword might be your best bet here, for example:
I don't know about the more pythonic way to do this, but you can keep a counter to check for the second appearance of a value you want to delete from a list.
Using enumerate() and a list comprehension:
Using list comprehension with enumerate(a) and index(2)
