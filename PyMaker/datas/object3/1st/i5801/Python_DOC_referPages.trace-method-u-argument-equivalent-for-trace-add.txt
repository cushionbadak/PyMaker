Considering tkinter variable class' trace() method is deprecated since Python 3.6, new trace_add() method should be used:trace('w', method) has become trace_add('write', method)trace('r', method) has become trace_add('read', method)I'm wondering how is the 'u' argument now specified? For instance, consider the former:trace('wu', method)I can't find anything in the docs or anywhere else.
In general, in such cases you can always fire up your REPL and call help on trace_add to examine its docstring.For trace_add the following is stated:trace_add(self, mode, callback)Define a trace callback for the variable.Mode is one of "read", "write", "unset", or a list or tuple of     such strings.     Callback must be a function which is called when the variable is     read, written or unset.Return the name of the callback.So, judging from that, 'wu' should now be ['write', 'unset'].
