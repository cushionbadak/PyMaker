A dictionary on its own does not store a key order. For this, you will have to use the OrderedDict which stores the order of insertion.If you just need to iterate through the sorted keys, you can use sorted:if you need to specify a special key or method, you could pass this as information to sorted. The following example sorts by value:Sort orders can be reversed by using reversed:Finally, this code snippet would fill an OrderedDict with sorted key/value pairs:Since you updated your question from dictionary to listSorting lists is even easier, just use sorted (again, provide a small method, if you have a different sorting key):
