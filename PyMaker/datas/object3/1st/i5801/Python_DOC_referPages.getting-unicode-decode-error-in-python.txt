I am using facebook graph API but getting error when I try to run graph.pyHow should I resolve this problem of charmap. I am facing unicode decode error.enter image description hereIn graph.py :I could not understand why I am facing this issue. Also getting some error with 's=f.read()' 
In error message I see it tries to guess encoding used in file when you read it and finally it uses encoding cp1250 to read it (probably because Windows use cp1250 as default in system) but it is incorrect encoding becuse you saved it as 'utf-8'. So you have to use open( ..., encoding='utf-8') and it will not have to guess encoding.But you could change it before you save it. And then you don't have to open it again.BTW: python has function html.unescape(text) to replace all "chars" like &gt; (so called entity)
