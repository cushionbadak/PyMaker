In Python 3.6 when entering the codefor some reason it comes out with an error messageDoes anyone know how to fix this so it runs like:
input expects a string as an argument so you can't pass it multiple args like with print. Instead you can format the string before you pass it to input:The f before the string is short for format and is new in Python 3.6, you can read more about it here.
Sorry, I might not answer your question fully but you can't have more than one argument in input().
