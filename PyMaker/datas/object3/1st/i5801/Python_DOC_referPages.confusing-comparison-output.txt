I am confused about the following:The == operator should return only a bool (or at least I thought so).I would have expected to have, (True, True) assuming that the line would have been processed like a,b = 1,2 but performing comparison instead of assignment. Or, to have an error. But definitely not (1, False, 2).Can anyone explain what is going on here?
This:is evaluated as a three element tuple that contains 1, 2 == 1 and 2 respectively. You need to use a couple of parentheses here:This is stated in the Language Reference:Except when part of a list or set display, an expression list  containing at least one comma yields a tuple. The length of the tuple  is the number of expressions in the list. The expressions are  evaluated from left to right.
@alec_djinncomparison operator work If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.you are trying to compare wrong data type 1,2 is not valid.try '1,2' == '1,2' will give you correct results.1,2 is not single argument.
