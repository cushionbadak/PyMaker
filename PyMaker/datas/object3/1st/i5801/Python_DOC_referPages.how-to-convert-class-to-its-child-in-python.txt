I have a class called class_A I do some work with it and store it with pickle. I have another class class_B wich is a child of class_A but has some additional methods and properties. I want to load data from my pickled file as class_B and work with it. How can I do it?
You could override the unpickler's find_class function, like so:Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.Unpickler.find_class
More details around your exact use case are needed to be certain, but  one of these abstract approaches may work for you.OrOrI'd recommend crating a class method to do what you need.
