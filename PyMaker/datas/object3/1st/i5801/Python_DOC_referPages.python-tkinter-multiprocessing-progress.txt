For my work, I frequently have to collect reasonably large datasets from a MySQL database, e.g. several parameters for several locations, and store that data in a CSV file per location. For this, I've written a small GUI. Since, the data has to be stored per location, I thought I'd take advantages of my 8-thread CPU and use the multiprocessing package to query the database per location. This works just fine, but I also want to keep track of how far the data retrieval and file writing is.The trick with using multiprocessing together with Tkinter was to put the function that is called in the multiprocessing outside of the GUI class, but how do I get information from that function back into the class?My code so far:To be clear: this code works fine. It produces this GUI:What I want, is a GUI like this:With the  part showing the progress of the query_database function, meaning it has to update when a step in that function has been completed.How would I approach this? Also, feel free to give any comments about my coding, I'm still learning the basics of GUIs and setting up classes.
Let's sum what was said in comments:To get information from function, which executed in another process,you should communicate with function's process with either a Queue or a Pipe.While you have a channel to communicate with - keep checkingcontiniously for messages via self-schedulingafter.Keep in mind that idea to pass a Label or anything tk-related tothat process isn't an option, since it isn't a thread/process-safepractice.After all of this you should come with something similar to this approach:
