Using spyder 3.2.4 with python.When I call i function (in another file) lets call it my_func() from my main script, it uses the "old version" of that function. Clarification:If i change my_func and save that file, the new version of the function is used if called from my main script, BUT only if I run the entire main script.If i just run the lines with my_func (using run cell or run selected lines) the OLD version of my_func (before the changes was mad) is used.I though my_func had to be "reimported" (from myOtherFile import my_func), so I try to run those lines as well, but the old version of the function (not changed) is still used.Did I misunderstand something or is this a really, really serious bug? If i close down spyder and restart it it works (it uses the new version of the function) but that's an unacceptable solution.
This behavior has to do with how the (I)Python interpreter handles imports.You can find a detailed explanation (with possible solutions) here: https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/204469240-Jupyter-IPython-After-editing-a-module-changes-are-not-effective-without-kernel-restartShort answer:- either restart the kernel- or use importlib.reload (https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload)- or use IPython's autoreload extension (http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html)
(Spyder maintainer here) This is not a bug, it's the way Python works. However, the normal behavior can be improved by making our IPython consoles to load the %autoreload IPython magic. With that change, after saving a file you'll immediately get the code on it reloaded in your console.We'll do this in our 3.2.5 version (to be released on December 2017).
