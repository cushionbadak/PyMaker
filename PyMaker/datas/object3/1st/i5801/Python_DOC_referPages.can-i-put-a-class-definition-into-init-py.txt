I have a package with a class structure similar to this.Base class is a typical, simple parent class for a few separate hierarchies.My package layout looks like this:Is this a good idea or good practice to put Base class into __init__.py instead of creating separate module just for one class? In this way I wouldn't need to import it each time in modules.
It is perfectly fine and a more flexible approach to leave it in base.py. Also note that the primary use of __init__.py is to initialize Python packages and not to hold content.To avoid having to import the module each time you can write something like into the __init__.py such that you can directly import Base from my_package:This is a common approach to make objects available at the package level.For more info about the __init__.py file check out the documentation.
