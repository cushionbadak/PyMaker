Here is my code to get the nearest value to a given number ( Mynumber) from  a list (Mylist)Now I have 3 lists [ 1, 2, 3] ,[ 4, 7, 8], [ 13, 9, 10] I want to compare first item , second item and 3rd item of them with this list,[2,6,9] ,If I compare 1st item in each list, out if [1,4,13], 1 is the closest to 2 ,If I compare 2nd item in each list, out of [2,7,9],  7 is the closest to 6,If I compare 3rd item in each list, out of [3,8,10], 10  is the closest to 9Does any one know how to do it? Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated

Here's a kind of ugly way to do it.
You can try something like this:Note that in last item [3,8,10] 8 is close to 9 :output:
