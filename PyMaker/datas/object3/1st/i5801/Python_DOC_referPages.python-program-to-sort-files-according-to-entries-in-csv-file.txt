I am trying to sort my files according to this csv file. But the file contains many ids with same name. Is there a way to move files with same name to 1 folder or adding a number in front of a file if the file with same name already exist in directory?I actually want to move all the files having id corresponding to golden_retreiver to one folder and so on. 
Based on what you describe, here is my approach:NotesFor every line in the data file, I create the breed directory at the destination. I use the set seen to make sure that I only create each directory once.After that, it is a trivia matter of moving files into placeOne possible move error: file does not exist in the source dir. In which case, the code just prints out the error and ignore it.
