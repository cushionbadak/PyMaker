There is an extra space in the output of a string. This is the section of the code where it happens. It happens in the string of the function, nameConfirmation().This is the output it gives.How do I get rid of the space in between the name and the punctuation?
You can append string with +.Output:
If you use:You will notice that the output is:Look at is and name (Raven). You can note in the output an space (is Raven), that is because print() have a default argument called sep an by default it's print("Right... So your name is", name,".", sep = ' '). That argument is an string that it's added at the end of each piece of string concatenated with a coma , in the print function.So if you do print('A','B') it will be A B, because when you concatenate A and B, print will add  ' ' (and space) as glue.You can configure it: print('A','B', sep='glue') would print AglueB!To solve your problem you can do two options.Change sep = '' and add an space  after is: print ("Right... So your name is ", name,".", sep='')Or, concatenate using + the last two strings: print ("Right... So your name is", name + ".")Also there are a lot of another ways like: (I ordered them by worst to best in my subjetive opinion...)print("Right... So your name is %s." % name).print("Right... So your name is {}.".format(name)).print(f"Right... So your name is {name}.")Link with documentation:Python Official Documentation Python 3 Course (Use of sep and ,, +, %s, .format(), f-string and use of string class)PyFormat (Basic and advanced use of %s, %d, .format(), value conversion, datetime, ).P.S: This isn't part of the answer, it's just a note.print (something) don't need the space --> print(something).Futhemorer sep = ' ' there is also called end = '\n' that determine the end of a print (\n = new line).P.S 2: Thanks Ouss for the idea of add some documentations links. I've just learnt that you can do print(%(key)s % mydict)!
Use the string variable substitution %s:For more on string manipulation and formatting in Python3, Check the following:https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-string-functions-in-python-3https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-working-with-strings-in-python-3https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3
Each argument passed through the print command is automatically separated by a space.  I see you're in python 2, and I use python 3, so I'm not sure if this solution will work, but you can try doing this:This basically (assuming it works in python 2 as well) changes the separation between arguments to no space instead of 1 space.
The comma indicates a continuation on the same line with a space in between (you'll notice there's a space between "is" and "Raven", even though neither string has one in there). If you want to remove the spaces, the usual way to concatenate strings is with a plusEdit: Plus, not ampersand... stupid me
