I want to convert a list of lists to a standard Python array.array. Let's take good ol' [[1.0, 2.0][3.0, 4.0]] as an example. Answers to similar Q seem to all be in terms of NumPy. I am doing something to be used by folks who are very unlikely to import numpy.
This is not possible, as array.array arrays are 1-dimensional. You can't even make a nested array, as array.array arrays only hold primitives.You should probably read the array module docs and think about whether array.array arrays are actually suitable for your use case, as you seem to be expecting more NumPy-like behavior from them than they actually provide.
