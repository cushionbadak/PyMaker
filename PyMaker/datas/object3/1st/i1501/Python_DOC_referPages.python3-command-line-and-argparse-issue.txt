Please find below the code i wrote (based on the assignment) and the error message i got back. I m new to python so i apologize in advance if this is super obvious. thank youAfter Charles answer I used But I cannot get the default values as I should 
parse_args is indicated as the problem in your traceback, and the way you call that method is contrary to how they describe it in the docs. parse_args() takes the args by default from the command line so try just calling it args = parser.parse_args()Otherwise if you wanted to do it manually you could do something like: parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'FOO'])The docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.parse_args
Thank you fro your help everybodyI found the answer that yields the defaults command lineswith the hint of Charles and some more help I finally found it
