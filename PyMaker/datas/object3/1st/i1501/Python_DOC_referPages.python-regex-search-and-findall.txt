Below is  my code. My understanding is my pattern says you must meet car and pet is oprtion . i.e check for word car and a carpet both .Now re.search match carpet which is fine.But re.finall output should be ['carpet', 'car'], But it is showing me ['pet', ''] .Please let me know where i am incorrect ?Here is output of code:
Use instead. The ?: makes the group non-capturing (see the regex syntax docs) which makes all the difference to findall as it returns a list of the capturing groups if such are present in your pattern:
The reason is mentioned in re documentation of findall():Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of  strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned  in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern,  return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern  has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result.If you want the result you expect, use finditer().
