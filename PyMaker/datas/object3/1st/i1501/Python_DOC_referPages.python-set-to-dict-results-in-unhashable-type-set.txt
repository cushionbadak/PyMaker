since one week I am building up knowledge in machine learning, using python + tensorflow. My main target is to get the tutorials presented by keras up and running, so my own introduction to python is getting these load-functions to work properly, bc I am stucked behind a firewall and pip ain't downloading. Now I've arrived at a problem which makes me loose my mind. Currently I am working at a basic regression, just like https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification - convert integer back to wordsEvery other tutorial just worked fine after a little modification, but this one is driving me crazy.this piece of code opens the dataset and returns it as a dictionary. the content looks like this:that's it. I am trying to reverse it, bc the built-in function doesn't seem to work like intended. Now the best practice I found wasTypeError: unhashable type: 'list' when using built-in set functionwhich didn't help much. My code iswhich raises the error:TypeError: unhashable type: 'set'After multiple experiments, turning it manually over and typecasting it to 'dict' my patience failed.Please help...
You can reverse a dictionary with a dict comprehension:Not every dictionary can be reversed. This is because while there are no restrictions on the types of objects that can be dictionary values, there are restrictions as to what types can be keys.The error that you're getting implies that at least one of the values in your dictionary is a set, contrary to your expectations. You can debug what's going on and figure out the bad value by doing the dictionary reversal within a try...except clause:Running the above code should result in the same TypeError as you were getting before, but now it'll first print out a helpful error message pointing out the bad value in your dictionary.
