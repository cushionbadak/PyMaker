So I have a CSV file of users which is in the format: I've tried dateutil parser, however it states this list is an invalid string.  I need to keep the names and the dates together.  I've also tried datetime but i'm having issues with "datetime not defined". I'm very new to Python, so forgive me if i've missed an easy solution.The end goal is I need to check if the date the user last logged in is longer than 4 months.  Honestly, any help here is massively welcome!The CSV format is:
Edit: Edited the answer based on the given csvYou could do something like this with pandasThe DataFrame more_than_4_months_ago will give you a subset of all records, based on if the  account_last_used_date is more than 4 months ago.This is based on the given format. Allthough I doubt that this is your actual format, since the given usernames don't really match the format 'firstname, lastname'(I edited 2 lines to 2018, so that the test actually shows that it works).
