New to the index function. I am trying to display the hostname and IP address of my PC, but I'm stuck at this index part. If I comment it out and print the whole list, what I'm looking for is right there. So why can't .index see it?Contents of sdata:
Take a look at what is returned by p.communicate():Note the b prefixing the stdout output, this means it is not a Unicode-encoded string, but rather a sequence of bytes. This is called out in the documentation for POpen.communicatecommunicate() returns a tuple (stdout_data, stderr_data). The data  will be strings if streams were opened in text mode; otherwise, bytes.When you split data, it will thus return a list of byte sequences (see how each item is also prefixed with b?):What you're passing to index, 'src', is a string, not a byte sequence. These two are not equal:So, one solution to your problem is to pass the byte sequence b'src' to index:See this SO question for further information.
