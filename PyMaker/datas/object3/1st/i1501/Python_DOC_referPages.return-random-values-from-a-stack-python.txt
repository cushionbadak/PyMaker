I am trying to return 5 values from a stack and displaying it out. May I ask how I can go about doing it?Attached is my code on how to solve the problem.The error shown is:    
Error is caused by statement in randomFive methodbecause self is an instance of Stack which has no __len__ method available and for user-defined classes len built-in function tries to call it and raises an error if there is no any (more info at this thread).Fast fix would be to change it tobut in longer perspective it will be better to define your own __len__ method likeafter that your original randomFive method should work.
