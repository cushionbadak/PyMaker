I need to find if two values have the same key.Dictionary looks like this, where the values are lists:So I want to compare for example (5, 8): True
You are looking for subsets and supersets; your two values must together be a subset of a dictionary value.Convert your tuple to a set, then use set.issubset() together with any() to find if there is a value in your dictionary that contains both values:Note that because the objects in your lists are strings, you must use strings in the test set too! Using sets here is as efficient as Python can make it given your data structures; internally, test_set.issubset(v) will convert the list to a set, then test each element in test_set against that temporary set (each test taking constant time), making this a O(N) linear time operation. If you have to do this many times over, and performance is an issue, consider making the values in d1 sets to start with.As a function that accepts integers too:which you can then call with all_same_key(d1, 5, 8).Demo:If you must find the keys, then use a list comprehension over dict.items(), and filter on values where test_set is a subset:
