I have a JSON file like below:So basically the file contains a list of people. I tried to use json.loads(str_content) in Python 3, but it returned the error of json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data:.I checked with an online JSON parser (http://json.parser.online.fr) and it told me the same problem.How to parse a JSON file without a root element but a list of JSON objects?
The issue is that the string you are trying to parse is not a valid JSON document. It is  actually a concatenation of JSON documents. So the simple json.loads() will  not work.You can use instead something based on https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode . E.g: (code is a bit ugly but the logic should be clear):[{'name': 'A', 'age': 19}, {'name': 'B', 'age': 20}]
