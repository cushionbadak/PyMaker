I am hoping for the following info:1) NHL Team Names2) Betting OddsHere is the site: https://www.bovada.lv/services/sports/event/v2/events/A/description/hockey/nhl.Here is my code so far:The code above only prints the data for one game. I was hoping for all of the games. Is there an easy way to loop through all of them? I am also not sure how to parse out the info I am looking for. Team NamesI noticed the team names are located in the section titled 'competitors':In the example above the info I am looking for is Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers, respectively.
