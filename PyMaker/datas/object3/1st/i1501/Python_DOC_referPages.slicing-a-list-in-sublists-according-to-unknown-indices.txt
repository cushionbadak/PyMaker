What is the best method to slice a list (here: lst_num) into (more than two) parts of variable length according to another list containing the indices?A string of numbers has to be split into sublists that contain the numbers standing between all subsequent occurrences of a certain number. E.g.: "30 24 17 30 22 1 67 2 4 3 30 24 95 34 29 56 30 43 24" and "30" yields: [24, 17], [22, 1, 22, 1, 67, 2, 4, 3 ]  and [24, 95, 34, 29, 56]To slice the list, the first argument should be "i+1", but how to obtain the subsequent index from idx as stop index? Is there a way to give each sublist a unique name in the iteration? 
One little step to go:Just zip the indexes into pairs of slice boundaries.
