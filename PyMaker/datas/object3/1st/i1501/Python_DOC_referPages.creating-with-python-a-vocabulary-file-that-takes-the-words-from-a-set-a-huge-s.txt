Natural Text
I have this set of files .tsv (it's really big, 18k+ files) and i want to create a file (doesn't matter what format it is) called 'vocabulary' that will storage each word that appears in these files and assigns an identifier to each word. I don't want to count occurrences: if the word "house" appears 227 times in my files i want to save that word in my vocabulary just once.I will use this vocabulary for a search engine, but this is another story...Edit: I forgot that i also want to name each identifier in a specific way: 'term_id'. So i imagine the content of my output file something like:
Are you using a Windows machine or a Linux/Unix/MacOS machine?If latter, you don't really need Python - you can do it by chaining together shell commands - If one of your files is called abc.txt - Note that the md5sum hashes the word - almost guarantees a unique ID for each of your words
You can do this -
