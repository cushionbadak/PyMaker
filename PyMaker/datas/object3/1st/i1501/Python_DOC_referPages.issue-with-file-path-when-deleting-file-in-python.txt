Trying to write a small script in Python to delete files, but the os.remove function is having issues with the file path. Note if I comment out os.remove("C:\\Users\The User\Downloads\test.txt") it runs fine and will print 'gone'. I don't understand why when assigning the path to the variable it works but os.remove doesn't like the same thing. Here's the error message:OSError: [WinError 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect: 'C:\Users\The User\Downloads\test.txt'
I think you should just return the full path of the file to delete, and if the path is not None, then call os.remove(). In your code, you check that search exists in files, but files is a list, and you need to go through and get the matching file to determine its current directory. Then you can get the full path using root, and use that later for deletion. Demo:You can can also use next() here to make find() shorter:Note: You can use os.path.join(os.environ['USERPROFILE'], 'Downloads') instead of hardcoding C:\\Users\The User\Downloads.
