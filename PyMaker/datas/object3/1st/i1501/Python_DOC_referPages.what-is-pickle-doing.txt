I have used Python for years. I have used pickle extensively. I cannot figure out what this is doing:This returns to me:I am beyond confused. I am use to pickle loading the massive file into memory. The object itself is a massive array of arrays (I assume). Could it be comprised of multiple pickle objects? Unfortunately, I didn't create the pickle object and I don't have access to who did. I cannot figure out why pickle is splitting up my file into chunks, which isn't the default, and I am not telling it to. What does reloading the same file do? I honestly never tried or even came across a use case until now. I spent a good 5 hours trying to figure out how to even ask this question on Google. Unsurprisingly, trying "multiple pickle loads on the same document" doesn't yield anything too useful. The Python 3.7 pickle docs does not describe this behavior. I can't figure out how repeatedly loading a pickle document doesn't (a) crash or (b) load the entire thing into memory and then just reference itself. In my 15 years of using python I have never run into this problem... so I am taking a leap of faith that this is just weird and we should probably just use a database instead. 
This file is not quite a pickle file. Someone has dumped multiple pickles into the same file, resulting in the file contents being a concatenation of multiple pickles. When you call pickle.load(f), pickle will read the file from the current file position until it finds a pickle end, so each pickle.load call will load the next pickle.You can create such a file yourself by calling pickle.dump repeatedly:
