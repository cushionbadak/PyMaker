I am working on a project in Python which requires me to do iteration over a 3-element list as;Then I use the basis_nums vector for other applications.However I'd like to do it as follows;etc.and increase the list elements one by one until its;Any suggestions how I can do it?
did you mean this:itertools.product saves you the indentation depth. (note: basis_nums are tuples now and not lists).
Or have an extra repeat=3 at the end:itertools.product is getting the mathematical product algorithm embedded into python, the itertools module also contains the combination algorithm, as itertools.combination, also the module contains the permutation algorithm, as itertools.permutation.
