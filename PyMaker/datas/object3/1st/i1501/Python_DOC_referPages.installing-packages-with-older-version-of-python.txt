I have Python 3.7, which currently doesn't support Tensorflow.So I installed Python 3.6.7, went to the command line and typed in py -m pip install tensorflow, and still got the same error:Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: ). No matching distribution found for tensorflowWhat can I do ensure that I'm trying to install Tensorflow using Python 3.6.7?
Browsing the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.htmlThe solution is to invoke version 3.6 by specifying it as follows:py -3.6 -m pip install tensorflow
