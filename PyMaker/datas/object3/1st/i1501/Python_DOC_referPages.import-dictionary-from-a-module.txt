I have been struggling with importing a dictionary from a module I created. I have the module testmodule1.py where I defined the dictionary:Then on the main script then I import the module and I want to access the value using the key:But I get the error:Any idea on what I'm doing wrong?
To get the values of a dict from a key, you can either do main['dtt'] (see doc) or main.get('dtt') (see this part of the doc) but not main('dtt') as like the error says, a dict is not callable.Option 1:d[key]: Return the item of d with key key. Raises a KeyError if key is not in the map.Option 2:d.get(key[, default]): Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.
