This question already has an answer here:python open built-in function: difference between modes a, a+, w, w+, and r+?                    6 answers                I have the following code, but it doesn't work if the file doesn't exist:I want the method to create the file if it doesn't exist, but all the examples I have found don't explain how to do it using with clause, they just use try: open.How can I instruct with clause to create the file if it doesn't exist?
You can open the file in a+ mode (append mode with the permission to read) instead, and do a file seek to position 0 so that it creates the file if it doesn't already exist, but also allows reading the file from the beginning:
The mode r+ is read+write, but does not create the file if needed.  I think you want w+.  Nice table here.
