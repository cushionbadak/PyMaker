i started to learn python, i using pycharm, mac, and i'm trying to import mate expansion package.. i add this line at the head of my python file: "from mate import *" and it doesn't work, i try to install the mate package and every time i do it i get this error, i also put this line in terminal "python setup.py install" but setup.py isn't found...need some help, thanks :) 
Try to install the dependency using pip. mate is on PyPi repositories (link), so you can install it using pip install mate
I found a solution to my case, appear to bethat I was needed to download a package call "vcversioner" that was missed. https://pypi.org/project/vcversioner/ without this package i could'nt download new packages to pycharmi used this commend line to download vcversioner -> pip install vcversioner and it solved the problem
