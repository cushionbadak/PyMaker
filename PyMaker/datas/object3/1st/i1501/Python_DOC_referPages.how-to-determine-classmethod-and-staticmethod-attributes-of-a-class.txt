When iterating the attributes of a class, I can see the @classmethod and @staticmethod attributes, but I'm not sure how I can generically identify them based on their typeand the attributes look like:So instances methods have a str() == "<unbound method DeprecatedClassWithInit.foo>"And classmethod have str() == "<bound method type.bar of <class ...>>"And staticmethod have str() == <function bab at 1232455>Is this a good way of identifying the attributes?
No, you should not rely on the string representations of these attributes. Instead, note that classmethod and staticmethod are types, i.e., they are class objects. For those who want to know, they are implemented as descriptors. Just iterate over the attributes of a class and use isinstance:
