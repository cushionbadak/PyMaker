I want to create alphabetically ascending names like the column names in excel. That is I want to have smth. like a,b,c,...,z,aa,ab,...az,...zz,aaa,aab,....I have tried:Which works until zz but than fails because it runs out of indexIndexError
You could make use of itertools.product():First, you want all letters, then all pairs, then all triplets, etc. This is why we first need to iterate through all the string lengths you want (for i in range(...)).Then, we need all possible associations with the i letters, so we can use product(ascii_lowercase) which is equivalent to a nested for loop repeated i times.This will generate the tuples of size i required, finally just join() them to obtain a string.To continuously generate names without limit, replace the for loop with while:
For a general solution we can use a generator and islice from itertools:And the output:And you can use islice to take as many strings as you need.
Try:When your index in below line exceed 26 it raise exception, becouse of ascii_lowercase length:But you can:EDIT:or you can use:
You can use:
There's an answer to this question provided on Code Review SEA slight modification to the answer in the link gives the following which works for an arbitrary number of iterations.
