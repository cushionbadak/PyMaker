I understand the basics of numpy (Pandas) broadcasting but got stuck on this simple example: My understanding of the z shape is that you had a (1,5) array multiplied with a (2,5) array, the trailing dimension for 5 is equal so you end up with a 2x5 array. Okay that sounds good. My problem is why is x.shape = (5,)? Isn't it one-dimensional so it's really 1x5? 
NumPy 1D array like x gives you shape such as (5,) without reshaping. If you want to treat it as 1 column matrix of shape 1x5 then do np.arange(5).reshape(1,5)
The broadcasting rules are:With your x and y:If y was (5,2), it would raise an error, because (1,5) cannot be paired with (5,2).  But (5,1) is ok, because (1,5) * (5,1) => (5,5).
