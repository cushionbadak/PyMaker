I am trying to retrieve a random string from python list to build a word guess challenge. I deployed anaconda environment on Alibaba Cloud ECS Instance.I often use the following method to retrieve a random string from the list.Let's say Is there any optimized way or build-in funtion to do that? Due to a large number of words, it takes some time to give the result.
Take a look at random.choice which does exactly what you need. For your case, it would look like this:Having said that, I wouldn't expect it to make such a big difference on the speed of the process. But If I find the time I will test it.
You could try random.randrange() instead of random.randint().random.randrange():Return a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step). This is equivalent to choice(range(start, stop, step)), but doesnâ€™t actually build a range object.From https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrangeI am not aware of any built-in function that does this. So the equivalent statement would be: WordStack[random.randrange(len(WordStack))]
