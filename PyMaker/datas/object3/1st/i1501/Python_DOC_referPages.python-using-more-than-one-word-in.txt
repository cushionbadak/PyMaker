I want to use more than one word in !=, but I can't for the life of me understand or google my way how to. Can anyone help, and explain why I can't just do it like:!= "No" != "no" !="n" !="N":             etc etc
You can use a tuple of sentinel-values, e.g.or If there are a huge amount of sentinels, a set will perform faster than a tuple (for low amounts of values, hashing is not worth it). You might also want to look into the re module for more sophisticated pattern matching.

You're looking for a way to chain together conditional statements. Unfortunately you cannot do it the way you're trying to do. However, you can use and and or to chain them together, which is how it's normally done. For example:But an even better approach is to find how to logically turn this into a single conditional, in this case using lower on the user input:Finally, you can use random.choice to provide a random element from your answers array.
Change your problematic line to:This way, you convert the input string to lowercase (lower()) while also stripping any space the user might have typed in (strip())Then, if user types: "No", lower() will convert it to all lowercase, "no" and then check it towards your != 'no'.Anything typed into input() is a string, so can omit the str().
