Natural Text
I have a string like this '[[20, 20.4,aa], [c, 10.5, eee]]'.My aim is to enclose the characters inside single quotes and leave the numbers as it is.For example:I have done so far this:But it works only for single characters. If I have aa it will give 'a''a' which is wrong.How the problem can be fixed? 
You could use sub:OutputThe pattern ([a-zA-Z]+) means match one or more letters and put them inside a group, then refer to that group r"'\1'" and surrounded with single quotes.
