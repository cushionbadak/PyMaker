I am monitoring and controlling a smart light bulb from my dashboard(User Interface   Dashboard) and every time I open or close the light bulb it sends back a data that shows the light bulb is on or off, what I want to do is to change this "ON/OFF" data string in to binary of 1/0, is there anyway I can get 1 or 0 instead of 'ON/OFF'.this is some of the API code I have used to control the light bulb
If you can guarantee that the returned value is always one of 'ON' or 'OFF', you can use the fact that True and 1 are interchangeableIf you need some error handling, something like this might work.If you need an int to serialise, call int with the result
