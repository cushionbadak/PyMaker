I'm trying to come up with an assert statement that checks whether a nonempty string, s, contains alphanumeric characters and spaces:I understand that this will return False if there are spaces because it checks that whether every character is either a letter or number.  How do I fix this?EDIT: For clarification, I'm trying to create an assert statement that checks whether a nonempty string contains alphanumeric characters and/or spaces.  For example, "    a 4    bc  " and "ab" should both return True.
Maybe this is what you want:Strings for testing:Check whether a string contains any space:Check whether a string contains any digit, you can use any function and str.isdigit function:Check whether a string contains any alphabetic character, you can use any function and str.isalpha function:Check whether a string contains any number, or any alphabetic character or any space:If you want to use assert statement, you can use any combination of them:Of course, if you don't like these methods, you can simply use assert like this:
You could use all, to check if every character is alphanumeric or space:OutputIf it most contain spaces and alphanumeric characters, you can do:OutputAlso note, as mentioned by @Chris_Rands that this .isspace considers tabs as whitespaces.
You could remove the spaces to test:
This would be one way
