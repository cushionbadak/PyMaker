I'm scraping a lot of reviews from a site with Python, for each review I call the "review" function and then open the file and append it to it. It works for a while but then the following error appears me everytime and not it the same review.OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argumentI tried json.dumps:but the same error keeps appearing. I also tried json.dump:and, for some reason, I tried without indent too.edit: full traceback for json.dumps:full traceback for json.dump:
try giving it the full path of the file.make sure you have permission to write in that directory (whatever user the app is running under)also, if the file does not already exist, it cannot append to it... instead of a try a+plus sign means if it is not there then create it
Why don't you open your file as a variable?
