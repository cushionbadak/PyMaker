I'm fairly new to using python and I'm seeking help on a small project I'm working on.So firstly I want to make a 10x10 grid out of coordinates and then add a loop function that can randomly pick a cell and somehow store the cell coordinates it has picked without selecting the same cell twice.So far I have come up with this.The next part is where I'm struggling.Eventually I would like to plot the coordinates onto a grid and then put a map image over the grid.This is my first question so please excuse mistakes and code quotes.Thanks in advance
