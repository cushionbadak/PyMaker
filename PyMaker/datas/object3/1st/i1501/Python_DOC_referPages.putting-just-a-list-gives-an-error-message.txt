I am very new to Python just to make that clear. I made a list just to try out different things you can do with IDLE:That was all I wrote and got an error messageHowever, when I made the same list with numbers everything worked. What is the issue here? How can I - for example - make a list of strings?
About python list. I suppose you wanted to create a list with strings as single characters. But in this case you made a list with three variables, which doesn't assigned yet to the name a,b,c you passed to the list. That is why the error message occurred. You have to first define them some way first. If you want to pass them as strings you have to use quotes (double or single)  "", or '' surround them:
list_of_letters=[a,b,c] implies there exist variables, classes, etc with names a, b and c, which you have not defined.To do what you're trying to do you should define them as "a", "b" and "c" (Strings).Here is a guide on Python lists
list can contains stringsyou need to know strings should come with an quotesOutput:['a', 'b', "'c'"]string can comes with single,double and triple qoutes
