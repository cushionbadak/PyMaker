Natural Text
Is it possible to split something by ", " on a row and print it out as a separate lineText file contains this:Basically what I want the code to do is split the text file by ", " and print each one onto a new line so it says thisFor some reason it just says 
This line splits the line by comma and takes the i'th element (it works for i=0,1 and probably 2 but you'll get an exception once i will be bigger) What you would actually like to do is - And then print each variable but a more elegant way would be to use csv reader
The reason your code doesn't currently work, is because in the example you give, you are taking a fixed item per line (line = ...[i]) where i does not change in between you printing the different lines.Assuming your file always contains the same structure Subject, Name, Fruit, I would use zip() to loop over the line:Additionally, I would replace your print statement with a 'more modern' version:or if you work in a version < 3.6but that is mostly personal preference.
