Natural Text
I want to automate multiple file generation. I have a working Python script to generate a single file with sentences that mimic a domain of language I'm interested in (code from here). The code below takes the text my_domain.txt as input, trains a Markov language model on it, then outputs a file with 10 fake sentences that read pretty similarly to the ones in the input text. What I want to do now is use this method to generate 1000+ files, each with a slightly unique name, like this:fake1.txtfake2.txtfake3.txtI'm guessing that I may need a different method of printing to a file. But when I search on techniques, I don't find anything that helps me run the markovify method repeatedly AND gives unique names to each successive output file. 
Use a loop that creates filenames,use with open(..) syntax to make sure they get closed ok even if exception arises.string format mini languagewith open(...)  ( and the more abstract with-statement ingeneral )
