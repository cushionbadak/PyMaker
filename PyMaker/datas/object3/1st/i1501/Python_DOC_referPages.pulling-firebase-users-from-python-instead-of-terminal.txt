I found (and tried successfully) to pull the user emails using terminal but was wondering if anyone knew how to do it from python? My program needs to the file daily and I'm trying to automate it. Here's what I have then I try and read it, but the auth:export line is where it breaks giving me a syntax error
emails = (firebase auth:export account_file.csv) is not a correct sintax in python.Haven't used it, but this function seems to list firebase users: Check documentation here.Once you have all your users toghether in some variable like firebase_users, you'll need to export them to .csv.Also check here for python csv package.As I said, haven't tried it. I'll do it later to refresh any possible mistake.
