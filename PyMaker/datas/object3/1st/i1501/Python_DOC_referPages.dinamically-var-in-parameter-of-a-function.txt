I'm trying to call a function using a name of a var dinamically, but I don't know if this is possible, something like that:I'm trying to pass the variable name as a list dynamically, but I'm not sure if that's possible in python, any suggestions?
Just use a dictionary:A variable number of variable is not the recommended approach.Related: How do I create a variable number of variables?.
You could find your variables in locals()/globals() like so
As suggested by most use a dictionary, and then if you want and I think what you are intending for it to do is to then store the dictionary in a list. However, your code shows a problem where you passed a string for what I believe you intend to be a list.The example below works as intended:The better way is to store your list of titles by genre in a dictionary, you can use the defaultdict data model from the Python standard library for that.Also do not use inbuilt method or reserved names as variables, I replaced your dict variable to just d.
