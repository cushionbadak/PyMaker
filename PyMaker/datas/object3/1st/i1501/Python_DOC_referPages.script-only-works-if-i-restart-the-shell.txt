Natural Text
So I wrote a script which gets parameters from input (by hand) and it writes it in a text file. My only problem is that the text from the input won't appear in the txt file,  only if i restart the shell manually. What would you recommend to try to fix this, so I don't  have to restart the the shell manially all the time?Well the script is simple, because I'm beginer :D 
In your code, you're referencing the close method of your file object, but you're not calling it. That means the file isn't closed until you close the interpreter (you could probably also get the same effect by using del file or rebinding the variable to some other object).To fix the problem, you can call close just by adding parentheses: file.close()Or better yet, use a with statement:When the indented block following the with ends, the file will be closed automatically. It will happen even if you exit the block unexpectedly, due to an exception.
