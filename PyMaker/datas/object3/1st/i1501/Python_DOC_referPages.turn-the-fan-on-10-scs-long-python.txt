This is my code turning the fan on i run the sleep on separate thread because it makes the entire script sleepThe script is running however im not getting 10 scs it is only 1 or 2 seconds? How to fix this? TIA
I'm going to assume that your program dies before the 10 seconds are up, which is what kills the fan. The misspelling of daemon in t.deamon = True doesn't matter here.Probably better to join on that thread in your main function.
As Adam Smith said, the problem is because of your new thread dying almost instantly after creation and not because of daemon. Hence, you should use the join method.
