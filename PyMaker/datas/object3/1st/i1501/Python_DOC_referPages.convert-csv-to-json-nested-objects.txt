I am new to python, and I am having to convert a csv file to json in following format:CSV File :JSON format:I can produce parent values in json, but I am not sure how do I get sub-nodes and parse column name as values and iterate through entire file like that.Above code converts csv to simple json objects, I want to achieve nested objects. I am thinking maybe appending would be the solution, but not sure how to pass column as value and corresponding data as value.
You can use csv.DictReader which gives you access to the column name as you're iterating each row. Then you can build each item as follows:OutputIf you want to set custom field names in your final json (e.g. emailOrPhone for email), you can always manually set field names for d and set the appropriate value
At little more complicated than needs to be, but you can try building your JSON array as you read in your values from the csv file, then output your result to a .json file with json.dump at the end:Which gives the following customers.json:
USAGE:python csv2json.py myCSVfile.txtwhere myCSVfile.txt it's your CSV file (name it as you prefer).It will create a JSON array in a file named myCSVfile.jsonThat's all.
