I'm new to Python, looked unsuccessfully for answers in previous posts. Hoping you can help me.I'm trying to use a script I copied off of this blog post.Said script automates the process of starting SSH sessions on a given remote system and running commands on that system. It imports a configuration file, from the import statement below I assume named conf, that supplies the script with login credentials, file paths, etc.My issue is I am not sure how the conf file is formatted and it wasn't provided in the blog post. From the import statement I assume the file is named conf.py and the it has sections, one of them named ssh_confCan anyone describe how was that file formatted?Gratefully,A Python Newbie.
There are not really sections like that.If conf.py was a file, then this could be made to work, by making ssh_conf a class within conf.py:But that's kind of nasty and feels like pointless abuse of classes.My guess is that conf is actually a package. That is to say, a directory called conf containing a (empty) file called __init__.py and a number of other files, any of which can be imported from conf. One of these files would be called ssh_conf.py and that would contain things like:The overall structure looks like:If you aren't familiar with packages, the official documentation is a good place to start.
