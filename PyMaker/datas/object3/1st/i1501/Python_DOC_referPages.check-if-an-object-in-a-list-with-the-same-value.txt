I have a Python list of some complex objects, and a target object which I wish to check of its occurrence in the list by value.In other words, I need to find if any of the objects in the list, has the same attributes with the same values as the target object.I tried:But this compares the references of the objects not the values.I know I can do some nested loops to check every single attribute, but I am looking for a smarter way, if any.Thanks in advanced.
