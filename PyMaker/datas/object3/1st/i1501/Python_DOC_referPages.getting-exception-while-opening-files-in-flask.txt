I'm getting error when i make postman request to my api when trying to read files from a directory.I'm getting the following exception:Why is it not able to open the file and read data when i'm getting all the list of files inside the directory?
Here is complete solution to your problem:Here is the output:Explanation:In my example, I put it on / route, but you can put it where ever you want.Whenever I go to / route, I get JSON response. os.getcwd() gets me current directory, but I join two paths using os.path.join() function. From python documentation:Join one or more path components intelligently.You can read more on python documentation. Next, since I get the path to training_data, I need to join again path to training_data and file. And I return JSON data. If anything goes wrong, you can print traceback in except clause and also return data, so that flask doesn't raise error for returning no response to the user.P.S.training_data folder is in a same level as a your flask application.
