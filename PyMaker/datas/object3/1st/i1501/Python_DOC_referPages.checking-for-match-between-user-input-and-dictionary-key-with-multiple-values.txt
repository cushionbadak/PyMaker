If I want to check if the inputted parameter in the checkPlayer function matches a key in dict1  and return the entire object or a specific value for the respective key, how would I change this code?I am mainly confused as to why printing x would print the players name and not the whole object. How would I print the whole object, or more specifically, just the nationality or team if a match was found. Not quite sure how to access indexes in dictionaries using for loops, it's not quite as intuitive as lists :/Thanks guys
You are iterating over the keys of the dictionary and printing the key (which is the name of the player) if it was found. To get the value for that key, you can use the get method (which also allows you to specify a default if a key wasn't found in the dictionary):OutputFurthermore, to check if a player name is in your dictionary, you can simply have if plyr in dict1; you don't need to iterate over all the keys. So your method can also be:Output
your object is a key:value the key is 'Messi' the value is 'Argentina','Barcelona'however in your print statement you only print the name of object will will return the key only without the valueto access the value you may use get() or the index of the object inside your dictionary to get your desire result use this :
You can use below code:
