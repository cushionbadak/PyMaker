I use OS LUbuntuI installed Python3.4 using the Lubuntu software center;Next thing I want to do is to install some modules.Best way I can think of would be pip install. But I can't find it on the computer (I'm quite new to Linux). Please help reaching the pip? or other way to install modules except pip?I tried sudo apt-get install ... , but It installs it on python2.7 instead of python3.4 (I have 2 interpreters). Removing python2.7 off the computer is not an option..
You have stated that you want to use apt-get instead of pip, so:The important part of this is the 3. But honestly, pip is easier to use and more "meant" for Python, so I don't see a reason not to use it.
Have you tried sudo apt-get install pip3?Ok, as someone has pointed out it is not actually pip3, it is a symlink. For a better answer we can look at the official python documentation.https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.htmland here we find:python2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2python2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7python3   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 3python3.4 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 3.4So, if you want to install the Python 3 version of a package usepython3   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 3
