For example, if I use print it gives me 101 238 157 and None.But if I use RETURN it only returns 101.So what can I do?
return can have only one value, (that can be an object like a list or something else)... why? Just because return is the value that assume the function. In the moment you do an assignment of a function for exampleIn this way the number should be MJ, KD and LBJ at the same time... impossible conceptually. But we can return a list!First of all use a for loop, is more compact an readable, and do the same things:Now use a list of champions:In a more compact way:now you can return it in a func:Maybe you would like to make the for loop more dynamic:This is a more pythonic wayI hope this is what you needed to do!
There are multiple ways to do but the following is simpler way using range and for loop. The data will be a list of your outputs. You may try yeild also
Add all values â€‹to one variable and return it.
You can either collect all values and return them at once, or yield each value one after the other:Both of these provide an iterable - you can use them in for loops, pass them to list or destructure them, for example:Since your transformation maps directly from one form to another, you can express both in comprehension form as well:While both provide iterables, the two are not equivalent. return means you build the entire list up front, whereas yield lazily computes each value.When you return a list, you can also reuse its content. In contrast, when you yield each value, it is gone after use:
