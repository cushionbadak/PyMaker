Natural Text
I want to cut a text from the point where my regex expression is found to the end of the text. The position may vary, so I need that number as a variable.The position can already be seen in the result of studentnrRegex.search(text):Can I get the start position as a variable directly from my variable start, in this case 2494?
The match object returned by calling .search() has .start() and .end() methods that return the starting and ending positions of the match.You can accomplish the same thing with a different regex that matches the student number and everything after it. This will save you the trouble of doing the slice:The {8} matches 8 repeats of the \d and the .* matches all remaining characters until the end of the string (including newlines) as long as the re.DOTALL flag is specified. The full match is group 0, which is the default value for the .group() method of the match object. You can access the student number as m.group(1).
