Natural Text
The text file is like:I want to match the block and write something in between the two field tag. I have got the following code which is from How to search for a string in text files?My solution doesn't work even if I use \t to detect the tab I think my issue is how to match multiple lines that have some space or tab in it. Thanks everyone. 
Please refer to this question: Regular expression matching a multiline block of textYour goal is simple enough using regexes. The following script finds <field> tags in the variable html, and puts <text to put between the tags> in between the tags.
I got the answer from: Pythonic way of inserting lines to a fileThe solution doesn't use mmap. That's true we cannot insert data into a file, but we can replace the data.
