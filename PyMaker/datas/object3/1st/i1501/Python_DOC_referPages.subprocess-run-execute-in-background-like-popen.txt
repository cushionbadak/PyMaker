The subprocess docs say The recommended approach to invoking subprocesses is to use the run() function for all use cases it can handle.subprocess.run executes in the foreground, waiting for the subprocess to exit. subprocess.Popen executes in the background, immediately returning a Popen object. Can I make subprocess.run immediately return a Popen object running in the background?
No. The docs for run specifically call out that it waits:Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then  return a CompletedProcess instance.It was introduced in Python 3.5 as a simplification of Popen/communicate for use cases where waiting for the process to finish is acceptable.
