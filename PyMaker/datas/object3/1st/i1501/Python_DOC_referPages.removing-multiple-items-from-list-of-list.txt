I need to remove items from a list in the following manner:given two numbers:and the list:I need to remove all items that are in between these two nums, such that the following output will be created:so the 1st and 2nd numbers are kept, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th are removed, the 6th and 7th are kept, and the rest is removedI've tried to create a certain loop that deletes items, but couldn't quite figure how to run over indexes.thx for the help! 
You want to keep the first 2 out of 5 for every 5 items:Output: The trick is to use enumerate() and modulo the given index of your original data by num2 - you keep those that are less then num1.
I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but I'm assuming you mean this:Delete elements from num1 to num2Delete elements after num1 + num2Just use the del operator and list slicing:Please clarify if you mean something different.
