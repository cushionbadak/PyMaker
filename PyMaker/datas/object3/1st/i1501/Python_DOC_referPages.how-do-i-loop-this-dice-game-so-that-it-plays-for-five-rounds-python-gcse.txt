I'm currently working on my OCR GCSE Program. I'm a new developer and this is my most extensive project yet.The basis for the code is there, the program is working as intended, however my brief asks that the program run 5 times over for five separate rounds.I'm struggling to understand while loops, whenever I try to implement a while loop. The program can not go past the login system.I need some help figuring out how to loop this program and any suggestions on how to improve and optimise the code would be greatly appreciated! :) - Jayode18
You may want to look at this:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.htmlThe for statement will solve your problem! You just need to put all the code you want to be looped inside of it, like this:In this example above, the programm output will be like:In other words, the code was looped 5 times! And the variable i are the number of the iteration.Hope I've helped!
