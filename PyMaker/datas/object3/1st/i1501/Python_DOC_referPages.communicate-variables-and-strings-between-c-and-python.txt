I think you'll be interested in IPC with mmap and locks.See docs and for example, hereand maybe here for a code example (with two Python processes only).
Generally using APIs is the best way to communicate between services in different languages. But if you must have one codebase with shared ram, there is actually something for that with C/Python. It's called Cython: https://cython.org/
