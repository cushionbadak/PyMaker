I have used requests library and I know how to work with it, but I need to work with standard library only, so I would appreciate if you don't encourage me to use requests instead.   I made a flask server that handles POST requests and then from a different script I call urllib to make POST calls to the flask server. I need to send a raw json in body just like we do in Postman. Flask Server Urllib Client (saved as test.py) -With only Authorization header I get Bad Request as output and the json is None on the flask server side as expected.  With ONLY Content-Type header OR both the headers I get this error -The whole thing is simple enough, but I am not able to understand why is this happening and the error message doesn't help much either.
The server is failing in request.get_json(). It's only happening when the client sends both headers because that's when it reaches this line.To fix it, change the client to send the data as JSON:I hope this helps
