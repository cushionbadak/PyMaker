Natural Text
I have the following in my urls.py:url(r'^prstatus/(?P<pk>\d+)/(?P<organization>.+)/' +        '(?P<repository>.+)/(?P<pr>\d+)/$',PRStatus.get_pr_status, name="one_pr_in_repo"),The url that I enter is:localhost:8000/api/v1/prstatus/1/myrepo/docker-react/1But if I print(organization, repository, pr).I get myrepo/docker-react 2 NoneOrganization gets assigned myrepo/docker-react instead of myrepo.Can someone help on this?
It seems that is regular expression. The python documentation for regular expressions explains:The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<a> b <c>', it will match the entire string, and not just '<a>'. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only '<a>'.Because . matches any character, including \, you need to replace .+ by .+?Another option is to change . to something that better reflects which characters should be matched. Every organization and repository name I know of only contains alphanumeric characters, underscores and whitespaces (which are replaced by dashes in urls), so this will probably work:
