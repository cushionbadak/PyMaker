Natural Text
I have 2 lists below and I need the user to enter the coin type from the list which I was able to do. After the bag weight is asked, but whatever coin type was entered first has to match the index of the bag weight but I cannot seem to do this as the code I typed has an error
You can use the list index() method:Then later you can check if the bagWeight has the right index.
The builtin zip() might be helpful here, since you don't have to explicitly match indices. This is, of course, assuming that the lists are designed to match index-by-index (the coin in the first position goes only with the weight in the first position)
