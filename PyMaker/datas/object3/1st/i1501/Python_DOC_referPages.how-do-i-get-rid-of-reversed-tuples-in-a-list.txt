This question already has an answer here:filter out “reversed” duplicated tuples from a list in Python                    4 answers                For example, let's say I have a list:How do I get rid of all reversed tuples, so what's left is:?this is for a personal project I'm doing it, and I wrote something that detects reversed tuples and deletes them, but only deletes one of the reversed tuples (rather than all of them). I think a dictionary would be useful here, but not sure how to go about implementing it
I would write a good old fashioned for loop. This solution guarantees the following: the first of any reversed tuples is kept, the output list is the same order as the input, makes no assumptions about the input tuple lengths.
Tuples of length 2For tuples all of length 2, you can use frozenset with the itertools unique_everseen recipe available in the docs, also featured in more_itertools and toolz 3rd party libraries:frozenset is an unordered but hashable collection of unique items. The solution assumes your inputs all have length 2. So it won't differentiate between (8,) and (8, 8).Tuples of variable lengthFor tuples of different lengths, you can make a small adjustment to the recipe:
If we consider that all your tuples are duplets and that you want to keep unique values:We then sort the tuples:And then use a set to remove the duplicates:
