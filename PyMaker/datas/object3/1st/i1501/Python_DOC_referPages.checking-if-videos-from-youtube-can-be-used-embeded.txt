In a site I have multiple Youtube embedded videos, (with permission) at that time.Later, after 1-2 years, some of the videos are marked as Youtube only, or are deleted from youtube.I'm looking for a way to use python:- to see which video from a list are still available, - which can be used embedded- is a video or playlistIf a package exist, better.
The youtube API should return to you whether a video is embeddable or not:Calling on their video endpoint should return you a representation that includes:You can use any library you like to hit the API like urllib
