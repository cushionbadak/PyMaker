Natural Text
I have a dictionary that has integers as keys and lists as values. A small preview is shown here. I want to output the keys with the same list values in the same dictionaries so as to draw up a CSV file for each individual set of values, categorising the keys that have similar values. I have a large list so I can't define the dictionary names because I don't know how many shall be there. I managed to sort the dictionary using pandas to output a sorted list basing on the texts but I have not been able to use pandas to split it up.I thought about an option B of having lists of the keys of which these lists are named after their unique dictionary values(text lists). My preferred option, however, is a split dictionary.
You can use collections.defaultdict for an O(n) solution, remembering to use tuple keys, as list is not hashable:draw up a CSV file for each individual set of valuesFor this part of your problem, just iterate your defaultdict:
