I have this code here:my goal with this code is to get the key with the biggest value, and if 2 keys have the same values then choose the one that comes first in a lexicography order.now the first part of the code works fine! however I am having trouble with the second part. I read some code on the subject but I haven't been able to find a way to make it work.example for how the code should work: (it should print harry potter)but my code prints 'lilo and stich' another example:(this output is working correctly)
You can get the fully sorted list by:and takte the first one. It works by defining a tuple as sort-criteria - tuples are sorted by 1st value, then 2nd value if 1st value draws etc.Sorting by -len() "inverts" it (you could also specify the reverse=True param to sorting - either one works.Output:
You could use min if you only want the most popular book:OutputThe idea is the same as in the answer of @PatrickArtner, the only difference being the sorted is O(nlogn) and min is O(n). No need to sort the list, only to find the minimum.
