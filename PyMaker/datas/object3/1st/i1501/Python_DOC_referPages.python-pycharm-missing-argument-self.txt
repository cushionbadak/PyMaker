I'm currently learning Python and I don't understand what is wrong with my code, but PyCharm keeps giving me the following error:Here is my code:and here is my Fish.py file:Any help would be appreciated!
You have the error in Creating Instance Objects In this section fish1 = Fish you didn't create the instance, but try to use it fish1.bubbles().So try change fish1 = Fish to fish1 = Fish(name, coords). name and coords required in your constructor.
The Fish is the class. You can't ask for an abstract fish to make bubbles. You have to ask a specific fish (that is, an object of that class). So, assuming your fish is "bob"
You need to call the constructor of the class to create an instance of that classIn your case it would be with parameters
