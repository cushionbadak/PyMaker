I have to take in a string and an integer value and check if the string is lowercase or uppercase, and based on that I have to increment it by number k. for eg if k=4 and string is 'ABab' it should give the output 'EFef'. This is my code only for checking lowercase. Unfortunately is giving ValueError.
The traceback shows where the error occurs.You are passing an argument to chr that is not within the allowed range. As described here:The valid range for the argument is from 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF  in base 16). ValueError will be raised if i is outside that range.This is because you have changed the value of k to (probably) be a large negative number:So the result of ord(i)+k is also often negative. Negative numbers are not in the allowed range, so the call to chr fails.There are lots of other problems with your code, and I don't think you'd learn much if I just wrote "my solution" to the problem. Another thing you might want to look at to begin with is that:doesn't do what you want, you probably want:
