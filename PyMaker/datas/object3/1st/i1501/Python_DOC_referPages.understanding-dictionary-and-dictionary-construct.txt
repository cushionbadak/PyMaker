I'm just started into the python learning and trying to understand the different construct of dictionary while going through dictionary reading i know it has key and Values format but i have few doubts to understand.I have Below two dictionary called d1 and d2In the above sample i see proper dictionary key and value format and while looking at type it says class dictWhile the above sample i see dictionary key is okay but values are in list format and while looking at type it also says class dictSo, How could i process the d2 into a proper dictionary format key and value. saying that i want to process d2 so it looks like as d1 then how could that be achieved.Apologies if something i could not make clear.
In Python Dictionary are an unordered set of key: value pairs.Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.so you can store any type of object in value.in first example you are storing string in value.In second example you are storing list in value.you can access the key value pair using below code.Output:
In Python 3, you can just use .items() function over the d2 dictionary as follows:Try using the n2w python library to convert the number to words and flatten the dictionary to get the desired output.
