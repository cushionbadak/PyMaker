New to Python and having a hard time creating a for loop or while loop that'll give me an output of 5, 10 ,15, 20, ... all the way to 1,000,000.
Use range (note your doing to a million which is gonna take a while):

Try thisfor i in range(0,1000000,5):  print(i)This will print every time it goes up by 5.The range() function works like range(start, stop, step)
