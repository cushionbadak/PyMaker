First of all, I read this SO question but it actually doesn't include my desired approach. In addition, negating the actual values is not applicable for my use case.Heapq Docs: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/heapq.htmlAssume I have a list of dataclass objects in my heap. Only the a property determines the order of objects.Now I want to have an inverted order. Therefore, I changed the line return self.a < other.a to return self.a > other.a. The result:The desired result should be one of the four solutions: Probably, not all pairs of objects are compared by heapq that would explain the strange order. However, is it still possible to get an inverted order?Do I have to provide more object comparison methods?        If you have an completely other approach, do not hesitate!
You need to make l into a heap using heapifyprints
