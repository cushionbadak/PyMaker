Apply the Counter update option on the elements of your list,Based on the suggestion from @BlueSheepTokenoutput:
itertools.chain.from_iterablecollections.Counter accepts any iterable of hashable elements. So you can chain your list of lists via itertools.chain. The benefit of this solution is it works for any number of sublists.
