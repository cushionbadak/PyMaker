I am plotting some data and I want to automatically generate a report. I can save the plot and then add it to my document. However, I prefer to do it directly, without saving step. Going through the python-docx documentation I doubt it is doable by this package. Is there another way?My code looks like this right now
Use StringIO :This module implements a file-like class, StringIO, that reads and  writes a string buffer (also known as memory files).Python 3 : https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.htmlPython 2 : https://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.htmlOr use StringIO from pandas.compat
