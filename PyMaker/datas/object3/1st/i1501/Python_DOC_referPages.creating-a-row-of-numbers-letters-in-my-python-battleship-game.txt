I am trying to get my grid to display like this:I have tried various ways of attempting this but I cannot seem to get it working. Would anyone have any suggestions? Also in my login the while loop seems to be stuck. I put in a break a few times but again cant seem to get it working correctly. Any help is greatly appreciated!
