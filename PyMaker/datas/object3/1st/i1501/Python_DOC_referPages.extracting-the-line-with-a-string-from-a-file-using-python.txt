You can use regex with flags for re.MULTILINE and re.DOTALL. This way a . will also match \n and you can look for anything that starts with tg_ (no need to put each in []) and ends with a double \n\n (or end of text) \Z:Output (each match is between a line of ----------------------------------------):re.findall() result looks like:To enable multiline-searches you need to read in more then one line at a time - if your file is humongeous this will lead to memory problems.
