I have a function to catch uncaught exceptions, below. Is there any way to write a unit test that will execute the uncaught_exception_handler() function, but exit the test normally?
Instead of testing that your function is called for uncaught exceptions, it's probably best to instead test that the excepthook is installed, and that the function does the right thing when you call it manually. That gives you pretty good evidence that the excepthook will behave properly in real usage. You'll want to move your uncaught_exception_handler outside of init_uncaught_exception_logger so your tests can access it more easily.If you want to actually invoke excepthook through an uncaught exception, then you'll need to launch a subprocess and examine its output. The subprocess module is the way to go for that.
In order to write assertions about raised exceptions, you can use pytest.raises as a context manager like this:with raises(expected_exception: Exception[, match][, message])Now, this unit test will pass only if any code under pytest.raises context manager will raise an exception provided as a parameter. In this case, it's Exception.
