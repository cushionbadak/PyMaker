Trying to get to grips with regular expressions in Python, I'm trying to output some HTML highlighted in part of a URL. My input ismy output should beIf I do this in JavascriptI get the desired result, but if I do this in PythonI don't, how do I get Python to return the correct result rather than $1? Is re.sub even the right function to do this?
Simply use \1 instead of $1:Also note the use of raw strings (r'...') for regular expressions. It is not mandatory but removes the need to escape backslashes, arguably making the code slightly more readable.
Use \1 instead of $1.\number Matches the contents of the group of the same number.http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
For the replacement portion, Python uses \1 the way sed and vi do, not $1 the way Perl, Java, and Javascript (amongst others) do.  Furthermore, because \1 interpolates in regular strings as the character U+0001, you need to use a raw string or \escape it.
A backreference to the whole match value is \g<0>, see re.sub documentation:The backreference \g<0> substitutes in the entire substring matched by the RE.See the Python demo:
