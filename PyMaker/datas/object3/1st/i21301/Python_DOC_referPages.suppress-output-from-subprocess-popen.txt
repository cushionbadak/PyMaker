How do you stop the output from subprocess.Popen from being output?  Printing can sometimes be slow if there is a great deal of it.
If you want to totally throw it away:If you are using Python 2.5, you will need from __future__ import with_statement, or just don't use with.
In Python 3.3+ you could use subprocess.DEVNULL, to suppress the output:Remove stderr=STDOUT if you don't want to suppress stderr also.
