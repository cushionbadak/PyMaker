I've problem to read from Standard input or pipe in python when the pipe is from a "open" (do not know right name)file.I have as example pipetest.py:I run a program that have continues output and Ctrl+c after a whileI get no output.But if I go via an ordinary file it works.this is ended by Ctrl+c after a short whileHow do I do to get any output before the program ends, in this case ping has ended?
Try the next:

For this to work without waiting until the stdin stream ends, you can iter on the readline. I think this is the simplest solution.
while sys.stdin is a file-like object, meaning you can iterate over its lines, it will block until a EOF is inserted. The behaviour can be described with the following pseudo-code:this means that, while you can iterate over sys.stdin's lines, you cannot use this approach for the task at hand and you must explicitly call read() or readline()
This is how I ended up doing this. I didn't really like any of the other solutions, they didn't seem very pythonic. This will make a container for any open file input to iterate over all the lines. This will also take care of closing the file at the end of the context manager. I feel like this is probably how the for line in sys.stdin: block should operate by default.From the command line both of the following should work:
