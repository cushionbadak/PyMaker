I want to override my Python class's __getattribute__ and __setattr__ methods. My use case is the usual one: I have a few special names that I want to handle, and I want the default behavior for anything else. For __getattribute__, it seems that I can request the default behavior simply by raising AttributeError. However, how can I achieve the same in __setattr__? Here is a trivial example, implementing a class with immutable fields "A", "B", and "C".What goes in place of the question marks? With old-style classes, the answer was apparently self.__dict__[name] = value, but documentation indicates that this is wrong for new-style classes.
It'sin Python 2, orin Python 3.Also, raising AttributeError is not how you fall back to the default behavior for __getattribute__. You fall back to the default withon Python 2 oron Python 3.Raising AttributeError skips the default handling and goes to __getattr__, or just produces an AttributeError in the calling code if there's no __getattr__.See the documentation on Customizing Attribute Access.
SomeSuperclass.__setattr__(self, name, value) ?
