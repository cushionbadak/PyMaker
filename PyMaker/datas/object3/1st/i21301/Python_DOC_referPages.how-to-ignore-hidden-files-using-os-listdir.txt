My python script executes an os.listdir(path) where the path is a queue containing archives that I need to treat one by one. The problem is that I'm getting the list in an array and then I just do a simple array.pop(0). It was working fine until I put the project in subversion. Now I get the .svn folder in my array and of course it makes my application crash.So here is my question: is there an existing function that ignore hidden files when executing an os.listdir() and if not what would be the best way?Thank you.
You can write one yourself:Or you can use a glob:Either of these will ignore all filenames beginning with '.'.
This is an old question, but seems like it is missing the obvious answer of using list comprehension, so I'm adding it here for completeness:As a side note, the docs state listdir will return results in 'arbitrary order' but a common use case is to have them sorted alphabetically. If you want the directory contents alphabetically sorted without regards to capitalization, you can use:
On Windows, Linux and OS X:

glob:(glob claims to use listdir and fnmatch under the hood, but it also checks for a leading '.', not by using fnmatch.)
I think it is too much of work to go through all of the items in a loop. I would prefer something simpler like this:
