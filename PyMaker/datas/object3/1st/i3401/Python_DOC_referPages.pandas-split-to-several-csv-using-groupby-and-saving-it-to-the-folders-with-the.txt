I'm very new to Python, Pandas and programming overall, sorry in if this is a too stupid question.Question is quite similar to this one (I've used this for my code) but i want to take it one step further and to save all separated csv's to each individual folder with the same name.What do i have right now:+And it is saving grouped 'Contact Account Name' values in a root folder as separate csvs. But what i need is to save it to the folder inside a root folder, named as 'Contact Account Name' values.I've tried several different methods of creating folders, but failed.Data Frame:How is it working right now:It is creating csv's:How i want it to be:Thanks in advance!
Check folder existence with os.path.exists and use os.mkdir to create the new one:
All you really have to do is to add the Contact Account Name (i) to the os.path.join command - So, the following should roughly work -``````See more here - https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.join
You can define your output directory outside your loop. You may, as below, wish to check whether it exists, creating the directory via os.mkdir if it does not exist.Note in the example above I use f-strings, available in Python 3.6+ and more readable / efficient.
