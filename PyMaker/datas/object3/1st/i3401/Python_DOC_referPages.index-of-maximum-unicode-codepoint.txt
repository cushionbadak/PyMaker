Is this number in the stdlib somewhere?  At the moment I'm parsing it from chr.__doc__ (unichr.__doc__ on Python 2) which seems lame.The valid range for the argument depends how Python was configured â€“ it may be either UCS2 [0..0xFFFF] or UCS4 [0..0x10FFFF].  I'm not sure if other ranges are possible.
This is sys.maxunicode:An integer giving the value of the largest Unicode code point, i.e. 1114111 (0x10FFFF in hexadecimal).Changed in version 3.3: Before PEP 393, sys.maxunicode used to be either 0xFFFF or 0x10FFFF, depending on the configuration option that specified whether Unicode characters were stored as UCS-2 or UCS-4.
