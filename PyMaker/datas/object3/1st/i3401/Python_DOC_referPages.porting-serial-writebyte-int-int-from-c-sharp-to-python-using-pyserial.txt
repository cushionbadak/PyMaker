I have code written in C# that I want to port to Python.I want to port Serial.write(Byte, int, int) from C# to Python and I am using Pyserial. I tried Serial.Write in Pyserial but wasn't able to get the work done.Can anyone guide me through how to create a similar function in Python?
According to the docs, you need to write bytes, not numbers.So you need to convert your numbers, which are one byte and two int, to bytes.You can do that with the struct module. See the struct.pack method.
