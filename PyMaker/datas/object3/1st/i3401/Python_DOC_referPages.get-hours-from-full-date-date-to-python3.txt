It looks like the output is a string. So, you can use string slicing:It's best to use negative indexing here because the day may be single-digit or double-digit, so a solution like time = x[13:21] won't work every time.If you're inclined, you may wish to use strptime() and strftime() to take your string, convert it into a datetime object, and then convert that into a string in HH:MM:SS format. (You may wish to consult the datetime module documentation for this approach).
Use the datetime module. Use .strptime() to convert string to datetime object and then .strftime() to convert to your required string output. Your sample datetime string is represented as '%b %d, %Y %H:%M:%S %p'Ex:Output:
Is the returned parameter a string? If so you can just copy the required parts into another string.
