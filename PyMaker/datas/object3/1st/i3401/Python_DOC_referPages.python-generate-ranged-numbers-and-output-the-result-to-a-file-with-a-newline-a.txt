Natural Text
So what I am trying to do is to generate a list of number values arranging for example from 1 to 100000.I have created a script that does that, but it only prints the output to the screen:What I need is exactly the same thing but appended to a file with a newline following each value:This is the script that generates the numbers:This is the script I wrote in a try to append the output to a file:Solution: Okay, I have been trying to achieve the above and then tried to oversimplify everything, I let the code explains it all:Here is the new script, accepts no args:Then run the command: python appoge_generator.py > appoge_wordlist.txtTo run the script from command line you would python appoge_generator.py I just added the > which means append the output of the procedure to the file appoge_wordlist.txt instead of the screen.Now I have a 1990001 lines, 14,2 MB wordlist generated in 0.9 seconds. I hope some one finds this useful.
It might be faster/more convenient to use Python to write to the file:
Another option you might consider:Basically open the file that you want to write to using a context manager (the with open(...) syntax) in "write-append" mode (the 'wa' argument), create your string of numbers joined by new lines with '\n'.join(...), and finally write that string to the file with a_file.write(...).If you want this to be callable from the command line and allow you to pass in any desired start and stop values and any filename, I suggest looking at the excellent argparse module.
