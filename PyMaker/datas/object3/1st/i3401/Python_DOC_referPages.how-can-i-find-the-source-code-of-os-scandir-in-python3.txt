well this is slightly related to my another question.Among all means to get source of a function:getsource won't workos.scandir has no __file__ attribute, so you can't just os.scandir.__file__.scanning through the source file in python github repo reveals nothing of interest.Any advice would be appreciated.
From the documentation:On Unix-based systems, scandir() uses the systemâ€™s opendir() and readdir() functions. On Windows, it uses the Win32 FindFirstFileW and FindNextFileW functions.I would recommend looking at those if you want to know what's going on behind the scenes.opendirreaddirFindFirstFileWFindNextFileW
