In Python, is there a good way to iterate through lists of different lengths?For example,Assuming that the list will have at least 2 values, and in some list, 3rd value is optional. The above for loop didn't work for b, obviously, that val3 is not available for list 'b'. In that case, I want to print the val3 as 0. Can I give a default value in case of unavailability? The above syntax didn't work either. Please help.
If you want to be fancy ("elegant"?), you can pad a given list with zeros:Similarly, if you're working with tuples, here's another function:
You could use zip_longest with fillvalue handling empty slot for this case:If you need values out of list, just replace last print with:
this is very simpleval1 = 1 , val2 =3 , val3=[3]val1 = 1 , val2 =3 , val3=[]

The simplest method to concatenate the lists is via chain function from the itertools module.Example SnippetOutput
