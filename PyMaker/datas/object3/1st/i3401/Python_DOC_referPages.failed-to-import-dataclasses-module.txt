Today I installed python 3.7 from apt-get to try out the new dataclasses module. I installed it seperately because python3.6 wasn't upgradeable to 3.7.When I type: python3.7 --version, it gives me: >>> Python 3.7.0a2 as my current version.The problem is that I can't seem to import dataclasses.my import statement is: from dataclasses import dataclass as instructed hereThis is the error message it's giving me:I even tried installing the dataclasses module with pip3: pip3 install dataclasses. Not sure if that's necessary though.Any suggestion on what might be the problem?[EDIT] Just tried it with a python3.6 console and it worked fine .. weird.
As suggested by @wim python3.7 -m venv venv_dirThis command will:Use python3.7 to run the commandThe -m flag tells the interpreter to run the next argument as a scriptvenv is a module, and because of the -m flag it will be run as a scriptFinally, the venv_dir is given to the venv module as an argument whichthis module will use to create a virtual environment directory atOnce this command is run now you'll have a nice sandbox for messing around/testing the dataclasses module.To activate this virtual environment be sure to run source venv_dir/bin/activate before you begin. This command will run the script at venv_dir/bin/activate to set up the necessary environment variables and other things for youTo deactivate, simply run deactivate after activating
