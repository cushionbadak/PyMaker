This question already has an answer here:Python: multiplication override                    2 answers                I wrote a class in python like this I want to overwrite the operation *, so I can achieve function like:so I tried code like this:however, I was disappointed to notice that this function only works whenif I wrote:it says:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'Vector'How can I get the function that works both on 3*Vector([1,2,3]) and Vector([1,2,3])*3?thank you so much.
This is exactly why rmul was designed.
Vector([1,2,3])*3 works because Vector()*3 means "call the __mul__() function of my vector object with an int argument". But 3*Vector([1,2,3]) doesn't work because that tries to call a multiplication function of an int object with a Vector argument: int doesn't know about your Vector class, so it throws an error.You need to define an __rmul__() function on Vector to fix this.
