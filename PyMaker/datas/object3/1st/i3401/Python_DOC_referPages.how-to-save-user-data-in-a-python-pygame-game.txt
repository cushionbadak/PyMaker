I don't mind if the save is readable or not, I don't plan on making this game big, just mainly for friends. I'm fairly new to python/pygame, and all of the tutorials don't really make sense to me. All I want is a way to save game progress, and when they return there progress is there. Anything helps!
You need to save some representation of the game's current state. This can be any format you want -- if you have a game state object, you can serialize and save it using the pickle module, described here. If you have something simple that you could describe in a text file, e.g. something that reads likethen you could just save it in a text file when the user exits, and then load it when they start again.
