I'm trying to write a Python script to extract some tag values from within a table located on this page: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/ I've included a screenshot of the HTML source code, however I can't figure out how to extract the price data for columns 6,7,8 and 9. Below is the code I've already written. I'm ultimately trying to extract out all of the values for each row and save it into a Pandas DataFrame, or a CSV. Thanks.
The table values seem to be embedded in a JSON string that can be gotten with json.loads. Then we can get the value by indicating a "regional" key of country's region. It's a bit more complicated but at least it gets the values that we put into a dataframe as follows:gets 24 dataframes, one for each table from the page:
Pandas can likely handle this on its own with read_html. You can then cleanup data types, etc. within the resulting frame. Returns an array of matches - here's the general idea:Hope that helps!
soup = find_all ('table', {'class':'sd-table'})
