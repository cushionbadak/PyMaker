Natural Text
Here's what I have so far, I think it's complete and I have zero errors other than the fact that the output is just 10,000 (which is way wrong, I've been using 15 years as "t"). I've looked around at similar questions and followed a few of the suggestions but nothing has fixed it. Is there just something silly I'm missing? Thanks!
As mentioned in my comment, your code doesn't capture the actual formula very well. Check the brackets properly. Result: 10120.718840552334
