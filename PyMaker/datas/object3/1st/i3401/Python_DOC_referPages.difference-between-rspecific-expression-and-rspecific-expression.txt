This question already has an answer here:What is the need for caret (^) and dollar symbol ($) in regular expression?                    5 answers                My doubt is that I came across a regex which checks whether a password is strong or not. What is the impact of  ^ and $ in this expression.It has ^ and $ signs in it. But the below code works the same as above. If so why are they been used in the above code. Or is there reason for its usage. Thanks in advance!
The ^ means “beginning of a line” and the $ means “end of a line”.In your case, every match is a line so you don't have any problem.
^ is followed by the string or pattern by which the string will be started with and $ follows the string or pattern by which the string will be ended with. For your case your regex matched with the pattern of the string without regarding the starting or ending portion.
