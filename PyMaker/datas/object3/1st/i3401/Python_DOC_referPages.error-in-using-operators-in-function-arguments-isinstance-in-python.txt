I can't seem to wrap my head around the output of this function:This will output 'Yes', but it shouldn't as 1.4 and 2 are not both integers.Any help?
The way the and operator works in Python is:The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.In Python, None, False, numeric zeros, and empty collections are false; almost everything else is true.1So, 1.4 and 2 means 2, because 1.4 is not zero. So, isinstance(1.4 and 2, int) means isinstance(2, int).And 2 is an int.What you probably wanted here is:â€¦ or:1. To avoid confusion between the specific True and False values and the more abstract idea of true and false values, most Python developers refer to None/False/zero/empty as "falsey" rather than "false", and everything else as "truthy" rather than "true". But the documentation avoids this cutesiness, and I'm quoting from the docs here.
Is the same as The result of an and between two numbers returns the first Falsey value if there are any, else returns the last value in the expression.Some examples:For more information, see Strange use of python's and / or operator.If you want to test both, you have to do them separately:Which is a more wieldy way of writing...with the all function which generalises to more than 2 arguments.Better still, have your function accept a variable number of arguments:Better still, return a boolean result:
