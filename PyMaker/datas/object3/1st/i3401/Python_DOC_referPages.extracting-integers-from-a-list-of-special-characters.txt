Natural Text
I have the following list in pythona = ['[', '1', ',', ' ', '0', ',', ' ', '0', ',', ' ', '0', ',', ' ', '0', ',', ' ', '1', ',', ' ', '0', ',', ' ', '1', ',', ' ', '1', ',', ' ', '0', ']']. I want to extract integers form this, so that I can get a new list  [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0]. I am using python 3.x and I have tried the solution given in the link How to extract numbers from a list of strings? but unfortunately I am getting an empty list []. Can somebody help me?
Use isdigit with a list comprehension:
Someone messed up this data really bad. We have the following:Let's try somethingNow b is '[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]'. This looks like a task for literal_eval:Et voil√†, the list is back: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0].To put everything together:Whoever created this mess of data used a combination of castings to string and list. Check for yourself: print(str(list(str([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]))))
If list comprehensions like andare beyond you, you can use a simpler approach.  Iterate through all items in your source list, try to convert it into an integer, add the result to a list.If errors occure, it is not an integer and you ignore that element and do not add it to the result list:Output:ReadUp:error handlingfilter(function, iterable) - just for completeness sake if you want to look it up.
A more efficient solution:Please read Python List Comprehension Vs. Map. map is faster than list comprehension when dealing with non-lambda functions.
