I have this program which calculates the total for all the values entered by the user:If I entered in the values, 1.2, 1.3, 1.3, the output will be correct and print a result of 3.8. However, it seems when I enter in three floating point values which are all the same, I will get a floating point error. For example, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2 will print out 3.5999999999999996. Why does this seem to happen? Is there a way that I can prevent it? 
It doesn't work because float does a lot more decimal numbers, for more information check this: link, so you should do the below:Output:Or:Output:decimal module:Try this:Output:
That happens because the floating point numbers does not have an exact representation, for more information check this.If precision is critical for you, you can use python decimal.
