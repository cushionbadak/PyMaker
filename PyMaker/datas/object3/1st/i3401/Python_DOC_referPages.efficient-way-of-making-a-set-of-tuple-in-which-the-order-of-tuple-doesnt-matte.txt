I want to make a set of tuples in which the order of tuples shouldn't matter.For eg.- If the tuples I want to add is :It should output like this:Is there any efficient way of doing this in python?
You can apply sorted and then tuple, followed by conversion to set:ExplanationThere are a couple of good reasons why you should not convert each tuple to set as an initial step:Tuples (1, 1, 2) and (1, 2) would become equal after conversion to set.Even in the case where we are considering tuples of length 2, we would be adding an assumption that tuple({(1, 2)}) and tuple({(2, 1)}) are equal. While this may be true, it would be considered an implementation detail, since set is considered to be unordered.Function compositionFunction composition is not native to Python, but if you have access to the 3rd party toolz library you can avoid nested map:
You can sort the tuples:
The other answers all work! I'm just going to post mine here because I'm a beginner and I love to practice. Gives back{(1, 2), (1, 3)}Whether you want to use this or not is up to you! The other answers are much more shorter.
You can use comprehension, too:
