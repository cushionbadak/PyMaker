I am trying to find if a selected country is in a list of tuples by using the following command in my view:if I print second_tier.profile.country I have CAand when I print COUNTRIES I get:So the if statement is supposed to return True, however it comes back as False.
You currently searching for a string in a tuple of tuples. You need to make sure COUNTRIES is all strings to make this work. You can use some simple list comprehensions to transform your nested tuples.Using tuple unpacking:Using indexing:Which takes the first element(country) from each of the tuples and puts them in a list.Then you can do:and it will return True.Alternatively you could just loop over COUNTRIES and match second_tier.profile.country explicitly:You could also use any() here:Which returns True is any match was found. Note: Since your just doing a simple lookup, you could convert the COUNTRIES to a set, which will allow a O(1) lookup instead of a O(N) lookup. I also used _ above to discard values that are not needed, such as the second item for each tuple. 
You have a tuple of tuples, then you need to iterate in COUNTRIES.
