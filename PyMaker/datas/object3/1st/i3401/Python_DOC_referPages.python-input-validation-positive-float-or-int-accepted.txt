Natural Text
seems we are asking a lot, but we are seeking a short validation for positive int or float being entered as input. The code below rejects negative, text and null entries - yay! It accepts int as valid, but why doesn't entry like 1.1 pass? (seemingly a positive numeric entry) We want entry of positive 1 and 1.1 to pass. is there an easy way without two separate blocks, including try/catch?
