I am kind of lost here and can't really find a similar question. Maybe also because I don't know how to search for it.I want to import the names.csv file, which holds a bunch of names in the structure: ID, Name, Gender, Year, State, CountNow I'm trying to transcribe all the names and count integers into a dictionary which I call names. I don't understand why it now continually returns me an empty dictionary.Through the conditionals, I'm trying to say that IF the name is in the dictionary already, it is supposed to sum the count onto the existing count.Can anyone help? Sadly I'm really a newbie and can't help myself...

Better to use defaultdict from standard python lib (for details link) and for working with csv files csv module (link for details)in result you will have:
