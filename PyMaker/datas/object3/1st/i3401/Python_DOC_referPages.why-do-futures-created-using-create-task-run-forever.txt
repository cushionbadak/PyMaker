So, I'm fiddling around with Python's asyncio and I'm creating new futures using loop.create_task(myfunct()). When myfunct() finishes, it returns. Since I created my loop using loop.run_until_complete(..) I'd expect that a thread created by create_task will be destroyed once it's function finished. But when I watch the Python process in Process Explorer I see that the threads are never destroyed. Threads at process start: 7Threads after some work was done (and finished): 25What's going wrong here?
You sayI'd expect that a thread created by create_task will be destroyed once it's function finishedbut create_task doesn't create threads at all. The threads you're seeing have absolutely nothing to do with create_task. Nothing is going wrong here.Most of the threads you're seeing come from the ThreadPoolExecutor used as the default executor for run_in_executor.
