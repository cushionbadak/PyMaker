-This is a Python in general question.I am having topology errors very often, they are very small and i would like to proceed to intersection even though they are there. Is it possible to make an exception for this particular :TopologyException: found non-noded intersection between LINESTRING (229971 4.39944e+06, 229971 4.39944e+06) and LINESTRING (229971 4.39944e+06, 229971 4.39944e+06) at 229971.08857010119 4399438.0928708706 and make it complete the process anyway? I am using Python and Geopandas. Also sometimes in intersection it says:is it possible for any line like this:inte_s=gpd.overlay(data2,asttom,how='intersection') that is causing this Error to create an exception and make it perform the calculation by being unfazed from the error that would show up? What code would do that in this line where the intersection is done?
Yes, you can skip or handle any exception in python using try/except blocks. In your case it would be:
One way you can handle errors in Python is using a try and except statement. Here is a sample piece of code that I use often when testing. You can place the operation that might fail in the try part of the block, and even if it does throw an exception, your whole script will not be broken. The above code is a general form for a try/except statement. If you are looking to catch a specific error, you're looking for something like this SO answer.
