I am a newbie learning python. Please take a look at the below code (From Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich, et al).I know what ValueError is. For example the ValueError occurs if the input is given as characters instead of an integer.On the other hand, I have no idea when EOFError raises.I can't get what 're-raise this exception' meansThe book says, 'the call to input will raise an EOFError if the console input fails.' Again, I have no idea what console input is and when console input fails.I have tried several ways of raising EOFError, but every time I tried there was only ValueError. Can someone give me some idea?Thanks in advance.
You caught the exception, meaning Python will continue with the loop instead of letting the exception percolate up the stack, ultimately ending the program if it remains uncaught. Calling raise without an argument in an except clause simply raises the same exception again, equivalent toRe-raising the exception is necessary if you don't actually handle the exception, instead simply adding additional logging before (possibly) someone else handles it.Triggering the EOFError can be done by runningas all attempts to read from /dev/null look like an attempt to read from the end of a file.
From input's documentation:When EOF is read, EOFError is raised.EOF is sent when the input stream reaches the end, or if it's from the console, it means the user presses ctrl-D on *NIX, or ctrl-Z on Windows.You can catch the EOFError exception and break your while loop as a way to end the program gracefully, so change your exception block to:
If you're looking to raise a The following code will produce a SyntaxError, EOF in Python:print("Where's EOF now?")this is a test to see where the EOF occurs... suspect is that it will be EOF line 4print("Hello world!"I'm not sure if this is what you mean by "raise an error", though.
