You need to use global variables inside your function and initialise cFrom the documentation: What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are  implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within  the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly  declared as global.
As long as the variables are visible from the scope of the function declaration, you can define yourself a function without parameters that can operate on these values:Note that the scope creates an implicit copy of these values, i.e. it is not possible to manipulate the values outside of the function, i.e.will still return 0. A nice read is this article.
