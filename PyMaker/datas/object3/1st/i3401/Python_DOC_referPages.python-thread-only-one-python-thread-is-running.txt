I'm working on the webcam using python and opencv, it seems that it lagged between reading the first one and the second one. So I want to use python thread to fix it. Here is my code:When I run it, I only got the result like: start reading ll donestart reading ll donestart reading ll doneIt seems that the thread t1 is not running. And it never prints "ready to print!".How can I fix it? Thank you a lot!
According to the documentation, the target argument to the Thread constructor is the callable object to be invoked by the run() method. Defaults to None, meaning nothing is called.You are passing webcam0_read(), which is not a callable. You are actually calling the webcam0_read function, which is stuck in its while loop and never returning. The rest of the code isn't even executing.Change your target arguments to webcam0_read and webcam1_read:
