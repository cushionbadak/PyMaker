I am using Pymongo. I have successfully connected to my MongoDB. Collection name is test_collection. In the document, there is a key called request_time . I am trying to fetch the documents in a specific range of request_time. In the mongodb shell, this command works,But, when I am using pymongo. It is not accepting $ and giving syntax error. 
You write commands in Javascript in mongo shell, don't copy-paste them into python.Python is not Javascript.Python does not have neither new nor builtin Date type.find method of the pymongo.collection.Collection class expects dictionary with string keys, put keys in quotes.Use datetime.datetime if respective fields in documents from the mongo collection are ISODates.
Use '$gt' and '$lt' in code.
Try put brasket in each condition({ { $gte: new Date('2018-06-22') }, { $lt: new Date('2018-06-26') } })
