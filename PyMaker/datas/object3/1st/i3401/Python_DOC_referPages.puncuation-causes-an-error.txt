Natural Text
Hello I got a small block of code that when run with the test phrase I get an error when the code hits the punctuation.  I think that the value of word is null but I tried to cast that to a string to prevent getting the error IndexError.  I have stepped through the program and am getting a value for word of '' instead of ' ' and would like to know the difference so I can fix this issue.  The code works with all letters.Sample Input:Wheresoever you go, go with all your heartDesired Output:With all the capitalized words on their own line.WHERESOEVERYOUWITHYOURHEART
'' is a perfectly valid string. You don't need to "cast" it, or anything of the sort.But it's an empty string. So it doesn't have a first character word[0]. If you read the error message:… that's what it's telling you. The problem isn't that you don't have a string, it's that you have a string that isn't big enough to have a first character.What you want to do here is either check for the empty string before asking for its first character:… or handle the IndexError:Normally, in Python, it's more idiomatic to just try something and handle errors (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission, as opposed to Look Before You Leap), but in some cases it's going to be more readable to check first, and I think this is one of those cases.
