In python I can use a template with how can I define a default value in the template?And call the template without any value.EditAnd when I call without parameters get the default value, example
The Template.substitute method takes a mapping argument in addition to keyword arguments. The keyword arguments override the arguments provided by the mapping positional argument, which makes mapping a natural way to implement defaults without needing to subclass:This will also work for safe_substitute:If you are absolutely insistent on passing no arguments to substitute you could subclass Template:And then use it like this:Although I find this to be less explicit and less readable than just passing a mapping with defaults to substitute.
You can create your proxy to Template class and store substitutes there.UPD: edited code to handle dict as first argument. Original api compatibility.
If the default value is the variable name (like in the question), the missing data could be added automatically:
