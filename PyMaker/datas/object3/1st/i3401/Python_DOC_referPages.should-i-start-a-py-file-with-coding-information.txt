This question already has an answer here:Should I use encoding declaration in Python 3?                    2 answers                Can you tell me how I should formalize my .py file.From some sources I've found that all files should start with:Some people on GitHub do this:However, Google for example doesn't use either of these and start files with license information:What is the best and accepted way?
It depends.Python 2 used ASCII as default encoding for source files.Python 3's default is UTF-8.So, if you intend to only support Python 3+ then you don't have to declare the utf-8 encoding as it is already the default.If you intend to support Python 2 as well and you have non-ASCII string literals then you should declare an encoding.If your text editor also needs a coding declaration (e.g., if your Unix locale is set to, say, Latin-1, but your code is UTF-8), Python's lenient syntax allows a single declaration to be used for bothâ€”e.g., # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- is recognized by both emacs and Python.Some official information:Python 3's docs about unicode support: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#python-s-unicode-supportPEP 263 that introduced the encoding declaration syntax: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/PEP 3210 about changing the default encoding from ASCII to UTF-8 starting from Python 3.0: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/
