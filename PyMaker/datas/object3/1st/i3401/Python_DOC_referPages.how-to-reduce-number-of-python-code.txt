How to reduce number of code when element does not already exist in dictionary? Otherwise assign it to the object.Prove of python concept:Is it possible to remove if else statement?
You can read python documentation -> setdefault: It`s more pythonic!!!!
Read up on Documentation before you start asking questions...You want to use this setdefault(key[, default])
You can use dict.setdefault for this:
Maybe see if using defaultdict (from collections) would help?I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but I think this is the same behavior?Unrelated, with the above, I thinkormight be a little more pythonic?
