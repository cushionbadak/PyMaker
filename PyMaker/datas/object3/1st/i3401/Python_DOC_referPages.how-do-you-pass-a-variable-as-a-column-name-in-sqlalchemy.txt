This question already has an answer here:How to give column name dynamically from string variable in sql alchemy filter?                    4 answers                I have recently created a script which allows a user to both filter a table and then sort the remaining columns into ascending and descending order. This is what i wrote: Then repeated this for all of my columns, the issue here is that i have 17 columns ( not all have been used in this example.) So to get ascending and descending sorting working I have 34 batches of code accounting to 900 lines. This is a huge amount of code which will slow down the productivity of my search/sorting feature ( i presume.)    Is there way of using a refined code, where the request.form['desc'] value is saved as a variable, then that variable used to tell the query which column to look at? I assume it would eventually look something similar to the code bellow. But when i run this code i get the error trackback bellow it.  AttributeError: type object 'test_result' has no attribute 'order_column'
Use getattr.order_by(desc(getattr(test_result, request.form['desc'])))
