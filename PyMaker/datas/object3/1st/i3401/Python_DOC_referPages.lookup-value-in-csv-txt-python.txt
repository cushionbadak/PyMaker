In my high_schools.csv file I have this:I want to see if a value exists and then return the zip, latitude, and/or longitudeThis is what I have so far but it's checking for the entire row instead of just the beginning.When I run this it will return as False because it is matching the entire row and not just the first 3 columns.  How could I change it to match the first part and return the entire row or just the zipcode, latitude, longitude?
Using csv module.Demo:Output:
You need to write an if statement, to check the values you pass in:
You can use csv.DictReader() to convert your rows into dictionaries, then you can explicitly check the values you pass in with simple lookups.Code:Output:In Python 3.6,  DictReader() returns a collections.OrderedDict(), so you can just wrap dict() to return a normal dictionary. If this doesn't bother you, you can just leave it as return row, since an OrderedDict() is  just an ordered dictionary. 
You can use pandas module.row here is dataframe like this:You will get the required row and you can return whatever column values you want from it.Saves you writing all the loops.
