So, to make this work with write, you have to do the conversion manually.But you can also just use print instead of calling f.write:Notice that this doesn't do quite the same thing. When you call print, by default, it puts a newline at the end. So, this code:… will print out two separate lines:And likewise, this code:… will add the same two separate lines to the file.
Words has to be converted to string. File.write() is what is actually going to write it.Your new code:
