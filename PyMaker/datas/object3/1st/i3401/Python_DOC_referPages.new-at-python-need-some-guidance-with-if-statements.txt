Q: Code runs but only prints the else statement...   Any help is appreciated.
str() returns '' every time. So fruit is always '' which doesn't satisfy any of the if statements.Also your if statements are off. You can just check if fruit is in favorite_fruits and then print:If you want user input then use input instead of hard coding fruit.
