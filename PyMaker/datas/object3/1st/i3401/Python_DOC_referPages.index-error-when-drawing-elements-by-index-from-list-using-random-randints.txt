This is my code and following is the error what I am getting?IndexError: list index out of range
You are calling one function 1000 times to get 1000 values. For python-3 you can simplify your code by using random.choices(iterable, k=nubmer of elements).One call will give you a list of 1000 random items from your source-iterable:Which gives an output of:You feed it an iterable and a count and get the radomn drawn results (with duplicates) back as list.Timings:vs.which makes using random.choices(...) about 5 times faster.
Function random.randint generates a random number inside the range defined by low and high values, both included: low <= x <= high. Since you set high to len(fruits), and the last list index is actually len(fruits) - 1, you can get a list index out of range error in case random.randint produces the high value.Instead, modify the code by changing the definition of high.
