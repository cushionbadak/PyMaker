I have a directory structurewhere __init__.py is justand baz.pyNow, when I do import foobar, I get access toNice! However, one also hasalthough it's never explicitly imported. I suppose it has been imported along with do_something.Is there a way to make do_something available as foobar.do_something without adding foobar.baz to the namespace? (And without putting everything in in __init__.py.)
This behaviour is documented in chapter 5 of the Python Language Reference. If you really want to disable it, you can do this in __init__.py:which removes baz from foobar's namespace when imported.However, this isn't common practice as far as I know; is there a particular reason you're wanting to do this?
