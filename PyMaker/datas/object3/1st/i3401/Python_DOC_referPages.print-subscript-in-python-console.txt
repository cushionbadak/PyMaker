Natural Text
In Python 3.3, is there any way to make a part of text in a string subscript when printed?e.g. H₂ (H and then a subscript 2)
If all you care about are digits, you can use the str.maketrans() and str.translate() methods:Note that this won't work in Python 2 - see Python 2 maketrans() function doesn't work with Unicode for an explanation of why that's the case, and how to work around it.
The output performed on the console is simple text. If the terminal supports unicode (most do nowadays) you can use unicode's subscripts. (e.g H₂) Namely the subscripts are in the ranges:0x208N for numbers, +, -,  =, (, ) (N goes from 0 to F)0x209N for lettersFor example:For more complex output you must use a markup language (e.g. HTML) or a typesetting language (e.g. LaTeX).
