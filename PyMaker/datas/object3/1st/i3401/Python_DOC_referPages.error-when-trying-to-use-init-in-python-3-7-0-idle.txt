So I was just trying to do same basic Classes stuff in Python.org's Python 3.7.0 IDLE (Shell), and when I tried to run this code:It gave me this error: Doesn't the init function in class Giraffes make Gerald take parameter self?I'm just getting started with Python so sorry if this is a newbie mistake or something.
The constructor method (like other Python magic methods) is called __init__ (two underscores on each side).
