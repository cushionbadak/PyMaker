Natural Text
I'd like to use a memorize decorator on a class method. cExample.pri() calls self.text() but memorize doesn't seem to know about self. When memorize calls self.func(*key) it is missing the cExample obj so it complains about missing args.How can I change this memorize decorator so that it is able to pass the caller's self to the function?Python3.5.2Output:
You need to pass self (i.e. c) to cExample.pri (i.e. self.func). But __missing__ won't allow you to do this: it receives only the key.You can rewrite it using function-based decorator:(I'm using functools.wraps not to lose the original name of decorated method).In this approach self will be passed to wrapper as positional arg and proxied to cExample.pri.
