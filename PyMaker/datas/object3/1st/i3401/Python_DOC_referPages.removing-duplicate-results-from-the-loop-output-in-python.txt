My data from a loop generates a series of strings which are sentences retrieved from a database. However, my data structure in the database needs to have duplicates but I want to omit the duplicates in the output. Assuming my loop and results is as follow:Output:How can I set up a condition so that the program reads all the output generated and if find duplicate results (eg. He goes to school) it will only show one record of to me instead of multiple similar records?

You can use set. Like:Or can use list:Or you can use dict:
Split document by '\n' or read by rows to arr = []. I.e. in for loop store arr += row.lowercase().arr = list(set(arr)) will remove the duplicates.
If the case does not matter, you can take set of the list.
Use built in option SET of python to remove duplicates
