Natural Text
I'm working with a project, in this there will be variable holding any data types just separated with a comma.I need to separate all these things and also need to define which type it is.For e.g:    data="Hello, Hey",123,10.04I used split() function to separate, but it separates the comma even within the string "Hello,Hey"I don't need like this, all i need is, just to separate the values by commas but not by the commas inside the string.I killed my brain, but it is still a problem for me. Because I'm a beginner.Thanks in Advance
I'm struggling to understand your question - it seems you have a string with data inside the string, separated by commas:You can use the shlex module to split it respecting the quotes
You may use the re module like so:
You can use re.findall with regex pattern "[^"]+"|[^,]+:This outputs:
You can use re.split to split on a combination of either a double quote before a comma or a comma followed by a digit
