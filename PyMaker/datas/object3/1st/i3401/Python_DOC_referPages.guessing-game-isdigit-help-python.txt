I created a guessing game that only allows the user to type 4 numbers. My error is "'int' object has no attribute 'isdigit'". I'm trying to make it so when the user types an alphabetical letter it displays an error message saying something like "Type only numbers" and lets the user guess again. Can someone give me suggestions?Thank you!Sorry for my English (Not my first language) 
isdigit can be invoked only for a string and not for an intYou have to check if the given string can be converted into an int by invoking isdigit and then convert into an int
Python encourages the use of EAFP, so you can write this code:When the conversion from the input string to an integer fails, the builtin converter will raise a ValueError. And when you catch one such error, you know it's not a valid integer and can take actions accordingly.
