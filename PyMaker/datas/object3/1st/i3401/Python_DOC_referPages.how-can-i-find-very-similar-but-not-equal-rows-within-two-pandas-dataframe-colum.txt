I'm trying to compare two columns from two different dataframes to get similar values. The values are strings, so they are not just the same, but very similar. How can I get those similar values?The dataframes that I use are like the following:What I would like to get:I need to find those names that are almost the same, in order to find the companies that appear in both dataframes.
You can use regular expressions:Regular expressions (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) can be used to do exactly what you are asking. For example, if you are looking for a company related to 'Regex' such as:You can do the following:[Note that I have converted the DataFrame column Name to a Series and use the .str.contains() method, which can be used to index the appropriate rows from your original DataFrame (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.str.contains.html )]Returnsfor df, and:for df_sortedThe argument for the pd.Series.str.contains() method was '^Regex' which states that for a string to return a True value, it must begin with 'Regex'.I used this regex cheatsheet (https://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html) for the special characters. I'm not an expert on Regex, but plenty of material can be found online, also with the links contained in this answer. Also here (https://regex101.com/) is a regex tester than can be used to test your patterns.
