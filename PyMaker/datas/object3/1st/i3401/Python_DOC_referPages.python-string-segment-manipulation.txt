I have this code so farI need to split the list like I have. Once the list is split I need to add the 1002, 1001, of the split ends into the empty list frames
Use re.sub() to substitute patterns in strings.
Using re.sub with a callable will allow to handle numbers of different sizes.Output
This is what regular expressions are made for.You can use expr.match(some_string) to match the value, or reverse the capturing groups to use it as part of re.sub
You could try a list comprehension
