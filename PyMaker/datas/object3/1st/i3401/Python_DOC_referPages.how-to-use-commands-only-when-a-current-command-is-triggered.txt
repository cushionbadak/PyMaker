This question might be complicated and my brain can't really explain it well so please bare with this crappy explanation, My question, When you trigger a command for example .start it will start let's say a text based game, of course you would have the commands to be able to actually play the game however my concern is people can still trigger the ingame commands without needing to start the game for example .What i'm saying is, is there a way of only being able to use the in-game commands only when the game itself is activated?Additional Question: How would you store a user's information like basically saving the game (You don't really need to answer this as i would like to learn this myself but any tips would be great!)
First, we want some object that stores the state of a particular session.  We can just call this object Game.  We'll maintain a mapping of discord.Users to Games.  A User existing in this mapping means that they are playing the game.  Some basics would look something like:Some things you could do to extend this: make use of checks and CommandErrors to avoid having to repeat the code for checking sessions; make sure that Games are pickleable, and write code for saving games using pickle; write a game that's more fun than collecting rocks.
