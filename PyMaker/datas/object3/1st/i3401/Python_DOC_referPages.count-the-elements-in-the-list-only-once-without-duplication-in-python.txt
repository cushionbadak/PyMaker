Use collections.Counter:For your input you'd get:
You're sooooooo close!Take note that, since you're reporting each word's count only once, you've lost a strong association between each count and the word it represents.  Both set and Counter will lose that ordering.
You forgot to convert the list to a set in your second loop:
you should use from collections import Counterand its output the amount of each word
