I have a list which consists out of two numpy arrays, the first one telling the index of a value and the second containing the belonging value itself. It looks a little like this:A function is now receiving the following input:My goal is to swap the values of x with the values from x_glob based on the given index array from x_glob. This example should result in something like this:I do have a solution using a loop. But I am pretty sure there is a way in python to solve this issue more efficient and elegant. Thank you!
NumPy arrays may be indexed with other arrays, which makes this replacement trivial.All you need to do is index your second array with x_glob[0], and then assign x_glob[1]To see how this works, just look at the result of the indexing:The result is an array containing the two values that we need to replace, which we then replace with another numpy array, x_glob[1], to achieve the desired result.
For a non-numpy solution, you could create a dict mapping the indices from x_glob to the respective values and then use a list comprehension with that dict's get method:Or using map with multiple parameter lists (or without zip using itertools.starmap):
My solution also uses for loop, but it's pretty short and elegant (I think), works in place and is effective as it does not have to iterate through full x array, just through list of globs:
