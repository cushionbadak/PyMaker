Hi I am doing a project with Raspberry Pi. I make a python program which have an endless loop inside. I also make a PHP website which call to that python program, make it run in background by this way:Everything seem okay, but I don't know how to get the status of my python program is running in background or not, and make it available in my website with PHP ?
I guess there is many ways to do that:Try get the logs from terminalYou can throw some logs at your terminal while running your endless python script, and capture it with PHPhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.htmlWrite on files and read with it with php Straight forward, you write in file with python and read with PHPhttp://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-pythonAPI REST On PHP website and python with cURLYou can use cURL inside your python script to comunicate with your endpoints in php and get the needed data.cURL: http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.htmlPHP Api Rest: https://www.codeofaninja.com/2017/02/create-simple-rest-api-in-php.htmlI hope it helps
With shell_exec() PHP will wait to continue your script until the application you're calling exits and will return the output of that application as a string. When your application picks back up the child is already done (or you've hit the PHP time limit).It sounds like you want to start the process and monitor it while it's running. For that look at proc_open() and proc_get_status().
