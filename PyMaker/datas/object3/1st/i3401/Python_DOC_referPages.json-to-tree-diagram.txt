Natural Text
I have a JSON object which is heavily nested. Is there a way in which I could view a hierarchical tree diagram? I went through several resources like Pydot, Plotly etc but nothing could render the JSON in my format.JSON file:More precisely, I'd like to extract the average number of branches per level. Expected results would be:
It's not completely clear what you're trying to do, but the following code counts the number of dicts and lists at each nesting depth. We use collections.deque as a stack to perform a breadth-first search, counting the number of nested containers at each level, storing the counts in a defaultdict of lists, and pushing those containers onto the stack for future processing. When we've finished counting all the objects we compute the mean number of branches at each level.I won't paste your data into this code, since it's about 740 lines long. I refer to that data as data_string, on my machine I simply wrapped your data in triple-quotes, but of course you could save it as a file, and use json.load to load it.output
