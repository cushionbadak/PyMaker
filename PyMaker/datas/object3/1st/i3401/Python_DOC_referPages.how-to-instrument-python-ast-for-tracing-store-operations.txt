My debugger uses AST instrumentation to get notifications for all logical steps of code execution (including steps in expression evaluation).There is one step I'm not able to pin down -- the moment when for-loop is just about to assign new value to the loop variable.Inside For-node the loop variable (or something more complicated) is represented with an expression inside target attribute. This expression has ctx attribute set to ast.Store(). I don't know how to trace the usage of this node.As a special case, I could replace simple loop variables with indexing to locals():This would give me a ctx=ast.Load() node inside the ctx=ast.Store() node and I know how to trace this. Unfortunately this won't scale to more complex targets. How does the interpreter use these ctx=ast.Store() expressions? Can I somehow instrument them directly to get notified when interpreter performs the store operation?
One option is to rewrite the for loop so that the assignment targets a temporary variable and insert your tracing code into the loop body. For example, a loop like this:could be rewritten to this:For this purpose, we implement a NodeTransformer:Which can be used like this:
