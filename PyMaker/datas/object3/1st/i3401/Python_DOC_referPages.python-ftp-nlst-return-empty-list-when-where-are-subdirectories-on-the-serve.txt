My application needs to download all the directories from a remote FTP, I'm testing for the first time the python's ftplib.When I try to list all the directories in the remote FTP with the command ftp.nlst() it return an empty list. I know for sure that the directory is not empty because this command: ftp.retrlines('list') returned an object displaying the names of the subfolders inside the directory.While I was testing I tried other commands like ftp.cwd('/other-dir/') or ftp.pwd(), but none of these seems to work.This is the code that I'm using to display the list of subdirectories:Output:As you can see the list is empty.This is my code for retrlines:Output:This is the output from command-line ftp:
So you see it yourself with ftp (from the behavior I assume it's Windows ftp.exe).dir command, which uses LIST FTP command, returns the folders;ls command, which uses NLST FTP command, does not return the folders.So it's how your FTP server behaves - It does not return folders in NLST.If you need to retrieve folders from your FTP server, you have to use LIST:either use FTP.dir methodor FTP.retrlines('LIST').
