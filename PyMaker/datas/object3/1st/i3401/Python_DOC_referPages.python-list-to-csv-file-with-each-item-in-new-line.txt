I am trying to write a function that takes in a list of strings and writes each String in the list as a separate row in a csv file, but I am not getting any output. Could you please help me understand what I am doing wrong. Here is my code:
You can use delimiter='\n' with csv.writer.writerow (notice, not writerows). In addition, newline='' is not required as an argument to open.
You need to use writerowEx:
If your just writing each string on a seperate line, you can just keep it simple and just write each item with a \n:Which Outputs:You also shouldn't use list as a variable name, since it shadows the builtin function list. 
Why don't you try doing it with pandas instead. It's super easy. :)First, import packageThen, create dataframeThen, export to csv :)Done :) let me know if this one works for you!
You can change the code as follows:The function writer.writerows() takes a list of lists, in our case [['name@domain.com', 'name@domain.com', 'name@domain.com', 'name@domain.com', 'name@domain.com', 'name@domain.com']], where every sub-list inside the original list is treated as a single line of the CSV file.You also should not use reserved keywords like list for variable names. list,dict are functions used to create Lists and Dictionaries respectively. May be in your code it did not throw any error, but for scripts that are larger than the current piece of code in question, the interpreter throws errors for the same and such errors become harder to debug
