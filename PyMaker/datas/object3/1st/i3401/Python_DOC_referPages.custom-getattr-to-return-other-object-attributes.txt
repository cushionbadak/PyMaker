So far, so good. I can call obj.name and get backobj._name`Then I try pickling the object:is a no-go though.How do I do what I want with __getattr__ above (return _<attr> if <attr> is not found without breaking other normal behaviour??
The easiest approach would be to simply protect against infinite recursion and let the default logic handle the rest. It is important to not implicitly return None (which you do in the omitted else-case) and break the default behaviour (which is to raise an AttributeError when an attribute is not found):See also this question and the docs.
