Say we want to serialize B below:If this serialization pattern is terrible and you have alternatives, please let me know. However, at the current stage I'm not sure how to re-assign the superclass's member variables as a's attributes(since a's state might be different than during initial construction). I know I could do something like super(B,b).__dict__ = a.__dict__, but it just doesn't feel right. What is the python-idiomatic way to perform something like this?
Borrowing the dunders from pickle:There are a few other changes here, like not hardcoding the class name in the deserialize() classmethod, serializing to string instead of file (for testing), Using consistent dumps/loads instead of one of each.
