I am scraping a site using selenium in python, I get the desired results when I run the same script on windows, but in ubuntu 16.04 when I run the same script it throws error:can anyone give me an idea why is this error raised?Thanks :) 
This error message......implies that the BadStatusLine was raised as the server responded with a HTTP status code that we don’t understand.exception httplib.BadStatusLine Python2.x/Python3.xexception httplib.BadStatusLine is defined in Python2.x - httplib / Python3.x - http.client module and is subclass of HTTPException which is raised if a server responds with a HTTP status code that we don’t understand.Reasons and SolutionsThere can be many reason behind seeing the httplib.BadStatusLine exception. As per Why am I getting this error in python ? (httplib) some of the pottential reasons and solutions are:You may be trying to use http:// instead of https://The URL string may be containing a trailing newline character. So make sure that your URL are stripped of any leading or trailing special characters.The Web Server may be down and Not Responding.The Server may be closing the connection before sending a valid response.Presence of Content-Length within the http header can also create this exception.If the time interval between two requests are more than he configured time of Keep-Alive timeout=n.An easy solution would be to establish a new connection through conn.connect() before sending each request.
