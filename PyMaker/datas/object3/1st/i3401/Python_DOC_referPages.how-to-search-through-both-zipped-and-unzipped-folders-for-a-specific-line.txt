I'm trying to implement a Python script that takes a folder from the user (can be zipped or unzipped), and search through all the files in the folder to output the specific lines that my regular expression matches. My code below works for regular unzipped folders, but I can't figure out how to do the same with zipped folders that are inputted to function. Below are my code, thanks in advance! The try and except block of my code was my attempt to open the zipped folder and read it. I'm still not very clear with how to open the zipped folder or how it works. Please let me know how I can modify my code to make it work, much appreciated! 
One possibility is first determine what object type folder_name is using zipfile and os.isdir() and whichever one succeeds, get the list of files and proceed. Maybe something like this:
