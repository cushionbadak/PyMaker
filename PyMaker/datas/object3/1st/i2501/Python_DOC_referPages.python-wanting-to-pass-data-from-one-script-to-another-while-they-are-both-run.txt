So I'm making a Discord Bot that posts when a person goes live on Twitch.tv. At the moment I have a Python program that runs the bot and a program that runs a mini server to receive the data from the Twitch server(webhook). I am unsure on how to pass on the data I receive from my server to the discord bot. Both programs have to be running at the same time.DiscordBotWeb server
Are the bot and the mini server running on the same machine? In that case you just make the server writing a file to a location where the bot can access and check periodically.
How about using a Flask server that handles the communication between the 2 programs. You could define custom endpoints that would be able to grab the data as well as send it to the discord script.You can use this structure to construct something that listens for changes and then publishes those to the discord bot. Also hosting this server on heroku is something that you might want to consider
