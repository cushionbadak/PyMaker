This question already has an answer here:Opening A large JSON file in Python                    3 answers                Is there an accepted way to parse large json responses/files in Python?  To be clear I mean:The data cannot be loaded into memory all at once.You know nothing about the data other than that it is legal json.The output format should be something that easily read in chunks(delimited by linebreak or YAMl for example.)This is the classic json problem, i've seen plenty of other posts on this, but they usually revolve around a specific json representation.  The key here is you know nothing about the json.  I know how to build a parser to do this myself, but it really sucks to do.  I'm hoping there's already an accepted Python solution for this.Thanks.
You could try ijson. It provides event-based iterators and would be easier than writing your own from scratch.
