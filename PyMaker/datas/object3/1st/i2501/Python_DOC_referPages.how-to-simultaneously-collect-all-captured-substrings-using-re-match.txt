Natural Text
I'm applying a number of regex patterns to text entries, and I wish for them to be automatically entered into a list.e.g.Is there a way to have answer collect all the captured results?As in answer.extend (result.allgroups()) # does not work, of course
You may use Match.groups():Return a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern. The default argument is used for groups that did not participate in the match; it defaults to None.So, you may modify the code this way:Note you do not need to wrap each single \S with a character class and a \s+ instead of a space will let you match any one or more whitespace (it is considered more readable and fail-safe, especially if you plan to use re.VERBOSE / re.X later to insert comments or formatting whitespace into the pattern).
