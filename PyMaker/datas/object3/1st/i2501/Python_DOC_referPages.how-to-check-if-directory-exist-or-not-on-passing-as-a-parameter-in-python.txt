I am trying to pass the directory as a parameter and checking its existence - Error : Syntax Error in line os.path.exists('pathtodata'DirectoryName):
In Python the way you combine paths is not 'pathtodata'DirectoryName but rather os.path.join(pathtodata, DirectoryName).
You should use os.path.join():Your code should look like:
The os.path.join joins the paths according to your os delimiter and the os.path.exists checks if the path exists.What caused the syntax error earlier was which is invalid python syntax regardless to the context.More details in os.path documentation - https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html
