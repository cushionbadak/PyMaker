Originally, I've learned to specify the source code encoding in Python 2.7 this way:Now I just noticed, that PEP263 also allows this:Is there any differences between these? What about editor compatiblity, cross-platform etc.?What about Python 3? Is this comment still needed for python 3 or is any code in python 3 expected to be utf-8 by default?
Take a look at PEP3120 which changed the default encoding of python source code to be UTF-8For python 3.x one therefore finds in the docs:If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches  the regular expression coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+), this comment is  processed as an encoding declaration [...] The recommended forms of an  encoding expression are:which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, andwhich is recognized by Bram Moolenaarâ€™s VIM.  If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is UTF-8The take home message is therefore:python 3.x does not neccessarily need to have utf-8 specified, since it is the defaultThe way the coding line is written is to some degree personal choice (only a recommendation in the docs), it only has to match the regex. 
Since Python 3 the default encoding is utf-8. You can still change the encoding using the special-formatted comment # -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-.The docs recommend to use this coding expression as it is recognized also by GNU Emacs.As python checks whether the first two lines are matching the regex coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+), # coding=utf-8 works also to ensure utf-8 encoding but it is not recognized by GNU Emacs.
