All I need to do is to create 1 list with all these values without sublists.The result here would be: ['a', 'c', 1, 3, 'f', 7, [4, '4'], {'lalala': 111}].When I add 3rd for it would say that 'int' object is not iterable. Do I need somehow check whether the item is int or string and then skip them? Or am I missing something?P.S. I believe this is done with the recursive functions, but I have no clue about them :(
Here is one example of recursive function that flattens your list : Result is ['a', 'c', 1, 3, 'f', 7, 4, '4', {'lalala': 111}]
Using recursive function. Enjoy!Code:Output:In case you don't want the dictionaries to stay as dictionaries and only want the values. You can use this. But if you want to keep the keys all you need to do is use:Then the output would be:
Using a recursive generator function:
List methodsThe list object offers two different methods to add new items to a given list:list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].list.extend(iterable): Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.ExampleResult
Maybe you are looking for something like this:result:
