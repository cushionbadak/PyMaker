A few pointers:Converting your code to "one line" doesn't make it better.No need to type out all consonants, use the string module and use set for O(1) lookup complexity.Use formatted string literals (Python 3.6+) for more readable and efficient code.No need to use str on variables which are already strings.For a single line, you can use a list comprehension with a ternary statement and ' '.join.Here's a working example:
You may use a list to put all the words or use print() in a different way.Example:where here I use the keyword argument end to set it to '\t' ( by default is '\n')
Simply edited your code to return the results as a words separated by space.
