I have the follow class , that are more attributes .. Every year the population changes and at the end of x years im trying to built o ordered dictionary that will show me which country have the highest population and the least people with diseases... How do I built a dictionary that updates on every year/ turn and give me this info at the end.How can I get information of the stats on the last turn?Let me clarify the question.All i need is at the end of the simulation to have a ordered dictionary.Then be able to pick for example in this case London because of higher number of people with a disease. So thinking through it could almost be a new method that return the city with the higher number of people with the disease.
Would adding a function to the class work?
Not entirely clear how you intend to update the country data, but it sounds like what you need is just to store the country data objects in a dictionary of dictionaries, with a series of database-like functions to query it, like this:If you want you could add these functions and the data dictionary to the class as class methodsThis is convenient because all the functions relating to storage and querying of country data can be stored in the Country class together with any modelling methods you need.
