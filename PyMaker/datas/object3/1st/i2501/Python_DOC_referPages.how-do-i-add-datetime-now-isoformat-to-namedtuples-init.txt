Of course I have tried:But I get exactly the same error as How to provide additional initialization for a subclass of namedtuple?I can't tell if attrs can help me (too difficult to comprehend). dataclasses.dataclass probably can help, but it only supports Python 3.7.Or I could write my Class, probably also with __slots__...Edit:Did you read the answer in the question you linked?works with from collection import namedtuple, but not from typing import NamedTuple.
Python 3.7+ users should just take advantage of either the default_factory or the __post_init__ hook in dataclasses. For users on older Python versions, read on..I think you should be able to do it with an extra layer of types:Arguably, though, you lose some of the benefits of using a NamedTuple in the first place, and may as well just write the subtype yourself.
Quite a beautiful answer, that requires pip install attrs (which inspires dataclass)For the dataclass version, no need to pip, but at least Python 3.6 is needed.
