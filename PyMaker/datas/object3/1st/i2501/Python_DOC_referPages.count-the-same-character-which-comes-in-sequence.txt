I am trying to return the most used x characters in a file format. for example this functions should return [4, 1, 2].For example if string is "xxxxxyxxyxxx' it should return [5, 2, 3]My function does not return the correct list. Any helps would be really appreciated. Thanks
You are not resetting your counter when you encounter a y character, and you should only append to total_char_list if there was at least one x character counted by the time you find a y character (y characters could be duplicated too):Next, when the loop ends and total is not zero, you need to append that value too, or you won't be counting 'x' characters at the end of the sequence:Next, you really want to use a for loop to loop over a sequence. You are given the individual characters that way:You can make this faster with itertools.groupby():groupby() divides up an iterable input (such as a string) into separate iterators per group, where a group is defined as any consecutive value with the same key(value) result. The default key() function just returns the value, so groupby(string) gives you groups of consecutive characters that are the same. char is the repeated character, and sum(1 for _ in group) takes the length of an iterator.You can then make it more generic, and count all groups:The same can be done with a regular expression:
You don't initialize the value of total between the sequences so it keeps on counting. Update (17:00) - fixed the original procedure and I thought of a better solution -
Edited for function format:returns [4,1,2]
