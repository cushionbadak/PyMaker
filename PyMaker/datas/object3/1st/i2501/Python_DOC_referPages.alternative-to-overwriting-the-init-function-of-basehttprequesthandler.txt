I would like to define a few variables inside my RequestHandler class that is a subclass of BaseHTTPRequestHandler. These variables then should be accessible from inside my do_Post() function. Normaly I would define those variables inside the __ init__() method but the python docs about the BaseHTTPRequestHandler classsays "Subclasses should not need to override or extend the __ init__() method."So what would be the most elegant way to achieve this?
Shouldn't need to means you don't have to worry about that method, the library will work without any special attributes set on the instance. However, that doesn't mean you can't.For example, the BaseHTTPRequestHandler class doesn't define a __init__ method itself, but the SimpleHTTPRequestHandler class in the same module is a direct subclass of BaseHTTPRequestHandler which does define an __init__ method.Your code can define one just fine:
