This question already has an answer here:Shuffling a list of objects                    23 answers                I am trying to create a Deck of cards type scenario, which I want to 'shuffle' and then pick a 'card'. The cards are in a list as 'S6' (6 of spades), 'CJ' (Jack of Clubs) and I want a card to be picked from index value 0 (top of the deck), and so would like to be able to move around each value in the list randomly. Side question- Would picking a card by using a randomly generated index number produce a similar result? Coding Newboy here!
Yes. You can use random.shuffle() to mix up a list.If you had a deck with the cards in order you could do something likerandom.shuffle(deck)
As @dawg says, use random.shuffle:The function applies the change in-place, which means it alters the original object passed in and returns None.See here  https://stackoverflow.com/a/976921/9917694
