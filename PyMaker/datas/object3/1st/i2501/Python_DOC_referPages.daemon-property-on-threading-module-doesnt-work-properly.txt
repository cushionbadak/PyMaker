without introduction, i wrote the following script :the script is working fine, here is the output i get:i found in the documentation that deamon property means that the script will be running in the background, so i edited the script into this :but it doesn't keep creating files in the background, it creates only the first one
The daemon property in Python threads is a different kind of "daemon" than the Unix usage. In Unix, daemons are programs that run unassociated with a terminal, or in the background so to speak. In Python, these threads are threads the main thread won't check before exiting, so any thread you make a daemon thread that's still running when the main thread exits will be ended at that time. Threads that aren't daemon threads are waited for by the main thread on exit, and the program won't end until they've all finished.So, in your program, since you aren't synchronizing the exit of your threads explicitly, when they're not daemons, the main thread will automatically wait for them to finish before exiting, and so all the files are created. When they are daemons, they'll be terminated when the main thread exits, and so only the threads that managed to get through creating a file will have files created, and the rest won't.
