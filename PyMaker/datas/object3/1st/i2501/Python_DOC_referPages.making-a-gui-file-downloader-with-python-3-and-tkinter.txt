(I am using python 3.6.6 if that matters to anyone)I am making a GUI installer for a game that is currently in private alpha and is constantly updating. I already made a console version:I will only be using this to download 1 specific link so ignore the url variable.I am trying to make a GUI that does the same thing when I click a button that says 'Download'. I want to make a progress bar, and a text box that tells you what is going on e.g. Downloading, extracting etc. I have no need for a directory option. I just need it to download where ever the file is located and delete the old file if it is still there.So here is my question: How do I learn how to do this? I have looked at tkinter tutorials and other questions but I only find stuff for python 2 or stuff that is to developed to modify and call my own work. What I am looking for are links and/or examples that can tell me how I go about creating something like this. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps me out.P.S. I am a noob when it comes to coding so whatever you explain please do it thoroughly.P.S.S. In order to run the console application you need to run it through terminal and add your own link in the 'url' variable.
Take a look at PySimpleGUI. You can build a layout with a download button, an output window and a progress bar easily.  Stop by the GitHub and post an issue if you run into trouble.
