My database stores some standard address lines fields (address line 1,2.. City, Country, Postal/zip code) and I would like to concatenate them to a human form. I've written the following code but I'm not sure if this is very efficient with a bunch of if statements. (Written in python but it's the algorithm that I care about)What do you guys think? Is there a better way?
Instead of using string concatenation (which creates a new string each time) you could use str.join():
You can use a list comprehension, joined into a string, to get the address in the format you need:As in: https://repl.it/repls/LiveJuniorLanservers
