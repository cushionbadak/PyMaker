I'm trying to make a script that detects whether an executable ran using Popen was able to successfully run or not (maybe if it got blocked by an antivirus or the program itself is broken). Maybe by checking whether the file is memory or not? I'm not quite sure what's the best method for detecting the file in this case and if you have a better suggestion, then by all means don't hesitate to share it.This is my code:I'm trying to figure out what to put in the last "except" part to make this work how I want it to.
Exceptions are used to keep the program running even though an error occurred.This will alert the user that the '*.exe' did not run properly while keeping your code running.
Basically, Try will execute always in the loop and Except only when there is a exception. Now that we need to see the output we can print the exception Using a continue will allow you to execute the rest of the loop. It would look like this : (Bad coding practices ahead)
