i'm trying to add logging to my django project here's my logger configuration:As you can see, I want to log everything to debug.logand log errors on apps (crawler and gui) to apps_errors.logand log info on apps (crawler and gui) to apps_logs.logdebug.log and apps_errors.log are working normally, everything is being logged to debug.log and only errors in my 2 apps, are being logged to apps_errors.log, but when it comes to apps_logs.log i keep getting both errors and info when it should be only infoby the way when i want to log something i'm doing for info i'm doing : logging.info(my_info)for errors i'm doing: logging.exception(my_exception) i also tried logging.error(my_exception)PS: i have tried defining two loggers, one for each handler, but doing that logs only errors using the errors logger/handler, the info one doesn't work
If for some reason you only want INFO messages to show up in a handler's output, but nothing of higher severity, you would need to attach a filter to that handler. This is not a common requirement - though it's common to isolate errors and greater in logs, it's not common to isolate only INFO messages. Using a filter should work:and then assign that filter to your handler dev_logger. Not sure why you've called it dev_logger - perhaps you need to review your understanding of loggers and handlers. The top of the advanced tutorial gives a summary.
