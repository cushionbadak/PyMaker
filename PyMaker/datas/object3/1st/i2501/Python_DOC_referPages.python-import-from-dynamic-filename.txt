I'm in the following situation: I have a python script main.py, that runs some actions depending on a config file. The config file is a python script/class itself. I want to be able to pass different config files from the command line as parameter and import it in the main script.Is it even possible in python to load classes dynamically? If so, how can I accomplish that task?See the following minimal example for clarification.This is my script main.py:This is an example config.py:This is another example config-special.py:I'm calling it like this:
Use import_module to dynamic import modules, detail explain see in the code.Still use your next command to call them.main.py
I use this:You would also likely want to manipulate sys.path if your file is not in the standard PYTHON_PATH hierarchy.I went explicit with all the checks (especially find_spec) because if you just import and try to catch an exception, it is very hard to distinguish if you got the exception because your import failed, or because an import inside the file you imported failed.
I would suggest not using python file as configuration. You could use configparser method like this:config.ini
