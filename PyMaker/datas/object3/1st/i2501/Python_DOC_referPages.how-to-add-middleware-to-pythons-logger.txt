So I'm using Python's logger and it has built in functions like logger.debug() which are very useful. I also have a send email class that I want to run. How can I have SendEmail() run every time I call logger.error()?
This is supported directly in stdlib logging.  Create an SMTPHandler and add it in your logging configuration, configured with level logging.ERROR. There are several logging configuration methods available, documented here.
