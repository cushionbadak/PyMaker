Given a list of positive integers, how can we test if the list contains n consecutive numbers with a difference of 1 and return the result?For example: Testing the following list [10, 19, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 7, 10, 12] with n=4 would return [5, 6, 7, 8], because there one section of this list that contains four consecutive integers with a difference of 1. Testing the following list [5, 2, 12, 10, 11, 12, 14, 95] with n=5 would return False, because there is no section of this list that contains five consecutive integers with a difference of 1.Finally, lets test the following list [8, 10, 50, 10, 11, 12, 8, 9, 40, 41, 42] with n=3 would return [[10, 11, 12], [40, 41, 42]] because we have two sections in the same list that contains three consecutive integers with a difference of 1.
Try reducing your list.
