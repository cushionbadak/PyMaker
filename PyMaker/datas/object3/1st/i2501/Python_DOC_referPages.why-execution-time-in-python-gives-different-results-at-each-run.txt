I have a data frame of one column having positive and negative values. I want to find index position of negative values. I have two methods here and I am trying to find which of the methods is best and fastest. My code is: Output at first execution and Method-2 is faster here: Output at second execution and interestingly both clock same time: Output at fourth execution and surprisingly Method-1 is faster here: Some explanation and help to know which method is faster? 
I would prefer to use np.where:Also don't use time.time use timeit:Output:So np.where wins big time!
There could be other processes consuming resources while you are measuring the time taken for each execution. There could also be garbage collector kicking in at random points skewing up the results. So never use time.time() for comparing performance.Use the timeit.timeit for measuring performance. It repeats the code run several times and measures average time taken for each run, thus providing much more acurate results. It also disables garbage collection during the run.
