The documentation states that the default value of Dialect.delimiter is ','. However, when I try to print, it returns None. Dialect.delimiter A one-character string used to separate fields. It    defaults to ','.
This is default value when you creating your own dialect.
That's the default value when you create a new Dialect. You can get a dialect instance (an inmutable one if you're using Python 3.x) with csv.get_dialect() and register your own using csv.register_dialect. You can also just subclass Dialect and get on with it.The documentation may seem unclear if you just read that line, but a few lines above you can see that:To make it easier to specify the format of input and output records, specific formatting parameters are grouped together into dialects. A dialect is a subclass of the Dialect class having a set of specific methods and a single validate() method.Doing a simple help(csv.Dialect) in the REPL confirms that subclassing is a must when working with this class.
