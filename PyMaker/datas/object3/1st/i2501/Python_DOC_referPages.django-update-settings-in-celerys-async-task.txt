I am using celery to load Neural Network models and would like to store the loaded model in settings for fast prediction.so in django.conf.settings I have:and in celery task, I have the following snippet:However, I noticed that the tasks are running in another thread that launches different Django Environment and any changes in the settings will not be reflected back to the main thread.Is there a workaround for this?EDITThe parameters I am storing in settings are:net: keras Modelsess: Tensorflow Session
Django settings are not the right place for this, obviously. First because the settings object is not a shared resource (there's one instance per process), then because the doc explicitely mentions that this object is to be considered as immutable.If your point is to have a celery task computing those objects so that other tasks and / or the front can use them, you will have to find a way to serialize them and store the serialized version in a shared resource (database, cache, etc).
you can try to use the configparser    import configparserset file config.ini:call dict_from_file the output is:update the file config.ini:call dict_from_file the output is:ypu can read more for the supported-datatypes
