It splits the text on space like this:And loops over each word in this list and adds a tuple which includes the word, the id you passes and 1 to your mapop list like this:After it loops over each word, it returns mapop

I took the liberty of changing the function name.  Here's a suggested use that I think solves your problem.  You can reduce several of the statement blocks to a single line, but I expect the current version is more readable for you.Output (with extra line breaks for readability):
