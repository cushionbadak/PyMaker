I'm working on project based on project built at Arduino microcontroller and Raspberry Pi computer:Arduino measures time from the moment when program loop starts. It stops when the user push button. This score is going to be sent via serial port to specially prepared csv file. The same time update() function is going to take out values from this file and plot live graph and histogram.The problem started, when just one function was executed when the script was running. I've checked some options and decided to try the threading:https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.htmlhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htmHowever it compiles, but not executes properly. I don't ask for ready code or links - just suggestion or some tip would be really helpfull:I got some warning:This [...] TapeError: serial port_() takes 1 positional argument but 11 were given says about 11 records in the csv file - am I right?
The args attribute must be a tuple not a single value. With Python, singleton tuples must have a trailing comma, like (foo,).To fix that, add a trailing comma:
