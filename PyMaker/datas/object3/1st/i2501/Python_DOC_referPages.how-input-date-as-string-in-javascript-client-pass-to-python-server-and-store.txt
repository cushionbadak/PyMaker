I want my users to input date as a string.The date is passed via a Python backend to a MySQL database where it is stored as datetime.What is a way of doing this? To clarify, I am asking what kinds of conversions I should do, where, and using what packages.
Now a lot of things in this domain depends on your use-case but I'll take a shot. I'm guessing you pass your data to the server after JSON.stringifying it? Now we have data on the server. You get everything as json strings, do a json loads and convert them to python strings(unicodes) on your server. From here on, things are easy except for one single problemYou'll have to know the format of your date beforehandWhy?Because you'll have to do a strptime on your date. A simple example of converting a string date to datetime object is -The example can be found just below this. The format table can be found here (which is quite handy, I'd bookmark it)I hope that makes some if not complete sense
