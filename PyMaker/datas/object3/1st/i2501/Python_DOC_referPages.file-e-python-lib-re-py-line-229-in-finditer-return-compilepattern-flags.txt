I am working with the skimage.feature.greycomatrix to calculate the image's GLCM(Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix),   but when I use:in python 3.6.4 shell - it works. See imageBut when I use it in my sublime Text 3, thenit will report an error:(See picture of Sublime Text error)Can anyone tell me why this happens and how I can solve it?My code:enter image description here
You were running Python with the -OO flag, which discards docstrings, replacing them with None. skimage.measure._regionprops includes code that, during initialization, parses the docstring of one function to set the docstrings of a bunch of other functions. This fails when docstrings have been discarded. Running Python without the -OO flag avoids the issue.It looks like similar issues may have been encountered and fixed in other parts of the scikit-image codebase; I see a few places that already check for docstrings being set to None, such as in skimage.io. To make skimage.measure._regionprops compatible with -OO, a similar check for a None docstring would have to be added to that module. _install_properties_docs does a bit more than just docstring handling, though, so we can't just skip the whole thing if we don't have docstrings.
