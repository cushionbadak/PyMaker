Alright so for a living I program ABB industrial robots, and the programming language we use is called Rapid. One really cool thing I can do in Rapid is called a trap routine. And it's like a while loop but instead of looping through the whole loop before it checks a condition it will break literally as soon as the event its waiting for happens. I suppose it is similar to an event listener in javascript. It's like it runs in the background of the normal program. I want to do this in python. I have little formal CS education so I'm not exactly sure what this concept is. Sorry if it's a bit vague I'm not really sure how to ask it in a clear way. 
Like most languages, so does Python handle system signals by using handler functions. For more details, take a look at the Signals chapter which talks about receiving and sending signals, with examples e.g. here.In short, you can bind a function to one or more signals:In your specific case, find out which signal(s) the robot sends to your Python process (or whichever process listens to signals) and then act on them as shown above.
