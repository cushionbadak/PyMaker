Target: Remove '\x' from string.split(), strip(), and replace() all give the same error.Can anyone help me out?
The default string literal in Python considers backslash as an escape character.To interpret backslash literally, use r'my string with \x in it', so try:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literalsWhat exactly do "u" and "r" string flags do, and what are raw string literals?
You need to put an r before the '\x' in replace()  as well as the string. That will tell python that \ should be interpreted as a character and not as an escape character.
