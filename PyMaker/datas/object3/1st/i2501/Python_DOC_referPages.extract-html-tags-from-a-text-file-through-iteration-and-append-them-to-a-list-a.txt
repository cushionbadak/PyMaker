Natural Text
I want to be able to read a html file and extract only the tags out of it. Read one character at a time from the file, ignoring everything to get "<"(ignore "<" as well)Read one character at a time, appending them to a string until ">" or white space(ignore ">" as well) I can iterate through the text files and can get the list as below: [['<', 'h', 't', 'm', 'l', '>', '\n'], ['<', 'b', 'o', 'd', 'y', '>', '\n'], ['<', '/', 'b', 'o', 'd', 'y', '>', '\n'], ['<', '/', 'h', 't', 'm', 'l', '>']]but the expected output should be : [html,body,h1,/h1,/h2,/body,/html]
Simply use regex or a HTMLParser.
