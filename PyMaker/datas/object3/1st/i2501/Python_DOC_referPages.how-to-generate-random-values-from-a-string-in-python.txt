I have a string 'ABCDEF', I would like 4 unique characters to be generated randomly every time I run the program.The result should give something like:I could use random.sample but it would require a list to be used instead, are there ways of achieving the same result using a string?
You can indeed use random.sample; it'll give you a list, but it's easy enough to join the resulting list into a string:
You can use the functions provided by Python's random module.Use random.sample to extract a random set of characters from the string and then join them:
You can do this using random then join your resulting list with '' to create a string:For input, you can use a string as in Python a string is also a list (list of characters) 
There are 3 solutions (and probably 100 more):The"classic" for method appending everyone of the N=4 letters to the same string and the choice method of the random module that picks one element among its arguments,Using the join method to add in one time the elements generated by the choices method of the random module. The choices method is very versatile and can be used with several arguments (official documentation),Using the join method to add in one time the elements generated by the sample method of the random module. The sample(set,num)method picks randomly num elements in set.Method1Method2Method3
