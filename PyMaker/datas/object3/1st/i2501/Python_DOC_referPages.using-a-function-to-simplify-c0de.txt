Simplify the following code using a function.from https://guidebookstgc.snagfilms.com/9151_ComputerScience.pdf page 102I honestly don't know what I'm expected to do.Can someone point out the seemingly obvious?
This seems like a homework question, but as an example:Then you would call it as:This takes the logic you were performing repetitively and condenses it to one function so you only have to change it in one spot if say you wanted to make the increase a percent you would only modify one function instead of all 3 instances in your original code. 
Here's an example of writing a function to handle your user inputs. In fact, it handles all of them in one function.Here we've taken out all the parts that are the same between the original lines (including parts of the prompt string!) and put them into a new function. There is very little redundancy left here. 
You need to look for patterns.  Things that are repeated in your code consistently.  Don't look at specific variable names, but their relative position in the code and how they are used.One of the areas I would look to simply here is the if - else statements.
You could also simplify the logic by using predefined functions and replacing the conditions with them:This a valid replacement for your if's - max() is a built-in: max(...)Its not as explicit as @hgoscenski answer, but would be a valid simplification using functions.
The point of this exercise is to look for repeated patterns and abstract them in its own function. Check this block: ,this block:and this block:Do you think there is a pattern that can be abstracted in a function?
