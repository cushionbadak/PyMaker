I have a list of tuples:and I want to sum the right-side of tuples where the left-side is equal, and to put it in another tuples-list, so for the above list i'll get:I tried this:but from k=1 it just loop one time less for every k because of the else condition.thank you
yet another way,
If your tuples are guaranteed to come in order like this—all the (0, x), then all the (1, x), etc.—you can use groupby:If they aren't, but you can sort them (you have a list, not just an arbitrary iterable, and it isn't so huge that log-linear time will be too expensive):If you can't sort them, you can manually build up the totals as you go:
Another approach is using a defaultdict (from collections) and to iterate the list of tuples.
I'd recommend using a library with a groupby function. pandas, for instance, can be useful
