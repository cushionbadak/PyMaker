I'm trying to randomly reorder an Array using my scramble function:The issue that I'm facing is that my_choice variable is always containing None. Can anyone please point out what I'm missing?
The issue with the above code is in the line while not my_choice:. Remember, that my_choice variable can contain both 0 and None (both of those values are falsy).       So, I'd recommend changing your code to something like this (if you don't want to use random.shuffle):        Also, do container[i] = arr[my_choice] instead of container[my_choice] = arr[my_choice]
The problem occurs because you are setting indexes[my_choice] to be None, as result at some point all elements in the indexes list is None, and the while loop becomes never ending.To scramble the list you can  use random.shuffle function from standard library:
