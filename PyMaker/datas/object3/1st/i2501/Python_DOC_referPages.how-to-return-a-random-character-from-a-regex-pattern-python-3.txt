I would like to know if its somehow possible to return a single random character from a regex pattern, written in short term.So here is my case..I have created some Regex patterns contained in an Enum:I want for these to be returned as a string containing all the characters that the regex expresses, based on this method below:I have tried several thing, but the only option I find possible is using an Enum containing long regex patterns, or strings like in the below example:... And so on with the other variables in use.Any suggestions or solutions to this scenario?--EDIT--Mad Physicist brought the solution for my issue - Thanks a lot!Here is the working code:
The string module has all the definitions you want.Instead of RegexExpression.LOWERCASE use string.ascii_lowercaseInstead of RegexExpression.UPPERCASE use string.ascii_uppercaseInstead of RegexExpression.DIGIT use string.digitsRegexExpression.SYMBOLS is probably closest to string.punctuationRegEx is not really suitable for this task. Expressions are used for checking if a character belongs to a class. I'm not aware of a good method to check the spec of a character class without getting into source code/implementation details.
There's a recipe in the secrets module of the manual that may be a better approach:https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/secrets.html#recipes-and-best-practices
If you 100% insist on using regex, you need a function to convert arbitrary character classes into strings. I'm sure there's an easier way to do this, but here is a general purpose routine:Now you can just apply this function to your enum values to get the string of available characters.Here is an IDEOne Link to demo the results: https://ideone.com/Rh4xKI. Notice that the regex for LOWERCASE and UPPERCASE need to be surrounded by square brackets or they will be literal three-character strings, not character classes.
