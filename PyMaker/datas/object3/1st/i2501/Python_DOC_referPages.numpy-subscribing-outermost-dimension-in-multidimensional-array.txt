I am working with multiple multidimensional arrays. Let us consider dummy example for simplicity:I need to subscribe the outermost dimension of each array in the list. For example, my goal is to set some of the elements to zero according to a specified range in the outermost dimension:In my real application I don't know how many arrays I have and how many dimensions are in there.I would like to do the task in a for loop:But I am struggling how to implement this if I don't know the dimensionality of each array.
Use the Ellipsis to select all dimensions except the last (if there's only 1, nothing is selected).
