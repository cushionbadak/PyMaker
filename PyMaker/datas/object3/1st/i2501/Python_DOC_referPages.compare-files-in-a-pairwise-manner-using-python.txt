I am trying to compare the contents of two files in the same directory for matching lines. I want to eventually do this in a pairwise manner. Right now, I have written some code which will keep the first file in the directory open and compare it to the rest of the files in that directory. What I am having trouble implementing is to repeat the logic with the second file in the directory, then the third, etc..I am new to Python and am just using the knowledge I've gained so far to execute this code. I'm thinking of adding another counter for the first file. This way once the files have been compared to the first file, the file1counter then has one added to it, so that now file1read is opening file1read[1] and repeating.
You can use itertools.combinations for getting all the unique pairs of files in the directory and a set to determine similarities between files as done in this solution. Also the glob package has better functionality than os.listdir as it lists proper paths to files in the given directory:
