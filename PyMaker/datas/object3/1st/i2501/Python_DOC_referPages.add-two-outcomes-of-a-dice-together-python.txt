I'm an absolute beginner to python but I really want to challenge myself. I want to create a game where a dice is rolled for each player (for now, two players) 2 times. The outcomes of the dice is added and if its even 10 points are added and if its odd, 5 points are subtracted. The players can play up to 5 rounds. So far, I've kept the code within a while loop and imported random to "roll" the dice but I don't know how to add the random outcomes together. My code might be completely wrong but I would love some help and advice regarding how to fix it (this is done on python 3)My code:
You may directly get the sum using random.choices().or directly check:
As stated, you need to call random.randint() to generate random numbers inside the loop. For keeping count of number of rounds, use another variable. Try this :
you should pay attention to where you created the random number. In your code it is out of the loop meaning through out the whole session you would only produce one random number. I presumed you wanted to use two dies as well so that would mean you need another number variable. 
Here you go with number of dice and number of players:
