This is a section of an exemplar code that my teacher gave me. Can anyone explain how the variable "day_num" is used for this loop when it has not been previously defined. I have tried printing it out in the loop and it increases by 1 every time the loop runs. Any help appreciated, thanks.
Python variables don't have to be declared; the first time you assign to one, it's created.And almost anything that assigns a value to a name counts as an assignment, not just actual = statements. That includes:name = …while (name := …) > 0:for name in …:import namewith … as name:def func(name):… and so on.Each of these assigns a value to name in the current scope (except for the last one, which only assigns a value in the scope of the function body). It doesn't matter whether name was a variable before that statement or not; it is one now.If it isn't clear where any assignment is happening, your for loop is equivalent to this while loop:Now it's obvious that, as long as the iterable is not empty, day_num is going to be assigned to.
You are declaring day_num in the loop. Basically the loop is telling the interpreter that you want to iterate over something and want to give each iteration a name, in this case day_num. The iterable you are providing in this case is a range from 1-8, but you could just as easily pass it a list. In that case you would be calling each element of the list day_num, as an example. Every time you run through the loop, it updates the value stored in day_num.
