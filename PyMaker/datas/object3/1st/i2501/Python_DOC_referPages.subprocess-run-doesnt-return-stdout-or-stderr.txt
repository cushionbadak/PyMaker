Natural Text
I tried using subprocess.run as described in this answer, but it doesn't return anything for stdout or stderr:I also tried using capture_output=True but I got an exception __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output', even though it is described in the documentation.
I had made a mistake, I hadn't added stdout=subprocess.PIPE:Now it's working.
