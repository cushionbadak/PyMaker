to create a fullscreen window in Python through Tkinter i do this:And it works, of course.But I'd like to know why it is like this.Why am I typing "%dx%d+0+0"? What does Python read in that command?
w, h = window.winfo_screenwidth(), window.winfo_screenheight()w, and h are now holding the value of the screen height and width, say 1280, and 920window.geometry("%dx%d+0+0" % (w, h))Then it is a straightforward python string formatting (the old fashion way):window.geometry("1280x920+0+0")which is a string that tkinter can parse.
