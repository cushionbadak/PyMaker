I have made a function that reverses the singly linked list using Recursive method.However I am having some difficulty executing my below code:What should I pass the second argument in reverseRecursive function/method so that I can execute it?As a second argument, I want to simply pass the head node of a linked list. But I don't know how to get the head node from the init method of  the class linked_list I have tried several things but I'm not able to resolve it. Maybe I am not very good at OOP concepts. Can anyone please help me in resolving this?
The linked list is a recursive structure, and so using it with functional style will yield the best results. In your program, you have implemented a linked list using procedural style and mutable nodes – you change the values of data and next over time. While this might feel like an intuitive approach, I'd like to focus on an immutable discipline that frees us from crippling state complexity.First, we fix the node constructor function. We set both properties when constructing new nodes because they will not change later in the program –Then a linked_list is just a single node constructed by a particular convention:node.data hold's the node's datanode.next is either:another linked_listor, None, representing the end of the listWe begin with the constructor for linked_list –And implement is_empty, head, and tail properties to abstract away node –Now the use of a node is completely abstracted, and we can write higher level list behaviors by using our new properties –Above, we see it's very easy to talk about our list through use of its properties. Before we go further, let's see how we can construct lists and visualize them using print. For object-to-string conversion, we use __str__ –Remember, because we've built an immutable linked list, add does not change the list it was called upon –Finally, we can implement reverse –Reversing the list does not mutate it
