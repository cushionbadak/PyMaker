This question already has an answer here:Python: calling 'list' on a map object twice                    1 answer                Python iterator is empty after performing some action on it                    1 answer                list_of_input = map(float,[1,2,3])print(list(list_of_input)[0])print(list(list_of_input)[0])IndexError: list index out of rangeWhy does this error occur?
The conversion of a map to list is done only once, meaning map is a generator object and once you transform it to list, it gets exhausted : python 3: generator for map. So the error comes from second print statement and not the first. 
in Python 3 map() returns an iterator not a list. When you pass this iterator to list the first time it consumes the iterator so the second time you get an empty list, hence the IndexError.
