I have a package structure as:In the parent __init__.py I have:However, when I tried to reuse the import in its child, division does not take effect. In module's __init__.py:
You are misunderstanding how the __future__ module works. __future__ is a special module that is built into the python interpreter and changes how the interpreter parses and/or executes your code. In order for a __future__ import to have the desired effect, it must be of the form(See PEP 236 for the exact specification.)However, in addition to the __future__ module that's built into the interpreter, __future__ also a real module in the standard library! The import from __future__ import divison actually does two things: It enables the new division behavior, and it imports the feature specification from the real __future__ module. This is what you'll see if you take a look at the value of division after the import:When you do from parent_package.__init__ import division, you're simply importing this variable. But you're not enabling the new division behavior.
