I am at my beginning journey of learning python and I am struggling to get my head around transforming entries in a code.I have a for loop going and for every loop I create 4 variables. So below is the result of four loops.Expected result:So I thought this would work, what I need is that none of this variables to be greater than 50 or below 0. If they are below zero they must become 0 and if they are above 50 then 50, else just the variable itself:I also thought about defining a function and passing the 4 variables each time to the function..Ok i edit the if , sorry typo. Let be a bit more clear on every run A,B,C and D must be transformed if they are above 50 or below zero, so just use a 0    
A = A doesn't do anything so it is not needed.There is an issue in that you mix the comparisons of B in with A, because of the elif. You should separate them:In the end you could just write a reusable function:And use it with:
Can be simplified to:.....Saying A=A is redundant
