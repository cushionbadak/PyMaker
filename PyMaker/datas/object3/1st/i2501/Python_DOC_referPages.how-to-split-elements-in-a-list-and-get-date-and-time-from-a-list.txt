Since the beginning of time I have been struggling with importing files in Python  and reading lines in a optimal way.For example, a file I have is as follows:Now I want to extract the date and time from the first line; for this we want it in this format I think, to make it work in the datetime moduleThis is what I haveThis gives us the first element of the list. Now I want to make a comma separated list out of this. Now when I try this for example:I get a list of lists, which does not make things easier in any way. And we haven't even split the whitespaces yet. What is the best way to get the date and time out of this? And more in general, do you know any good tutorials to practice list/string splitting, iterate over text files/lists etc. 
To get the date and time (or rather the datetime) from your input, it's easiest to use strptime.Output:You don't even have to bother with the exact amount of spaces in the "format" string.You can then convert/format the datetime object as needed.
I suppose that you want this:prints:split the tokens according to 1-n blanks, then join the 3 first tokens to get the date, and get last element to get the time.Python 3 allows star unpacking so you can directly do this:(datetoks contains all the tokens but the last one thanks to *)
Split the line by spaces .split(" ") and Extract year, month and day from the first 3 strings. Now, the last string has  the time, split it with : i.e .split(":") to  extract hours, minutes and seconds.
why not just read in every line one by one and just append each line to a list?this would read every line in the file separate then add each line to a comma separated listis this what your looking for?output would look like this thats from 3 lines in the file but I just used the same entry if you had 3 different entries in the file it would put the different ones into the listI don't think anyone here actually knows what you want if you could put up the end result you are looking for that would help everyone out a lot and get you an answer a lot faster
