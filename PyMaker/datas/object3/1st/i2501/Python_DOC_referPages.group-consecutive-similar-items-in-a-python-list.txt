I have a list containing different data types, say numbers and strings:Let's say I want to find all consecutive strings in the the list, and group them together:How can I do this
This is a wonderful opportunity to use groupby:which produces the desired:
Iterate through each element in the list, if it is of type str, append it to one_d_array, otherwise, append one_d_array to two_d_array, provided one_d_array is not empty. Reset one_d_array whenever the element is not of type str
Without using any import, you can do it through a good old "for loop" iterating over the elements of the lists. Here is a code working also for any type you want, not only string:
