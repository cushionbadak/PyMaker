I have a module called mymodule.The module has a method sayHello()So this works:Now I want to use the methods (all of them) from mymodule for a class.So I can do in another class:How can I achieve this in python?atm I can only achieve this by using an extra attribute which I don't want
I think this is relatively bad design, and recommend you find a different way of expressing what you want to do.  That said, using the __init_subclass__ method of a parent class makes this pretty easy: we just loop though the directory of the module and assign all the attributes to identical attributes on the class.This doesn't actually require that module be a module either: it should work on just about any target.
You can literally import stuff right inside the class definition:You may want to take a look at how this can be used in a real-world project here. I'm not saying this is the best method (I actually find it relatively ugly), but it works fine.
