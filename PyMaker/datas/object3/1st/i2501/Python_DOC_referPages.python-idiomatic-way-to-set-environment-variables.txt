I am trying to import a module from a particular directory. The problem is that if I use sys.path.append(mod_directory) to append the path and then open the python interpreter, the directory mod_directory gets added to the end of the list sys.path. If I export the PYTHONPATH variable before opening the python interpreter, the  directory gets added to the start of the list. In the latter case I can import the module but in the former, I cannot.Can somebody explain why this is happening and give me a solution to add the mod_directory to the start, inside a python script ?
This is working as documented.  Any paths specified in PYTHONPATH are documented as normally coming after the working directory but before the standard interpreter-supplied paths.  sys.path.append() appends to the existing path.  See here and here.  If you want a particular directory to come first, simply insert it at the head of sys.path:That said, there are usually better ways to manage imports than either using PYTHONPATH or manipulating sys.path directly.  See, for example, the answers to this question.
You could use:
As to me, i need to caffe to my python path. I can add it's path to the file  /home/xy/.bashrc by add export PYTHONPATH=/home/xy/caffe-master/python:$PYTHONPATH.to my /home/xy/.bashrc file.But when I use pycharm, the path is still not in.So I can add path to PYTHONPATH variable, by run -> edit Configuration.
Temporarily changing dirs works well for importing:
When running a Python script from Powershell under Windows, this should work:
