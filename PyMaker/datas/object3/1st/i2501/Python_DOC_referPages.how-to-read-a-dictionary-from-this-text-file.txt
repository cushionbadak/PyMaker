Natural Text
I am still new to python and I am playing around with saving data to text files. My problem is that when I try to access a dictionary it comes up with this error TypeError: string indices must be integers but I don't know how to convert them.This is what's inside my file:This is my code:If there is a more efficient way of storing the data?
Well since your question asks for "a more efficient way of storing the data" I'm going to say yes!https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.htmlShelve is a great tool to store dictionaries persistently and change / edit the dictionary whenever.  I'm currently using it for a discord bot project I'm working on and so far it's been great.Here is some usage tips to get your started (pulled directly from the page I linked).
I'd suggest using JSON to write the data out to a text filehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlYou can use the json.dumps method to create JSON data that can be written to a file and use the json.loads method to convert the text from the file back in to a dictionary
