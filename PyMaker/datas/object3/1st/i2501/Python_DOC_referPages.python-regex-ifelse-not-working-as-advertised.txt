This question already has an answer here:Checking whole string with a regex                    5 answers                I'm trying to educate myself on how the if|else pattern matching works in python and so created the following test from the documentation. As near as I can tell it's not working per documentation but I've learned to assume I missed a critical step somewhere.In this test case the third item should fail because it's missing its closing '>'.Relevant:(?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern)Will try to match with yes-pattern  if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it  doesnâ€™t. no-pattern is optional and can be omitted. For example,  (<)?(\w+@\w+(?:\.\w+)+)(?(1)>|$) is a poor email matching pattern,  which will match with '<user@host.com>' as well as 'user@host.com',  but not with '<user@host.com' nor 'user@host.com>'.So my question is, what step did I miss? Tried on different python versions and hosts/os.
You're using search, asking whether the string contains a match for your regex, rather than asking whether it is a match. <user@host.com contains a match, specifically user@host.com.Use fullmatch rather than search.
