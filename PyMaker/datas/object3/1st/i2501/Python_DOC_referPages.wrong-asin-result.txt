My code:My x was 0.7071067811865475, and the result was some irracional number between 0 and 1, but in my knowledge it should have been around 45
You're converting the wrong number with the wrong function.That is, given x (which is the sine of an angle) call asin to compute the angle (in radians), and then use degrees to convert that angle to degrees.
math.radians converts to radians, you want math.degrees.It's also in the wrong place, you're converting a number, not an angle. You want https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#angular-conversion
