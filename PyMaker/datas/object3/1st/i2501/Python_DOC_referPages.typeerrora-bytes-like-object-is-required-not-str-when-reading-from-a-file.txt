I am trying to use the dataset from file to implement my project in MLAfter this I am getting error in this lineauthors = pickle.load(authors_file_handler)
You need to open the file in binary reading mode:From the pickle.load() docs:The argument file must have two methods, a read() method that takes an  integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no arguments.  Both methods should return bytes. Thus file can be an on-disk file  opened for binary reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any other custom  object that meets this interface.
