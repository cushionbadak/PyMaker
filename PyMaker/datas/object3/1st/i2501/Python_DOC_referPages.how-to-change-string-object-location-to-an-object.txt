I need to convert string object location to an object. My code is:I saved the object a in a Dog.txt file <__main__.Dog object at 0x0000024E1C7AFE80> and now i want to take that string and convert it to an object so I can use the bark method with it.How can I do this
you can use PyYAML:and dump and load data from yaml files:now dump you object to the yaml:inside the data.yml you will see:and now load:
You cannot recover an object from its string representation. You should instead serialize the object before dumping it to the file. You can use pickle for this
Both Bear Brown and Sunitha fail to mention that the loading they propose to docan be unsafe. For PyYAML this is clearly indicated at the start of thetutorial:Warning: It is not safe to call yaml.load with any data received    from an untrusted source! yaml.load is as powerful as pickle.load    and so may call any Python functionPickle has a similar warning:Warning The pickle module is not secure against erroneous or    maliciously constructed data. Never unpickle data received from an    untrusted or unauthenticated sourceAt least using YAML, it is not necessary to run any risks now or in the future.First do:Then:which gives:Notes:The "official" FAQ on yaml.org asks to use .yaml as the fileextension for files containing YAML.You can uncomment the "yaml_tag =" line, to use a different tag in YAML document than the default (i.e. your class name)Not only is this safe, it also doesn't have __main__ in the YAML file, which is essential if you ever decide to move the class definition to a different file.Although not as fast as using pickle, the above is much (~10x) faster than the solution Bear Brown proposes. That might be relevant if you have 101 Dalmatians to dump and load.It is not noticeable in your example data, but the above loads/dumps YAML according to the YAML 1.2 specification (published 2009) and also supports the long outdated YAML 1.1 specification. PyYAML has never been updated and still only supports YAML 1.1.(Disclaimer: I am the author of ruamel.yaml)
