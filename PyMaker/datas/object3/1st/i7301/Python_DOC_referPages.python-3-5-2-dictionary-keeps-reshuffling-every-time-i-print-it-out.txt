I'm trying to put file's contents in a dictionary. Even though file itself remains unchanged, the dictionary I get in the end is always different.One time it's something like this:And another exact same list but shuffled.What am I doing wrong?
It's not that it's reshuffling - it's that the order is non-deterministic to begin with.Why is dictionary ordering non-deterministic?There is a subclass to handle this - OrderedDict in collections.
Have a look a the Python manual:https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html5.4. SetsPython also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.You may consider sorting dictionary keys.
