i have written a code to assert in below code:when i ran(windows 10, python 3.6.1) the above code using command prompt : assertion is working properly. But when i run using sublime O/P -someone guide me please
I tried and I got the same assertion error as it is supposed to.You might be running a different version.python shell and python idle would be in different version.
Seems that you are using PyCharm not Sublime. I never work with PyCharm but your problem should be that you are running "PycharmProjects/ppp/loop.py" project with an configuration that turns on PYTHONOPTIMIZE environment variable. This mode turns any assert statement into a null operation and wont be evaluated.You should check run/debug configurations in your IDE.
