Natural Text
The script runs for the number of accounts that are present in the accounts.txt file. I want to run the script x number of times, no matter how many accounts are present in the accounts.txt file. So I just enter an input 10 and the script should run the for loop for only 10 times. Below is my code. Can someone please help me as to how to fix the for loop or add a new parent for the for loop?
this should work:
Put the reading thing in a function :
Another way to solve this problem is to use itertools.islice() which allows you to pick exactly as many values from an iterator (e.g a file pointer) that you want:Here, in addition, I have used the with open... construction to open the file to read. The benefit of doing this, is that the file will automatically close when reaching the end of the with block.
