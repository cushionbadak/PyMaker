Got a problem with encoding process. The error is : binary = bin(int(binascii.hexlify(message), 16))  TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'I'm trying to type only ascii in a program.  What is causing the error?
You need to encode the string, either in your function or before you pass it to your function:The reason is, that hexlify expects a data type that supports the buffer interface. A bytes-like object does, a str does not.See also the note on the binascii docs:a2b_* functions accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters. Other functions only accept bytes-like objects (such as bytes, bytearray and other objects that support the buffer protocol).
