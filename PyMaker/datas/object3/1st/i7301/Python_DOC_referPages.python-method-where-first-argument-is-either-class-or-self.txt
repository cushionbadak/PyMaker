I want to write some Python code that when called from the context of a type behaves like an @classmethod, however when called on an instance of an object the first argument is behaves as normal, with self referencing the current instance. I.e. I want to write:
I once wrote a code snippet in daniweb about this
After some research I managed to do this. The first thing I found is that you can actually implement @classmethod in pure Python, as referenced in the documentation.With that knowledge it's fairly simple to adapt the code to test if obj exists: All we have to do over and above the example in the documentation is check if obj is None and favour obj over klass if it is not.
