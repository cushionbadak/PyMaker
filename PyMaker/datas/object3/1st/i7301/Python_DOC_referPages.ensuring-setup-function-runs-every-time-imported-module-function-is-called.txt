I am importing a module with a few functions which connect to a database. I call functions from that module like so:main.py:data_source.py:Every function established a database connection. I am trying to reduce code duplication so I can have a function which connects to the DB like so:in data_source.py:but i would have to call connect_to_db() from every function. Is there a way to ensure if a function from an imported module is called another function runs by default? so I dont have to have connect_to_db as the top like in every function within data_source.py? and so the connection isn't made for every single call? I know it wouldnt hurt the performance for my purposes but I am just curious. I know I can pass the connection back to the caller after the first call and then for the subsequent call(s) I can pass the connection to the function in the imported module but that is something I want to avoid doing.like when you do python main.py everything under if __name__ == "main": is run is there perhaps something likeif __function_is_being_called__:?
You can use a decorator to first call connect_to_db, then call the function as normal:You can also make it pass a database argument to avoid global variables:
I don't know how you define your data_source.py, but its globals are more than enough as long as you immediately execute your function that sets up the stage for all the other functions, e.g.:And now if you import it anywhere:Here's a simple setup with an in-memory SQLite instance:And when you want to use it:
