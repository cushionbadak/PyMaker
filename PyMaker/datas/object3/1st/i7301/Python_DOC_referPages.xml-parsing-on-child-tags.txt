Below is the sample of my XML. There are many such similar cases.My requirement:Pass through the xml logs, note the tests, test cases and the test case status. If status is failed, then display for which test case and test suite its failed along with other relevant messages. Issue i'm facing: I'm iterating over the test, collecting all the sub tests status and status. In the below code, if tc#2 is failed, output is giving for tc1 as I'm iterating for tc1 by collecting all the status which is in list. So the output is getting repeated.My desired output(Only for status="FAIL")Test Name: Login checkTest case: Invalid username & PasswordStatus: FailMessages: Return errorBelow is my code:
Don't know if I understood right... however, try with a recursive function like this:Hope this helpsByeDave
I recommend using XPath expressions:Note: In my example, I am only working with a single suite element, so I refer to it as root - In your implementation you will want to iterate through all suite elements, thus root will differ, e.g. the line tests = root.findall('.//tc') would become tests = s.findall('.//tc'). I have commented out the lines I think you would use.Output:Additionally, there is also XPath information within Python's xml.etree.ElementTree documentation.
