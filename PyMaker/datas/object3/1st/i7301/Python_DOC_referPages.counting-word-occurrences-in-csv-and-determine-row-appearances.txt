Natural Text
I have a csv file such as the following in one column.  The symbols and numbers are only to show that the file does not just contain text.  I have two objectives:count the number of occurrences of a word;determine how many rows a word appears in.Ideally, the code should return something like:{apples:  3}{# of rows: 2}I've written some code to try and count occurrences, but it isn't running properly (assumedly because of the punctuation).  Also, I do not know how to determine the number of rows a word appears in; this could be as simple as counting the number of unique occurrences in each row, but I'm unsure of how to proceed.  Here is the code I have so far, done in Python 3.6.1:The code merely returns 0 as the answer.  Help?
You are comparing if the row == 'apple, what you need is if 'apple' in row. And to count the occurrences you can use str.count(), for example:This way you will check if the row contains apples then you increment rows by one and increment ctr by number of apples in that row.

I don't know why you are using the csv reader, since you are not using any csv file.here is a code that will do what you need using less  code.Here is the code running:https://repl.it/JkVn/1
