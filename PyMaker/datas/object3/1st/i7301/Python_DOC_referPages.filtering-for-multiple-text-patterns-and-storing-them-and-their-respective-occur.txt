I'm new to python and to stackoverflow itself, it's my first post here.I'm working with a log file that looks like this:Feb  1 00:00:02 bridge kernel: INBOUND TCP: IN=br0 PHYSIN=eth0 OUT=br0 PHYSOUT=eth1 SRC=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX DST=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX LEN=40 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=110 ID=12973 PROTO=TCP SPT=220 DPT=6129 WINDOW=16384 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0I need to search for everything between the colons. In this line the pattern matched would be  INBOUND TCP, but there are other types of patterns.I have to search that field, store all unique type and how many times they occured in the file.I already know how to open the file and use re.compile to parse it and i managed to save the unique results in another text file.Reading the documentation i imagine that i need to use a dictionary with some sort of loop in order to store the different patterns and their occurence number.Can someone help me?Thank you if read this far.
First of all you shouldn't call your dictionary dict because it is already an existing keyword in python (The dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs).This line dict={"(f.line)", "(len(log))"} is incorrect, the curly brackets used like this mean you are actually defining a new set containing two strings, and not the variables you want - they are in quotes.The declaration of the empty dictionary itself is fine.To add values to an existing dictionary use dictName[key] = value. To declare a dictionary with value pairs use dictName = {key1 : value1, key2 : value2} etc.
