Evening Guys,New to Python and wondering if someone can take a quick look at the beginning of a POS system I am working on. I want the employee to have to enter their ID number to operate the system. So I placed the employee name and number in a dictionary. And tried to do an If/Else function to match the input against the Employee IDs. Any guidance is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
There are a couple fundamental problems in your code that you should address.The first thing to realize here is that the input() function will always return a string. With that in mind, if you actually compare string to an integer (you have an integer in your dictionary), you will never pass an equality check. The second item to note, is that you never actually properly look to see if the data you want to validate is in your dictionary. When you do this: You are not performing a proper containment check to see if your data is inside the dictionary. If all you want to do is validate that the employee_id is not valid, then you need to check the values of the dictionary. This can be done by calling the values method against the dictionary, and then using the containment check in: However, this won't work! Because employee_id is a string and your values are all integers, so you need to call int on the employee_id to actually compare the proper types with one another: I suggest you read the dictionary documentation, and take the time to go through some of the relevant parts of the Python Tutorial, which will greatly help your learning and solving some of these problems in your code. 
You are comparing a string to a dict, which will always fail. If you want to test if the input matches one of the numbers associated with the names in the dict, the test should be something like if int(employee_number) in employee_IDs.values().
Instead of you want to have
