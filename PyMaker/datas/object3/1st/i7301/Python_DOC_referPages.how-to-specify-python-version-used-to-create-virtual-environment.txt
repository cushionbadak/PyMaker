My Python virtual environments use python3.6 when I create them using virtualenv~ $ virtualenv my_envbut I need to use python3.5 as 3.6 is not currently supported by Opencv3.I've tried using the --python=<py_version> flag when creating a virtual environment but this doesn't work.How do I specify the python (3.x) version to install using virtualenv for Mac and/or Linux?
Assuming that you have installed python3 or any desired version of Python (2.6, 2.7, 3.5, 3.6), Now while creating the virtual environment directly pass the python executable path. Hence here are few valid exampleAnd last
Alternatively, I think you could use the specific version of Python itself to create the virtual environment. That way, you'll know for sure it's the correct version:Reference at https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/venv.html
As of version 3.3, python includes a package named venv. However that package doesn't provide the same functionalities as the traditional virtualenv package.venv allows creating virtual environments only for the version of python it's installed for.virtualenv allows creating virtual environments for different versions of python by providing the path to the binary.Creating virtual envs for different versions of python:So assuming one has python 2.7 and python 3.6 installed in /path/to/ and wants to create the virtual env named respectively env-py36 with python 3.6 and env-py27 with python 2.7Using python 3.3+ venvPython 3.3+ :Python 3.3 to 3.5 (deprecated in 3.6+) :Sources:Creating Virtual EnvironmentsPython 3.3 venvPython virtualenv package
I working on all ubuntu and MacOSUbuntu : virtualenv -p python3.6 environment_fileMac OS : virtualenv -p python3.6 environment_fileI think it be same
