This simple program checks if the 4th bit in a user provided integer is turned on. When prompted "Enter Integer" you can provide a number (say, 12, for example) and then it will be converted from a string to an integer, then from base10 to binary. However, despite the int() and bin() conversions I'm still getting an error saying that & can't be used on 'str' and 'int'.As far as I understand the int() and bin() functions, the user provided number should be a bitwise interger when it's passed to the check_bit4() function. What am I missing?File "Problem3.py", line 3, in check_bit4if x & check > 0:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'str' and 'int'
There is no reason to use bin(..). bin(..) does not convert an integer to a binary equivalent, an int is already stored binary. It constructs a representation (something a person can read) of the integer with 0s and 1s as a string. Indeed:So you can simply use:In your function, you write 0b00001000 but this is also an integer: if you would have written 8 directly, that would not have made a difference.
Well, It is because bin(x) returns a string Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#binHence in the above line you are trying to & (and) string and int which causes the error.So we need to convert the string to int before using & (and) operator. Instead of these tedious tasks, I would suggest you to use & (and) operator directly on the input number.I hope this solves your issue :)
