I have a list with column namely A,B,C,D and I wanted to reformat list by a group of Unique D column's values. List Expected Output:and then print all list under d1:
You can use operator.itemgetter() to extract the field of interest (field 3 is the D column).  Then use itertools.groupby() to extract groups with a common key:If you just want to print the d1 groups, the code is even simpler:The code [group[:-1] for group in groups] uses slicing and a list comprehension to remove the key-field as shown in your expected output.Hope this helps :-)
