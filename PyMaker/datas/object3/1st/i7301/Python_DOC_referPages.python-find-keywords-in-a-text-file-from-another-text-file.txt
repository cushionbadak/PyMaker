Natural Text
Take this invoice.txt for exampleInvoice NumberINV-3337Order Number12345Invoice DateJanuary 25, 2016Due DateJanuary 31, 2016And this is what dict.txt looks like:Invoice DateInvoice NumberDue DateOrder NumberI am trying to find keywords from 'dict.txt' in 'invoice.txt' and then add it and the text which comes after it (but before the next keyword) in a 2 column datatable.So it would look like :col1       -----                 col2Invoice number  ------            INV-3337order number       ----         12345Here is what I have done till nowThis is working but the ordering is all wrong (it is as in dict.txt and not as in invoice.txt)i.e.The output is Invoice DateInvoice NumberDue DateOrder Numberinstead of the order in the invoice.txt , which isinvoice numberorder numberinvoice datedue dateCan you help me with how I should proceed further ?Thank You.
This should work. You can load your invoice data into a list, and your dict data into a set for easy lookup.Now iterate over invoices, 2 at a time and print out the line sets that match.
