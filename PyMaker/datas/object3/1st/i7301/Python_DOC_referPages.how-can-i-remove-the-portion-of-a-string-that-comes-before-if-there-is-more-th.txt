This question already has an answer here:Split a string by a delimiter in python                    3 answers                If given the string "John Doe;Lodging;123;050617", which is a line within a file, I need to remove everything before and including the first semicolon, and after and including the last one. How can I do that without removing my ability to later split the remaining substring?Previous questions do not address removing the portions once separated while retaining the portion needed for further use.
Stepwise for clarity:As one line:
This will make new_s = 'Lodging;123'

The find method will give you the index of the first instance of a character in a string
There are a few methods you could try.  The simplest one is to split the string and reassemble it:You could also use find and rfind (like find, but from the end of the string backwards:There's also partition and rpartition:
Use str.partition and str.rpartition.In terms of efficiency, this is probably the best solution. However, I find the split/join method more readable.
Try: 
Try this: use str.find() function to locate the first occurance of ';' and then substring from that point to the end using [:]
