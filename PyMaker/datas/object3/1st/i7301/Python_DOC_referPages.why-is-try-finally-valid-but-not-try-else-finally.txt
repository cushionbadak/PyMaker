I found Python throwing a SyntaxError at me for trying try without except:Instead, I was forced to write:which felt slightly silly, but I want eggs() to be executed before semprini() â€” if I put the contents of the else:-clause after the finally:-clause it will be executed after semprini().  Although there has been a try without except proposal in the past, the semantics were different as there the implication was except: pass, i.e. the polar opposite of what I'm after.  Interestingly, try: without either except: or else: is valid, but I can't have else: if I don't also have except:.  Although there may be a different way to formulate the same, the alternatives I've thought of (probably) have subtly different behaviour.Why does the presence of else: require the presence of except:?
You should have writtenIn the absence of any except clauses, else is useless.
