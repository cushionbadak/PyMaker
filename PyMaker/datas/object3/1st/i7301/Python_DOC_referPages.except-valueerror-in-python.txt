Natural Text
Is there better way of writing this code: 
You can have it all inside a try/except block (calculation and return):Also note, the default return value from function is None, so the second return is not really necessary (you could have pass instead), but it makes code more readable.
You can also use contextlib.suppress, if you find it more readable.See the documentation here.
