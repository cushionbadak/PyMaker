Natural Text
I have a repository which contains protocol buffer messages and services, originally written for a Golang project. I need to write a Python microservice but I'm not 100% clued up on how Python dependency management works. I need to import the definitions into my new Python project and compile them to Python.How should I import my protocol buffer definitions repository into my Python project and compile the protobufs for Python? I can't copy the .pb files into my new project as they're shared amongst a number of other projects. 
Protobufs is installable via pipRead Installing Python Modules in the documentation if you need help on using pip.
