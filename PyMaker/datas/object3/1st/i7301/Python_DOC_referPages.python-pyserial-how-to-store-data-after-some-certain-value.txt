I'm reading data through seral port of my computer using python pyserial package. The source is an FPGA board.The source sending 24 pieces of bytes  accordingly and then there is an idle period. This process repeats itself. So to find out the first byte of 24 tranmission there is a 0 byte which is a kind of marking byte. So when I got this marking byte I want to start recording the next 24 bytes and repeat this for the next 24 bytes real time. I can identify the zeroth byte but stuck for the next step. You can see the current code below...Thanks in advance
Question: ...how to store data after some certain valueAggregate the 24 Bytes into list, for instance:Python Â» 3.6.2 Documentation: class list([iterable])Tested with Python: 3.4.2
