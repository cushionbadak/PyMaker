I'm trying to solve this using regular expressions in python, any suggestion on how to proceed using regular expressions? 
If all you want to do is remove non-alphanumeric characters from a string, you can do it simply with re.sub:Note, the \W will match any character which is not a Unicode word character. This is the opposite of \w. For ASCII strings it's equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_].
