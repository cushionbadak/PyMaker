I am learning how to read python docs and less reliant on the internet examples. Not easy, but I will try.In python cli, i import osWhen I help(os), the following output was returnedI cannot find the class DirEntry in the os.py source file. Can someone enlighten me why help(os) returns with DirEntry
If you print the representation of os.DirEntry, and as you can see in the help, it is the object nt.DirEntry (Because you are on a windows system):The place where DirEntry is imported from nt in the os module is here:The from nt import * imports (mostly) everything from the nt module, which is where DirEntry is added to the os module.
