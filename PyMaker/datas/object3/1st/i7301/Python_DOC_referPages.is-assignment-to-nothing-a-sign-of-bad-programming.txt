I wrote a program that works perfectly, except I get feedback that says "you assigned the expression to nothing". Here is the code:I can first initialize boolean_list and then assign logical values to it, but I believe it would be much slower than my first approach (given above). I'm completely new to programming so it isn't clear to me what I'm doing wrong.
Your best option to avoid this problem is to get rid off your for loop, by using a list comprehension : This will use list comprehensions that are a much more efficient way to build iterators.
