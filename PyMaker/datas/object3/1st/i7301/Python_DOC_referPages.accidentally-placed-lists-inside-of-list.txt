This makes it difficult to do some other operations I would like to perform on the individual parts of the list. My code:When I run this code, it returns [['Test 1'], ['Test 2'], ['Test 3'], ['Test 4'], ['Test 5']].Is there anything I can do about this?
This part:Is your problem. str.splitlines() returns a list. That's why you're seeing a list of lists, rather than a flat list. But you don't need str.splitlines() anyway since you're already using file.readline(). Just use that:If you have extra whitespace you need to strip from the lines, use str.strip():As noted in the comments by @idjaw, an alternately way to accomplish your goal would be to read the contents of the file, then  use splitlines() to separate each line removing any trailing whitespace:Also, consider using the context manager statement with. It will ensure that your files will always be closed regardless of any errors or issues that arise during program execution.
f.readline() returns one line. No reason to split it. .splitlines() turns it into a list.
