I have defined the following model and enum:I'm trying to update the record in the following way:During this, I received an error:

To emulate the behaviour in an SQL expression you can manually pass the names of the enum objects, with an appropriate cast:It is unsightly and I'm somewhat sure there exists a better method, but for the time being this was the best I could come up with.
