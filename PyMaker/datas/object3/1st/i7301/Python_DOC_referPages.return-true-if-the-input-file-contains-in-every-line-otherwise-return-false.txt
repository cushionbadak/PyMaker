Natural Text
I am new to programming and I am trying to write a function that would accept filename as a parameter. This function should open the file, read it and return True if the file contains "?" in every line of the text file.The input file may have the designated character one or more time.This is what I have so far:I have spent several hours looking for every possible similar solution but no results.
The main problem you are facing is that you are returning inside your first iteration. The return will end execution of your function. If you are looking to check if all lines contain that '?', then the check should simply be something that will return once it does not find a '?'. If you manage to exhaust your iteration, then all lines have the '?' and you simply return True. Furthermore, notice the reading of the file is now using a context manager, which is a cleaner approach here. Finally, to refactor this completely, we can make use of the all function, which will iterate through the each line, and will short circuit once it finds an unmatching condition. It is pretty much exactly what was shown above, but all the work is done for us: 
You can use all() to ensure that all lines passed your condition. For example:
