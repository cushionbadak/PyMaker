This question already has an answer here:Sorting list based on values from another list?                    14 answers                sorting multiple lists based on a single list in python                    3 answers                I have 3 lists:say,Basically, st is the different letters from a string , freq is their corresponding frequencies and pos is the positions of those letters.Now I want to sort all the 3 lists in decreasing order of freq.zip is not helpful as I need to store those sorted lists separately!
You can calculate your new indices and then apply them:This gives tuples, but list conversion is trivial: list(order(st)), list(order(freq)), etc.
Using NumPy:
I would change my data structure to this:Then sort based on the criteria, in this caseResult
If data belongs together it really shouldn't be separate (as in separate lists), at least I would use a namedtuple (or if you have Python 3.7 one could also use a dataclass), one can easily unpack them again (for storage or further operations).To demonstrate the namedtuple approach:Now you have a list where the related data is also stored together. Sorting it is now very easy (almost trivial):And if you need to unpack it again:By the way you have some redundancy here, because the length of the positions actually contains the frequency. In such cases it's often preferable (although that may be subjective) not to store the calculated property directly if one can compute them efficiently (and len is efficient):With the following operations to sort (and unpack them):
