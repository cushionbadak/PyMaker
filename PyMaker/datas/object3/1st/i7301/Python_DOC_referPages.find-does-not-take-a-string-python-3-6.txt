I have lately been working on a project that retrieves METAR from a NOAA website, and slices the METAR data and prints it. Now I have encountered a problem as change the code to Python3.6, when I try to .find() the marker that sates the start of the METAR data it gives me this error message:I do understand what this error is saying. It means that the .find() does not take a string, but according to the python docs the .find() function does take a string! here is the section of code I am having trouble with: 
HTTPResponce.read() returns a bytes object. bytes methods (such as .find) require arguments of type bytes. You could either change br1_string to a bytes object:or, decode the response:
As per the documentation, it takes a bytes-like object or an int.There are two types here: str and bytes. Both have a .find method. It is easy to mistake them. Your website_html file is actually bytes, not str.
