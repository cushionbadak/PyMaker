Natural Text
I am new to Python. I am trying to extract one string ("concluded that our disclosure controls were effective as of") from a txt file ("infile.txt"). The file is relatively large, and I need to look for the above string in one particular section (between the "ITEM & nbsp;9A" and the "ITEM & nbsp;9B"). An example of such section follows:If the section has the desired string "concluded that our disclosure controls were effective as of" (the above section has it aprox. in the middle), then I would like to print a "1" in a separate "output.csv" file, if it does not, print "not found". The starting point of the section does not always coincide with the start of a line. I am sorry but could not figure out how to start.... I am using Python 3.6.Thank you very much in advance!
You can use re.findall:
You can use regular expressions to extract text between a given opener and closer:You can look over the extracts by with re.finditer and then filter the extracts with the target string using the in-operator:Hopefully, this is enough to get you started :-)
