I'm trying to access a dict_key's element by its index:I want to get foo.same with:How can I do this?
Call list() on the dictionary instead:In Python 3, the dict.keys() method returns a dictionary view object, which acts as a set. Iterating over the dictionary directly also yields keys, so turning a dictionary into a list results in a list of all the keys:
Not a full answer but perhaps a useful hint. If it is really the first item you want*, then is much faster than for large dicts, since the whole thing doesn't have to be stored in memory.For 10.000.000 items I found it to be almost 40.000 times faster.*The first item in case of a dict being just a pseudo-random item before Python 3.6 (after that it's ordered in the standard implementation, although it's not advised to rely on it).
Conventional way of appending the keys to a statically defined list and then indexing it for same
Another different approach would be use a pandas Series like this:This might be overkilling and not very fast, but for me is very clear and readable.
