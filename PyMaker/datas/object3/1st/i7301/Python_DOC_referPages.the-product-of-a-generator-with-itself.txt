I need to iterate over the product of a generator with itself, excluding the diagonal.  I'm attempting to use itertools.tee to consume the same generator twiceThis does not workThe documentation for tee states:Return n independent iterators from a single iterable.What's the proper way to do this?(I'm using python3.6.1)
It looks like you want to use itertools.permutations.If you really want to do it using tee, you will have to turn the second iterable into a list so that it is not exhausted on the second time through the outer for loop:Note that this is pretty pointless, since calling list on an iterator loads it into memory and defeats the purpose of having an iterator in the first place.
The issue is that you're trying to reuse the i2 iterator. After it's been iterated once, it's exhausted and so you won't be able to iterate on it again. When you try, it yields nothing.I think rather than tee (which is not very efficient for this purpose anyway), you should use itertools.product to generate all pairs (before filtering out the ones you want to skip):
