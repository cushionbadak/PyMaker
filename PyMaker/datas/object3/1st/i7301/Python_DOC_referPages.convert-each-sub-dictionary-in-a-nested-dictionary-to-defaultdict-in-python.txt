Here's a piece of code I have now. What I want to do is covert each sub-dictionary in a nested dictionary to a child class of dict, which is MyDict. However, my recursion logic only change the first level of sub dictionary. How to modify this recursion function?
You're not updating your nested structures properly, try:Although I'd advise you not to extend dict and use collections.MutableMapping instead. On Python 3.x it's moved to collections.abc.MutableMapping.
You could use depth-first search to traverse the dict.
define a function dict_to_defaultdict(), inside the function looping it through
