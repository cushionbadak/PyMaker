I'm using this source to calculate the UVI value for every hour in a day (From 7am to 7pm). And using pysolar module to get the Solar Zenith Angle. The equation is below:The output is:    0.4850283419701262+1.8890606693266203jMy question is when cos(sza) becomes negative it will give a complex number as output, how can I handle this ? Also, at 7 am the uvi results in 9.232276464148745 which is wrong. Am I missing something ? Or my interpretation of the algorithm is wrong  ?
math.cos expects radians but you seem to pass in degrees.Convert from degrees to radians with sza * math.pi / 180. Then you should not get negative values for angles between -90 and +90 degrees (which I guess makes sense, assuming that 0 degrees means the sun is in the zenith and 90 degrees is the horizon).
