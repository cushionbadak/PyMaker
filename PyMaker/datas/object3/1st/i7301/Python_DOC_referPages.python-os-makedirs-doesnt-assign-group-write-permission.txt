Here is a list of steps to reproduce this problem:Ideally, all these folders should have group write permission drwxrwxr-x. I know that I can work around this as mentioned in this question's answer.I would like to know if there is something I'm missing that might be the reason why group permission is wrong.UPDATE: Test snippet shown above was done on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04). I was able to reproduce this in Mac also.
Python honors umask and sometimes ignores the mode entirely:On some systems, mode is ignored. Where it is used, the current umask  value is first masked out. If bits other than the last 9 (i.e. the  last 3 digits of the octal representation of the mode) are set, their  meaning is platform-dependent. On some platforms, they are ignored and  you should call chmod() explicitly to set them.from: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlMore about umask hereSo one way to go is to set the umask not to interfere with your desired permissions (for your running process - also be sure to reset them afterward): Of course, if you need those permissions all the time, you can set the umask on os-level. 
In the doc it says in some systems the mode parameter is ignored or not well interpreted:On some systems, mode is ignored. Where it is used, the current umask  value is first masked out. If bits other than the last 9 (i.e. the  last 3 digits of the octal representation of the mode) are set, their  meaning is platform-dependent. On some platforms, they are ignored and  you should call chmod() explicitly to set them.And it suggest you to use chmod() insteadSource https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkdir
