Natural Text
I have a list of strings like this:["ra", "dec", "ra-error", "dec-error", "glat", "glon", "flux", "l", "b"]I need to find all the strings in this list that contain "ra" or "dec" or "lat"I checked many other threads as well as the regex manual. It turned out to be too confusing for me. Pleas help. :(
You don't need regex for this at all. A list comprehension with any will suffice
Here's a solution using regex if that's what you really need. I search to see if any of your 3 substrings are present inside any given string from the list. Using https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html as the Python regex library.
find also works for your problem.
