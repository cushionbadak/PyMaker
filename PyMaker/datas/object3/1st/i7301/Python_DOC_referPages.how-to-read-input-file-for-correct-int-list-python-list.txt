My input is a list of int elements where I save the list as a file (not more, not less), which works fine so far.But when it comes  to taking the file as an input for my int list, I either get wrong list elements or an error for the code. The numbers can be any (positive) int and it's an even number.input for file (by keyboard):file content:list after input from file:where it should be:The elements of my filst from file need to be int again.
You have several options here.Save each number in its own line instead of the actual list, then in order to read the file to a list of ints:If you insist on writing the list as-is to the file, you can use literal_eval (do not use eval):Keep in mind my usage of strip() to get rid of possible leading/trailing spaces and/or new line characters.
If you are saving the list to a file and assuming list_from_file is the string representation that has been read. Use ast to evaluate the list.
