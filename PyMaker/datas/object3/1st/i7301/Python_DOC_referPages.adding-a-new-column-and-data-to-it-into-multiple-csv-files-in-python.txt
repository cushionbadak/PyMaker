Natural Text
I'm a beginner in Python, and I've been struggling to create a code to add columns to a set of similar csv files.Here's what I have so far:Basically, I'd like to add a column in which I had "Row 13's text + row 14's text + more text, the same every time".I get this error message on the writer.write(headers) line, though:AttributeError: '_csv.writer' object has no attribute 'write'What should I do?
I have to refactor your code but this should be closest to what you would like to achieve. You would need to do exception handling and checking if there are more than 13 elements in the row, etc.More on python csv : https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
You need read the API document,https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlThe csv.writer write function used writerow not the write, please check.The sample to write CSV file,
