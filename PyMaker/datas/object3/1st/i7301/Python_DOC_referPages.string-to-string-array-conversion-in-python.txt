This question already has an answer here:How to make a flat list out of list of lists?                    38 answers                I have a string: [('I', 'PRP'), ('have', 'VBP'), ('lost', 'VBN'), ('a', 'DT'), ('pant', 'NN')]Now I need to take the words in between single quotes in an array. as example: The number of entries [assuming ('x', 'y') makes an entry] is variable in the original string. And the array needs to be a string array, not something like numpy ndarray. Now, how to do that with Python?I also have a List object just like the original string. If the same result can be achieved by processing the list object, that would also work fine.
chain.from_iterable does exactly what you'd think it does: it flattens the given iterable (converts nested structure into a chain).
It's same like make list of list into a single list,
