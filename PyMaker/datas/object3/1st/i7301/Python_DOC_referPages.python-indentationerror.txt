I need help in my code, I don't know why I'm getting 'IndentationError:unexpected unindent' in the line 10 (def plus(self, v):), someone could help me?
Try this:
In your __init__ function, you are missing an except block. If you do not include this, your try statement is essentially useless. Make sure to add the except block to handle your ValueError!
The error is coming from when you are calling try what you need to do is add and except to it like such:The try and except concept means that you are trying to perform an action in python but if an error occurs within the try scope then whatever is in the except scope will run.Hope this helps :)
I'm gonna take a guess and say the code should look like this:The indentation in the code you provided was indeed wrong but i think the interpreter was expecting an 'except' statement(here just shown to pass but you should make it do something)
See the documentation on exceptions.
