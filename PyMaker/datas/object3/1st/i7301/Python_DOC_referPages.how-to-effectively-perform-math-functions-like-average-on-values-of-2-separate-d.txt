Currently i'm doing it like:So wanted to know if there is a more optimized/effective way of doing this?
Do it like that instead:this is a dictionary-comprehension that loops through the key-value pairs of dict1 and for every one of those keys fetches the corresponding value from dict2 too. It converts both to integers and derives their average.Note the .get(..) method used instead of the dict2[k] that makes sure no error is raised if a key is missing from dict2 but present in dict1.
