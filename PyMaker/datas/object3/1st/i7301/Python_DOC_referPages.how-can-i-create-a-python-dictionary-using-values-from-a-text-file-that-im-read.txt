I have a file 'peaks_ee.xpk' and I'm trying to create a dictionary in my python code using the values in that file. I'm reading in the file peaks_ee.xpk. This is what peaks_ee.xpk looks like:This is a sample snippet from peaks_ee.xpk:I want to make a dictionary which takes in the atom name as the key. The atom name in peaks_ee.xpk are "1.H1'","2.H8", etc.. and I would like the value to be the chemical shifts which are for example "5.82020" and "7.61004" (this is coming from the 0 line in peaks_ee.xpk)So for example, I would want the dictionary to look like:dict = { "1.H1'":"5.82020", "2.H8":"7.61004"...}But the next line repeats by having 2.H8 and 1.H1' again, so it doesn't need to be added to the dictionary. The line after that (line 2) should add to the dictionary because it has a new atom called 1.H8, so it should bedict = {"1.H1'":"5.82020", "2.H8":"7.61004", "1.H8:8.13712", ...}How can I do this?Edit: If I have another file "ee_pinkH1.xpk" and I want to read it in and see if the chemical shift values from there are in a certain range, then print out those values, would this be the code?This is my entire code: 
You can extend your regex pattern to include the chemical shift and get what you need in each match.  Put parenthesis around the parts of the pattern you want to keep so they will be captured.Iterate over all the matches; the name and shift will be in the match.groups() tuple; if the name hasn't been seen yet add it to the dictionary.If the file is too big to read at once, extract the info one line at a time.
Just check if a key is already in the dictionary before adding it, using in.Since it looks like you have multiple key-value pairs to check for each row, you can repeat the function in every line like this:Did you mean to edit this post, by the way? I also answered on your older duplicate post.
