With gevent, i can monitor a long running function like so:How would I do this with asyncio? I've tried the following but I'm stuck:How would I change this to get the intended behavior?
You can schedule the long running task with ensure_future (but not awaiting it). In return you'll get a Future object that have done method that is similar to ready
