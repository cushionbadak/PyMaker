I'm relatively new to using eclipse, and I'm trying to figure out how to use the Python.h includes that are described here. What steps do I need to take to get eclipse to properly compile that include? Thanks!Edit:I am using Windows if that helps.
Ensure PyDev is installed as a plug-in. You can do this by selecting Help>Install New Softwareyou will then select add and choose a name (eg. PyDev), then enter http://pydev.org/updates as a location.You will then select PyDev from the list of available software and accept the license, and trust the certificate. You may need to restart Eclipse afterwards. You can refer to this Official Python Documentation for additional information on embedding and extending your code.
