Can you explain it what problems are here? To my mind, this code is like a heap of crap but with the right solving. I beg your pardon for my english. the task of this kata: Some numbers have funny properties. For example:Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n. In other words:If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.Note: n, p will always be given as strictly positive integers.dig_pow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1dig_pow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * kdig_pow(695, 2) should return 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2dig_pow(46288, 3) should return 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51test results:Test PassedTest PassedTest PassedTest Passed3263 should equal -1
I don't know what exact version of Python you're using. This following code are in Python 3. And if I get you correctly, the code can be as simple asThe major problem is that, in your objective, you have only two option of returning, but you wrote if elif else, which is definitely unnecessary and leads to problems and bugs. The % is modulus operator.Also, having an if and not returning anything in the other branch is often not a good idea (see the assert part). Of course, if you don't like it, just fall back to if.
