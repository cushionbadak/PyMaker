For my recursion assignment, the only built in function we are allowed to use is len() and 'print()'. So, not even int() is allowed to be used. The function I am supposed to make is supposed to break apart a number and print out each digit in the number.So,This is what I have come up with so far,This works for all numbers, except it will not print out 0s. I was thinking of writing something along the lines of,But if there are consecutive 0s, it will not print all of them. I guess I could use another counter like I did at the beginning, but if anyone could think of less convoluted ways for me to approach this, please let me know.
Use recursion to your advantage here, making the print call come after your recursive call:Note what happens if I put the print call before the recursive call:
If number can be a string:Or reverse it:
Something to keep you up at night:Python 3 specific, of course.
