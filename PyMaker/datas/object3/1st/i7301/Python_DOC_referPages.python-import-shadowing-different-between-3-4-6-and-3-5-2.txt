Python import shadowing seems to be different between version 3.4.6 and 3.5.2 :Question 1: Why is... those things ?Question 2: Is it there something in a changelog about that ? I can't find anything...
The documentation states thatWhen a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches  for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches  for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the  variable sys.path.(emphasis mine)time wasn't a built-in module module in Python 3.4, but that changed in Python 3.5:You can see the patch that introduced the change here (related to issue 5309). Considering that the changelog mentions the issue 5309, but doesn't say anything re. the time module, it's safe to say that the change was a side-effect and is an implementation detail of CPython.Since time isn't a built-in module in CPython 3.4, and the first directory in sys.path is the current script directory, from time import time attempts to import the time attribute from your time.py file, but fails and throws the ImportError.In CPython 3.5 time is a built-in module. As per the quote above, running from time import time successfully imports the built-in module, without searching for modules on sys.path.Both CPython versions will raise the same error if you shadow a non-builtin module from the standard library, such as inspect:
