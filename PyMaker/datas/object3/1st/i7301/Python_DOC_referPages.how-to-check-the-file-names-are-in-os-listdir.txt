I use RegEx & a String to get if this file name & similars to it exists in os.listdir('.') or not, If exists print('Yes'), If not print('No'), But If the file name even doesn't exists in my listdir('.') It shows me YES.How should I check that ?
filter on Python 3 is lazy, it doesn't return a list, it returns a generator, which is always "truthy", whether or not it would produce items (it doesn't know if it would until it's run out). If you want to check if it got any hits, the most efficient way would be to try to pull an item from it. On Python 3, you'd use two-arg next to do this lazily (so you stop when you get a hit and don't look further):If you need the complete list a la Py2, you'd just wrap it in the list constructor:On Python 2, your existing code should work as written.I'll note, what you're doing would usually be handled much better with the glob module; I'd strongly recommend taking a look at it.
An alternative to your code (not considering additional requirements you might not have listed):
