Natural Text
In python would it be possible to write a program which reads the  data from a .txt file and turn that data into lists, make calculations, etc... For example if you had a .txt file that read:Could you compute the average for the numbers assigned to each year?(Note: I'm using version 3.4)
You can open file and read lines and then split them and convert them to list. You can use numpy to calculate the mean. Hope the following code helps Output:
First you need to read the txt file and format properly by stripping any newline or whitespace characters:Right now,Now, that you have each line into the a list, you now have to split each string within the list into a list and convert the strings into floats:Now, we haveNow, you know that the first index of each sublist in c is the year. The best data structure to store this is a dictionary where the key is the year and the value is the average.And you now have:For reference, the entire code:
