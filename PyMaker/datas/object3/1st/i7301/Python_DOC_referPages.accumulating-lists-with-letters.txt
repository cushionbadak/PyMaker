I'm trying to right a code that accumulates a list.The code I've figured out so far does that but I want to make it work with letters e.g. accumulate("a", "b", "c")would come out to be a, ab, abc.
While @WillemVanOnsem has provided you with the method that would work, to shorten your code you can use itertools.accumulate from the standard library:
You can try this:Even better in a function with a generator:Output:
If you want to let it work with strings, you have to initialize it with an empty string:Furthermore if you want to use an arbitrary number of arguments, you should use *args (or *L).Now of course this will no longer work with numbers. The theSum += i is here short for theSum = theSum + i (since strings are immutable). Note however that this is not always the case: for lists there is a difference for instance.Now it prints:The last 'abc' is not a result of a print(..) statement, but it is the return of the accumulate function.
