Natural Text
I have a function that calculates an "either or" type of list for my data.Goal is to then write an output text file with the coordinates.OR if the keyword resulted in MINUS strands:I tried putting these write files within the code but then the return functions just would not give me the full list, and I end up only writing one coordinate every time. I put them at the end, but this results in empty files and empty strings - I would like to keep this as one function and have it determine if the keyword (i.e. a gene ID) has coordinates given for plus/minus strand (I have a gigantic data file that contains this data and the point is to not manually scan the IDs and see if they are plus/minus DNA strands).Thank you!EDIT (sample data, had to remove some columns so I edited the code as well):So if I use ENSPFOG0000001 as my keyword, then the script should run and determine that the strands are plus, collect the start coordinates in a list and then output a file that just has the coordinates. The file would have keyword+"_plus.txt" appended. If it was ENSPFOG0000002, then it would collect the minus strand coordinates, and create a file where keyword+"_minus.txt" is created. 
An empty list evaluates to False:So you can test for an empty list and take action as appropriateTo retrieve both lists from the function:
