I have been looking at this code for a while and can not find the problem. Can anyone help?This is my code:When I run this i this error:Please help
Its because you havesprite_co = sprite.coordswhich means sprite_co references a function rather than the function's return value. In subsequent function calls you try to access attribute y1 but since sprite_co is a function (rather than the return of function call as I believe was intended) it has no y1 attribute. Replace this line with sprite_co = sprite.coords()
