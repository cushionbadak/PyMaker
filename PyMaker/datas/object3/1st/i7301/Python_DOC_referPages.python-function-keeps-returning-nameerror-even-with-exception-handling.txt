I have a function which works with integers. I have added code for exception handling if strings or floats are entered, however, Python keeps returning either nonsense or NameError. At this point I have tried a loop which keeps asking until an integer is entered and a try and except. Nothing works.Here's the code:Entering a whole number(the intended input) executes the code fine, but everything else leads to a name error like this, where the input is threes(bob). The top part is my attempt at a loop, which also failed and returned the same error;
NameError: name 'bob' is not defined means that you try to use a variable named bob but you didn't create it.You have to define what is bob like that for exemple :bob = 'a simple man'  # bob is a stringorbob = 4  # bob is an integerFurthermore, I just want you to know that even if it works, try to avoid using try/except because this is quite slow when you have to enter in the except block.If you want to check if your variable is an integer I recommend you using :Where isinstance() is a built-in function.
Your bob variable is not defined at all, so you don't reach the try/catch.Try decalring bob with not a number, bob = 'test_string' and retry.
The problem is that NameError is being raised from outside the function call. When you say:What Python does is:Get the value of bob.Call threes passing that value as parameter.NameError is raised in step 1., so you don't even get into the function. If you still want to catch it, you should have the try/except block outside:
The code you posted simply cannot raise a NameError. The error probably comes from the part where you call you threes function. If you just wrote threes(bob), then the NameError will be raised if you did not previously define a variable named bob. If you wanted to pass a string, you should call your function like: threes("bob")
