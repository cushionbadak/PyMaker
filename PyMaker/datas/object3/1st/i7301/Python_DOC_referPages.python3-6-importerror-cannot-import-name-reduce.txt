I'm using python 3.6.2, and this is the only code that shows the following error:   Traceback (most recent call last):    File "D:\Pythons\oop.py", line 50, in       from functools import reduce  ImportError: cannot import name 'reduce'  Process returned 1 (0x1)   execution time : 0.145 sI will find this problem because I made a mistake in another code,   from enum import EnumIt reported the error:   Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\Pythons\oop.py", line  50, in       from enum import Enum   File "C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\lib\enum.py",  line 3, in       from functools import reduce ImportError: cannot import name 'reduce'So I just looked at the enum. Py source,Found in line 3from functools import reduceLadies and gentlemen, in centos7.2 installed python3.6.2 is completely out of any problems, but under the Windows 10 professional version installed, will appear these problems above, seems I installed out of the question, however, many times I've uninstalled, installed the many times repeatedly, still won't do, don't know without those documents, who can tell me how to through the command line in the Windows environment to install it?
Python 3.6 should have reduce in functools. To debug your problem, try this:I would expect an output similar to (tried it here: https://www.python.org/shell/):My guess is more than reduce will be missing. In any case, it looks like an Uninstall than Reinstall is in order. You may have accidently edited the file or corrupted it in some way. Sometimes an IDE could take you to that function and it would be easy to edit it accidentally.
Don't take care of those errors. Just try to use functools in your code :or like that :
