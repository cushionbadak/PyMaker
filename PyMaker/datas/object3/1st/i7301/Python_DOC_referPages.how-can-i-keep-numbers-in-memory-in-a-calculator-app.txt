I am making a calculator with a GUI but I don't know how to keep track of a number so that I can use it later on with a second number to perform an operation.My code is as follows:So as you can see in my functions definition, when I call Sum I use c=a+b. The problem is I don't know how to keep a in memory to use it for the sum operation with b, because of this I don't know how to input a new value and save it in b.How can I store the value of a while having the user input a new value into b?
First of all, you should try to use  class.If its about your question. Simply use functions parameters.Example with sum function:If you want to do it in "real time" you can use only 1 parameter and keep result as class member.If it does not suffice read about Reverse Polish notation
In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are  implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within  the function’s body, it’s assumed to be a local unless explicitly  declared as global.  - What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?Therefore when you assign a variable a and c in the function, it is created as a local variable. If you would try to use it before assignment, as example:you would get UnboundLocalError: local variable 'c' referenced before assignment exception.I think in your example you would also get a NameError: name 'a' is not defined exception if you would call Sum() before button() callback is executed, as a is not yet defined. That is because a is referenced in the function, but not assigned - therefore is not created as a local variable, however it is also not to be found anywhere in global namespace.The easiest solution would be to use global variables. Not that whenever you want to use global variable instead of creating a local one, you need to show it in the local context with the global keyword:However I would suggest using class and store values as a properties, as example:In this example I also used in keyword and dictionary of values, which simplify selection instead of using bunch of if-elif cases.
