I'm running a number of regressions I want to superficially compare with Stata, to ensure my code works as I migrate from Stata to Python.i.e statsmodels.formula.api('x ~ y') outputsWhereas Stata providesI'd essentially like the output to match exactly. I know this can probably done under the hood by saving the coefficients, but it's far easier at a glance.
The (hacky) way I have achieved this is by editing the statsmodels library file iolib\summary.py, and including Stata-like rounding. It's not perfect, but it will do the job for the moment.
If you're just looking to increase the number of decimal places so that you can visually compare the values, you can use pd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.2f' % x)replacing "2" with the number of decimal places you would like to display.Note: this changes the number of decimal places for all floats in your dataframes.
