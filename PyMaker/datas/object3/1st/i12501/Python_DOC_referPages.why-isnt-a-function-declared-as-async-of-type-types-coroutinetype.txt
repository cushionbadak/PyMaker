Quote from here:types.CoroutineTypeThe type of coroutine objects, created by async def functions.Quote from here:Functions defined with async def syntax are always coroutine functions, even if they do not contain await or async keywords.Python console session:Why doesn't isinstance(g, types.CoroutineType) evaluate to True?
There's a difference between coroutine and coroutine function. The same way as there is a difference between generator and generator function:Calling the function g returns a coroutine, e.g.:If you need to tell if g is a coroutine function (i.e. would return a coroutine) you can check with:
g by itself is not a valid Coroutine function when used that way:This is similar to the difference between a generator and a generator function. Instead, use g() to compare:You could also try iscoroutinefunction(g) instead, much more shorter and neater:Read more here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html
