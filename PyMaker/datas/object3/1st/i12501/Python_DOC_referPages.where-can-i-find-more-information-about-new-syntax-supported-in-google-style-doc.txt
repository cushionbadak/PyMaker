The sphinx-doc napoleon Google style docstrings example here for version 1.3.4 shows that optional arguments for a function/method should be documented as follows:But the same page for version 1.4a0 here shows the following way to do the same thing:But I don't see any explanation of this new syntax in the documentation. Where can I find more information about new syntax supported in Google style docstrings with the napoleon extension of sphinx-doc?
In a tl;dr fashion:Looking at the documentation in the beginning of function module_level_function that you linked, one can see that: The final line contains a hint. Apparently, the notation introduced in PEP 484 assisted by the typing module is what you're seeing.A small intro on the notation:PEP 484 is based on function annotations as described in PEP 3107; essentially each function parameter can have an optional type specifier after its name. So, for a function like:You could annotate their types in the following way:The introduction of type hinting brought with it a need to formalize the way types will be indicated; this is where the typing module comes in.The typing module contains a good set of abstract types (and, generally, type theory mumbo-jumbo) for you to specify additional types other than standard built-ins like int, str et al. For example, the Optional[str] notation indicates that the parameter can take either a str type or a 'type' of None i.e it's optionally a string. So in a nutshell, they're using the notation defined with the introduction of type hints for documenting the type of the parameters. This means that if you have a function that takes an argument that is a List of integers:The documentation for it should look something like this:Where List[int] comes from the notation in the typing module.Some more examples:Some examples where this specific notation is defined and furthe explained can be found in the documentation of mypy (a static checker that inspired PEP 484). Common cases that one might need to document in their code are contained in the table of built-in types:Others, like Any, Union are defined here while generic notation described here.
The Optional[X] syntax isn't specific to sphinx-doc, as far as I understand. It's from the typing module for type hints: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html
