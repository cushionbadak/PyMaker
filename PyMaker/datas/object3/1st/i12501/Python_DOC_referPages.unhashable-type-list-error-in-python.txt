I have already checked some question-answers related to Unhashable type : 'list' in stackoverflow, but none of them helped me. Here is my partial code:where dict_table is a list of lists, dict_list is just a list & keyvalue is a python dictionary. The entire code runs well when ever I comment the line input_list_new.insert((input_list_new.index(matched[i])), temp), but without that line being commented, it shows Unhashable type : 'list' error.
The error message does not correspond to the linebeing commented out. If anything, the culprit is the lineThe problem should be that you are trying to use a list as your dictionary key. Here is the problem in a simple reproducible way:The reason it fails, is because a dictionary is also be called a hashmap (in other languages). The key must be hashable, and in Python trying to use a list as the key throws your error becauses lists are not hashable (see "hashable" entry here).Avoid using a list as your dictionary key will fix the problem.
Here's my guess .... You mentioned that the error is with the line matched = list(set(dict_list) & set(input_list)) .. That is probably because in either input_list or dict_list, you have a list within a list .... the items in a set need to hashable, and hence immutable .. for example you cannot do set([1,5,6,[1,3]]) ... that will give the unhashable type list error ... but you can do set([1,5,6,(1,3)]) because a tuple is immutable and hashable
