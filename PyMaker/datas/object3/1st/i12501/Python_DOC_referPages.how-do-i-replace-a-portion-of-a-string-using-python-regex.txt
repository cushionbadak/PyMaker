I have a street name "2839 WYATT WY". I want to replace the second 'WY' with 'WAY'Please help.Thanks!
If you want to substitute WY, which is always at the end of your string with WAY, then you can do with re module using re.sub method:EDIT: For general cases of where 'WY' could be in the string, this is an improved solution
