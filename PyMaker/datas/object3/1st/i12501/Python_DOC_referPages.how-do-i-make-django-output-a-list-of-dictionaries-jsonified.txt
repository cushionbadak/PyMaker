This question already has an answer here:How to create a Python dictionary with double quotes as default quote format?                    6 answers                I have output of a dictionary inside a listI want the quotes to be " instead of 'The app I'm working on is supposed to return JSON and I believe for json ' is a character so it breaks it. Working okay! and not okay! UPDATEI've tried using json.dumps but it's being escaped
You can use the json lib 
As yedpodtrzitko mentioned, Django should be serializing the information for you - you don't have to turn it into a string first.From the docsSo it looks like whatever you get back from your serializer should just be a plain ol' dictionary with all of it's contents. I'm assuming that if you didthat it would dump out the appropriate JSON string
