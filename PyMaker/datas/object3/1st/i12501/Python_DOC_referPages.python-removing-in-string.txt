This question already has an answer here:Remove specific characters from a string in Python                    25 answers                I am trying to get the longtitude, latitude and altitude from a GPS module on my Raspberry Pi B+. Currently running this code here:This is the output of said code:Is it possible to remove the '' quotes in the last section of the output and leave just the number like in the first two sections of the output?
Because you're converting a list to a string, actually you really shouldn't do that. I'd suggest use ', '.join() instead:Let's see what's wrong:Because Python use quotes to says that: This object is a string.And when you convert an object which has a string object within it, the quotes will still there instead of removed automatically.
