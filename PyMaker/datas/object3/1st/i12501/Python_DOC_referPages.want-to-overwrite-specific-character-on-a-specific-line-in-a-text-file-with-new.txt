Natural Text
I Have a program that calculates a score 'LevelScore' and i want to open the UserFile 'UserScoreFile' and check against the current user score saved in the file, and if LevelScore > CurrentScore overwrite the previous characters representing that levels score in the text file to the LevelScore.Each line in the Text file represents a level from 0-7 with each line format being, "T 000", T is representing if level is unlocked and 000 represents the current score (score can be 0-100) "lev" is a variable from 0-7 indicating which level the user is on.
