I have the following loop:where:tile is a dictionary in the form of and corner_tiles and enemy_tiles are dictionaries in the form of {<tile_id> : <tile>, ... }.Â The loop always returns tile_id regardless of whether neighbour is in enemy_tiles or not, but doesn't if tile["player"] is not None. I have been trying to figure this out for quite a while but cannot seem to spot where I have gone wrong.EDIT:I have also tried:which acts the same way.
After much stress, I found the simple reason behind my error and I am kicking myself for missing it...What my loop was supposed to be doing is making sure that ALL neighbours are not in enemy_tiles. Of course, it was evaluating as true nearly every time because there was a much higher probability that the first neighbour checked was not in enemy_tiles and so the statement is true and tile_id is returned after only checking one neighbour.
