I have a large Python string as shown below.I want to replace "[year]" in the string with current year and "[fullname]" with a user provided name. I am using the re library in python to do this task.But I think it's not the appropriate way. I have never really used regex matching before but I think there should be a more Pythonic way to combine the two re.sub statements.
The task is much simpler if you simply do it with two regular expressions, rather than one.If you combine them into one, you make it more fragile (i.e. dependent on the ordering of the two things), and the regular expression needs to be more complex.You could do something like:Ask yourself which you find easier to read, though. I would recommend going with that option.
If you ensure that the string is rewritten to use {year} and {fullname}, you can then use the .format() method to fill them in:
