I am trying to create a turtle in Python so I could increase/ decrease it's size by pressing +/- on keyboard  To press the '+' key, I will have to hold 'shift' & press '=' at the same time. The problem is when I release the shift key ( or just press the shift key), it decreases the size value by 1. Why? Also if I put all these code into a main function: A error message show up:I had called 'size' a global variable but why it is not defined now?
