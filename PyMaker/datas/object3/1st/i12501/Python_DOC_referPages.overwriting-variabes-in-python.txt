I wonder if overwriting variables makes any difference in python code.for example this two codes (function argument is long string in both cases):first:and second:I think in first case it will use more memory than in the second.
No differences in the bytecodeLooking at the byte code, there seems to be no difference:No differences in timingsLook at the run times:When you repeat this, the values vary and one is tiny bit faster than other. So no difference.No difference in memory consumption
