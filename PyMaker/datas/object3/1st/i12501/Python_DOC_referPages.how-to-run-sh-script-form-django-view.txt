stack overflow.I'm trying to run some simple bash script (.sh) from Django view.My views.py:My bash script test.sh:My main goal is activate the virtualenv and start python script name "final_poster.py". But it doesn't work. I also tried to use subprocess.call without any success result. I am stuck on it, can you help me?
I think if don't see any error on the shell, then the script is running properly. If you want to see python shell's output, then you can add logging to bash script. For example:Check this SO answer for details.
