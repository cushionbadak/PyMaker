I write simple udp client program, but it cannot receive datagram correctly.My code is below.And I write UDP echo server protocol program posted in asyncio document.(https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#udp-echo-server-protocol)Running these programs, I think result is like this.But result is this.Why is result shifted?I search about asyncio module, but I cannot solve this problem.
It is because while True loop does not give back control to ioloop until next send call - input is blocking. Simply add some async sleep, so ioloop could handle events to receive dataAnd since input will block here as well, afaik it is the best to move it to separate thread:I have mixed your code with waiting for user input in separate thread, of course to refactor :)
