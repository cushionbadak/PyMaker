In python, I'd like to convert a formatted date + time + timezone string something like:...to epoch time (or some other defineable format). I'm sure there is a simple way to do this that already exists, but after looking around in the datetime python library, I can't find exactly what I'm looking for. Any ideas on how this may be accomplished?
datetime.strptime(date_string, format) returns a datetime corresponding to date_string, parsed according to format. You can then use datetime.timestamp() to convert a datetime tuple to the epoch time.For example:Not sure how to convert the timezone accurately.
Something like this?(For Python 3.3+ - doc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?highlight=re#datetime.datetime.timestamp )
