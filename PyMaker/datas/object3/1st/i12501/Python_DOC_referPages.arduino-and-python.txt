I am trying to control LEDs connected to Arduino from Python through serial communication. I am attaching both codes in Arduino and python. But I am not getting any response from LEDs when I run the code in Python, though I am not getting any errors. Maybe I am making some mistakes in the syntax?This is the code to control LEDs from Python in Arduino. Arduino code is below
I don't know Python but the problem seem to be the following: arduino.write(b'c'). You keep on sending the "c" character. Shouldn't it be sending whatever is in the c variable?
As Blurry Sterk said, you're sending the character 'c' instead of the variable c. Apart from that your code has too much repetition and delay function does nothingFor example, your python code could be much simplier like this:Your arduino code can be more readable too if you use an array for the leds and use the absolute value to access the index of the array, similar to the logic in the print statement in python
as Mr. E pointed out, the delay function does nothing. Maybe you wanted this:That would in fact, delay the processing of instructions. Is this the best way to achieve that? I don't know.
