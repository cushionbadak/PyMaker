Assertion Error Received when I type a number that is not 4 digits.
except ValueError or AssertionError: should be except (ValueError, AssertionError):When you do or you are not catching the exception AssertionError
Let's analyze a code structure. I've added parenthesis to denote how Python interpreter groups statements.Let's check what happens to definition of exception to catch. Quoting official docs:The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned."If x is true" actually refers to x being true in boolean context (value of x.__nonzero__() in Python 2, x.__bool__() in Python 3). All objects (including classes) are implicitly truthy, unless implemented otherwise.After taking in consideration boolean context of classes and quoted docs about boolean operations, we may safely asssume that (ValueError or AssertionError) evaluates to ValueError.To catch multiple exception you need to put them in tuple:
