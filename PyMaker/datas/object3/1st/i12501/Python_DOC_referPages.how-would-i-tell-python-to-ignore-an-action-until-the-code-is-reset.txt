I asked a question earlier and got a quick and perfect answer, so I thought I would ask for advice on the next part of my project.Basically I am trying to create a "game show buzzer" type system that simply changes the background color of my window depending on who "buzzes" in first (by pressing either the right or left arrow).So if left is pressed the background turns green, if right is pressed, the background turns blue. However, being VERY new to python and programming in general, I'm struggling to figure out how to tell the program to ignore the second "buzzer". In other words if the left arrow is pressed first, I want it to ignore the right arrow until I "reset it". I currently have that as me pressing the down arrow to turn the background black again.Sorry for the super long question, but does anyone have any ideas to how I could do this? Or direct me to some sort of tutorial or information that I could read up on to figure it out?Here is my current code:
This a problem the State Pattern aims to solve. The idea is to keep track of a "state" that your methods can check to decide what to do. A convenient way to represent state in Python is through enum.Now you can store a member variable in your class to keep track of state.And design your methods around the stateIn your example, you could have a state for before and after the buzzer is pressed. That way you can design your buzzer methods to take action only when the game is in the "before buzzer" state.
