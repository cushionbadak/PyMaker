I've tried searching around and can't figure out an easy way to do this, so I'm hoping your expertise can help.I have a pandas data frame with two columnswhich gives mewhat I'd like to do is take the values from the 'NAME' column and remove then from the 'FULL NAME' column if it's there. So the function would then returnSo far, I've defined a function below and am using the apply method. This runs rather slow on my large data set though and I'm hoping there's a more efficient way to do it. Thanks!
Here is one solution that is quite a bit faster than your current solution, I'm not convinced that there wouldn't be something faster thoughThis is kind of a long one liner but it should do what you needFasted solution I can come up with is using replace as mentioned in another answer:Original answer:compared to your current solution:These get you the same answer as your current solution
You could do it with replace method and regex argument and then use str.strip:Note You need to pass notnull to testing.NAME because without it NaN values also will be replaced to empty stringBenchmarking is slower then fastest @johnchase solution but I think it's more readable and use all pandas methods of DataFrames and Series:
I think you want to use the replace() method that strings have, it's orders of magnitude faster than using regular expressions (I just checked quickly in IPython):If you need further speed improvements after that, you should look into numpy's vectorize function (but I think the speed up from using replace instead of regular expressions should be pretty substantial).
