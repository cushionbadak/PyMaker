Natural Text
When I input [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] the output is => [4, 3, 2, 1, 8, 7, 6, 5].It seems like the only thing different from a working solution (comparing here) is that instead of a sorted list, I have a k variable that I am incrementing, and update arr[k] in place of sorted. Why doesn't this work? And how does updating arr[k] work? It seems like you would be losing data by updating the original input array.
You should just assign to left and right variable as you function return the sorted list after sorting also in the base case you should return a list and use // for integer division check this code
