I have a list of lists as followsI want to normalize this list in such a way that for every, 'a', 'b', 'c' etc, I have only one unique entry in the list, and for every duplicate list, the second value which is the quantity is added so that I get something like:How to do this with Python ?
I'd suggest use collections.defaultdict() like below:Output:Also you can use a try...expect instead of collections.defaultdict()...if you'd like:Also, you can try if...else:
here is a long way to do it, but returns a list, not a data objecthopefully that helps!
