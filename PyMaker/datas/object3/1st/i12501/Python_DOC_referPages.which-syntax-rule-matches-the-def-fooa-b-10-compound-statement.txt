The formal syntax for parameters in function definitions is as follows:(#[num] added by me for clarity)Where |, according to the notation, indicates alternatives.I can't see how exactly it matches the following function definition:The obvious rule where one would suppose a definition of the form def foo(a, *, b=10) would fall under is #[2] which allows for the * notation to seperate keyword-only parameters.  But the rule for foo, from what I would of thought, would have to be a combination of #[1] and #[2]:Since rule #[1] and #[2] don't seem to match this case solely on their own. What am I missing here?
The formal syntax appears to be missing an opening parenthesis. The last closing one doesnâ€™t match anything, and if you look at the Python 2 version, it makes perfect sense:So just read it as:Someone probably replaced the ( with a | while realigning things.
Hmmm, as Pointed out by Ryan, it definitely looks like a documentation bug.This is how the actual language grammar is defined, for the function declaration syntax in Python v3.5.0Here, tfpdef is the identifierand test is the same as the expression
