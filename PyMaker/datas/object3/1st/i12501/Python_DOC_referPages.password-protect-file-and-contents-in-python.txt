I've tried doing a lot of research on this topic, but haven't been able to find a good answer yet. I know, on mac or windows to create an encrypted zip pretty easily, but for python, I cannot seem to find an easy way to take an existing file like myfile.db, and take the contents and encrypt it, then create another file, like encrypted_myfile.dbDoes anyone have some samples they could share? or good tutorials on this?I'm using Python3.Thank you.
I did not write this myself, but have successfully used it:Hope it helps.
