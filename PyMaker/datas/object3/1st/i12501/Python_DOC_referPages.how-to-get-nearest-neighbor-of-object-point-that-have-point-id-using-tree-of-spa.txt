Help me. I'm stuck. I have a class of point. The attributes of that class are lat, Long, point_id, name. There some points that has same Lat, and Long. So, i need point_id as points identity. Actually, I want to get nearest neighbor of my point using tree of kdTree. I have no problem when I construct kdTree, but when I want to know my point nearest neighbor, the result is list (Lat,Long) of nearest neighbor whereas I want point_id as my result because there are some points have same Lat, and Long. This is my code: Please give me any suggestion? 
Use a dict (or collections.defaultdict) to record a mapping from (lat, lng) tuples to lists of Points.Armed with this dict (let's call it pointmap), given a (lat, lng) you willbe able to look up all the Points at that location.The keys in the pointmap dict are (lat, lng) tuples which we can form into a NumPy array to be passed to spatial.KDTree:Now, we can iterate through each location and findthe nearest points:Note that query_ball_point returns a list of indices (that index intolocations). The actual locations are given by locations[indices]. Here we'retaking advantage of NumPy fancy indexing -- made possible because locations isa NumPy array.For each location in location[indices], we can now obtain a list of Points by looking up the associated point using our dict, pointmap:Putting it all together:yields output like:
