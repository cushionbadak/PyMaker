I want to know if a number in a list is found j times consecutively ,this is my list :And this is what i wrote :But this function will check if any number is found consecutively,i want to add another parameter to this function so i can specify what number i want to look for in the list .n means there are n rows and columns and j is how many times is how many times the number needs to be found .
Your requirements are unclear. However, this would be a slightly modified version of your code which would yield what I believe you're seeking.target is the number for which you want to know if there are j consecutive entries.
No need for the n argument.
There are a few problems with your code:the n parameter is not needed, you can get the size of the list by using len(list)you should not use list as a variable name, as it shadows the builtin list functionwith for x in range (n-j) you are assuming that each sublist has the same number of elements as the parent listyour function also returns True if the number appears more than j times in a rowyou are doing lots of double work by using three loops instead of just twoYou can fix this, and also add the parameter for the number to be repeated, as shown in the other answers. However, using just loops and conditions, the resulting code will be very unwieldy.Instead, you can create a function as you describe using any and itertools.groupby. groupby groups equal numbers, then you just have the check the len of those groups and see if any is long enough, and whether it's the correct number, for any of the sublists.This will return True if num appears exactly count times consecutively in any of the sublists.
