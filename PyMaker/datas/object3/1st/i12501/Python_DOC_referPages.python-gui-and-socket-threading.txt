i am working on a piece of software and got some major problems (i am new to python)...The app should deal with some tasks from a .csv. When the program starts, it should read the file and displays the tasks nicely in a GUI. In the GUI are some tools like editing, deleting and moving certain tasks.There is also running a socket server which sends sorted tasks to clients.Both of these functions are working, but not parallel.Everytime a client connects to the server the GUI crashes. I know this happens because the socket is blocking the process and i need to create a separate thread for the GUI, but i can't figure out how to do it.I stuffed all the Tkinter-Code for the GUI in one function and tried threading.Thread(target=guiStart, args=()). But then the GUI stopped working due to error messages like "Calling Tcl from different appartment" (working on OSX, but should also run on Win) and some undefinied global variables from functions modifing GUI-stuff...I have no Idea what to do, i read so many threading example code but i cant figure out how to solve my problem.Is there anybody who can tell me what to do?Here is my Code (without my threading attempt):(there is also another little bug i cant get rid of: see here
I suggest you look into asyncio and use asynchronous sockets as opposed to spawning a new thread per connection.  This will remove all ideas of "blocking" from reading/accepting from a socket.  Asyncio handles a lot of the tough stuff when it comes to asynchronous file I/O but takes a little time to get used to the whole "Future" concept.  I recommend you give the documentation a read.
