I am using pandas(0.17.1) and have a data frame containing some binary data(for images) Trying to write this to a csv I am encountering issues with encoding. encoding="utf-8" which I use for most frames I am saving results in a unicode decode error but leaving that out gives an Ascii error. Is there a specific value I should be sending to encoding to allow for storing of this binary data?python 2.7.10 is the version being used
I would suggest base64, but I think you need to encode the data before .to_csv() like so:See docs.
