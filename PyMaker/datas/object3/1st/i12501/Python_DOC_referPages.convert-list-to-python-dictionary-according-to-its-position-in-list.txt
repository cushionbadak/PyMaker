I have a list like this:and I want it to convert it into dict object likeI have currently implemented the following code:But this gives the output {'alphabets': {'2': 'C'}}. Does anybody know how to deal with this bug?
That is because you are updating the dictionary.Warning: I have used normal dictionary. There is no orders in them you could use ordered dictionary if you want. Code:Output:Notes:The issue in your program  was you were always updating the key alphabets to a new dictionary.That is why you got c:2 since that is the last updated dictionary-What I have done is created a dictionary with key alphabets
You could do it with dict comprehension:If you need an order you could use OrderedDict from collectionsOr onliner suggested by @cezar:
You can use zip too though it does not maintain order.
