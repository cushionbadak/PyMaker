When I running the program I get this error: What am I doing wrong?Thank you so much and yes I have python 3. With the change as you sad to import the codecs, I now get another error insteed. ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequenceWhat sholud I do? any suggestions? 
You’re reading your file as though it were encoded in ASCII, but it’snot. Given the 0xc3 I would say it’s probably encoded in UTF-8.So, you need to open it with UTF-8 encoding:This all assumes you’re using Python 3, in which strings are Unicode bydefault. Since you had no problem with non-ASCII identifiers, that seemslike a safe assumption.
As far as i know, you have to type English letters in order python be able to read it. so you need to change these variables:Edit: max() is to give a maximum of a list and in string case it will break it to letters and give you back the maximum letter in alphabet, like so:   Note it wont work on single integer you will get error, but you do have pass list to it.your code is fine, just the document you are feeding to, might has some mistakes init, I see your application expect at least 4 column but never use the 4th column which the file type of it doesn't really matter, but i believe your document should be like so:example of your document should be like so:Note: if you have string in second or third column that could cause the error, string can't convert to float as well as random.normalvariate wont take string.
