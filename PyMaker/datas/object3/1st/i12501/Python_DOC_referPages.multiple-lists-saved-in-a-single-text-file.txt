Natural Text
I have a text file with the following info (each condition in a separate line):I have implemented the code to remove 2s and 4s and their respective timings (see below) and all I want is to resave this info in another text file!However, out of all 15 (or so) attempts this morning I only managed to save the last line (DOWN_adc up 1752.8) in various ways: normal, vertical instead of horizontal, all characters "glued" together etc. etc.So I kept the most basic write method here now. I understand that all the previous lines get deleted by the next line so only the last one stays, but I can't figure out how to prevent this.Here is the code:So, how do I save the data like this again each condition in a separate line (angle brackets, commas etc. are not a problem)?
The call to write() is outside of the for loop, therefore words is only written to the file after the loop has ended. By that point, it contains whatever was in the last line read.Change your code to something likeNo need to call output.close(), that's what the with block is for.
