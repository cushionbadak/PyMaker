I'm trying to implement a simple TicTacToe game, but i'm unable to make a shallow copy of a certain list.Here's a minimal extract from my script, that presents my problem:Although i assign new value only to sim, the change is reflected in the "main" board. I also triedandbut both give the same result.Any suggestion what i'm doing wrong?
Arpegius' comment is right. You have a nested list. With sim = self[:], sim = list(self) or sim = [item for item in self] you get a new outer list, but it will be a list of the same references to the inner lists.or would have worked, butis more elegant and its purpose is easier to comprehend. See its documentation.
