Natural Text
I have a string text="0000001011001100"I want to convert this string into a 2 byte array something like this (b'\x00\x02')But this is not working and giving an error that int requiredI have converted the text to int but then the entire string changesI need help on this
You can convert text to integer and then you can use struct modulesee: https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html
You need to convert the binary representation into an int with base 2if you are using python 3.x and want to convert the text into a bytes object from a string of any length by splitting up each 8 characters:but for your example it gives b'\x02\xcc' so it is possible you want something different
