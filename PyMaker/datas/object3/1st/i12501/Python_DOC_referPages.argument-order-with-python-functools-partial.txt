I am trying to using multiprocessing with pool.map to speed execution of a function, but the iterable is not the first argument for that function.  Lambdas won't work because they aren't pickleable.  I tried to use functools.partial to create a new function, but it fails with a TypeError.  Below is a very simple example with the same result.  If I switch the argument order to f(i, s1, s2), it works as expected.Why does the argument order matter here?  It is not obvious to me when I read the doc.What are my options (other than the obvious of changing the original function)?Update:The best I can think of is to create a wrapper at the module level to switch argument order, then a partial from the wrapper.  Doesn't look pretty or seem pythonic at all.
The order matters because pool.map is invoking f(i, s1='a', s2='c').You could write your partial like this:If you are using python3.3, pool.starmap is available to you:
