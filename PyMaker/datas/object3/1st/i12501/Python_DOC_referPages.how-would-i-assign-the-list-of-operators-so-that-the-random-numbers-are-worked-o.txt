How would I assign the list of operators so that the random numbers are worked out to tell the user if they're correct or not?The code that needs to assign to the list of operators is...It should work out the answer to each question using the function I'm telling the program that if the operator from the operator list is * to work out Number1*Number2The current output for telling them if the answer is correct or not prints Your answer is incorrect, the correct answer is Number1*Number2.when if the question is what is 10*3 it should be printing Your answer is incorrect, the correct answer is 30.Now that I have this code...The program always prints that the question is incorrect even with the correct answer inputted, it will then print the correct answer, how would I make it so that It would tell them if it's correct too?
