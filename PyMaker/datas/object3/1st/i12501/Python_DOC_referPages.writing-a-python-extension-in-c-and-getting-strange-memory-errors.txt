I have a Python class I've written in C called pyquat.Quat, and it includes methods for multiplying by another Quat, returning a NumPy array (Quat#to_matrix()) and for printing the representation.Sometimes when I call these methods, I get a SIGSEGV. However, the segmentation fault never occurs when I'm running the program in GDB.Although I can't seem to trace the problem, I am seeing some weird cases of memory being overwritten (apparently). For example, here's my script and output:I've been doing a lot of searching, but I have no clue why it would be overwriting the caller with a string here.The function in question is:and my type looks likeI'm fairly certain I'm correctly including numpy, and creating both my module and my class:My repr method seems pretty typical, too, but I notice that this method also occasionally causes obj to be overwritten.This is one I have some concern about. It's returning self — but why does the multiplication function, which also returns an object, not also cause Python to echo the repr for the object?Edit: After some investigation, it looks like the problem only happens when I call the in-place normalization routine. Do I need to increment or decrement some reference counter here?Here is the multiplication function:Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might debug this more effectively, or see what the problem could be?
You said that by Py_INCREF some values before returning them from your methods, the problem seems to disappear.Inspired by your discovery, I found the problem:You are Py_DECREFing arguments. You should not do that! Refcounts should be increased and decreased only when objects are stored somewhere.
Okay, I think I found a solution.The problem is in my in-place functions, which also return self.For example,I had to add a Py_INCREF(self) since self is both an argument and the return value.This appears to fix the problem.
