I'm making a polynomial class but can't get the add and scale function to work properly. The scale function should work by multiplying the coefficients of the polynomial by a given x. For example if y=2x^3+4x^2 and x=2, then y=4x^3+8x^2The add function should just add like terms of two polynomials.I've added comments to the code to hopefully explain how I was trying to get the functions to work
This is not what you are looking for:With that multiplication you are growing/shrinking the list.Because your coeffs is an iterable. This is what you want:And this:Can possibly better be expressed as:
