X, Y and Z are the three coordinates of a cuboid.Now X=1,Y=1, Z=1 and N=2.I have to generate a list of all possible coordinates on a 3D grid where the sum of Xi + Yi + Zi is not equal to N. If X=2, the possible values of Xi can be 0, 1 and 2. The same applies to Y and Z.I have written this below code so far, and it is giving the output as : however the expected output isBelow is my code, what is going wrong in my code?
range is actually a half-closed function. So, the ending value will not be included in the resulting range.If X=2, the possible values of Xi can be 0, 1 and 2In your code, range(X) will give only 0 and 1, if X is 2. You should have used range(X + 1).You can write the same, with itertools.product, like this
Another approch with itertools.product and list comprehension:
try this:as range function doesn't include the ending value and stopped at (n-1)th position so if we use range(X) here it will result just 0 hence +1 should be used to print the list in lexicographic increasing order.
