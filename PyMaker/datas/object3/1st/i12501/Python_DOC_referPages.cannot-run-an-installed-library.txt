When I do:Where XYZ is a library and boo is function on that library, and xyz are the arguments I pass to the function.I recieve an error ending withWhat is happening?Note: this is intended to be the canonical answer for several questions about the same topic but with different libraries implied 
Name your source files carefullyMake sure no Python scripts, modules, or packages in the current directory have the same name as a built-in or third-party module that you intend to import. Really it's best to avoid name conflicts altogether.Say you want to experiment with Python's turtle module. You decided to name your script turtle.py, and write:When you run it, you receive the error:The problem is your turtle.py is interfering with the import of the built-in turtle module. The statement import turtle actually imports your local turtle.py script instead of the built-in one.There is a simple way to verify this is the problem. In the traceback, the very last file mentioned is /path/to/your/directory/turtle.py" which indicates you did not import the built-in turtle module. The built-in turtle should be located somewhere similar to /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/turtle.py on Linux, or C:\PythonXY\Lib\turtle.py on Windows.To fix this problem rename your script to something else such as myturtle.py.
Make sure you use the version of the library with such attribute.If correctly imported you can explore the attributes with dir(XYZ) Otherwise this error is due to an undesired import.The module python is importingXYZ is one you created in the same folder or in the %PATH as XYZ.py and not the desired library. Or it is the same file where you are calling the library.You should rename that module to avoid any conflict with existing packages and remove the *.pyc files. You could rename as XYZ_test.py or any other name avoiding conflicts with installed libraries. Then you should be able to do:
