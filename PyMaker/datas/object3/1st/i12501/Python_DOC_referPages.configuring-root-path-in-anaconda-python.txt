I have Anaconda 3 installed in /opt/anaconda3/ and the Gurobi optimising software installed in /opt/gurobi650/. I want to be able to load the Gurobi libraries after having started /opt/anaconda3/bin/python (i.e. the Anaconda python - not the system python) with the import gurobipy command. Currently, anaconda python does not search there as the codesuggests - it returns a list of libraries in the anaconda directory. The command import gurobipy works with /usr/bin/python however - as this uses the PATH environment variable.I realise that I could append the Gurobi directory to sys.path, but I want to alter the root sys.path of Anaconda because the library should be accessible by default.In the normal system environment, this is a simple matter of altering the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables with files in /etc/profile.d/. What would be the analogous solution for using Anaconda python?EDIT: To import gurobipy, it's actually /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages that needs to be added to sys.path, not anything in the /opt/gurobi650 directory.EDIT: This is on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04).
You can always add it to the environment variable PYTHONPATH, which will be prepended to sys.path:It's a hack to add /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages to your sys.path when using Anaconda's Python. The Anaconda distribution is different from the OS version, possibly in ways that can cause you some headaches.
