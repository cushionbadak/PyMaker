Is there a way to use the logging module shipped within python to rotate the log file? Like that in logrotate?I used logrotate but it gave some bizzare result.
I suppose this could help you.Yes, you can similary to logrotate in Linux rotate logfiles in Python too. Following is a small example from the link above:The output of the script is:The most current file is always logging_rotatingfile_example.out an each time it reaches the size limit it is renamed with the suffix .i. Each of the existing backup files is renamed to increment the suffix (.1 becomes .2, etc.).This is just a show example. In real life scenario you should set the maxBytes to an appropriate value.Source: Python Docs (the listed above article, in case the link gets broken)
