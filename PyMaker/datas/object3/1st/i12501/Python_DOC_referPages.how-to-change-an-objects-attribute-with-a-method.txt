I have this code that stores a person's name, age and funds. I am trying to write a method that can take "age" or "funds", along with a number, and increase the given attribute by that number.a.increase_age() works fine: calling it increases the age of Andrea to 33, just as expected. However, a.increase_attrib("age") gives an error, saying AttributeError: 'Actor' object has no attribute 'attrib'. a.increase_attrib("funds") gives similar results.If I just say a.increase_attrib(age) (without the quotes) I get a NameError, which is what I expected.By my understanding, giving the parameter "age" to increase_attrib() should mean that the attrib mentioned becomes age, so that increase_attrib() references self.age instead of self.attrib. Apparently, I was wrong.Now, I could just use increase_age() instead, but then I'd have to make different methods for age and funds, and even more methods once I add other features to Actor, like location, gender, and nationality.What do I need to do so that I can pass the name of an attribute to a method and have it change that attribute?
You are looking for setattr:Is the same asSo for your example:
