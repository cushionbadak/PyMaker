Consider the string 'X Y Z' and the substitutionThis returnsWhen it could have returned 'X ' as well.  Obviously it took the first thing it matched, substituted, and afterwards the pattern for the other alternative no longer matched.Is there a way to tell the substitution to prefer the longest substitution?
According to Python re documentation - Regular Expression Syntax, | part,A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression  that will match either A or B. An arbitrary number of REs can be  separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see  below) as well. As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|'  are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches,  that branch is accepted. This means that once A matches, B will not be  tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In  other words, the '|' operator is never greedy. To match a literal '|',  use \|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|].Position the longest pattern before the shorter pattern:
That would beâ€¦
