This question already has an answer here:Cartesian product giving a dictionary                    1 answer                Operation on every pair of element in a list                    3 answers                I have two lists:I want as output a list of dictionaries:etc.So the objects don't repeat, but the descriptions may. Each dictionary has as its keys the original list of objects.I'm not sure of the name of the algorithm I want, so I'm having trouble finding the correct one. (I've looked at permutations of two lists in python, but that's seeking a different result. Permutations of two lists is the same question, but using OCAML.)
You could use itertools.product to generate all possible combinations of your descriptions. Then create a dictionary with the objects as keys and the "combination" as values:
