I have multiple classes happily communicating thanks to x being an object of class foo:now I create an object X being an instance of class fooI have a Screen as a part of a ScreenManager containing a Label with id vystupWhat I am trying to do is to write function on_propname with X.a as a propname. How do I point to value belonging to instance of other class.I have read:WarningBe careful with ‘on_’. If you are creating such a callback on a property you are inheriting, you must not forget to call the superclass function too.But as its common with kivy's documentation it does not tell you how.
Kivy Properties are declared at class level, not in an instance. (bad)Binding to a property and using an on_property event are two different things.You can check for an instance in each of the function with isinstance because of the instance argument passed into each event/bind of a Kivy property mentioned here.
