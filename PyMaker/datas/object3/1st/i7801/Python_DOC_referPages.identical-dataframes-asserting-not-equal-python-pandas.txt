I am trying to unit test my code. I have a method that given a MySQL query, returns the result as a pandas dataframe. Note that in the database, all returned values in created and external_id are NULL. Here is the test:Here is the console output (note the print statements in the test code. The manually constructed dataframe is on top, the one derived from the function being tested is on the bottom):AssertionError: DataFrame.iloc[:, 3] are differentBy my reckoning, column 'created' contains three string values of 'None' in both the left and right dataframes. Why is it asserting not equal?
Python also has a built-in constant None that is different from the string 'None'. From the docs:None The sole value of the type NoneType. None is frequently used to  represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not  passed to a function. Assignments to None are illegal and raise a  SyntaxError.In the case of comparing None  against 'None' (None == 'None') the result will be False. Therefore, assert_frame_equal will raise an AssertionError if one of the DataFrames contains None  but the other contains 'None'.
