I just started to learn Python 2.X. I am trying to encrypt a file using Python. Professional users all are using pycrpto, while I am just doing a simple project to explore some of the basics in python's open file in "rb". Here is the code:The error message is:The error is the same if I remove "b" from the open file statement. I have been reading couple of related questions here but still could not get a clue. Can anyone help me here? Why my code is not working? What is exactly inside the result of a file opened in 'rb' mode?
Your error is unrelated to open. The error message says explicitly that the problem is with int function being called with 'P' as an argument. Since 'P' does not represent a binary number, int fails.
