is there a way to import multiple python files into a main python file?I have a bunch of py files and each one has to run in the main python file and the data are saved into a json file. This is what I tried and it gave me an error.Error:I have also tried specifying the path to the py file and it didn't work either and keeps giving an invalid syntax error. Update: I managed to fix the import error but i now, after importing this light.py file, i have to print out certain keys from a dictionary (key) into this new file then export it to a json file. I'm currently using TinyDB to do so. Here are my codes: Error: NameError: name 'lightkey' is not definedThe problem is I had already defined 'lightkey'  in its own file already.
