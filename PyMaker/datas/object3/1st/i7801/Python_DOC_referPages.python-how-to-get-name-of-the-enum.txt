I have an enum like thisThen I have a method that takes the enum key name Code_1 and enum key value successful response as inputs.If I send testEnum.Code_1 then that resolves to successful response and not Code_1.I checked some documentation online that suggests to use testEnum.Code_1.name but that throws an error saing that 'name' doesn't exist for the enum item.Does anyone know how to get the name of the enum key ?
I suspect that what's happened is that you're using the outdated pip-installable library called enum.  If you did, you'd get something likewhereas with the "real" enum (either enum in the standard library if you're using modern Python, or the enum34 backport if you're not), you'd seeYou can confirm this independently by typing help(enum) and seeing whether you see "NAME / enum / MODULE REFERENCE / https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/enum" (as you should) or simply "NAME / enum - Robust enumerated type support in Python" if you're using the older one.
You can start your investigation with the __dict__ that comes with your object. Interesting reading is found with In that dict you will see a good start which you can test with the following:which, indeed, yields
dir(testEnum) will give you the dictionary keys.e.g.returns:['Code_1', 'Code_2', 'class', 'delattr', 'dict', 'dir', 'doc', 'eq', 'format', 'ge', 'getattribute', 'gt', 'hash', 'init', 'init_subclass', 'le', 'lt', 'module', 'ne', 'new', 'reduce', 'reduce_ex', 'repr', 'setattr', 'sizeof', 'str', 'subclasshook', 'weakref']
