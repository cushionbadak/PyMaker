I'm new to Python and I was trying to get a "price tag String" to get converted into a float, so I can easily compare the result with other prices.I searched for 2 hours for a answer for this "simple problem", but none of them fitted my needs.So basically, I have a price like this:(comma and period swapped because I live in Germany, which is also pretty annoying)And I want to get this for easy comparing:The main idea is to compare prices, which is my school project.I used to do everything with php, which worked, but was way too slow.  If you have a more elegant or simple way, please let me know.
This work for the specific case you provided:It requires:Periods in price are only separators;Only one comma in price and is just a decimal mark;The price comes first and is separated from other strings by a whitespace.Just to mention in case people need more generalized solution, hiro protagonist's answer using locale is very helpful when you need a simple way to switch between numeral systems during coding or when maintaining your codes.
you can use your (or any) locale to convert a string to a float:depending on your default locale you may not even have to specify the locale.in your case you may need to split the currency (EUR) part away:note: it may be enough not to setLC_ALL but just LC_NUMERIC to what you need.
If your string is "1.222.333,44 EUR"If it is just like this "1.222.333,44"
