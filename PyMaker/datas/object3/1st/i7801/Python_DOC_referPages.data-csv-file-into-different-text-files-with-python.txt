Natural Text
I'm a beginner in programming, but for a Dutch text categorization experiment I want to turn every instance (row) of a csv file into separate .txt files, so that the texts can be analyzed by a NLP tool. My csv looks like this.As you can see, each instance has text in the column 'Taaloefening1' or in the column 'Taaloefening2'. Now I need to save the text per instance in a .txt file and the name of the file needs to be the id and the label.I was hoping I could to this automatically by programming a script in Python by using the csv module. I have an idea about how to save the text into a .txt file, but I have no idea how to take the id and label, which match the text, as the file name.Any ideas?
The csv.DictReader should be able to do what you need:
