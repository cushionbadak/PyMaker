I have import.py script. I want to extract some code into a separate file, say, m1.py:When I switch to absolute import, it works. But I don't want accidentally importing other module. I want to be sure module from script's directory is imported. How do I make it work? Or what am I doing wrong?
If you're not overriding the built in modules. By default, python looks first in your current directory for the file name you want to import. So if there is another script having the same name in another directory, only the one you have in the current directory is the one that will be imported.Then, you could import using the absolute import.You can check this post out, for more infrotmation about importing in python.To make sure that the one your importing isn't the built in. You can create your own package in the current directory for example,"my_package" and have your module m1 moved in it. Then you can import by:
Add __init__.py in the directory where m1.py is.EDIT : Run it as a package from the previous working directory. cd .. && python -m prev_dir.import
