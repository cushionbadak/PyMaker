I would like to sum up a particular amount of numbers from a list. Can someone tell me how to do it?Kind regards Marcel
You can use python's list slicing (assuming rets.dropna() returns a list). rets.dropna()[:10] will be the first ten from the list.See more examples of this syntax in the python docs tutorial.
