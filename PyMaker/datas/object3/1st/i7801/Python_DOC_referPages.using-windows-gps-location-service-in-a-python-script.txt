I have been doing some research and can't find any information on the topic. I am running a Windows 10 version that has a GPS feature for apps to use, this can be enabled or disabled by the user. I want to know how to access and use it through a python script, assuming it is even possible. Note: I don't want any solution to get the location through an IP geolocation service. Much like using the gps service of a mobile device in android apps. Preferably python3 libs and modules.
On one hand, from the Microsoft Location API documentation you will find, LocationDisp.DispLatLongReport object which has these properties:AltitudeAltitudeErrorErrorRadiusLatitudeLongitudeTimestampAnd on the other hand by using Python pywin32 module (or ctype module), you will get access to the Windows API (or any Windows DLL), so finally you could get the Lat & Long as you want.If you need help, to use the pywin32 module you may take a look here.If you need help, to use the pywin32 module you may take a look here.
