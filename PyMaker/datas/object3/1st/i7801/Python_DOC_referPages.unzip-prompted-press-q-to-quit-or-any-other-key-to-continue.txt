I want to write a Python script to automatically unzip lots of apk files and then do static analysis. However, when I unzip some apk files, unzip prompted that "Press 'Q' to quit, or any other key to continue". Because it's a script and I haven't press any key then the script hangs. Any command option can solve this problem? Or do I have to handle it in Python? Thanks in advance :D
You don't say what the structure looks like, but for a single use of unzip you can try this:
I just ran into the same thing and figured out what's causing it. Turns out, if a zip file has a zip comment attached, it will be shown, along with a prompt that hangs your script.Passing -q to unzip will avoid showing the comment and any hangs, though you will lose the list of files being unzipped too. I haven't figured out how to just prevent the comment from showing up and not the rest of the stuff unzip prints.
