I have the following python code:The output isI don't quite understand why I need to escape the character 'v' after "(.+?)" in regex0.  If I don't escape, which will become regex1, then the matching will fail.  However, for space right after "(.+?)" in regex3, I don't have to escape.Any idea?Thanks in advance.
So, there are some issues with your approachThe ones that contribute to your specific complaint are:You do not mark te regexp string as raw (r' prefix) - that makes the Python compiler change some "\" prefixed characters inside the string before they even reach the re.match call."\v" happens to be one such character - a vertical tab that is replaced by "\0x0b"You use the  "re.VERBOSE" flag - that simply tells the regexp engine to ignore any whitesapce character. "\v" being a vertical tab is one character in this class and is ignored. So, there is your match for regex0: the letter "v" os never seem as such.Now, for the possible fixes on you approach, in the order that you should be trying to do them:1) Don't use regular expressions to parse HTML. Really. There are a lot of packages that can do a good job on parsing HTML, and in missing those you can use stdlib's own HTMLParser (html.parser in Python3);2) If possible, use Python 3 instead of Python 2 - you will be bitten on the first non-ASCII character inside yourt HTML body if you go on with the naive approach of treating Python2 strings as "real life" text. Python 3 automatic encoding handling (and explicit settings allowed to you when it is not automatic) .Since you are probably not changing anyway, so try to use regex.findall instead of regex.match - this returns a list of matching strings and could retreive the attributes you are looking at once, without searching from the beggining of the file, or depending on line-breaks inside the HTML.
There is a special symbol in Python regex \v, about which you can read here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.htmlPython regex usually are written in r'your regex' block, where "r" means raw string. (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html)In your code all special characters should be escaped to be understood as normal characters. E.g. if you write s - this is space, \s is just "s". To make it work in an opposite way use raw strings.The line below is the solution you need, I believe.
