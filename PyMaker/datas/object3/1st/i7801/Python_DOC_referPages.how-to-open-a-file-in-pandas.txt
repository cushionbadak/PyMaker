Having difficulty opening a csv file in pandas, I have tried:That did not work, so I tried:and that doesn't work either, just says that file does not exist, but it's there in the file manager clear as day.
os.getcwd() return the current working directory without trailing path separtor.You should use os.path.join instead of + to correctly join paths:BTW, there's no need to specify full path of current working directory; just specify sample.csv should be enough:Make sure the file sample.csv is in the current working directory.
