My web application works with datetime(s) as timestamps, which according to Django's error messages need to be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:ss[.uuuuuu]][TZ].I display these timestimes on multiple occasions on the web application, where they're displayed in the following format: 12. June 2017 10:17.Now, the user is able to choose and submit the displayed timezones, which are then processed by the server. The server then error's because the format isn't correct.How do I convert the format printed by Django on the web app (12. Juni 2017 10:17) to the format, required by Django for further processing (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:ss[.uuuuuu]][TZ])?edit: Currently trying to create a datetime object of the received data, then convert it to the required format.Which results in the following error:
Your issue is that "%y/%m/%d %B" doesn't match the pattern '12. June 2017 10:17'You can try using the following to parse the date correctly:Or with:You can work out what percentage values to use from this useful table in the documentation here
Yes it expects the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:ss[.uuuuuu]][TZ] so the Valid values are:This should do the trick:output:which is in the valid accepted format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM[:ss[.uuuuuu]][TZ])
(12. Juni 2017 10:17) is in Pseudocode:day. month in locale full name year with century hour:minuteTo convert this into a datetime object with strptime use:to convert back, use the equivalent strftime, with your format string.
