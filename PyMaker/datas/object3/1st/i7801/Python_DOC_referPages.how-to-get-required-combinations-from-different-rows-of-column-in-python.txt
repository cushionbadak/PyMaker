I am trying to get the different required combinations out from dataframe column with few rows.It is something like below:I have following values in one of the columns of my dfHere oy,on belong to group 1,Now I am trying all the combinations from each value of the each group ranging from 1 value to all like below:This will be for all possible combinations.note that within group combination is not desirable like g1 and g2 cannot come in same combination.I know that this is possible with for loops with some if conditions.But looking for more efficient and elegant solution.
I think you may want to itertools.product on the various groupings. To get the groups you could do (col here is the name of the column describe above). This gives a mapping from the first letter (lowercase) to an array of the unique values starting with that letter (lower or upper case). Then you can do itertools.product(*groups) to get all six-tuples containing one member from each group. To get all combinations of, say, the g and o groups, you can do itertools.product(*groups[['g', 'o']])
