Just wanted to know what having a variable or a condition before the for loop does in any case, so in this case what does 'b' for i in range do.
Since b = True, zs.extend([b for i in range(k)]) is effectively zs.extend([True for i in range(k)]) or zs.extend([True, True, ..., True (k times)]).Update. I'm assuming that the intended (indented) code is the following:Then if xs is, say, [2, 1, 3], then:after the first for-loop execution (so called "iteration"), zs = [] + [True, True] = [True, True] and b becomes False,then zs = [True, True] + [False] = [True, True, False] and b becomes True, finally zs = [True, True, False, True, True, True] and b becomes False.So if xs == [s, t, u, v, ...] then zs is True s times, False t times, True u times, False v times and so on.
