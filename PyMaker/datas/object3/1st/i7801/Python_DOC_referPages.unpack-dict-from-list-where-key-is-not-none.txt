Trying to unpack the dicts which are not None from a list:Tried a dict comprehensionAnd a list comprehension:Expected result:What is the right syntax?
You are trying to unpack either a dictionary or None to two variables (key and value). You can't unpack either type in this way. None is not iterable, and iteration over a dict would yield only the keys, not the values.Loop over the dictionary items if there is a dictionary, otherwise loop over an empty sequence, and unpack the iteration results:The d.items() if d else () expression produces either an iterable of (key, value) pairs from a (non-empty) dictionary, or an empty tuple (causing that nested iteration to stop immediately).Demo:
FWIW, you can do this with a for loop and successive calls to dict.update, which I think is quite readable: 
Using the built-in function filter:Assuming you actually do have a list of dicts or None, as per your example:Or in one line:Or if your input was supposed to be a list of tuples, then it's quite easy, and similar to what you were attempting:
