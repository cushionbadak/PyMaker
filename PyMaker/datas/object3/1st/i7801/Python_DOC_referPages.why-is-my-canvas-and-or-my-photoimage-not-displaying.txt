I don't know why my canvas is not displaying. There is a reference to it, self._screen, and it is being packed, but it does not display at all. What am I missing?
You have a few problems from what I can see.Unlike other programming languages you don't use ; at the end of a line of code. You don't need to place m = Map(20) or root.mainloop() in a function. You also need to define a tkinter window so add root = Tk() to the start of your program. Take a look at the code below and let me know if you don't understand something.
