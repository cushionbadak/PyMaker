How can I pass both objects in each other?For example:If I do this it will say Unresolved reference "obstacle"And I do understand why, but is it still possible to pass obstacle in player?
You cannot pass obstacle to player because at the beginning there are no obstacles. You should create an empty player, create an obstacle and assign the obstacle to the player:Please note this creates a reference loop which is a problematic for garbage collector to cleanup. Consider using weak references to create mutually referencing objects.
