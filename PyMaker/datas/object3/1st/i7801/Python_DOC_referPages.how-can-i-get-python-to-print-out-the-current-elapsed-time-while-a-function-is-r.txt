So I currently have python printing how long it took for a function to run after its done running with something like:but I want to show the live time that has passed since the function has started, and I cant quite figure out a way to get that to happen.for example in a terminal I want it to say something like:Any help would be appreciated.
Here's an example with a thread that will print how much time has elapsed since it started and can be stopped from the main loop.This gives the following output, with the Elapsed Time counting up from zero and being overwritten:Note that this code is in Python 3. More info on stopping threads here & here.Let me know if you'd like clarification on any portions.
