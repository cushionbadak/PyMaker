I am still fairly new to the python world and know this should be an easy question to answer. I have this section of a script in python that calls a script in Perl. This Perl script is a SOAP service that fetches data from a web page. Everything works great and outputs what I want, but after a bit of trial and error I am confused to how I can capture the data with a python variable and not just output to the screen like it does now. Any pointers appreciated!Thank you,Pablo
I am not sure what your code aims to do (with var in particular), but here are the basics.There is the subprocess.check_output() function for thisIf your Python is before 2.7 use Popen with the communicate() methodYou can instead iterate proc.stdout but it appears that you want all output in one variable.In both cases you provide the program's arguments in the list. Or add stdin if neededThe purpose of stdin = subprocess.PIPE is to be able to feed the STDIN of the process that is started, as it runs. Then you would do proc.stdin.write(string) and this  writes to the invoked program's STDIN. That program generally waits on its STDIN and after you send a newline it gets everything written to it (since the last newline) and runs relevant processing.If you simply need to pass parameters/arguments to the script at its invocation then that generally doesn't need nor involve its STDIN.In Python 3 (since 3.5) the recommended method is subprocess.run()
