I am trying to write some code to allow a user to download a .csv file with the results bases on their search when they press a download button. I would like to include the date in the default name of the csv file but can't get it to work. The relevant code in views.py is:This returns a default filename 'results_+str(date)+_.csv'.
You messed up your ' and ":This will work. I would suggest this though:Also consider using strftime.
