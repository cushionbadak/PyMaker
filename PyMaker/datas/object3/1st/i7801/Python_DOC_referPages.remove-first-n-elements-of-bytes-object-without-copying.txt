I want to remove elements of a bytes parameter in a function. I want the parameter to be changed, not return a new object.What's the solution here?
Just use a bytearray:It's almost like bytes but mutable:The bytearray class is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. It has most of the usual methods of mutable sequences, described in Mutable Sequence Types, as well as most methods that the bytes type has, see Bytes and Bytearray Operations.
Using a bytearray as shown by @MSeifert above, you can extract the first n elements using slicing
