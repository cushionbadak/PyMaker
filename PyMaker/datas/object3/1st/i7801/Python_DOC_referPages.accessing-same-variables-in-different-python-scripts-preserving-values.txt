I have below scriptsscript1:script2:script3:script2 will execute first then script3In script3,  script1 is importing so all values update as per script 1 I am expecting var1 to print 30 and var2  print ['1', '2']So what is the best way to use variables in this case.
As I understand the question, script2 and script3 are ran independently of each other, i.e.Then, no, changes you make to variables of script1 in script2 will not be persisted after the program has finished. However, if you have another script, call it script4.py, that executes both ofscript2 and script3 within the same program...... then the changes will be persisted (im memory) and script3 should print 30 and ['1', '2'] as you expected.If you want to store variables between program execution, I suggest you have a look at json, or some other persistence module for Python, for storing data on disk or in a data base.
