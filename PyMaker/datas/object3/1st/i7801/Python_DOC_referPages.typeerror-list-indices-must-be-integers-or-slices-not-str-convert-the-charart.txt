want:input 2want: but the result is:TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
Do:inputNum3 = int(input())to get an Integer, you can't access lists by a String as index.Your variable names should start with lowercase. Generally snakecase too, with all lowercase separated by underscore:You don't need the .join() here because you want to have just a single character anyway.You can also fill your number list like so:number = [x for x in range(20)]This is called a list comprehension.Lastly, you can just do print(number) if you want to print the full list, no need for the for loop.If you want to print all list elements from index x to y you can use list slicing:number[3:15] for example.See here for more examples of slices.
In Python3, input() returns a string. In Python2, however, input() returns the type you are looking for, an integer. Therefore, you need to cast the input() function to an int, since you are obviously trying to assign a value in the list by index. 
input function accept values as string.
