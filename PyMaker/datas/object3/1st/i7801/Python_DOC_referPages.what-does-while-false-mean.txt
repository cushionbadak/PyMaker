I don't undestand how this code works:what does while False? What does it have to be false? I don't get it...
A while loop checks the condition (well, the expression) behind the while before each iteration and stops executing the loop body when the condition is False.So while False means that the loop body will never execute. Everything inside the loop is "dead code". Python-3.x will go so far that it "optimizes" the while-loop away because of that:Gives the following:That means the compiled function won't even know there has been a while loop (no instructions for line 3-6!), because there is no way that the while-loop could be executed.
means that it will loop forever.means it won't execute.
it is saying if something is not true do this. for example:meanwhile.
