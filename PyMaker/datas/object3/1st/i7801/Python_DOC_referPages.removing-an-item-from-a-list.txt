I would like to remove to ignore duplicates in my list. For example, let's say the function checks for words that end with a ''.'' and puts them in a list. I would like to make sure that duplicate words don't go in the list.Here is what I have so far Please note I am using Python 3.
How about you check if the word is already in the list before appending it, like so: You're trying to check if word == list, but that's seeing if the word is equal to the entire list. To check if an element is in a container in python, you can use the in keyword. Alternatively, to check if something is not in a container, you can use not in.Another option is to use a set:And to make things a little cleaner, here is a version using set comprehension:If you want to get a list out of this function, you can do so like this:Since you said in your question you want to check if the word ends with a '.', you probably also want to use the endswith() function like so:
After statementyou can't use built-in list class and to understand that you can spend about an hour or so, that's why we avoid names of built-ins for our objects. More at this answer.function checks for words that end with a ''.''Statement checks if word contains dot symbol (e.g. "." in "sample.text" will work ok while it simply doesn't end with dot), if you need to check that it ends with dot – use str.endswith method.I would like to make sure that duplicate words don't go in the list.just make sure before storing one that it hasn't been stored already.Finally we can writeTestP. S.If order doesn't matter – use set, it will take care of duplicates (works only with hashable types, str is hashable):or with set comprehension
You can add a sample judge for the question.
Why not use a set?
The less verbose way to do it would be using list comprehension, that isAnd to ensure the elements aren't duplicated, just use set.
