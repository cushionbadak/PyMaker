There's a website that has 13 pages of midi files that I want to download and I can't download hundreds of files by hand so I'm wondering if there's any way of getting all the downloadable files with python.here's the website's url: http://midkar.com/jazz/jazz_01.htmleach page in the website has a list of links and they start downloading when you click.I wrote a for loop to go through all the 13 pages like this:but this is pretty much all I've done and I would appreciate some help.
you should learn to use the requests module to get the pages, and the BeautifulSoup module to get the actual links by parsing the html of those pages, then take those links and download them with the requests module once again.can't write the entire code for you, but here is where you should start:requests: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/BeautifulSoup: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
You can write a simple web crawler with Beatutifulsoup and requests.
