Natural Text
Suppose I have a line like:Where the match pattern "foo" is always contiguous to non a-zA-Z characters but may occur any number of times in a line. I want to replace all occurrences of "foo" with "bar" when foo is not contiguous to an a-z or A-Z character and output a newline.Where foo and bar are both variables I am passing in. Sort of like:Output:I'm not sure how I configure my re.sub
That should do what you are looking for.  re.sub takes requires 3 params.  What you are replacing, to what, and the text.  The \b is a word boundry. notice the Hellofrancis won't change as per your request to contigious.  I also escaped your foo and bar so if the data coming in has regex characters like a period it won't mess with your output.
