Is there a pythonic way to have a custom iterator on a namedtuple?A custom iterator appears to require an index attribute. Normally a namedtuple has a "__slots__ = ()" declaration, which avoids the overhead of a dynamic dict and reduces latency in attribute lookup. However, this breaks the iterator (AttributeError: 'Path' object has no attribute '_iidx'). Adding _iidx to the slots results in nonempty __slots__ not supportedContext: I will be working with a large number of Bezier splines. Each spline consists of a list of 'knot' points, and list of pairs of control points. By commenting out the __slots__ = () declaration, my code works. But, at the cost of having a per-instance dynamic dict. The overhead from the dict in attribute lookup is probably negligible compared to everything else, but it doesn't seem pythonic.The SVG method uses the iterator to make SVG formating trivial. This:Results in:But it also is trivial to use in the on_draw(self, wid, cr): of a Gtk.DrawingArea:Note: the 'knots' is a List[Point] and 'ctrl_pts' is a List[ControlPoints]:I am very new to python and I am certain this can be done in a more pythonic way.
To make your code work as is, add _iidx to the attribute list in the call to namedtuple().Note that inheriting from a namedtuple class makes further sub-classing less useful because inheritors can not add new attributes. This may or may not matter in your application. As an alternative you can inherit from object and call out the attribute names in __slots__. This will preserve much of the performance benefits of inheriting from a namedtuple, and make it so that inheritors can define new attributes in their __slots__.Changes below include:__iter__ now returns a generator that manages looping for you so you don't need _iidx anymore. Check out itertools for interesting ways of creating iterators. Defining __next__ is often more work than is necessary.The svg property now accumulates strings in a list and then joins them. This is usually faster than the increment operator on str.The last bit is changing the svg property to lowercase. This is purely style but it is more in line with the core language's style guide. .
Rather than implementing the iterator protocol manually, make __iter__ a generator for the values you want.  The generator object implements the iterator protocol for you.If you only expect __iter__ to be used as part of SVG, you really don't need it, and can use something like this:
