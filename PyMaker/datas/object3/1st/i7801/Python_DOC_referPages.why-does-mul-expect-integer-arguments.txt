I'm getting TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.  It appears __mul__() is expecting an integer only argument.  Did I not define it correctly?EDIT:Now that I understand what happened I'd like to clarify the answer for anyone who might run into this in the future.The problem was here:Which, for the purpose of this explanation simplifies to:or Here b is a tuple and c is a number, a real number.In Pythonresults inIn other words the * operator applied to a tuple results in the replication of that tuple N times.  Which also means we can't multiply a tuple by a float, it makes no sense.  Hence the error:Makes sense.My error was in that I multiplied the tuple by self.magnitude rather than to multiply my Vector object by self.magnitude, like this:Given my definition of __mul__() this makes sense and works fine.  And this works too:
You are applying __mul__ to the tuple coordinates. That returns n copies, which clearly requires an integer. Since you've written a __mul__ function, you probably meant to call thator directly
__mul__ applied to a tuple (like your coordinates) duplicates the contents of the tuple to increase its length, and hence only makes sense with an integer.You're trying to multiply eavh element of an array by a number. If you make coordinates a numpy array then the multiplication operator will do this correctly. If you want to keep coordinates as a tuple then you will need to iterate through it multiplying each element individually (e.g. like in the __mul__ function you define for your vector class).Personally I recommend using numpy arrays if possible - they'll make a lot of the maths you're doing quicker and easier if used well.
