I've been stuck on a line of my code for a while, and I'm at a loss as to why it returns as it does.This returnsWhereas my goal is a return ofMy previous solution was to loop through the list with an increasing value for the index, and to individually check each entry in word against the guess, and to replace the board list at the same index, but I feel that there is a more concise and pythonic way using lambda, I just can't quite get it.
The problem is the list.index method which returns the index of the first match:list.index(x[, start[, end]])Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item. [...]If you're also interested in a solution: You could simply iterate over both word and board:Given that you want to "replace" you could also use a normal for-loop. That way you would avoid creating and discarding lists all the time:
You can use list comprehension:This will give you:
You're probably looking for something like this:
You can use list comprehension as mentioned in the answers, but in your code board will always reset with every guess. I'm guessing you want to keep track of the guesses till all letters are guessed (or till number of guesses) so your loop should have a temporary list and then loop through board to add the new guesses(if found) something like:
