I am trying to write a FTP client software in Python. I tried implementing a method to rename directories:However I keep getting this error:I am sure I have the permissions to rename the directory. Can anybody please help? Thanks for the help in advance.
Do not call retrlines, use sendcmd. For the final RNTO, you can even use voidcmd to validate the operation even more strictly (requires 2xx response).retrlines is used for commands that make use of a data connection. I.e. typically for a directory listing, like LIST, NLST, MLSD. While RNFR and RNTO are trivial FTP commands that only return status.
