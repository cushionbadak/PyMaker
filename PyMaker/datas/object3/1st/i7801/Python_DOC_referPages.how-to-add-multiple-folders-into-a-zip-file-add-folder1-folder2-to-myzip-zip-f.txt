I have been trying to add multiple python modules into a zip file. However, I am unsuccessful as the the newly added module is replacing the previous one and I don't understand the relation. command_utils adds a util file and the next command_utils2 adds another module after which the entire first module is gone. Basically I want to add 2 of my modules to a zip file after making the zip file out of source code. Here is my code.
Using zipfile module: Notice I used a  mode for the zip file not w: If mode is 'a' and file refers to an existing ZIP file, then additional files are added to it. If file does not refer to a ZIP file, then a new ZIP archive is appended to the file. This is meant for adding a ZIP archive to another file (such as python.exe). If mode is 'a' and the file does not exist at all, it is created.
