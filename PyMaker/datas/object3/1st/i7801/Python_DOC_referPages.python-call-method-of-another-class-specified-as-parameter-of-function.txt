Natural Text
I know the simplified example below is embarrassingly ugly ... hence why I have come to SO to share it with the world.I would like to be able to call a class method from cls, specifying the particular method within callmethod.Is there a way to go about this without creating a (possibly large and cumbersome) dict that links a string form of each method to the actual thing?
What you're looking for is likely just:You can think of a.b as a syntax sugar for getattr(a, "b")
