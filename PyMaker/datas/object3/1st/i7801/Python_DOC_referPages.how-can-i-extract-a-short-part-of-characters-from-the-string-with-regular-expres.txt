This question already has an answer here:My regex is matching too much. How do I make it stop?                    5 answers                Here is my code:and I got the result:If I want to get the result only the first half wish I m, how can I revise my code?Thanks a lot!
In regular expressions, . means a single character and .* means any number of characters (0 or more).When you used w.*m, by default, python will look for the longest sub-string that starts with w and ends with m.This is called GREEDY MATCH.To find a smaller sub-string in a string that starts with w and ends with m, you have to search NON GREEDILY.For this, instead of using w.*m, use w.*?m .Because of the ? operator, python matches the first sub-string that is given by the regular expression.Technically, ? Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE. example : ab? will match either a or ab.So, Here, w.*?m will match minimum number of characters after w(included) that ends with m(included).Read more about REGULAR EXPRESSIONS here
Use .*? to match non-greedily.
What are you trying to accomplish here? Your regular expression means it will match any of the followingYou are pretty much saying it should match any phrase that starts with w and ends with m.wish i m appears twice in the phrase as highlighted below"I wish I may, I wish I mightHave a dish of fish tonight."So if that's the phrase you are looking for, your result should be wish I m, wish I m. For that result you'd need this pattern - w[\w\s]*m.  So instead of a greedy .* you are limiting the matched characters to words \w and spaces \s which is all that is in will I m.Again, it depends on what you are looking for.
