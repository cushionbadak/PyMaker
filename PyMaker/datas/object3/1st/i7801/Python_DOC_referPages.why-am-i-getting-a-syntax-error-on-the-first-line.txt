Natural Text
I copied this straight from my textbook and it still won't work. Thanks in advance. 
The problem why it is not working is because you wrote Def instead of def. Python is case sensitive like many other languages. Also, have you used indents with your code? Please add 4 lines to include this code in your main function.This would probably be the corrected version.
Uncapitalize def and add 4 spaces at the beginning of each line after a : except for that last main() that should be on the left.
