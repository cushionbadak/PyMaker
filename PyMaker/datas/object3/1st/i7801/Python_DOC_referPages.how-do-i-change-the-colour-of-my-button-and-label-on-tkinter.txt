My task is to create a label and button on Tkinter. The button has to change the label, and I have to change the colour of the button and the label. I have changed the colour of the background but I can't figure out how to do the same for the label and button.
So configuring a buttons colors is a bit different when using tkinter button VS a ttk style button.For a tkinter button you would use the background = "color" argument like the following:For a ttk button you would configure the style and then use the style = "style name" argument like the following.More information on ttk configs can be found hereResult:
From Python, Tkinter, Change of label colorThis will change the label color of a button:button1.configure(foreground="red")I assume the same approach can be used for the label.
