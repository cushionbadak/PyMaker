This question already has an answer here:How accurate is python's time.sleep()?                    9 answers                The final line prints the result normally but sometimes it gives a result less than 1 (0.9962501944182808 or 0.9886929485969909 etc.)If I have made the code sleep for 1 second with time.sleep(1) I would have thought that the result would always greater than 1.It is not precise so how can I calculate time consumed by my code with built-in modules?
From the documentationThe actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any  caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that  signalâ€™s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer  than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of  other activity in the system.Also, you can read this answer about the sleep function's accuracy.
