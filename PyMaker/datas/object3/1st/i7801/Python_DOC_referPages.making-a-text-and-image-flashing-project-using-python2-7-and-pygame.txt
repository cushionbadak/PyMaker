Natural Text
I am working on a art project for school using python2.7 and pygame.The effect I want to achieve is having rectangle containers scattered at random places on the screen. Each contain display while iterating through a list of chars (e.g. a to z, or alphabet in other language), or a list of images.I am new to programming, and so far I have figured out how to use pygame's font and image to display image and text on display, but I m really lost in the "update" part. say I am iterating through a to z, and want to display it in the same container flashing through a to z, where or how should I put it in the main while loop?
Here's one solution (for the letters from a-z): Store the letters in a list or another container (I just use string.ascii_lowercase here), then after some time interval or arbitrary amount of frames increment the index, modulo by the length of the container (to keep the index in the correct range) and then rerender the font and just blit the returned surface.
