I have an original config file that has a string:In my program, I grab a similar config from another computer.  This similar config has a string:I want to read the new number which is 1 and replace the original config with the number 1(replaces 5).I am getting an error in my program that says:Any ideas?
In your readConfig function, this line performs a search:match = re.search(r'(?<=boothNumber=")\d+', line)and the value of match is used in this line:sys.stdout.write(re.sub(pattern, match, f2line))There are two problems here. Firstly, if the search is unsuccessful match will be None, causing to the exception that you report:Secondly, if match is not None, you are trying to use match itself as replacement string, but match is not a string, it's a match object:You need to call match.group() to get the string that has been matched:To summarise:condition the output processing on match not being Noneuse match.group() as the replacement string
