I am not really familiar with Python yet.I have a string like "11223300". Now I want to increase the last byte of that string ( from "00" to "FF"). I tried to convert the string into an integer ( integer=int(string,16)) and increase it, and convert it back later, but that does not work for me. Maybe one of you guys has a better idea.Now I want to convert the IV from hex into a stringThanks!
You can use format to convert int to your hex string, which will not keep the 0x prefix:Output:
So are you literally wanting to change the last two bits of the string to "FF"? If so, easyEdit from comments
