In this script I have used both list comprehension and for. I need to replace for loop with comprehension and add this solve inside list comprehension.How can addinside this block My code:
You should not be using a list comprehension at all, nor the for loop you have now. The loop is inefficient; by using list.count() you are traversing the whole list l for every unique value, creating a O(N^2) loop.Use a collections.Counter() object instead and count in O(N) time:or evenif you insist on a single line.Note that sum() doesn't mind a few 0 values here and there, so I removed the if test for single 'socks'. Also, I used the // floor division operator rather than turning the floating point result of dividing by 2 back into an integer.
