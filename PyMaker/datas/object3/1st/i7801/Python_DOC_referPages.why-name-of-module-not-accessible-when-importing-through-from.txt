Natural Text
I observed that even if you import modules in python through from e.g whole module is loaded. It can be seen in sys.modules dictionary. So why the name of the module b is not accessible to our program. What am i missing? It looks like namespace of the main(top-level) file does not have module name. But I can not verify this as I am not able to see main file namespace. It also does not feel ok, just to remove one entry from __dict__ without many advantages. Can somebody clear this in detail?   
Because that's what that syntax does; it only imports the names you specify, not the containing module. If you want the module itself, just do import b.
