I have a list like:I want to write this lists into a CSV file like :I used following code to do this:But it writes into the CSV file asHow can I make this code do as I expected?
For python 3:Use writerow to write a row taken from a list(iterable)or Use writerows which takes an iterable (an iterable is anything that can be used to iterate so your my_list is an list iterable) and takes rows and saves them accordinglyFor python 2:with open('mycsv.csv','w+') as fileobj:use wb instead of w+The output in mycsv.csv is:Also note i used w+ as mode here which truncates that is empties the csv file if already exists or creates a new one and writes content to themThere are several modes to write use one for your need.Take a look at the File modes documentation for pythonOn Windows, 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode, so there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb', and 'r+b'. Python on Windows makes a distinction between text and binary files; the end-of-line characters in text files are automatically altered slightly when data is read or written. This behind-the-scenes modification to file data is fine for ASCII text files, but itâ€™ll corrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE files.
