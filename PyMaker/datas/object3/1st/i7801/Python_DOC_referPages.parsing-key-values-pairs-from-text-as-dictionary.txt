Natural Text
I'm still quite new to Python and I was wondering how would I convert something that is already in key:value form in a text file into a Python dictionary? Eg. (each key:value on a separate line)I've looked at other posts but none of them seem to work and I know I'm doing something wrong. So far, I have:
Iterate over your file and build a dictionary.Or, if you're looking for something compact, you can use a dict comprehension with a lambda to split on colons.This approach will need some modification if the colon is surrounded by spacesâ€”perhaps regex?
The straight-forward way to do this is to use a traditional for loop, and the str.split method. Rather than reading from a file, I'll embed the input data into the script as a multi-line string, and use str.splitlines to convert it to a list of strings, so we can loop over it, just like looping over the lines of a file.outputBe aware that this code will only work correctly if there are no spaces surrounding the colon. If there could be spaces (or spaces at the start or end of the line), they you can use the str.strip method to remove them.There are a couple of ways to make this more compact.We could use a list comprehension nested inside a dictionary comprehension:But it's even more compact to use the dict constructor on a generator expression:If you aren't familiar with comprehensions, please see List Comprehensions and Dictionaries in the official tutorial.
Assuming the textfile has the stated 'key:value' and the name of the file is contained in the variable fname you could write a function that will read the file and return a dict or just use a simple with statment.  A function is probably a better choice if this opertion is performed in several places in your code.  If only done once a 2-liner will do fine.Both suggested solutions uses a built-in dictconstructor and a generator expression to parse each line. Use strip to remove white space at both start and end of the line.  Use split create a (key, value) pair from each line.
