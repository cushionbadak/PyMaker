im trying to find the mistake in my code.My IDE (Coderunner on Mac) only says this:I never had this exception. I don't know how to handle it and where the problem is. What I am doing wrong? This is my code... I commented line 27.
You need to do for key, count in trigrams.items(): to iterate over the keys and the values together. Iterating just over the dictionary only yields the keys.
When your doit is equivalent to:This is what Python does behind the scenes when you iterate over an iterable. As you can see from the above code, a function call to the __next__() method of the trigrams dictionary's iterator is made when trigrams is iterated over. The __next__() function only returns the next key in the dictionary though. eg:So when you try to unpack the return value of iter(trigrams).__next__(), Python raises an error because only one value is returned, not two. eg:To fix this, you need to use the dict.items() method to return a tuple which contains a key, value pair which you can then unpack. From the documentation on .items():Return a new view of the dictionaryâ€™s items ((key, value) pairs). See the documentation of view objects.
