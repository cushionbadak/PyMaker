i write this code to sort the element of an array but iam getting this error    line 9, in     if(a[i]>a[j]):    IndexError: list index out of range    the same logic for sorting array elements work with java or c correctly.     help me to find why this is happening in python .     is this due to python syntax or another
first you don't need to write list sort method yourself python does it for you. and second no need of third temporary variable to swap value between two variable in python simply a,b=b,a will swap value between a and bthe above code works sorts in ascending order.for descending order change the > to <.it is better to use builtin list sort methods and sorted function to sort any list.
Here is some improvement to your current code:Demo:PS: I recommend you using the Python built-in sorted(), or list.sort() which is a in-place list sorting
