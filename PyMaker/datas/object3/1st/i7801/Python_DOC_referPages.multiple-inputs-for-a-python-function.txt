This question already has an answer here:Can a variable number of arguments be passed to a function?                    5 answers                I am starting with Python, and trying to make a function.The one i am in trouble is:What i want to know is if it is possible to give multiple inputs like and how can i do it.I apologize if it is an obvious question.
Python has specific syntax for this. It is commonly referred to as *args. When Python sees this in a function definition, it allows the function caller to pass in a variable amount of arguments to the function.The variable used in the *args syntax - which is a tuple - can then be used to access the arguments. In your case you can simply loop over the arguments and process them accordingly.It is important to note you may name the args in *args anything you want. I renamed it dirs(short for directories). And while it is common practice to simply name it *args, in my opinion it is much better to rename it to fit each specific case. That way, you can clearly convey what kind of arguments your function expects.
Either pass your variables as a sequence such as a tuple or list. Or use the splat operator * to unpack a variable amount of arguments.i.e.Sample Output:
You can use a variable arguments variable with *directorynames and use a for loop in the function:Regards.
