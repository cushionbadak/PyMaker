I am trying to implement Euclid's algorithm in Python3.If max(a, b) returns the object with the largest value in (a, b), why can't you operate on that object like so:max(a, b) %= min(a, b)
The interpreter has spoken. You are trying to operate on a value/object, which is not possible. Assignments can be performed on variables only, which are references pointing to said values/objects. Even if you could do it, it's pointless, because you're trying to change the return value of a function, that hasn't been captured by any variable. You can't even use it.
I believe the short answer to your question is no. The function max(a,b) is returning the largest value to you, not a variable reference to the largest value. I believe what you are looking for is:which will check if the largest value is indeed the variable a before the assignment. 
You can only assign to variables, but there's no way for a function to return a variable. (It can only return a value.)For example:max(a, b) returns the value 5, not the variable b. (So the code you're trying to write is essentially 5 = ... which makes little sense.)
You can't do like this, the function max returns a value, not a variable, what you can do, however is to execute:then, after this line, a will always be the greater value (or equal b)this way you can just do in the line after:Since b will be the min value...
