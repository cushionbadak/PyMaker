As a newb to python and pandas, I tried:returned no rows, butdid work and returned rows containing 'y' in df['x'].What am I missing? Why did the first form fail? (Python 2.7) 
These are different operations:The in check searches if any element is equal to 'y'. (note: For Series of strings that may not even work correctly).The .str.contains method searches the string-representation of each element if it contains 'y'.The first one can only return True or False (that's because Pythons data model says so and enforces it). The second one is a normal method and returns a Series containing True or False (because normal methods can do what they like).
Pandas requires specific syntax for things to work. Looking for a str y using the operator in checks for membership of the string y in a pandas Series.Try this and notice it returns one bool instead of three (like we might first think since there are three items in the series):You always need to think to yourself: "am I looking for items in a series, or am I looking for strings within the items within the series?"For items in a series, use isin:For strings within an item, use .str.{whatever} (or .apply(lambda s: s)):
