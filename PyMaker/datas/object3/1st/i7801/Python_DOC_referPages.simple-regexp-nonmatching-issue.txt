This question already has an answer here:Reference - What does this regex mean?                    1 answer                Python regex string matching?                    2 answers                What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                Can someone help me with what seems like a simple reg exp question?  I am using python 2.7.13.  I don't understand why the second test does not match(no match)
You want re.search().From the (DOCS)Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).
