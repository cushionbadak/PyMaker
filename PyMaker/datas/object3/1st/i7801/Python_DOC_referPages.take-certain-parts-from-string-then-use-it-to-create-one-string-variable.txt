I'm trying to create a variable that's a string from a listThe list is just the alphabet (Don't ask why, it just has to for the program)Basically, I used to have a variable that took 4 random letters from it to create one string that looked like this:What I need is 4 specific characters from the list to create the same kind of string variable, the word "STOP".An answer to this would be greatly appreciated, I'm trying to recreate the hacking minigame from Fallout, if any of you know what that is, thanks!
I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do, but...To create a string variable equal to "STOP":The line of code doesn't create a string variable but a list of strings 4 items long, each item being a 1-character string.  Using x as defined above, the expression x == correctPassword will always be false.To consolidate those into a single string:A comparison x == correctPasswordAsString will be true if correctPasswordAsString is "STOP", false otherwise.
You can just create the variable as the following:correctPassword = ["S", "T", "O", "P"]Or, you can use the indexes of the letters:correctPassword = [passwords[18], passwords[19], passwords[14], passwords[15]]
You can use this for create a string variable from list:and get something like:STOPThe Python join() method is a string method. It merges a list of objects into a string.
