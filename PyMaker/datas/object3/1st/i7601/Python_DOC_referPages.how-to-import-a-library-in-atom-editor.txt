I'm new to Atom Editor and I have tried importing libraries by just including "Import pygame" or "Import kivy" at the top of my code. However when I run my code it makes an error messages saying that there are no such modules with that name. What's the proper way to make the editor import a library or a framework? 
No such modules error is related to Atom. Make sure that you have installed the necessary package in your virtual environment and run the application by activating the virtual environment.Simply put, if you want to install Python packages, use the following the command in a terminal:You can also read this Documentation example on the subject.Once they are installed, then you may import them in a Python script.
