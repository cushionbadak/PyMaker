My input:This is just an example, but the real data follows the same structure.Why is my output always a, and never come on!?
data_current.index(i) will return the first match, so for '0.0' index is always going to be 0.Use the enumerate() function to provide a running index instead:Take into account that index + 1 can be outside of the range of valid indices.
