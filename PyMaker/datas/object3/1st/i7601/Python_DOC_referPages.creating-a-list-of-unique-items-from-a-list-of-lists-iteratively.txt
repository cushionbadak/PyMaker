I'm trying to create a list of unique items from a list of lists by selecting one item  from each list, and if an item in a list is already in the unique item list, then select the second  unique item and so on.See list and my attempt below;my output: [1, 2, 2]Expected output: [1, 2, 3]Only one item to be selected from each list, hence the appropriate solution should be able to produce the same result for this example [[1, 4, 3], [1, 2, 5], [1, 2, 3]] Any ideas? thanks.
With the restrictions you mentioned this code should work - The second loop iterates over elements of the inner list and check if they are already present in uniquelst. In case they are not present, add the element and break from inner loop.One thing I forgot to mention is that this code assumes the elements of inner list are in sorted order. If that is not the case, please sort inner list using sorted() or sort() before the second loop

With set object and itertools.chain(iterables) function:The output:
Does this help you?
