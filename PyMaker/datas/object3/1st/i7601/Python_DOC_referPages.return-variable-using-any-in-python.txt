Is there any way to return a variable using any?Without using Any:With Any (Getting error since punctuation isn't initialised):
No, any() only produces True or False. If you need the matching elements, don't use any(), instead filter (like you did with your for loop).You could use a list comprehension first to do the filtering:or if you only need the first matching element, use the next() function and a generator expression:The second argument to next() is returned if the generator expression doesn't produce any values; so here None signals there was no matching punctuation (so any() would have returned False).
No, any() can only return True of False, if you need a variable use filter()
