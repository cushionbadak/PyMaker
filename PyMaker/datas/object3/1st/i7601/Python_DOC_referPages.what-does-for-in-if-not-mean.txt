This question already has an answer here:What does “list comprehension” mean? How does it work and how can I use it?                    4 answers                There's a function I don't get:What does the last line mean? At first I thought it was "apply the function to W except the ones with name bias", but I'm not sure.
This is a list comprehension with a condition. It has nothing to do with Tensorflow, it's just basic Python.Conditional list comprehensions take the formThis iterates over all elements in <list> for which <condition> is true, assigning each to <name> in turn, evaluating <expression>, and making a new list of the results. It's equivalent toexcept that the list comprehension is cleaner code and possibly a bit faster to run.
It represents list comprehension expanded as the following:It is iterating through each item in v passed as list in group_regularizationThen, checking if string 'bias' is not in W.nameand then, doing(whatever) operation for tensorflow.
Let's break it down, it's convention in python:
Yes it is a list comprehension with a condition. List comprehensions can have multiple conditions.The general format for a list comprehension with a if condition is this,You can also have an if..else in the comprehensionNOTE: Your iterable can be list,tuple,set,string,...etcTo make things clear consider this simple example,Assume this is your v from your given code, also for understanding purposes let's say Wname is something similar to W.nameNow suddenly you decide I want a list x which has items from v but not in Wname. Hmmm... How to do that? Take a look below.Somewhat along these lines is what's happening in the code you mentioned above.
