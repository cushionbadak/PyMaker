This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                I have a number of functions called func_1, func_2, ... I'd like to call each of them in a for loop.I could do:but I'd like less typing. Is there any way to generate the names, something like:This fails with 'str' object is not callable, but is there anything like this that works?EDIT: I'm testing a number of alternative versions of func. They are all supposed to give the same result, but with different implementations. I control the inputs and this is not in production.However, this is bad and possibly dangerous practice in other contexts. See the comments and answers.
You could look them up in the local scope:The locals() function returns a dictionary of names to values in the local scope. If they are global functions, use globals().
You can use eval. However it is very dangerous to use eval. Be careful while playing with it.
