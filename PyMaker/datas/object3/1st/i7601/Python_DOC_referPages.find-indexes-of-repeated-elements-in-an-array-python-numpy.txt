Assume, I have a NumPy-array of integers, as:I want to find the start and end indices of the array, where a value is more than x-times (say 5-times) repeated. So in the case above, it is the value 22 and 6. Start index of the repeated 22 is 3 and end-index is 8. Same for the repeatening 6.Is there a special tool in Python that is helpful? Otherwise, I would loop through the array index for index and compare the actual value with the previous. Regards.
Using np.diff and the method given here by @WarrenWeckesser for finding runs of zeros in an array:This can then be filtered on the difference between the start & end of the run:
There really isn't a great short-cut for this.  You can do something like:I leave the not-found exceptions and longer sequence detection to you.
Here is a solution using Python's native itertools.CodeTestsThis example captures (index, element) pairs in lst, and then groups them by element.  Only repeated pairs are retained.  Finally, first and last pairs are sliced, yielding (start, end) indices from each repeated group.  See also this post for finding ranges of indices using itertools.groupby. 
If you're looking for value repeated n times in list L, you could do something like this:
Here is a relatively quick, errorless solution which also tells you how many copies were in the run. Some of this code was borrowed from KAL's solution.
