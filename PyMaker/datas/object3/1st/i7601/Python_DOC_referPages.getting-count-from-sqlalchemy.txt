I have:The returned object is sqlalchemy.engine.result.ResultProxy.How do I get count value from res? Res is not accessed by index but I have figured this out as:There must be an easier way right? What is it? I didn't discover it yet.Note: The db is a postgres db.
While the other answers work, SQLAlchemy provides a shortcut for scalar queries as ResultProxy.scalar():scalar() fetches the first column of the first row and closes the result set, or returns None if no row is present. There's also Query.scalar(), if using the Query API.
what you are asking for called unpacking, ResultProxy is an iterable, so we can do
The ResultProxy in SQLAlchemy (as documented here http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html?highlight=execute#sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy) is an iterable of the columns returned from the database. For a count() query, simply access the first element to get the column, and then another index to get the first element (and only) element of that column.If you happened to be using the ORM of SQLAlchemy, I would suggest using the Query.count() method on the appropriate model as shown here: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/query.html?highlight=count#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.count
