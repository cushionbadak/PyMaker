When I create a class instance, if I print the instance name, I get the memory address, like the code below:The output is:I sense that I could do a lot with this information, but I can't find information of what I can do. For what I should use this memory address? I can store this to some database just referencing the memory address?I appreciate any information of the possibilities for this.
You don't. It's an opaque value, letting you distinguish between different instances. It happens to be the memory address, but that is an implementation detail.What you see is the hex conversion of the return value of the id() function:Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory.Note the implementation detail note there.The ID is included because just plain <Car object> is not nearly as helpful when you have more than one instance. You could also supply your own __repr__ implementation to make that string a little more useful for your application; you could make it return a reproducible expression, for example:Now the representation looks like this:which may be a little more helpful when you are debugging.
