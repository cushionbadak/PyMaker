I created a function in one file, and want to access it while running it in another script in python ( for example- in MatLab, you create a function as a file, and can access it in other programs )
It looks like you are in initial stage of learning python.Basically in python, we have modules. what it is ?ModuleIn basic terminology, it is a python file which is a collection of functions or classes or bothPackageThis package is a collection of modules where it should have __init__.py in this so that python treats that this is a python package and provides the PYTHONPATH track for this if you set the PYTHONPATH to the root of the projectFor your question, yes you can have function in one module and can be imported in another module. see the example below:Save this above function in testone.py and create module called testtwo.py and import the above functionoutput:Python is very simple. try learning and see the power of dynamic typing.
You don't really need the location of the module.It should be somewhere in the PYTHONPATH or in the same directory.You import it by the command import and then you can use it. I suggest you read up on modules and how the import works in python: python3 import
