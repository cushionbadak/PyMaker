Natural Text
My input1:Expected output to print my input2:Expected output to print  my input3:Expected output to print  Below is what i tried:
Just call join passing in your list and if it is only one element, it won't add the "comma":output:output:output:If you have a list of integers, or a mix of strings and integers, then you would have to call str on the integer parts in your list. However, the easiest way to go about doing this would be to either call map on your list (map will apply a callable to each item in your list) to cast to the appropriate str, or perform a generator comprehension to cast to int: comprehension:map:
Just simple as:
What you type in the command for print isn't exactly what comes out. Basically the commas in the print command just separate out each item you asked it to print but don't tell it to print commas itself. i.e. The key is to create the text or string how you want it to look and then print that.
