I couldn't get the logic of how 'd' in the for loop works.Can someone explain in detail?
In your example the for-loop basically loops through the rows of the CSV file. In each loop iteration the variable d gets filled with a dictionary object that contains all data from a single CSV-file row (possibly the name d was meant to be shorthand for 'dictionary'). The keys inside d are column names from the CSV-file, and the paired values are row data values from the CSV-file.The expression d['Code'] returns the data value from dictionary d corresponding to the key 'Code'. In other words: it returns the CSV-file row data value found in the 'Code' column.
