This is the first question I am asking on this forum, so I welcome your feedback on making this more helpful to others.Say I have this list:and this dictionary:Is there a shorter, easier to read one-liner than the following?Many thanks
A more efficient (and probably more readable) approach would be this:This defines a generator which checks the IDs in order, and yields values from statistics that equal "FirstName". next(...) is used to retrieve the first value from this iterator. If no matching name is found, this will raise StopIteration.
If you look at your code in these two lines:The index of 'FirstName' in your newly created list will ALWAYS be equal to the index of 'First' in IDs. Because your list comprehension will iterate IDs in order and put the corresponding dict values in that order, you will always create 'FirstName' at the same index as 'First' appears in IDs. Therefore it is far more efficient simply to call it from that list using one of the above methods.
