Natural Text
I am trying to get data only after the page has been completely loaded; as in after the favicon turns from waiting to site's own icon. The source from where I am trying to get data from gives me 3 tables, these tables have same html so the same xpaths, i tried using:But this condition passes as soon as either table is loaded and so my script declares the other two arrays for those tables to be 'None'. Also i tried using 'EC.staleness_of' which didnt work as it passes as soon the another page is loaded i.e; as soon as the page is refreshed. I want a way by which the condition passes only after everything is loaded, not that a particular element is located.Thanks!
You can try below code to wait until all 3 tables appears in DOM
