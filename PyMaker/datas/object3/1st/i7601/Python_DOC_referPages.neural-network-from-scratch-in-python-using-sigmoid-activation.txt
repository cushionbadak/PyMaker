i am new to python,trying to learn machine learning in python.i have tried to write a neural network from scratch with one hidden layer on the famous iris dataset.this is a three class classifier with out put as one hot vectors.i have also taken help from already written algos for help.for instance i used the same training set as my testing set.it is a huge code to go through,i would like you to tell me, that how do we subtract  'y' output( which is one hot vector) of dimensions (150,3) and my out y softmax will be of vector (150,21).this is my biggest problem.i tried to look online everyone have used this method but since i am weak in python i don't understand it.this is the line of code delta3[range(m1), y] -= 1arrays used as indices must be of integer (or boolean) type if m1 is sie of(150)and if i give size m1(150,3) thendelta3[range(m1), y] -= 1TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got tuple.my code is
In Python range generates a tuple of numbers from x to y with range(x, y). If you generate something like range(10) then it is the same as (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Lists in Python need an integer index such as list[0] or list[4], not list[0, 4], however, there is a built-in thing in Python that allows access from index x to index y in a list here is the syntax: list[0:4]. This will return every value from 0 to 3 in the list. Such as if a list is list = [0,10,3,4,12,5,3] then list[0:4] will return [0,10,3,4]. Try taking a look at list data structures in Python on the Python Docs. As well as Understanding Generators in Python.I think what your looking for is something like this: delta3 = [[z-1 for z in delta3[x:y]] for x in range(m1)]. This list comprehension uses two generations both, [x-1 for x in l], which subtracts one from every element in the list, and [l[x:y] for x in range(m)], which generates a list of lists with values through x to y in a range of m. Though I'm not sure I understand what your end goal is, fully.
