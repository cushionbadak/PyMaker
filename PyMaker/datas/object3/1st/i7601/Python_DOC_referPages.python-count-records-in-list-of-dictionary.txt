But don't know how to get the count as well.Can someone please explain how this can be done? 
If you just want to count the number of times each mobile appears, the easiest way is probably with a CounterprintsCounters are a special kind of dict.  Read more here 
You can create a list of mobiles and then loop through your unique_list to update the records as the following:output:EDITA more optimized way of doing this is probably using two for-loops to update the list accordingly, or create a new list:output:If you want to create a new list, remove del complete_list[j] append the record to the new list at the end of the first loop
You should be able to get the number of elements in unique_list with len(unique_list). I believe this is the count of records you are looking for.Another solution is to use a for loop and set math to count the number of unique mobile numbers without creating the list of unique records.
