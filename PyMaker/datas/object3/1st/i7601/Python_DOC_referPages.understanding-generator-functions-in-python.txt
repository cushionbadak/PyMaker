Why it outputs None?result is:why None is printed?? not hello * 3 ?
Why it prints None:Here when you print() but doesnt return anything, python will add a return automatically at the end.Let's see an example using disoutput:Let's see now when you return an explicit values:output:See, the LOAD_CONST 0 (None) was not called the second times. Therefore, the first value being loaded was return.What you should do to improve your code:Do this, if you just need to print "hello" inside the hello function.  OR, use return value, in that case you need to return instead of printing.But it is weird to call several yield, better do a loop to avoid a StopIteratione.g
By default functions return None type. Output:What are generators?The main difference between generators and functions is that you can obtain values on the fly. And after one value is yield'ed by the generator. and next value is returned the old one is not stored in the memory. Iterating over a generatorOutput:Now using next()Output:So far so good. Right? gen = hello() here gen becomes a generator object.Iterating over a listOutput:Same output? Yes same output. But only difference here is that I can use the my_list iterable any number of times I want,Output:However if I try to use the Generator when it is exhausted.OutputHow to overcome this? Create a new generator object again and use.Output:You see the difference? Hope I was clear.
