Natural Text
I'm using a Python to transmit two integers (range 0...4095) via SPI. The package seems to expect a byte array in form of [0xff,0xff,0xff]. So e.g. 1638(hex:666) and 1229(hex:4cd) should yield [0x66,0x64,0xcd]. So would an effective conversion look like as the mixed byte in the middle seems quite nasty? 
You can do it by left shifting and then bitwise OR'ing the two 12-bit values together and using the int_to_bytes() function shown below, which will work in Python 2.x. In Python 3, the int type has a built-in method called to_bytes() that will do this and more, so in that version you wouldn't need to supply your own.
