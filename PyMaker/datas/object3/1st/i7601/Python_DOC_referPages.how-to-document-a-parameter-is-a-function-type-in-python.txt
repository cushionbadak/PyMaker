I'm using pycharm 2017.1.1 to code and I was wondering what I need to put in the :type function_param: to indicate that a parameter is a 'function'?== Edit ==I tried using function, but pycharm complains:
You can use the "callable" type.Since your parameter is a str, you can set this in the function signature.More info:https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callablehttps://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/type-hinting-in-pycharm.html
