Natural Text
In an mbox file I stored some e-mails: they can also use MIME. They must be extracted as they are in the mbox file, without modifications, with a Python3 script. I tried the following code:This seems to print the e-mails' raw contents. The e-mails in the mbox don't always use \r\n for all their new lines: sometimes they have only \n. Anyway, in the message.as_string() output always \n is used, as specified in the manual page.The manual also states (about as_string()):Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not be the most useful way to serialize messages in your application, especially if you are dealing with multiple messages.I can't fully understand what this suggestion could mean. My mbox file obviously contains several e-mails and I would like to extract all them. Above all, I would like to obtain exactly the same raw e-mails stored there, without any modification and preserving for each line its original \r\n or \n, as if I were using cat on the mbox file. So:Is my code the correct way to do this?If not, which would be the correct way?
If you want the contents without any modification, you can simply print() each message:Files with the .mbox extension are simply long plain text files: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MboxAlso check out the email module for handling email messages as an alternative: https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.message.html
