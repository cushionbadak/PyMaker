I have small doubt in organisation of module arparseFollowing code is found on python documentation onlineI assumed argparse will be module argparse.ArgumentParser() will be a class within the module so 2nd line simply create the object of that class. Next line we call methods defined in the class using dot operator. Till this point all made sense. I was thinking args will be simple variable but when args.echo is accesses using dot operator then what type is args? Is it parser.parse_args() return object of ArgmentParser() type.Apologies if question is too naive.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-namespace-objectclass argparse.NamespaceSimple class used by default by parse_args() to create an object holding attributes and return it.Try to find the argparse.py file in your distribution, and look at it, preferably with an editor that parses Python.  Almost all of the code is classes.  There several utility base classes (container, etc), but the key ones are imported with the __all__ list.It's also instructive to run your code in an interactive process and look at the objects that are created.  Or just add lots of print(parser) statements to see their respective str.creates a ArgumentParser object.creates an Action object (actually a subclass of Action, according to the action parameter.creates a Namespace object,  creates a dictionary object from the args attributes.
