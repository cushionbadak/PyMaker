Is it possible to loop over multiple iterators in a single for-statement?
There's nothing built into the for syntax for that; a for loop always loops over one iterable. You can make one iterable backed by a bunch of others, though:
This is not possible, however you can try alternatives like merging the two ranges to a single list.This should work. range(1) and range(2) are expanded to lists and you can always concatenate them using overloaded '+' operator.PS:wont work in python3, possibly because range is generated on the fly.
