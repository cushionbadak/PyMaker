smtplib.SMTP.sendmail expects its msg argument to be a str containing only ascii characters or a bytes:msg may be a string containing characters in the ASCII range, or a  byte string. A string is encoded to bytes using the ascii codec, and  lone \r and \n characters are converted to \r\n characters. A byte  string is not modified.Your message is a string, but in contains non-ascii characters; you need to encode to bytes:smtpObj.sendmail(from_add, to, email_text.encode('utf-8'))
