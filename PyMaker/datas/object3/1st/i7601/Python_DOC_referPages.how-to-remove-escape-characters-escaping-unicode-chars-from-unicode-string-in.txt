Natural Text
So how would I convert from test2 to test (i.e. so that unicode characters are printed)? .decode('utf-8') doesn't do it.  
You can use unicode-escape encoding to decode '\\u200b' to u'\u200b'.Note: But even with that, test2 cannot be decoded to match exactly test1 because there's a u'\xe2' in test1 just before the closing quote (").
