I'm developing code in ODI. My need is to get the date/time of the last modified file in a directory and check if the date/time of the last modified file is greater than 5 minutes; then copy all the files in that folder to another folder. If it is less than 5 minutes, wait for 2 minutes and recheck again.I have achieved of getting the date/time of the last modified file in a directory through .bat file. I'm storing the output in a .txt file and then loading that file in a temporary interface to check whether the time is greater than 5 minutes. I want to achieve my requirement through Python script, because I hope it will be done in a single step of ODI Procedure.Please help.Thanks in advance
