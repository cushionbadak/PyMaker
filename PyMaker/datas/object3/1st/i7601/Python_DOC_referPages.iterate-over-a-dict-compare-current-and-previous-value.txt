So, this has got me a little stumped.  I have a dict which I am trying to iterate over and I'm looking for the peak values.  The concept is here:I have tried putting this in list(range(len(data))) and iterating through that way, which works with dummy data.  However my data does not have keys like 1, 2, 3, 4.  Exmaple data:There are points in the data, where the value increases by a large value (roughly 3) and I am trying to find both the index and the value associated with those points.  Hence I'm using the next value - 2 and seeing if it is still larger than the previous as my check.  This dict can easily be a pandas data series if its easier that way.
You can keep the list of keys with in sorted order then use it to iterate overt the dictionary:    Output:
Using dataframe since you're okay with pandas  :input output
