I setup virtualenv using python 3.4.3 and tried to import JSONDecodeError from json.decoderBut it is not working. Only below is working:How I did ?
According to 3.4.x docs, plain ValueError is raised when JSON decoding fails.JSONDecodeError class is available starting from 3.5.x.
According to Docs from module json (Python version >= 3.5.0), Python which version < 3.5.0 does not support import statement like what you just did, but if you use Python(version>=3.5.0), your import statement is definitely correct.
json is the version of simplejson that has been integrated into Python. They have since been developed separately and are not the same anymore. So they cannot necessarily be used interchangably.See this answer for more details about the differences.
