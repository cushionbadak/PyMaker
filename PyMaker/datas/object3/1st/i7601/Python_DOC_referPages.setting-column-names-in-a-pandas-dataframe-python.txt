When setting a column name for a pandas dataframe, why does the following work:While this does not workWhy are brackets required around the column name? What is Python doing here?Thanks
The DataFrame constructor expects an "Index or array-like" as the column argument.['Coefficient'] is a Python list with a single entry, the string 'Coefficient'.'Coefficient' is not a list, but just a string.DataFrame accepts a Python list, but not a string, as an array-like.
