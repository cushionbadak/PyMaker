I want to split an array in such a way that I can extract some sub-elements within the column, I am new to programming and in particular python, so please help...I want to have something like:What function can I use and how?
If your array is a list of strings, where each string is a list of numbers separated by any character 'x', you can use:Each element is still a string this way. If you want the actual numbers, use:Use int(elem) if you want your values to all be integers, and float(elem) if you want them all to be floats (decimal-valued numbers).
Here's the documentation to help you on lists.
