Say I have a dictionary:How could I loop through the dictionary such I that find the difference between each value and save the results.For example, I want to (without hardcoding it) return a dictionary like the following using the dictionary above:I can hardcode it but I would like my function to be more dynamic so that I can add more elements without having to write tedious lines of code to incorporate a new element.
A workable yet ugly loop solution:
You could use itertools.permutations to generate pairs of distinct dictionary items and a dictionary comprehension to build a dictionary of differences.Outputs
What about some dict comprehension ? No need for imports and its relatively readable.(Replace the f-string with another form of concatenation if you're not in 3.6)Output
