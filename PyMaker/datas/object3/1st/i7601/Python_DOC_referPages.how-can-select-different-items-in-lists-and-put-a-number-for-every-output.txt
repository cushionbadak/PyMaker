I want to sort 2 lists with combination but when i print this  code some outputs printing sometimes same acts or subs (ex: [act1,act1,sub5]) but I don't want that. I want every output be different, if combination over, it should stop printing. And other thing I want, it give numbers for every output. For example :line1 : 1.[act1,sub3,act,4] line2 : 2.[act2,sub2,act1]...........How can i make this?
