I'm running this code, and it seems running the script using multiprocesses is slower than running it via a single process.Am I doing something wrong?output is Thank you. 
It's a bad example of multiprocessing advantages. It obvious will be slower because you spent more time on creating and starting each process than on executing your function. Multiprocessing sensible in case you have really big time consuming function so you put it in separate process.
Your timing is unfair. list(map(gcd, numbers)) is an in-process operation and doesn't start a new process. The Pool class represents a pool of worker processes.Starting a new process is intuitively slower than simply executing list(map(gcd, numbers)), relative to list(map(...)) there's so much going on in Pool to start the processes. It's almost like comparing the speed of elephants and cheetahs.
