I am using Python 3.6 and I need to convert an integer to a list of individual bits. For example, if I have:This currently outputs b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01'.But I need to have in a list of integers (but in a hex type format) like so [0x00, 0x00 ... 0x01] in order to pass it to another function. I am stuck at this part.
What about a simple list-comprehension with cast into bytestype?It does almost the same as list(bin_to_byte) expect it will forces to keep bytes rather than int. If you do need a list of int, then yes, list(bin_to_byte) is enough.As you can see, each items of the list are not int nor str but bytes:Because the problem while using hex is that it will transfrom your items to string even if they have the hexadecimal form e.g
One liner:ORIt's ugly, but I'm pretty sure it does exactly what you need it to.
