Natural Text
I have a list that stores tuples of coordinates. For example:I have other two tuples which work as delimiters (they are always within the coords list), for example:The start point is not always listed before the end point, but both of them are always within the coords list.Finally, I have another separate list of coordinates, for example:Basically, I would like to remove all the items from the coords list  that are between the start and end tuples and add the to_add items within it. The final result would be like this:How can I do that?
The solution using sorted() and list.index() functions:The output:
Divide the list into three different list i.e from 0 index to start coordinate index, another from start coordinate index to end coordinate and the last list from end coordinate index to last element of the list. Now only add 1st and last list with to_add list.Code snippet for required outputoutput
