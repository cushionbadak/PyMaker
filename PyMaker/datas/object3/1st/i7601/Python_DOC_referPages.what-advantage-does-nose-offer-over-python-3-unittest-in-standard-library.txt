In a new project (starting with no unit test suite), supporting Python 3 only, what good reasons are there to use the nose library?I understand that ‘nose’ began when the Python standard library had no easy way for the test runner to discover unit tests.Starting with Python 2.7 and Python 3.2, standard library unittest now has the discover sub-command, removing that reason to choose nose for Python 2.7 or Python 3 code.So, what remaining reasons are there to prefer nose in a new Python 3 code base?
The documentation site for nose has a notice:Nose has been in maintenance mode for the past several years […]. New projects should consider using Nose2, py.test, or just plain unittest/unittest2.This implies that the developers of nose don't see any special advantage over the suggested alternatives.
