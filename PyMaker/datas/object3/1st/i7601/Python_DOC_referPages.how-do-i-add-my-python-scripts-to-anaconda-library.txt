I have a python script foo.py that I wrote. In which directory can I put that script so that I can use from foo import *** without getting any error. I am using Windows system with anaconda.
In case of conda environments on windows you can simply check where the external packages for conda (or that conda environment) are installed.For example type something like this into the Python prompt of your conda environment:That gives you the path where you're normal packages would be installed (well, minus the \\numpy\\__init__.py part). So if I put a file in that directory, in my case C:\\Anaconda\\envs\\work\\lib\\site-packages\\ then I can load it.Just make sure that you really import a package that has been installed with conda install in that environment!For example:C:\Anaconda\envs\work\lib\site-packages\fun.pyPython prompt (again)That will make the file accessible for the corresponding conda environment (and just there).
