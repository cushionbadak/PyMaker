I have a list like:data = ['a:b', 'c:d', 'e:f', 'g:h']from which i have to create dict.this way it works but when i tried to put it in a single line, error comes, too many value to unpack.Is it because we cannot add operational statement in right side (like split). Is there any other optimized way for the task?
You can't do for k, v in i.split(":") because that would only work for an iterable returning pairs of elements (such as dict.items(), for example), and split() returns a flat list. You need to use a list comprehension or a generator expression for the split() part:Or just use the dict() constructor:
