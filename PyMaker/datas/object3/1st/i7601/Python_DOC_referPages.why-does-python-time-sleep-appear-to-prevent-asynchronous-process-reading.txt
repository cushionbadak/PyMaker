I have some python code which I would like to open as a subprocess.I have tried threading the process through subprocess.Popen() and also through asyncio from another Python script. I know that the addition of time.sleep() is preventing the process output from being read as the program produces output, but a time consuming large loop has the same effect. Interestingly enough, anything I try works from Eclipse with PyDev, but if I run my program from the shell it only outputs when the program is finally finished running. I need to be able to read output as the program outputs to stdout as it progresses. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Try disabling python's output buffering, for example by running python with the -u flag.For more info see: Disable output buffering
