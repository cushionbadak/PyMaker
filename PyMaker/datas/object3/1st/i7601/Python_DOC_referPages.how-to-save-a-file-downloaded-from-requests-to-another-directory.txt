Currently, I am using this to download a file but it is placing them in the same folder where it is being run from, but how would I save the downloaded file to another directory of my choice.
Or if in Linux, try:See open() function docs for more details.
You can just give open a full file path or a relative file path
As long as you have access to the directory you can simply change your file_name.pdf' to '/path_to_directory_you_want_to_save/file_name.pdf' and that should do what you want.
