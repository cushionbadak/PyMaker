I am using python 2.7 in my Windows 10(64-bit) system. I have a string str, when executed it shows result as :-Now, I want to write this result into result.csv file. So I wrote this following python scrip:-But whenever I execute this script, I am finding only wxyz in result.csv file.Help me with this issue.Thanks in advance.
Python 2.7 csv likes the 'b' mode for writing (in Python 3 just 'w').Example: Pre-built list of string to fileExample: Use of reader() to build list of rows to supply writer()Example: Quick appendReferences:In Python 2.x, the reader() and writer() objects required a 'b' flag upon opening. This was a result of how the module handle line termination.In Python 3.x this was changed so that reader() and writer() objects should be opened with newline=''; line termination is still handled however. There is also this post and that post covering some of this.
