I'm having an issue trying to modify strings within a list. I have a for loop set up to select each string item but I'm not able to modify it. I thought it might be a global/local scope issue or a muteable/immutable type issue but I've looked through documentation and I can't find out why I wouldn't be able to modify the string with the code I have in place right now.     The little program is not complete but the idea is to take my tableData variable and print it to look like This is a problem I've been on for a combined 5 hours, and its from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python chapter 6 practice project found at: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter6/Here is my code (issue being at the very bottom):
In Python, strings are immutable. When you doyou're just creating a new string and making the same label reference it. The old value (stored in the list) remains unchanged. You need to either modify list elements using indices:Or, better yet, build a new list using a list comprehension:The latter is not only more concise, but also exempts you from the need to copy the original list.
You don't need to modify the strings in your tableData with str.rjust (you can easily avoid that painful deepcopy). I suggest you apply string formatting for printing:
You can use zip:Output:
That is one of the reasons why you do not modify a loop while iterating it. It can lead to problems if you try to change and compute the iterables inside the loop simultaneously as mentioned here.Never alter the container you're looping on, because iterators on that container are not going to be informed of your alterations and, as you've noticed, that's quite likely to produce a very different loop and/or an incorrect one.If you still want to do it, access it using index like this:This one will work. Hope this helps!
