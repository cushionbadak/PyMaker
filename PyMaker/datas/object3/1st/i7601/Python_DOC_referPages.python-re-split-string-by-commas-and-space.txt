Natural Text
I need to split a string by commas and spaces. An example of the desired behavior is converting the string '    5,    3,   , hello' to the list ['5', '3', 'hello']. Here's what I tried:Why are the blank entries being returned? How can I retrieve the list  ['5', '3', 'hello']?
You can use findall and match what you want:[^,\s]+ is using a negated character class to match any text that is not a comma and not a whitespace.Your split regex ,|\s+ is splitting at multiple positions since , is surrounded by whitespaces as well.As your input has leading whitespaces even splitting on [,\s]+ will give an empty element at the start.
Just for fun, to show a non-regex approach, you can perform this within a comprehension by splitting on ,, and ignoring any string that passes the isspace check and finally calling strip on the final data placed in the list to remove surrounding whitespace.Taking this in to account, the final solution would look like:Performing a timeit analysis on the two solutions, we can observe the following:I'm a bit surprised with how big of a difference it is in favour of this non-regex comprehension approach.
