I have a myList list with e.g. 5 elements, but I want to slice it in template by using command:{% for item in myList|slice:"3" %}or this command:{% for item in myList|slice:":3" %}What's the difference between slice:"x" and slice:":x"? (I don't have currently access to machine with django installed but I'm curious)
slice:"3" and slice:":x" are both same as they will return first 3 elements from the listbut if you use slice:"2:x" then it will leave the 2 items from the first of the list and take from 3rd item till the number you mentioned in the x variable, its basically taking a part
They produce same result:Django slice filter internally use slice python function (or type).
