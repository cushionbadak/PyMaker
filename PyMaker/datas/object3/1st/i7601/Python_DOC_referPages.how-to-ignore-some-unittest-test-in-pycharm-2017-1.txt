There is a button "Show Ignored" in Pycharm test run window. I wonder, how to mark some test as ignored?
With just Python unittest, you can decorate a test to be skipped with @skip. From unittest — Unit testing framework — Python 2 or unittest — Unit testing framework — Python 3:I assume PyCharm is showing you the skipped tests.
