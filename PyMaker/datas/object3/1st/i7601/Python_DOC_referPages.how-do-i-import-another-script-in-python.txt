Natural Text
I'm creating a simple text-based adventure game. I have a long piece of code for combat, but I don't want to copy+paste it every time there's a fight. Is there a way for me to put the combat code into another script, and simply run that whenever combat occurs?
Put that code in a function and save it in another file, in the same directory.Then in the file where you want to use your function, import the file at the top like:where newFile.py is the name of your file. You do not need .py here. And when you want to use a function from the imported file, use :
To invoke a pythonsource use the runpy-module:
You are going to do exactly that. First you will put at the top of your code import theScript then your code in that script should be a specific method called possibly doCombat, so you will call theScript.doCombat() in your piece of code.A great tip that I learned in a computer science class is that if you are ever about to copy and paste code, 90% of the time it should be contained in a method which you should call.
