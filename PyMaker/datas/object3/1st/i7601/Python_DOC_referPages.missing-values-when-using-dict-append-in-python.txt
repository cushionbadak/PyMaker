there is something wrong when I use dict.append(values) but not all of values are addedThe result is:Why the result for append command does not include all number in my dict?
There's no dict.append(), but you are using list.append(). The problem is that you haveinstead ofin your recursive function, so you overwrite the collected values with a new list every time you find a nested dict. Using list.extend() you append all the items found in the recursive call to your list.Consider using isinstance():etc. instead of checking the type name.
