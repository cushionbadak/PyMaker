Natural Text
when i'm trying to make a copy from csv file to edit it away of the originalthen I apply the effects to the originalI get this error :/
The error is the result of your temp_file being opened in binary mode rather than text mode (the default is w+b). Change it to:(the encoding is not strictly necessary, but since you're specifying it on the input, makes sense to specify it on the output).See https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html
