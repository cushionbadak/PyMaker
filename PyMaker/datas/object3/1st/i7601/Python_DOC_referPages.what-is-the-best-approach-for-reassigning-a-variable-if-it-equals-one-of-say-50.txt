The main aim is of my code is: If variable x is equal to a value then I want to reassign x with a different value. eg if x = a then reassign x to = 1 but if x = b then reassign x to = 2. I have around 50 values I want to compare x against to see if it equals one of them.With my basic Python knowledge, I can see one way to achieve this by using 50 if statements in a function, haha but surely there must be a much simpler more code efficient way?I was thinking using a dictionary may be better where if x = key then make x = value, would this be a better approach? Or is there an even better way?Some direction on the best way to code this or a simple example to get me started would be much appreciated.
Yes, a dictionary would work well.
