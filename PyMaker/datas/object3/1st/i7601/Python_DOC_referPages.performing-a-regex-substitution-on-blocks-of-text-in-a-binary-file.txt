Natural Text
I have a file that contains both text and binary code.  In order for Python to process it, I have to load it as a binary file, which makes sense.Now, the problem is, once I do that, I can't use a regular RegEx on it without some changes I don't currently understand.I was hoping the code would be as simple the following, but it's proving not to be.I do know that r variable needs to be marked as a binary string, with a 'b' in the beginning, but it's unfortunately not as simple as that it seems for what I'm trying to do it seems.
The re module documentation states:Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings. However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.Which implies that if c is a bytes object then r and the substitution string must also be:I forgot about f and the other half of r. They need to be bytes also.
