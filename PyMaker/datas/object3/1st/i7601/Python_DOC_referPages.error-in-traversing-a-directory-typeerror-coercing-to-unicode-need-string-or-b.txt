I want to print modified time of all files in a directory.Why it gives this error?
os.walk returns a tuple with values. See the documentation on https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk.This should fix it:
From the os.walk docs:Generate the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either  top-down or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at  directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames).dirpath is a string, the path to the directory. dirnames is a list of  the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (excluding '.' and '..').  filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in  dirpath.The right way to use os.walk is:Note that os.walk will recursively traverse down all subdirectories in a directory. If this is not what you want, use os.listdir.
You're using the wrong function. os.walk is for walking down the hierarchy of a filesystem, and returns a tuple of (dirpath, dirnames, filenames). To return the list of files in a directory, use os.listdir(path).
Return value of os.walk() is a tuple.(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)try:
