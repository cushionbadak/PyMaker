The above is a part of an xml file that I need to parse. I looked at some youtube videos of how to parse/extract xml files, and whatever they cover doesn't seem to apply to my xml files for some reason. I do know that these PeakInfo are the elements if I am not mistaken. However, I can't seem to be able to access the values for mz and Intensity values for each PeakInfo no.'s. The above is a code that I've written based on some youtube videos. Here, I tried to access the mz values from PeakInfo elements but to no avail. Is there anything I can do to achieve what I want?Edit:print(pl) results in: xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree object
findall is looking for elements, you are trying to access element attributes.Use attrib or get to access the values.
