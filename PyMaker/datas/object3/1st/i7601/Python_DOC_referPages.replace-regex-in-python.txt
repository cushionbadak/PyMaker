Unless I completely misunderstood your intentions, you are asking one thing but your code shows a different expected behavior than the one you ask for.I will try to answer both cases:Case 1:You expect to get a multitude of separators like !~~! or !>>! etc., and you need a regex to replace all of them with an empty string ('').Try the following:Explanation:The | regex operator ensures that our pattern will try to match every separator given in SEPARATORS with the given string (s).The re.sub() method will return the string with every pattern matching any of our SEPARATORS, replaced by the empty string.Case 2:You will receive as arguments a series of separators and an equally sized series of replacements for those separators. In that case, try:Explanation:The for loop will traverse the search and replace lists for every separator and the corresponding replacement.The re.sub() method will return in each iteration, the returned_string with the search[i] separator replaced by the replace[i] substitute. Good luck :)
you can use the fileinput module which makes find and replace easyOr you can use the replace method
