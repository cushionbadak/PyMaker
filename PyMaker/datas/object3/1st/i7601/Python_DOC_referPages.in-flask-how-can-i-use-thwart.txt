This question already has an answer here:Python MySQL Connector database query with %s fails                    1 answer                I've been struggling to implement user registration func with flask. Here is the code I've done.When I fill the form and hit submit button, error occurs like as follows.not all arguments converted during string formattingI guess this happens because of thwart.When I insert print(thwart(username)), output b'username'.But there is no value of int(x).The above seems not working because of (thwart(username)), I'm not sure.Would you tell me how I can fix it?
To denote a tuple with a item, there should be a trailing comma before the closing parenthesis:or you can use a list:SIDE NOTEAccording to DB API v2, cursor.execute*(..) return value is not defined. You'd better to use use cursor.fetch*() to fetch results.
