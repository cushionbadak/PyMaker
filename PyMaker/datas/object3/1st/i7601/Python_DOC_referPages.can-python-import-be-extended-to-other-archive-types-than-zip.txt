The zipimport module is automatically used by the standard import to handle .zip sys.path elements.Is it possible to add hooks to support other file types? for example a handler for .tar.gz?so for example, if sys.path contains /path/to/archive.tar.gz or /path/to/archive.xyz handlers can be provided to open and read .tar.gz or .xyz files.
Yes, there are two ways of doing this:Overwrite the __builtin__.__import__() function with your own custom implementation.  This is a low-level way of completely overriding what the import keyword does, and is not recommended for general use.Add a finder object to sys.meta_path which implements the desired functionality, or add a callable which returns such a finder to sys.path_hooks.  Finders are easier to implement in Python 3 than in Python 2, because 3.x provides a lot of building blocks in importlib.  However, they can be implemented in Python 2 as well (you just have to write more code).In general, (2) is much easier than (1) regardless of 2.x vs 3.x.  (1) is only recommended as a last resort.  For more on (2), see PEP 302.
