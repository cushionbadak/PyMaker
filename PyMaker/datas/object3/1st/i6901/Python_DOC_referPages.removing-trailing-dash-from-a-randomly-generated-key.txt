So using the code i have when generating a number/letter string it generates an extra dash on the end and i want it to only consist of 16 digits numbers and letters (without the extra dash)And an example of the output: qIss-wXbS-PZo7-audg-
The second condition in your if statement serves no meaningful purpose. You should just modify it so as to not add the - if you're at the last iteration:Making this change gives me:Might I suggest an improvement over your current approach with random.sample?Note that random.sample does not offer replacement per call, so if you want that, you'll need random.choice.If you want randomness with replacement, you can substitute random.sample with random.choices - but only from python3.6 and onwards.
Yet another alternative, with only one loop :
Of course, you're adding the dash even at the last iteration.Anyway, the most pythonic way: just nest 2 str.join statements:an example:the inner comprension generates the 4 letter/digit sequence, and the outer one joins 4 of those sequences with -.Note that the join([..]) syntax may appear cumbersome, but is faster than without the square brackets (Joining strings. Generator or list comprehension?)EDIT: note that your digits/letters can repeat with random.choice. A better approach without repeats would be to use random.choice as follows:the iterator is consumed except when it's time to issue a dash.
Another way would be to add the code that adds the dash before adding the number. eg.which is a bit more readable than doing it after with if (i - 3) % 4 == 0 and i < 15: code+= '-'but in general using join would be the more pythonic way eg.
