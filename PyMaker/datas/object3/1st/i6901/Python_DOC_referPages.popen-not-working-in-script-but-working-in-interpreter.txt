i have a script action.py which will take a file name as command line argument and do some processing on that file.i want to run this script multiple times with different input files . i used Popen() command to run the script which is surprisingly working fine in interpreter but does not work if  i run the script .if i copy this code in the interpreter it works fine and spawn n processes but does not do any thing when i run the whole script in pycharm. 
I think You are mentioning about the subprocess module.This code might work:For Further references read the Popen() documentation. Hope This Helps
