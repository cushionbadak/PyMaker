To filter list of strings by another list of strings in Python we can use the following code:But how can we filter list of substrings by another list of strings? For example:Result should be:
You can use something like that:
Elegant way to achieve this is via using any with a list comprehension as:Here any will return True if any of string in substrings is present as substring in my_strings. As soon as it finds the match, it will short-circuit the iteration (without checking for other matches) and will return the result as True. Due to the short-circuiting property of any, it won't make the unnecessary iteration across the entire list, resulting in better performance.
