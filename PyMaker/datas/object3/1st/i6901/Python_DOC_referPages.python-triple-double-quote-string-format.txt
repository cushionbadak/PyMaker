I'm getting the following error, how should I fix it? KeyError: 'a'Process finished with exit code 1
You need to pass in the arguments by name .format(a=123) or use format_map which expects a dictionary:
Named formatting variables must be passed by name:If you're providing a dict of data, you can "unpack" the names:
You are using the format method for strings incorrectly. format requires that you pass in keyword arguments when you want to substitute names inside a string.The correct form to use the method in your case would be the following:However if you do want to pass in a dictionary, then you can unpack it into keyword arguments by prepending ** before the dictionary itself. This will unpack the dictionary into the the keyword argument of a='123' like the code above.Please read more about Python strings and the string format method here.
