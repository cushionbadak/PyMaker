I have a python script that creates a PDF and saves it in a subfoler of the folder where the script is saved. I have the following that saves the file to the subfolder:Is there a way I can save the PDFs to the subfolder without having to specify the full path? Lets say I wanted yto make this script an exe that multiple computers could use, how would I display the path so that the PDFs are just saved in the subfoler?Thanks!
