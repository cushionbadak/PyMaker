I've created several customized classes to transform dataframes, as follows (version simplified):what I want to do now is to execute these two classes methods in parallel. I suppose it should be something like :However, after I executing this code, and doI observed that no transformation had been done at all. (Though according to the computation time, something did happe when called pr1.start() and pr2.start())Does anyone know what might be the reason? And what will be the solution?Thanks a lot :)P.s  The next step will be 'merging df1.dataframe and df2.dataframe. So I'd also like to know whether I need another function fun_wait_until_all_process_finished()  and then do pd.merge((df1.dataframe,df2.dataframe))
In my opinion, using the threading module is the best way to solve this.For ease of use, you can use a decorator:After this is defined, add the decorator to functions/class methods you want to be threaded like this:Then just call the function, a thread will be created automatically:
