I want to change time delta to integer value .My code is as below.But, I want to get just 76 with integer.How can I solve this problem?Thank you.
Just reference the days attribute of the timedelta object you have there:There are also timedelta.seconds and timedelta.microseconds attributes, modeling the complete delta state. 
date1 is a timedelta object  - use  date1.days to get the number of days as an integer, or date1.total_seconds() to see the number of seconds between the two datetime objects.
