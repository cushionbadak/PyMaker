For example, I import json like so import json and now somewhere in the code I want to check if it has been imported. It should be something like: has_imported(module_name).The reason why I'm asking this is because I'm trying to understand how pkgutil.walk_packages() works. It must import the modules it lists but for some reason some modules are not imported. Seems like I have to import them with a separate function but first this function needs to "know" whether a module that it gets as an argument was imported or not.There are some similar questions, but I'm far from being satisfied with the answers.
Test for the module name in the sys.modules dictionary:
