Natural Text
Consider the following example.I was expecting this short script to print the a tag equaling x, followed by a dictionary of the attributes of x (name (as key) and content (as key's value) of each of these), ending with the text for the link.Instead the output isThe issues I find with this output are:print(soup.a.get_text()) bit always prints the text of the first tag.In the dictionaries output by print(x.attrs), the value of the key "href" is missing &amp.What am I missing here and how do I get the desired output?
You can use the cgi.escape or html.escape methods to html encode the & character.
