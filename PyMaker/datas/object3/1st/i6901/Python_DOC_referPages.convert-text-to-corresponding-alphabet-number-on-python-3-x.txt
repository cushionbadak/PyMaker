Natural Text
I want to be able to have an input where someone can type a sentence which will convert the letters to its corresponding number i.e. a-1 and z-26
If letter is a variable, you can do something like this:letter could only take the values 'a', 'b', ..., 'z'.
Call convert("hello") will give you '8 5 12 12 15 'You can tweak the output format a little bit, not sure if this is what you want?
