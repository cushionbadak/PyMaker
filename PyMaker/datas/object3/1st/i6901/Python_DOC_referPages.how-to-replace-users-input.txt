Natural Text
I'm trying to make a Text to Binary converter script. Here's what I've got..So let's say the user types the word "Tree", I want to convert every letter in binary and display it. I hope you can understand what I'm trying to do here.PS. I'm a bit newbie! :)
The way you have attempted to solve the problem isn't ideal. You've backed yourself into a corner by assigning the binary values to variables.With variables, you are going to have to use eval() to dynamically get their value:Be advised however, the general consensus regarding the use of eval() and similar functions is don't. A much better solution would be to use a dictionary to map the binary values, instead of using variables:The ideal solution however, would be to use the built-in ord() function: 
Check the ord function:
cheeky one-liner that prints each character on a new line with labelsimilarly cheeky one-liner to print with arbitrary seperator specified by print's sep value:Copy and paste into your favorite interpreter :)
