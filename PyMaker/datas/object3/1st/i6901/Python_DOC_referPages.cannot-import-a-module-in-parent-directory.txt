I am trying to get a python project working in Ubuntu 17, but I'm having trouble with module loading. I've been able to isolate the problem with a trivial example. This example works in Windows 10, but not in Ubuntu. Help getting this to work would be greatly appreciated!Here are the steps I am following:First I create a project directory called code_playground in ~/dev. Next I create a virtualenv for this project: I activate the virtual environment:It seems to work:I create a file called mod_a.py with a simple function in it:Now I create a subdirectory called sub : Inside sub, I create a file called mod_b.py with these contents:I try to run mod_b.py, but I get an error:
The Python interpreter has to know where to find module_a.py. The fact that the file that is importing the module module_a.py is in a sub-directory for the directory where module_a.py exist, "is not a thing that help much". You can try few things:1- Add your mod_a.py path (before the script run) to your Python's path as suggested by @CristiFati.2- Add your mod_a.py path (using Python code) to your Python's path doing something like (nasty one):3- Evaluate relative imports (6.4.2.
