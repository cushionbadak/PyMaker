Python 3There is an ipaddress module that may do the job.The constructor of the class Ip4Network handles both 255.255.255.255 and 255.255.255.255/32 (and also IPv6 format, with Ip6Network)So you may add in your codeand create an Ip4Network with the code:Than, continue with your code on the socket:you have only to convert it in a string.Python 2.7The ipaddress must be installed from the repository (py2-ipaddress) and has some issue between str and bytearray interpretation of string (refer here)So it works in my experiments if you do:
