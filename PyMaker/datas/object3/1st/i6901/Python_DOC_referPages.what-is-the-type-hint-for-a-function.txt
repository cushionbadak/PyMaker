This question already has an answer here:How can I specify the function type in my type hints?                    2 answers                Is it just callable? In the meantime I have been using function as my IDE regards callable as a bool.
Yes, typing.Callable is the right hint for a callback.Also see the Callable section of PEP 484:Frameworks expecting callback functions of specific signatures might be type hinted using Callable[[Arg1Type, Arg2Type], ReturnType].
