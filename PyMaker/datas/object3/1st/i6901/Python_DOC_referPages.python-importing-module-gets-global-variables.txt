Natural Text
I have two Python scripts, one testclass.py:  and one testscript.py:I expected testscript.py to throw an error because I thought that testscript only imports the class Something (with its __init__ method), and not the global variable zz. So, given this bevahiour, my question is, when importing from a module, does Python "run" everything in the module file?
Yes. When you execute:It has the same effect as:More generally, the Python interpreter can't know beforehand what objects your module exposes (unless you explicitly name them in __all__). For an extreme case, consider the following:a.py:Running from a import Foo has a 50% chance of failing because the a module object may or may not have a Foo attribute.
