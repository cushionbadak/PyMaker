Natural Text
I am attempting to scrape the last 6 lines of text from this table. I am having difficulty without performing nested loops through Beautiful Soup. I'm sure there is an easier way, but for the record I just need the Last  name, First name, Last name, and the last three lines which are DOB, Age and Gender. Below is my code which returns the entire tr.Thanks in advance
Find all the tr tags and get the texts using get_text() method. Then split() the text by \n and remove the empty strings using filter. Here you get all the data you need in one line.OutputIf you want to remove the first 2 elements then just slice the listOutput
