I have a JSON object like this below. Actually huge JSON file, simplified to ask this question.Now I wrote below python code to access values inside []. The above code works fine. However, the usage of dict ['firstKey'] [0] doesn't work for values more than 1. Two Questions.1. Is there a better way to access Key values inside []. 2. Can we find length of number of values inside []. For this list, length of values under "firstKey" is 2.Any help is appreciated.
Just loop over the lists directly. There is no need to know a length up front:The for <name> in <listobject> loop is a for each construct; no indices are generated. Instead, the loop assigns each element from the list to the target name.I changed the name dict to d to avoid masking the built-in type. I also used string formatting to put the values from the inner dictionary into a string.Note that I dropped using the totalCount key altogether. There is no need to look at that value here.As for finding the length of a list, just use the len() function. Again, there is no need to use that function here, iteration directly over the list removes the need to generate indices up front.
In the JSON you provided, there is only one element in the outer list of payload. But the code tries to access the first 5 elements of that list, which don't exist.Try to avoid using direct access to values in a list like this di['key'], instead use 'di.get('key','default')`, unless you are sure it exists.To loop through the keys-values and get the length of values under 'firstKey', use the following code:
