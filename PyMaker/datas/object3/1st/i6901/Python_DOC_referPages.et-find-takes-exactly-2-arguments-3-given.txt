I'm newbie in Python and getting the error ET.find() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)during the execution of My first question is: what type is deduced in the following initialization?Answering this I can go further to find out the error by myself! Thanks in advance! 
The find() method only takes a single argument so you cannot do whatever it is you're attempting (at least not with find()). To answer your question, {'conv_svc': 'http://schemas.com/serviceconvert'} is a dictionary and would be interpreted as a single argument. If you are wondering about why the error states that you're passing 3 arguments (which you're not), it's because self is also counted as an argument to class methods.Gives:EDITThanks to @ShreyashSSarnayak for pointing out that find() can take an optional extra argument in Python 3. The error message confirms that you are using Python 2, but perhaps reading some documentation associated with Python 3.
