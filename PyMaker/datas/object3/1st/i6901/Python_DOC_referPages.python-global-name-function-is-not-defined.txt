How do you use a method from the same class in this case? I am trying to make a tkinter scale that will update every time it is changed. How do I collect this value?This is a snippet of the codeFor example,Will return an error saying : global name 'set_humidity' is not defined  
You forgot to add self. behind humidityValue when you were declaring the attributes in your __init__:humidityValue = humidityScale.get() should be self.humidityValue = humidityScale.get().This is needed so that both objects created using your class AND functions inside the class (as you have witnessed) can self-reference attributes.You probably will need to do the same changes to other variables in your __init__ (eg humidityScale, humidityLabel).In regards to why your function set_humidity doesn't work - you forgot to add self as the first parameter of the function, just like you've done with get_humidity
