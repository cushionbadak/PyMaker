I read the documentation and am not sure how to simplify the following code with Python properties:
You could override __getattr__ and __setattr__ which are called when you access a property with obj.prop.Usage example:A note: you've defined json on the class, if you want it to be instance variable create it on self in __init__.
If you're just learning Python, this may be too advancedâ€”however by using it you can largely automate the process of creating any number of classes like this by using a metaclass (a class whose instances are other classes).Although doing so requires some non-trivial code, it makes defining the target classes extremely simple. Plus, as a bonus I added optional type-checking.The defined metaclass makes it very easy to create a class with exactly the desired properties:
You can use __getattr__ and __setattr__ to treat your dynamic fields as if they are properties of the object itself, rather than of the internal json object.The sample above will allow you to access the properties like so.
