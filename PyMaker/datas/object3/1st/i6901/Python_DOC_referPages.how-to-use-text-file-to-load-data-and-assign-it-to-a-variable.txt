Natural Text
i am new to python(learner).I created a simple program which asks for username and password and i used getpass()function to hide password.But i want my program to load username and password from a text file.now, if i remove text file and open function from code and insert a string like "user1" if user == "user1": it works fine. 
You can read data from text file simple:This is mean that you are open file "your_text_file.txt" for reading ('r' as second parameter) and we read first line, after that we read the next lineThis is work if your username and password write in the different line:your_text_file.txt:You can read about read and write file here
