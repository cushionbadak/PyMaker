Natural Text
I'm trying to remove all "\n" in this string. However the string.strip() method does not entirely clean the textThe result is How to remove them all ?
Use string.replace to replace '\n' for '' (empty string):
You have '\n' and '\t' to be replaced by '' and ' ' respectively. So you can use 
If you want to remove only the duplicate line feeds, you can use a regex through re.sub:Or to remove them all:
Use string.replace() not strip:This method will replace the old char with a new char. In your case, you want to 'replace' the new line '\n' with nothing ''. As seen belowbody.replace('\n', '')this will return a new string which you can re-assign to body:body = body.replace('\n', '')now body is:'Some textHow toremovealln?\t\t\t\t\tbecause notworking\t\t\t\t\t'so if you finally want to remove the tabs '\t' you can just do a further string.replace() on them as you said above:body = body.replace('\t', '')
