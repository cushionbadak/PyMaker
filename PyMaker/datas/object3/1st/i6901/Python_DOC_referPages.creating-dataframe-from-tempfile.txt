Trying to load a temporary file into a pandas dataframe and throwing an error.  Not sure how to get the parsed data from the temp file into a dataframe to use later on.Traceback (most recent call last):File "C:/LAS Load.py", line 42, in ...       return func(*args, **kwargs) TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
I think you wanted to prepend 'file://' to temp.name. After un-indenting the df assignment by two tab stops. The i.split(None) is odd, it seems just like [i], and ' '.join([i]) has no side effects. Maybe another copy-n-paste hiccup?
You didn't show us what readMe contains, in particular what type it causes i to have. If possible, would you please run this under python3? If not, show us some details like type(i), and do a trivial temp.write('hello') so it's clear the file descriptor is writable. It's still not obvious what side effects line 41 has:The '%s' % i is essentially taking str(i). Perhaps what we're looking for is i.encode('utf8'), or passing in a temp file encoding.
