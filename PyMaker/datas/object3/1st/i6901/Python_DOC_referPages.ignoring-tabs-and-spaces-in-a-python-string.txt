Any approach can i follow?
if you just want to replace tabs with a space, perhaps str.replace is simple enough. But that doesn't leave the trailing newlines. You might consider the replacement followed by str.strip. For example:If you have other kinds of characters, or multiple characters (missing data, or the like), a more aggressive approach with regex may be considered:
You can replace the tab in the command output string with a space.For example:
Read the description for strip() method in official python documentation."Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed."So, the characters within the string remain unchanged. Using replace() method is the best solution for your problem.
