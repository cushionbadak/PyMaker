I would like to know whether it be possible to set a length for a variable in python like in C: short, long, etc.
As I already mentioned in the comments Pythons integers are big integers. They can hold any integer number you wish:In Python there is also rarely a need for shorter types because (at least CPython) uses a reference counting system and that means all instances (and I mean all) have a refcount (64bit) and a pointer to the class (another 64bit) attribute. With an overhead of 128bits it's rarely useful to use integers that are shorter than 32 or 64bit.If you really want these C-types you could use NumPy which already wrapped them:But the memory overhead for scalars is, as said above, not worth it. However if you have arrays this argument doesn't hold anymore:This is because NumPy also wraps C-arrays and only has the reference count overhead + class overhead (+ additional overhead) (=96 bytes) once per array:
I suggest taking a look at Numpy's dtype, some documentation can be found here.Some examples:
You cannot specify a precision directly. When a python int grows too large they will automatically be converted to a python long. You can initialize a python long by appending an 'l' or 'L'. Note however that this is only possible in python 2.For example:long_int = 398593849843lanother = 13L
