Hi Guys I am struggling for the past 3 days getting the following working:I can not test this on localhost as the payment gateway needs to be on a live server.The data does get saved to the payfast model but not the bookings modelMy code as followsBookings ViewMy Payment Gateway model (Saves in the database after successful payment)My bookings modelOnce the payment goes through the following code runsfor some reason this does not workhow do I get values from the form to show in the booking model
As i can see your final code for saving obj in Booking model, there are following things you need to take care of.Make sure below line of code should return an parsable int string not None or any random string as user and event are not nullable field of Booking modelAs eventdate field is DateField it will not accept any date string you pass. Note: Format strings use Pythonâ€™s datetime module syntax.for your case it will look like.For more information you can visit https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#date-input-formats
