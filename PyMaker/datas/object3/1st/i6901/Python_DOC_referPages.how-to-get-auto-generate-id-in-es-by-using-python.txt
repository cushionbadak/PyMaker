I need to store the unique auto id like using XPOSTbecause every time I start the program, the data is overwritten.but, I can't find an example that automatically generate id in Python Could you tell me if there are any good examples?my code:
You don't need to do this in python -- if you index documents without an id, Elasticsearch will automatically create a unique id.  However, if for some reason you want to generate the id in python, you could use uuid.
