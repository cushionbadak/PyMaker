I have a bit of code that calculates pay / overtime pay based on the hours worked in a week. There are two if statements that calculate the pay for week1 and week2. What I am trying to do is then calculate the total pay which is the pay for the results of the week1 if statement plus the results of the week2 if statement, but I'm struggling. I'm probably making this much more difficult than it needs to be. I'm using a Jupyter Notebook where each of the chunks below are in a separate cell. The results of the first if statement = 440 the second if statement = 473. The desired result is to combine these so that the output is 913.Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated!

You can use variables too.
After writing my initial answer, I though of a completely different one I think is better. You can use the max and min functions to make sure you don't add negative overtime.This works by finding whichever is larger: weekX - 40 or 0 and multiplying it by rate * 1.5. This will be zero if there was fewer than 40 hours. It then finds the smaller of weekX and 40 and multiplies that by rate to find the standard pay and adds it to the overtime pay.Min and max docs:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#maxhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min
You can use a slightly more advanced feature called the ternary operator to do this:This operator works very much like how it sounds when you read the code out loud. That is: variable x is equal to some value if some condition is true, else variable x is equal to some other value.In a more simple example we can use:In this example pos_or_neg would evaluate to "positive" because 45 >= 0.Ternary Help:Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?https://docs.python.org/3.3/faq/programming.html#is-there-an-equivalent-of-c-s-ternary-operator
