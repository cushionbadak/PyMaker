I am trying to pull stat tables from NHL.com and convert them to csv for later use in excel. I am able to pull the tables but am having issues converting them to csv. I have found plenty of previous questions about converting json to csv but none of the solutions have worked for me. Some of the solutions utilized pandas, which for some reason keeps giving me a traceback error. Here is the code up until the conversion to csv.Any help would be greatly appreciated!Edit:Some of the csv conversion methods I tried included the highest rated answers from How can I convert JSON to CSV?.I was having issues pasting and formatting them here so I just provided the link instead.This is my output when trying to use pandas.

You could utilize python's built-in csv.DictWriterHere's the output CSV file https://www.dropbox.com/s/1mmprenx0eniflg/nhl_players.csv?dl=0 Hope this helps.
