I came across this problem online and used it on visualizer to see how this works. It looks to me that a new variable called guess was created using the for loop.Question: Did the for loop create a new variable called "guess"? If not, how was the value of guess utilized outside the loop in the if/else statement?I'd highly appreciate some feedback on this. Thank you!
Python formally acknowledges that the names defined as for loop targets (a more formally rigorous name for "index variables") leak into the enclosing function scope. The official wordThe Python reference documentation explicitly documents this behavior in the section on for loopsThe for-loop makes assignments to the variables(s) in the target list. [...] Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished, but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at all by the loop.Read More Here
From the doc:Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished,  but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at  all by the loop.So yes, the for loop create a new variable.The only case in which guess will not be created is in case that the sequence by which the for loop iterate is empty, e.g.as the opposite of:
