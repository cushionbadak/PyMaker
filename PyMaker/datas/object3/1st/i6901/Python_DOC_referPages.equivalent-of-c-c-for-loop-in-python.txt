What will be the python equivalent to this simple C++ code:Especially I am having problem in the implementation of the second loop with 'j' using  condition 
You may use a while loop in the inner loop to make it slighlty more intuitive and readable:
Use a negative step with range() :
From the range docs:For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the  formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by  the formula r[i] = start + step*i, but the constraints are i >= 0 and  r[i] > stop.Translation inline.
