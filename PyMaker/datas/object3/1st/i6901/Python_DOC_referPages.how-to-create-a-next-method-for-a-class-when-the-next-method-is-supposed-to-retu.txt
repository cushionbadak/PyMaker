I have the following example in which the next method of a class is supposed to return the values from two generators:However, when I call next for this class, the values are not incremented.What is wrong? Is there a more eloquent way to write this class?   
Your code doesn't work because it recreates the generator functions every time __next__() is called, which effectively resets them back to their initial state before their next next() values are returned:You can fix that by adding an __init__() method and initializing them in it:A more eloquent and slightly more concise way to do it which likewise will avoid the problem would be to use the builtin zip() function to create an "iterator of generators" that will return pairs of next values from each generator every time it's called. Another advantage is it's very easy to extend to handle even more generators simply just changing the __init__() method.Here's what I mean:Output:
Although I have no idea what you are trying to accomplish, here is a cleaned up version which (I think) does what you want.
