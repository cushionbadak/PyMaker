I have a queue with elements as follows :Here None does the job of a separator and nothing more than that.Now I want to print output like this :I'm able to print this output:by traversing the queue from right side.It's the code :The above desired output can be achieved by using a temporary stack. I can push elements into stack until I encounter a None and then start popping them out.But this requires an O(n) extra space.I just need an efficient algorithm instead of using temporary stack.You can use all properties of queues and lists.Thankyou :)
You can use itertools.groupby to "split" the array at the desired elements.After the above, blocks is equal to [[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [4, 5, 6, 7], [2, 3], [1]]. If you want to print those subarrays in the same format:
