If we consider the following generator and the generator function:Why does the built-in iter function have to be called onto the generator in the generator function? The code still runs and prints the correct value without it.
take does not know whether it receives a iterator (such as a generator) or a container (such as a list/tuple/set). In the latter case, containers do not have a .next method associated with them, so your code will fail. Your code is playing it safe rather than taking a chance, which I'd consider good programming practice.An example (in python3):In the latter case, the iter is redundant, but it the code works in both cases. However, consider:It should be clear why the iter call is needed.
If you pass a list or tuple to your take function, they won't have a next method.Using iter on a list will give you a listiterator, which does have a next method.
