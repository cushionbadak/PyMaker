I am having trouble deriving the overall sum of string values.While I am able to generate the following if there are in integers form:If I used sums = {k: sum(i for i in v if isinstance(i, int)) for k, v in size.items()}, I will be able to get output such as {'serverA': 20, 'serverB': 9}However, instead of having integers in the values of the list, I got string as follows:And if I used the same command to generate the sum of values, while there are no errors, the sums are clearly wrong in which the output is {'serverA': 0, 'serverB': 0}
You can use map() to map the values to ints:Note: if you have values that aren't integers this will raise a ValueError exception.Don't really understand why you had the isintance(i, int) in your base case. 
Simply use int(integer_string)Also, keep in mind using isinstance is typically considered an antipattern. If you want type checking check out Python 3.6 type annotations or use a different language.
