This is legal in Python3.But I have to change it to this for it to work in Python2.Is there something wrong with Keras or is this a new feature in Python3?This question has not been asked before to my best knowledge. Sorry if this is a dumb question but I don't really know what key words I should use to search for this...
This is something that depends on the module. If the submodule's name is included in __all__ in the module's __init__.py, you'll be able to access it in the way you expect. You can see how __all__ works in my answer here. Or read the documentation on packages:The import statement uses the following convention: if a package’s __init__.py code defines a list named __all__, it is taken to be the list of module names that should be imported when from package import * is encountered. It is up to the package author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the package is released. Package authors may also decide not to support it, if they don’t see a use for importing * from their package.In the case of keras, it seems that the module's __init__.py either: does not define __all__does not include preprocessing in __all__
