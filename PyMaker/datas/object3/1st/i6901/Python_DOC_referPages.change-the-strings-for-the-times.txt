I'm working on my code as I'm checking on the getTime1 to see if the strings is valid. If the strings is valid, I want to change the strings for the time to go 30 minutes backward in each time when the getTime1 strings is valid. Example: The getTime1 strings show 12:00AM so I want to change it to 30 minutes backward to make it to show 11:30PM. If the getTime1 strings show 12:30PM, I want to change it to 30 minutes backward to make it to show 12:00PM.Here is the code:But the problem is the getTime1 strings will only show 12 hours time.I'm wondered if there is a way if I could be able to reduce the code to make it to go with something like in 6-7 lines instead of 97 lines?
How about this?Except for the two special cases, this program finds the :, checks if 30 is present, if it is then it keeps the current hour and makes a new string with AM/PM label and hour intact but with 00 instead of 30. If the ending is 00 it turns the hour portion into an int, subtracts 1, turns it back to a string, adds 30 in the minute section and again preserves the AM/PM part. 
Yes, there are easier ways. You might be interested in the built-in time module. It lets you parse strings and perform operations on them. You could also do something like:And then you could figure out how to subtract 30 minutes. For validating you could use regex.
