Natural Text
I want to convert a string into a dictionary. I saved this dictionary previously in a text file. The problem is now, that I am not sure, how the structure of the keys are. The values are generated with Counter(dictionaryName). The dictionary is really large, so I cannot check every key to see how it would be possible.The keys can contain simple quotes like ', double quotes ", commas and maybe other characters. So is there any possibility to convert it back into a dictionary?For example this is stored in the file:I found previous solutions with for example json, but I have problems with the double quotes and I cannot simply split for the commas.
If you trust the source, load from collections import Counter and eval() the string
How about something like:
You could remove the Counter( and ) parts, then parse the rest with ast.literal_eval as long as it only involves basic Python data types:In the future, I recommend picking a different way to serialize your data.
you can use demjson library for doing this, you can have the text directly in your programif it is in the file ,you can do the following steps :
