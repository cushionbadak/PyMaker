I got this, but how to insert a date into it,  the date i want is one month from current time whereby the Y is one month later from the current time
Hint: To get the current month of the year, use the datetime module:Where datetime.datetime.now() gets the current time as a datetime object, and the .month attribute prints the current month (as a number)
ORAlso see: Get month name from numberhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.month_name
Often the easiest way of manipulating dates and times in ways like this is to use the arrow library. In this case, you can get what you want with this code:
If you want to print datetime one month later from current time,you can use datetime and dateutil in combination.then you can use the datetime attributes like monthplus1.month to get the next month.and if you want names of the month, use a list like in below answermonthNames=["", "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]with little tweak, so the 0th will be empty and you can get the Month NamesThen use these values as you would normaly do using format
