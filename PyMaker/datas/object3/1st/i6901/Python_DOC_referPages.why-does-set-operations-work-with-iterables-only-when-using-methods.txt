Why do set operations work with arbitrary iterables when using set methods, but not operators? To show what I mean:
From the docs:Note, the non-operator versions of union(), intersection(), difference(), and symmetric_difference(), issubset(), and issuperset() methods will accept any iterable as an argument. In contrast, their operator based counterparts require their arguments to be sets. This precludes error-prone constructions like set('abc') & 'cbs' in favor of the more readable set('abc').intersection('cbs').It was considered less error-prone this way.
