This question already has an answer here:Why does Python 3 allow “00” as a literal for 0 but not allow “01” as a literal for 1?                    3 answers                I found, this in Python3:While:Why does the first example works while the second one fails? Should't it be better if both failed or both worked?
From Integer literals:Note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed.  This is for disambiguation with C-style octal literals, which Python  used before version 3.0.You can read the lexical definitions to understand the rule to parse integer literals.
