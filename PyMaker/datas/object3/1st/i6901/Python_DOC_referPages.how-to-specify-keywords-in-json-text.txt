Natural Text
I have a long list of products I'm trying to figure out a way to use keywords to pull out only the product I'm looking for. For this example i want to find the t-shirt name Kiss Tee. Then I'm using regex to pull the id with this code - Right now it pulls all ids, What do i need to specify to use the keyword from above to only pull the Kiss Tee id?html1 = full url response.text -t shirt section in full - 
Check out the json module. You can json.loads your data and iterate through it.The above will output the proper id: 170783.
