This question already has an answer here:What is sys.maxint in Python 3?                    8 answers                Maximum and Minimum values for ints                    8 answers                Maximum value for long integer                    7 answers                I checked maximum size of the integer Python holds using sys.maxsize and it returned me 9223372036854775807. Then why I can still store a value greater than this range?How many bytes are required to store an integer and do Python changes number of bytes depending on the size of an integer?I am using Python 3.6
If you check the docs for sys.maxsize, you'll seesys.maxsize  An integer giving the maximum value a variable of type Py_ssize_t can take. Itâ€™s usually 2**31 - 1 on a 32-bit platform and 2**63 - 1 on a 64-bit platform.There's nothing in there about Python ints! It's talking about Py_ssize_t, an internal C API thing with no practical relevance to working with Python ints.Python ints use an arbitrary-precision representation that will use more bytes of memory to represent bigger integers. They are not limited by the values of Py_ssize_ts.
