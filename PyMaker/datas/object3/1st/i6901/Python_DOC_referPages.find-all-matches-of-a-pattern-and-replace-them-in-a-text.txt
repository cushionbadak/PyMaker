Natural Text
I have a pattern as below:It can be seen in several times in a sentence and in a document. I want to find all matches and replace it with "MEASUREMENT", also I want to add its value in a list.So far my code is below but it only brings the first match:
You can use re.sub() for the replacement, and re.findall() to get all matched strings.
If you don't want to parse your string twice, you can use re.sub with a function as replacement parameter. With this function you can easily populate a list of matching strings.
