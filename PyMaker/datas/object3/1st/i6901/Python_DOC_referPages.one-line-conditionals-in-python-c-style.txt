I tried to replicate C++ style single line conditionals in Python like so:I have a function defined : isPalidrome (mystr) - returns True if mystr is a palidrome,False otherwise.  The function works. Now I have a simple main function like so:   But i get an Syntax error - I did check a similar thread that comes very close to replicating my logic above (it just does not call the lambda as a function anywhere).Conditional statement in a one line lambda function in python?However, none of the answers explain WHY it is a syntax error. If you ignore PEP 8, the syntax is valid unless you you cannot include else in the same line as if.  Any help, options, alternative considerations ? BTW: I wrote this simple program to check on this feature for reducing the logic size of much larger modules. I know very well that I can get away with checking if its a palindrome within the isPalindrome function. Thats not the point of my question. 
You can fit your conditionals on one line, definitely. This is how you do it in python.Sure, you can have lambdas work with global variables, but that is not how I would recommend doing it. A well written lambda should be a pure function, meaning you would pass the parameter to it. Additionally, the lambda needs no return as it is implied. Now, you must call your lambda as such:
I hope that his explanation help you. From the doc:lambda_expr        ::=  “lambda” [parameter_list]: expressionlambda_expr_nocond ::=  “lambda” [parameter_list]: expression_nocondLambda expressions (sometimes called lambda forms) are used to create  anonymous functions. The expression lambda arguments: expression  yields a function object. The unnamed object behaves like a function  object defined with:def (arguments):      return expressionSo, you have to pass an expression to the lambda. A Conditional expressions (using the if/else keyword) is a valid expression. You can't pass just a if/else sentence. A valid code could be:
