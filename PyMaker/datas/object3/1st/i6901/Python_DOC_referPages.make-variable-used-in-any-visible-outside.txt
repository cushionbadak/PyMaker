How to print the match string outside of the if statement?says:
You can use a generator, and call for the next(..):Here we use None in the next as a fallback value if no such s can be found that matches and check for None.Note that this will match only the first of the matches. If there are more, these will not be emited. You can however alter the code by using a for loop:
As the any document says:Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is  empty, return False.And you can not access the intermediate variable used within any(...) (scope of generator expression) outside the scope of it. In order to achieve this, you may instead do:
You just can't, the variable is declared only inside the generator.You'll have to add another for loop for that:But you can avoid nesting for loops using itertools.product
I agree with @Willem Van Onsem's comments.
