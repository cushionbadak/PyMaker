When you open a file in python, you must specify its "file mode" - read-only, write-only, read AND write, and if the file is binary. So, in this line:You opened your file as READ-ONLY, and set the file to be read as BINARY.You should have opened the file as:As write and as STRINGNevertheless, you are manually writting a CSV file - you do not have to do that in Pyhton!

If you want to write bytes you have to make it like below
