I have no idea why this is so frustrating, but I have literally pulled out a few clumps of hair in rage because this just refuses to work and I honestly do not have the slighest clue on what to do. I am trying to use the winshell module for a quick python programming I am using. I am new to python and just started trying it today. I have tried to install the library manually, and through pip. pip claims the module is downloaded, and I can see it in the lib folder. No matter what I do I get this error when I try to run my code:what on earth must I do to get this to work I am at my wits end here and I feel like I'm going to break something
You have to install the library with:pip install winshellI just tested with pip3 install winshell and it worked.Python interpreter search for modules in the set of directories that you can see with:I recommend you take a look to see if the directory where you are seeing the library in lib is include in that list.Might be useful to you read: The Module Search Path
