I have a file with following format:So let's say I am only interested in device with id=2 and I want to extract its tag number(this is configurable and will be changed from some other code). So I need to extract tag number of the device id 2. How can I do this in python. I have done following:Thanks
You can read the next line using line.readline() try to use this code:
With re.search function:The output:f.read() - reads the file contents (as text)r'' + id_num + '\s+tag=([0-9]+)' - constructing regex pattern, so it would become id=2\s+tag=([0-9]+) where \s is one or many whitespace characters(including newlines) and ([0-9]+) is the 1st captured group containing tag numbertag_num.group(1) - extracting the value of the 1st captured/parenthesized group 1 from the match object tag_num
