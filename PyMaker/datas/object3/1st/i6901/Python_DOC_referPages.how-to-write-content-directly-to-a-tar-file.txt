I have a url that I can make curl requests againstHere I am trying to do it with the requests moduleHow do I write this to a tarfile-like data package? 
The content will be the entire file (as bytes) that you can write out.If you are downloading any arbitrary tar file and it could be rather large, you can choose to stream it instead. Note that this pattern (opening a file with wb mode) should generally work with writing any type of binary file. I would suggest reading the writing file documentation for Python 3 (Python 2 documentation here).
