I am very new to Python and I was wondering if someone could help me with this problem.I have a folder "Train" with sub-folders "ball", "chair", "cup", "bag" each sub-folder consists of it associated image.Such as:I have written the following code to read image from TrainFor names_path = [] I would like to store the name of the sub-folder (bag, chat, cup, ball) of the current image. So if first image in the loop belongs to ball, save image path to training_paths and "ball" to names_path I have tried using another loop such as But when I check the list all the entries are None.
If file_path ist the path of your image you can get the directory name with:dirname() extracts the path of the directorybasename() extracts the last part of the directory pathSee also: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html
It'll depend where you're actually running the file from, but I think your error is that you don't need the slash just before Train.Change:To:Your code is producing an empty list, so the for-loop never runs.
