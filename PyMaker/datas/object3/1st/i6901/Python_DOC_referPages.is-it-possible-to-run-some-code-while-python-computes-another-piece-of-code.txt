This question already has an answer here:Dead simple example of using Multiprocessing Queue, Pool and Locking                    5 answers                Python multiprocessing for parallel processes                    1 answer                Say you wrote a function that returns the factorial of a number (factorial of 5 is 120 because 5*4*3*2*1=120) so if you have a huge number clearly it's going to take python a while to figure it out. Is it possible to have it run some while loop or something that runs while python figures out the factorial of x?
What you're looking for is to generate another process that will calculate factorial concurrently to the work that your current process is doing.There's a module called subprocess that might interest you. Also see this.
