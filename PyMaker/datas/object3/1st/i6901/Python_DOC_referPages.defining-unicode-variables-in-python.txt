Recently, I have been reading about the Python source code encoding, especially PEP 263 and PEP 3120.I have the following code:This code works fine for Python3 but results in a SyntaxError in Python2.7 .I do understand that this probably might have nothing to do with source code encoding.So, I would like to know if there is a way to support Unicode variable names in Python2.In all, I am also having a hard time figuring out what pragmatic problem the PEPs exactly aim to solve and how(and where) do I take advantage of the proposed solutions. I have read few discussions on the same but they do not present an answer to my question rather an explanation of the correct syntax:Correct way to define Python source code encodingWorking with utf-8 encoding in Python sourceWhere does this come from: -*- coding: utf-8 -*-Is '# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-' also a comment in Python?
No, Python 2 only supports ASCII names. From the language reference:Compared that the much longer Python 3 version, which does have full Unicode names.The practical problem the PEPs solve is that before, if a byte over 127 appeared in a source file (say inside a unicode string), then Python had no way of knowing which character was meant by that as it could have been any encoding. Now it's interpreted as UTF-8 by default, and can be changed by adding such a header.
I don't think that those two articles are about encoding in the sense of your variable name being a Beta-symbol for example, but regarding the encoding in the variable value.so if you change your code to this example:Hope that answers your questionGreetingsFrame
