Use lambda:
You can wrap it in another function like this:Then use it like this:If you want to pass it to another function:
You need to escape quotes that your string is surrounded by. Moreover you need to use raw string, to escape other chars. So ...:But if you need to apply function that is have partially  fixed elements you should just use partial from functools, not this ad hoc with eval.Using partial you can fix common arguments and pass others that are not common on every call.
