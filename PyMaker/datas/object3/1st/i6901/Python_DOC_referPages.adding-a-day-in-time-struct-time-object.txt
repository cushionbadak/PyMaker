I am using a time.struct_time to set up the date and time and I want to add to the next day using a python script.I am using following code:Output:Now I want to add 1 day to this date. I used the following code:I am new on this, so can you please show me an example how I could add to the next day date using with my code?
Consider datetime.timedelta as explained in this question: Adding 5 days to a date in Python
Honestly, I'm not sure if there even is a (clean) way. The data of a struct_time object are stored as tuples, so they are immutable. This means they can't really be modified in place.I think you should be using the datetime module instead, like so:You can then add a month like so:If you want to add a single day, then use datetime.timedelta(), which deals with the month's number of days:The reason I didn't use this above is because timedelta() doesn't take months as an argumentIf you wish to convert it back to a string, then you use the strftime() function like so:If for some reason you need to use the time module (say for one part of your code) but you want to convert it to the datetime object (for reasons like this), then I refer you to this question.
