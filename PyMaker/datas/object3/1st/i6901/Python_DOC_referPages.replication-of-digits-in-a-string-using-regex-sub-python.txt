I have a s="gh3wef2geh4ht". How can I receive s="gh333wef22geh4444ht" by using sub. I have tried this regexp. what I am doing wrong?
You cannot use a regular expression pattern in the replacement pattern. The {...} does not copy the text captured in Group 1 n times. You need to use a lambda expression or a callback method in the re.sub to achieve what you want:See the Python demoNote you do not need any capturing groups here, as the whole match is already available in Group 0.Here, m is assigned with the curren match object, m.group() is the text value of the match and int(m.group()) is the digit cast to an int. Thus, when 3 is matched, the lambda expression does just "3" * 3 and returns as the replacement.
You can use a lambda function to capture the matched digits and repeat it:
