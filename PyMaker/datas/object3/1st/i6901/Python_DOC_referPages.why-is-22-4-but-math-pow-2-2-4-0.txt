Why are not these two statements equivalents?Python 3.5.3 (default, Jan 19 2017, 14:11:04)
The order of execution of the operators (operator precedence) matters here: with -2**2, the exponentiation of 2 to the power 2 is first executed, then the negative sign.Use parenthesis to obtain the desired result(-2)**2 = 4
because the precedence of '-' is behind the precedence of '**', use (-2)**2 to calculate -2 at first
You can check the precedence from the Python3 documentation.-2**2calculates as : -(2**2) = -4.
