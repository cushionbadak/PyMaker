I'm having trouble with async methods. I've already tried many examples from stack overflow, such as:The problem with those approaches is that they need to specify the number/methods before executing. What I need is a way to call a specific method many times from the terminal, but it can't be stuck on the last call.
You can use the multiprocessing module:When executed, you can type "foo" and printRandomNumber will run in the background. You can, of course, change "foo" to whatever you like (like "printRandomNumber"), and with a little work, you could even get some arguments working.
