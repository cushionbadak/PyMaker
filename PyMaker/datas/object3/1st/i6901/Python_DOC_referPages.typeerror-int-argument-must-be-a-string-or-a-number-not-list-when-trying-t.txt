I am trying to filter duplicate occurrence of number from the input stringIf the string contains duplicate characters then it must print "Not a valid number , if the input is without duplicate characters it must print "Valid Number"What is the correct way to check the duplicate occurrenceI am getting the below error:
Convert to a set and measure its size.If a string contains duplicates, converting it to its set equivalent will cause a reduction in size, so the set will not be of the same size as the string.
sorted() returns a list and int() cannot take list as an argument. To accomplish what you want to do (check if input contains duplicates) is to do Then check if the size of set is equal to len(input_number), you get the size of set simply by len(set(input_number)). If yes, all characters are unique. If not, some characters repeated and got cut off, because set() is like a set in mathematics, it only contains unique elements. So if not all the elements in input_number are unique, then the size of set would be smaller.Whole code would be something like this:
To get duplicate items in listFor you Solution 1Another solution 2 List has count method it returns no of any string exist in list
