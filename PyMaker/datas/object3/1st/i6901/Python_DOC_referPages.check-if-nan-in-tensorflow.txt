Natural Text
I would like to check a tensorflow variable and set it to zero if it is NaN.How can I do this? The following trick seems not to work:
If v is a 0d tensor, you might use tf.where to test and update the value:
You could use tf.is_nan in combination with tf.cond to change values if the tensorflow value is NAN.
Libraries like numpy (in this case, tensorflow) often have their own boolean implementations, comparing the memory addresses of a custom boolean type, and CPython's built in using is is going to result in erratic behaviour.Either just check implicit boolean-ness -> if tf.is_nan(v) or do a equality comparison if tf.is_nan(v) == True.
I hope this can help you.   math.is_nan
