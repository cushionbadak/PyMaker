Inside folder test is a Python file called bar.py, and in that file I am trying to do something like:And it gives me this error: Do I need to add something to environment variables or sys.path?
Absolute importIf you want to useThen yes, foo must be contained in sys.path.From the docs:When importing the package, Python searches through the directories on  sys.path looking for the package subdirectory.In that case take a look at questions such as adding a file path to sys.path in python.Relative importAlternatively inside of bar.py you should be able to use as an intra-package reference.Lastly: either way, you should put another empty __init__.py file inside of test to let Python know that folder is a subpackage.
