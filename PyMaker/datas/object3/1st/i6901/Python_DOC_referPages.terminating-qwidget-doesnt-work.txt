I used self.close to close the widget that is running. Whole code is as follows:What I expect from this code is, as long as the connectivity function is returning True, user will be repeatedly asked to do the certain action if they click yes. If they click no, I would like to terminate the whole widget. But when I click no, then it just goes through the lines after the self.close. What can I do to actually terminate the program?
To close an application forcefully as in this case we can use sys.exit()
