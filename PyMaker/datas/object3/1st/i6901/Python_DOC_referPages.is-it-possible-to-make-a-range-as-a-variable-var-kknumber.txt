My equation in a loop is long. I would like to define a range obviously before going to substitute it into the equation line. Here is my loop. k represents a range I want to use in the equationIs it possible to define k as a range as pseudocode shown?
We could generate those start, stop indices with cumsum on char_num and then use those within the loop for slicing H, like so -Sample run -If you actually need the range as an array for some processing other than for slicing, we can use range(i,j) or np.arange(i,j) within the loop. We can also use that range for slicing, but that would force a copy and would slow things down.Alternatively, we can use a slice notation there, like so -
