I have 7 columns in my dataset. A part of my script is taking the columns and processing it. For example the following is working on second columnI want it to process all 7 columns and writing each output as 'file$columnno.dat' Question 1: Is this a correct way to do it?Question 2: Now the output is just a list of numbers. But I want the output for each column as a file such as file1.dat (1 is the same syntax of the column no.), file2.dat etc. Is that %f command. I didn't manage to fix it. It seems pretty standard and sorry if I am overwriting this question with existing ones. 
Looks like you need list.extendEx:Using map to convert every element in list to float
Question 1Your solution will not work, because you can't iterate over the same line twice, unless you use seek(0) (see docs: Methods of File Objects) to start again from the first line. Instead, you can iterate each line and create a list of lists, with each sublist representing a row in your file.The csv module makes the syntax easier, so you don't need to manually iterate, split strings or convert to float. These can be handled by csv.reader in an efficient way:Question 2You can iterate over each index of your list of lists via zip. Then, within your loop, iterate over values in your column. The output will be 7 files each with a column from the original input file. Here's an example:
