I completely understand that I should have written the script right the first time, but the fact is I have a script that generates a data file based upon two values passed to it from the command line- like this:I need to call this script from within another script, iterating over a range of values. I searched around and after navigating through all of the "you shouldn't," I tried :And this doesn't seem to work.Help?
Let's break this down into pieces:This is equivalent to:That open is the same open you use for, say, reading a text file or a CSV. You're asking for a file named "sim_gen.py 100 .3" in the current directory. Do you have one? Of course not. So the open fails.The best solution is, as you already know, to rewrite sim_gen.py so that you can import it and call a function and pass the arguments to it.Failing that, the cleanest answer is probably to just run the Python script as a subprocess:Notice that this is effectively the same thing you're doing when you run the script from your shell, so if it was OK there, it's almost surely OK here.If you really need to exec for some reason, you will need to do something really hacky, and temporarily change argv for that script's code:Although really, unless the point of running this is to silently modify your own module's globals or the like, you (a) almost certainly don't really need exec, and (b) want to pass an explicit globals argument even if you do really need it.
