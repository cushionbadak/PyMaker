I am trying to parse a string in this format "2018 - 07 - 07 04 - AM"to pandas datetime using strftime format. However, It seems to me the format doesn't recognize the difference between AM and PM. Here is what I tried:pd.to_datetime("2018 - 07 - 07 04 - PM", format='%Y - %m - %d %H - %p').timestamp()Out[4]: 1530936000.0pd.to_datetime("2018 - 07 - 07 04 - AM", format='%Y - %m - %d %H - %p').timestamp()Out[5]: 1530936000.0Notice how the AM and PM are different in the above two strings, yet the same timeStamp is returned. Pandas version: 0.23.3 Python version: 3.5.4
Since you're parsing a 12-hour time format, you will need %I instead of %H, otherwise the %p specifier has no effect.This behaviour is documented in the docs:When used with the strptime() function, the %p directive only affects  the output hour field if the %I directive is used to parse the hour.
