I'm trying to make the migration from Windows to Linux, some of my Python code has not survived the move.this is the Windows version:etc....I'm trying to address a csv file in a certain directory but I can't figure out the Linux addressing. Can anyone Help?
here is some info for linux directory structure press Alt + Enter over your file then in that properties dialog copy the path to root its something like /home/<user_name>/Documents then append that path with file name of csv file.At Final your csv file's path becomes something like /home/<user_name>/Documents/filename.csv
You could use separator from os module:That way it could be Windows/Linux independent.Here is official documentation to os.path module.
Use whatever path is your csv file in linux!
