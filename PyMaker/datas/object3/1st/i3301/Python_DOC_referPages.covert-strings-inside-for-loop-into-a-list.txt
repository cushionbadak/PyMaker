You can replace your print statement with an append to a list you initialized before the loop.This outputs:
You can use list comprehension to generate the list more succinctly.In python, list comprehension allows for `[x for x in (1,4,3,2)] formatting.So that would lead to this code.The results variable will be:['app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php', 'app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php']
