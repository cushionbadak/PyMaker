This question already has an answer here:Is there an algorithm to find unique combinations of 2 lists? 5 lists?                    7 answers                Number permutations in python iterative                    3 answers                In Python, is there a concise way to use a list comprehension with multiple iterators?                    4 answers                Generating all possibly length n combinations of two items in python                    2 answers                I have N ordered slots. Each slot has a value within V possible valuesHow would it be possible to generate the list of all possible combinations in Python? For instance, when V=2 and N=4, I would like to get the following list of the 2**4 different combinations:I would like the code to work when N and V vary. For example, when N=9 slots and V=4 possible values, I expect the list of the 4**9=262144 possible combinations.
