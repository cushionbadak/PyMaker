I've been trying to write binary search recursively. When I do this using the list[:] syntax I don't get the intended results with several errors coming up or not getting the correct values. EDIT: Example inputs and outputsI expect to get something like '0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9' but get '0,1,0,0,4,None ,None,2,0,0'
You have two problems. First one is a typo, where you sayyou should saySince you're comparing the value and not the index.Second one is more subtle... when you check the right side of the array, in:The subarray you're passing to the recursive call (arr[mid+1:]) already starts in the middle of the array, that means the result of that recursive call will return the index of the element in the subarray.  So you need to add the index delta you used to split the array, to have a index based on the full array again:Here's the full code for completeness:
You're comparing val to mid, instead of to arr[mid]. Also, it would read nicer if you made the ifs mutually exclusive. Also, as per nosklo's answer below, you need to add the index offset for the greater than case:
