There will be 2 inputs, person1 and person2I need to check if the 2 inputs have the letters t,r,u,e,l,o,v,e (yes, the value of e will be duplicate).example: putting in john smith and jane doe will result to:T - 1R - 0U - 0E - 2L - 0O - 2V - 0E - 2I hope this makes sense. I am still a python rookie.EDIT:I came up with the code below, thanks to your help. Now, I need help. Why doesn't print(tr) generate a value?
Feed each name to a Counter, combine the two Counters, then look up each character of the third string in the Counter.
