This question already has an answer here:Extract part of a regex match                    8 answers                I've written a script in python in combnation with re module to get the title of different questions from a webpage. My intention here is not to use BeautifulSoup and still to be able to parse the titles. The way I've used a pattern can do it. However, the output doesn't look so nice. How can I get only the question titles and nothing else.Here is my try (using re.search()):Output I'm getting like (out of several):What I wish to get is like:I'm very new to regex. So, I seek apology in advance, If my question doesn't fit to be a question.
You just need to use group(1), which gets the first captured subgroup, instead of group(), which gets the entire match.From the docs:Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned).So:As a side note:My intention here is not to use BeautifulSoup and still to be able to parse the titles. The way I've used a pattern can do it. Really? I can easily construct examples where your regex will do the wrong thing. Even without semi-pathological data, if they push a new minor release of the website on Tuesday that doesn't even touch this part of the code, given that attributes are arbitrarily ordered, the attributes of that a could show up in a different order, and suddenly your search fails, while a trivial BeautifulSoup search still works.If you're doing this for the purpose of learning regular expressions, that may be fine (although really, HTML is not a great example to use for that), but if you're trying to get actual work done, you're better off using a parser.
