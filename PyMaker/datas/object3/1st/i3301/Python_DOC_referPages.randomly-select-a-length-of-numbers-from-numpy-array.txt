Natural Text
I have a number of data files, each containing a large amount of data points. After loading the file with numpy, I get a numpy array:How do I randomly select a length of x, but the order of numbers should not be changed?For example:if I wanted to select a random length of 3 data points, the output should be:1,5,3, or3,7,4, or5,3,7, etc.
Pure logic will get you there.For a list f and a max length x, the valid starting points of your random slices are limited to 0, len(f)-x:So all valid starting point can be selected with random.randrange(len(f)-x+1) (where the +1 is because randrange works like range).Store the random starting point into a variable start and slice your array with [start:start+x], or be creative and use another slice after the first:
