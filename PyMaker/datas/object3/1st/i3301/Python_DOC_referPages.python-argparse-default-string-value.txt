using argparse:I want to achieve the following behavior:The user doesn't specify the -o flag - no logging should be done.User specifies the -o with nothing - I should log to a default location, defined within my program.User specifies -o and a string(path) - I should log there. Does anyone know the best way to use add_argument to achieve that? I saw a similar example with int values, but in my case, it doesn't get my default value. 
You can use nargs='?' for this:If not present, it will produce the default value, if present but without a value it'll use const, otherwise it'll use the supplied value. Also read through the other examples in the docs, there's a sample for an optional output file which could be useful.
