Can someone show me a step by step solution or a way to go about this question?Write a function that takes a dict as its input and returns the number of vowels contained within the dict's string keys.  For this exercise, you can consider a vowel to be the letters "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u".I suppose an example would be count_dict_vowels({"Here": "Now", "When": "Python"}) == 3
You didn't specify how you wanted the output to look like so I created a new dictionary with the same keys but the number of vowels as the value.The "trick" here is using map() to take advantage of the str method count() and summing all the values.Gives the output:
