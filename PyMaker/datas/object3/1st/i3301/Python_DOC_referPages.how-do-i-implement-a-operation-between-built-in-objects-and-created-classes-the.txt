Let's say I want to define a class with a __mul__ method, for example:If I do A()*2 it will give me a result. But when I try the other way around (2*A()), it doesn't work.Is there a way to implement this other way around operation?
You would use object.__rmul__(self, other):https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
