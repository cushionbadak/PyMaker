I have a dictionary as followsand in my classThe above declaration is incorrect.If I want to add typing for my_dict what it should be and how to write the structure since I am having different types as values?
You want to use a Union as the value for the dictionary:The union informs the typechecker that values in the dictionary must be either strs, bools, or ints. When getting values, you'll want to use isinstance to determine what to do with a value:If you know that a key will contain a specific type, you can avoid the typechecker's complaints by using cast:
I'll take a stab it it. So, the type of the values looks to be pretty distinct and easy to determine at runtime. The code that accesses the dictionary data and performs some action on it dependent on its type can use instanceof() in an if/elif/else block.or you could test for type like so: if type(val) is str: dosomething()
