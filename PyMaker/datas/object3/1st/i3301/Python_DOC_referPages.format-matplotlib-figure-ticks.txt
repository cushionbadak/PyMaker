I am using matplotlib together with tkinter to display graphs. I am trying to change the format of my y-axis ticks to fit the need of the graph. Here is what I have tried.However this formats the ticks to an integer with commas in the thousands marks. Shown here. How would I format this so the y-axis ticks began with a $ and ended with a decimal. Thank you.
You can use the StrMethodFormatter class, giving it a format string that uses the same mini-language as Python's str.format() function.The format string in this case, beginning with a dollar sign and ending with a decimal, would be "${x:.2f}".  The x labels the field, the StrMethodFormatter class allows two fields in the format string: x for the value and pos for the position.The last line in your code would become:If you want more or less decimal places just change the number 2.  If you wanted to keep the thousands separators add a comma after the colon: "${x:,.2f}".
