Natural Text
Have some lightweight text search engine. It iterates through the .txt files in one folder, searches for selected term and displays the name of the file. All is based on the functionality of os library:The search is working good itself but I want as a final operation save the .txt files that were received in the result in another folder save_path For that I trying to use os.path.join(save_path,f) but it seems that it is not working. What will be the right approach to do that?
os.path.join only merges strings to look like a path, and has nothing to do with saving data to a file. Refer to this example which uses the pathlib moduleNote that creating p2 does not create anything in the file system.Regarding how to save files, you need to specify the mode as a second parameter, being 'w' the mode for writing. Check the documentation for more info.Your code thus would look likeNote also that pathlib exposes read_text and write_text methods, among others.
