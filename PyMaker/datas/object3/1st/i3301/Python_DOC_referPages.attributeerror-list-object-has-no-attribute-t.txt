I have been trying to implement a neural network in python that uses back propagation and keep getting the above error. How can I go about eliminating it. The code runs for one epoch without calculating the error in the system hence it is not able to back propagate the error across the networkThe error I am getting is
The X you are using is a list. You should use a numpy.array:
X is a list. You can see that by typing type(X). And lists do not have a transpose method. You want an array, so replace X = [0.4, 0.7]  with:Oh and btw.: A transpose of X = np.array([0.4, 0.7]) will be the same as X:This is true for all X with one dimension.
