I am building a scraper where I want to extract the data from some tags as it is without any conversion. But Beautifulsoup changing some hex values to ASCII. For example, this code gets converted into ASCII Here's the small example of the codeBut I want to extract the data in the same form. I believe BeautifulSoup 4 auto converting HTML entities and this is what I don't want. Any help would be really appreciated.BTW I am using Python 3.5 and Beautifulsoup 4
you might try using re module ( Regular Expressions ). for an instance the code below will extract the title tag info without converting it: (I assumed that you declared html variable before)You may do the same for the other tags as well
