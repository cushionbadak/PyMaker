I am doing some analysis on world cup data, I found scrapped json file of records, it is a json object that you can check here I want to get the name and time of the goal for every match.The problem I am facing is that the json has square brackets, because of that I have to through doing many for loops.Can I avoid having to do this?
I have to through doing many for loops.  Can I avoid having to do this?You can't avoid loops completely, but you can hide some of them in generator expressions:Then you need only one single loop for all the matches:Of course, you can play the iterator game one more level and also have the goals yielded by a generator. This is just an example how it could work.Please note the your data contains entries which have score1 > 0 but no key goals1. You could consider using a try block. Then you don't even to check the score: just try the goals and you are done. So, that boils down to:
Your code should work ok. Some of the matches though do not contain goal fields which can be fixed by using .get() with a default. Yes the loops are needed, it can though be simplified slightly as follows:This would give you output starting:itemgetter() is a useful way to extract required fields from a list or dictionary.
May be the answer is not the one looking for,  found schema very intersting in parsing json and validatingTry this https://github.com/keleshev/schemaCreate schema for one match.. using schema you could extract relevant data.Result:
