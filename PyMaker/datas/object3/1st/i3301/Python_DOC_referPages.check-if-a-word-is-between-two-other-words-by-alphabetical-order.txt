Natural Text
I want to check if a given word is between two other words, by alphabetical (or "dictionary") order.For example:I want to see if check is between word1 and word2 (it is).I tried this:but that's giving me False.
Well you here basically check if:But here, it is the opposite: word2 is less, and word1 is greater, we can however compbine the two possibilities with:So here regardless of what the order is between word1 and word2, it checks if check is "sandwiched" in between.
