I'm making some calculations where I get values like number*e-17 , but i would like to make all those small values become zero.Is there a way to make something like a tolerance that will change low values to zero in the whole program?I'm using sympy btw.many thanks,
You could use math.isclose to test for closeness to zero, and set the values accordingly:more details in python docs
