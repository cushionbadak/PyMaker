I'm trying to make the self-running feature of Visual Studio Code unit tests work.I recently made a change in the directory structure of my Python project that was previously like this:And my setup for unittest was like this:After the changes, the structure of the project was as follows:After that the extension does not discover my tests anymore. I've tried to change the '-s' parameter to "./app/tests", ".tests", "./tests", "app/tests", "/app/tests", "app.tests", unsuccessfully .
The problem was that I was using relative imports in the test module (from ..utils import guards). I just changed it to absolute import (from app.utils import guards) and it all worked again.
Activate your virtualenv,Go in your myproject directory and run:This will run the tests in app/tests/.Follow the documentation for more information.EDIT:You need to set the cwd parameter to the root of your project (myproject directory) and change the unittestArgs to search tests in app/tests.
