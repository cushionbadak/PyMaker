How do I append another list to the column df_final['time_seq'] which is stored in timeseq=[xyz,xyz...,xyz]
For your particular question:Generally, df.loc[df.index[i], 'NAME'] gives you the element for a named column with integer indices, and since that's a list in your case, you can use the built-in extends method for Python lists.
