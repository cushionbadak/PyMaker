I have two lists of dicts like this : list2 has two elements that list1 does not have and list1 has one element that list2 does not have.I need a list_result with all the elements merged : Whats the best way to do that in Python ? thanks!
You can use frozenset() to hash each dictionaries items() to a dictionary, then simply take the assigned values:Or using map() applied to a set comprehension:Or even using just a list comprehension:Which will give an unordered result:Note: If order is needed, you can use a collections.OrderedDict() instead here:Which gives this ordered result:
In Python there is the builtin set collection that is perfect for this. The problem is that sets need hashable elements so you must convert the dict to a set of tuples:
You can create a set out of these values, instead of the dictionaries it would require to be converted into a hashable object like tuple:and then can be converted back to dictionaries and list format again:Something like above should work.
