I have a string like this: s = "b'1f\xe6\xb5\x8b\xe7\xbb\x98'"How to convert it back to the original string?I try to use eval(s), however get SyntaxError: bytes can only contain ASCII literal characters.
Don't use eval, it's dangerous. Use ast.literal_eval instead and then decode to a string like @Amadan says:As is said in the comments, my s actually has a  repr that looks like "b'1f\\xe6\\xb5\\x8b\\xe7\\xbb\\x98'". Can you please confirm what your print(repr(your_string)) and print(your_string) look like?
