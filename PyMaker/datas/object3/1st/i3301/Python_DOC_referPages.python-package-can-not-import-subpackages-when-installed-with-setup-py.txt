I developed a python package which I want to use in another project. The package structure looks like the following example:The bar.py File contains the Bar-Class which relies on the files in sub_pkg1 and sub_pkg2 which are imported like The __init__.py files just import each python file in it's directory.For example the __init__.py of sub_pkg1:The main.py File just imports the Bar Class and executes some methods of it.The setup.pyfile looks like the following:When I run the main.py file directly from the package it works like a charm.However when I install it in my other project with pip using the command:(I don't want to publish the package to PyPi yet and just want to include the development-version in my other project)and try to import it - I am getting the error: Do I need to export the sub_packages somehow?I use Python 3.6
instead of from sub_pkg1 import example.py use from sub_pkg1 import ExampleClassas in __init__.py of sub_pkg1 and sub_pkg2 you have already imported ExampleClass and you are now free to directly import ExampleClass from sub_pkg1 anywhere in your project.Read more about __init__.py and modules here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
