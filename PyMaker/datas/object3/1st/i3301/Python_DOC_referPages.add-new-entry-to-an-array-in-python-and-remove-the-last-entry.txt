I want to add a new entry to an array and remove the last entry. I want to do this without using pop or append etc.AttemptThe output gives [9,3,4,5,1] when the answer I want is [9,1,2,3,4]. Any tips on how I can correct the logic used would be great!EditI should have been more clear. I want to do this using only logic and loops, without using built in python functions or array operations like array[:-1] etc..

Simple enough with list literals and slices:
