I am using Pydev on Eclipse.This is my codePydev shows unresolved import for from http.client import RemoteDisconnected this line. But when I run the code, it works (It prints not working for few of the sites that are down). What could be wrong?
Please try adding http.client to the forced builtins to see if it fixes your problem.See http://www.pydev.org/manual_101_interpreter.html#PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins for details on how to actually do that (and how that's used).
