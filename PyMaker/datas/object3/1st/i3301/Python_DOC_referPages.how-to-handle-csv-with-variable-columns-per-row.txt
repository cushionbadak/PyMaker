Natural Text
I've got a file that has a header row with a fixed number of labels and rows of variable length. The last column has a field that should really be a sublist of items, but this list is treated as a continuum of columns.Example:I ultimately want to iterate over the sublist, in this case telephone #'s. I've tried using csv dictreader but it drops the extra columns. Thanks in advance.
You don't need DictReader.  Use the standard reader and tuple assignment syntax:Code:test.csv:Output:
As you can see in DictReader docs:If a row has more fields than fieldnames, the remaining data is put in a list and stored with the fieldname specified by restkey (which defaults to None).All you must do is pass the restkey parameter and all your extra values will go there.will print
