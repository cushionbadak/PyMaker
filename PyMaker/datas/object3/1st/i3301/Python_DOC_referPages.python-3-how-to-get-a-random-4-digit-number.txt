I need help to get a random 4 digit long number with no repeated digits inside the number so I have Would this be the best way to go at it?I also need help with making sure the first digit is not 0, how could I do that? Cheers for the input
If you want to extend your solution to make sure the leading digit isn't 0, there's probably no super-concise way to write it; just be explicit:Notice that I'm taking advantage of the fact that sample takes a sequence or set. In older versions of Python, it required a sequence. According to the 2.7 docs, this includes 2.7â€”but CPython and PyPy 2.7 both take a set anyway. Anyway, if this is a problem, you can just do leftover = [val for val in range(10) if val != first].One more thing to consider, if performance matters. A nondeterminstic solution like noskio's answer obviously has unbounded worst-case time, but it could be significantly faster in almost every case. There's a 90% chance you'll get your answer the first time, and a 99.9999999% within the first ten loops, and it's at least plausible that a single call to sample could be about an order of magnitude faster than multiple set operations, etc.
If you allow the first digit to be zero (such as 0123 instead of 123), then you will need your result to be a string. To do this, I would suggest random.sample(['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'], 4). Alternatively, random.sample([str(x) for x in range(10)], 4).Otherwise, abarnert's answer works.
The following code does the job:
random.sample() makes sure you get no repeated digits, but the first digit can be zero, so can re-randomize in this case
Using permutations from itertools:Sample output:Edit: permutations, no product
You should import the random library first on python IDE.
