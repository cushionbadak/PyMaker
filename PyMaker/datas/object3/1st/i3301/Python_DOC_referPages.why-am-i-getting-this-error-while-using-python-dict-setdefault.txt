You cannot do what you are looking to do because str is immutable, you will always need to construct a new string and assign it back to the key. You can do this with lists because the list is mutable, i.e. you can mutate the list in the dictionary.For str just use dict.get(). This will append the value onto the existing value in the dictionary if it exists or to the empty string if it doesn't, e.g.:Alternatively, use a collection.defaultdict, e.g.:Note: don't use dict as a variable name it hides pythons dict type.
