Natural Text
I have following code:it's works, but I try to find a way how to make "if sys.argv[2].isdigit() and sys.argv[3].isdigit() and sys.argv[2] >='3' and sys.argv[3] >='3':" shorter and more beautiful. Is there any way to reach this? Thx!
This is a nice, expandable condition to replace yours:This will be true if all elements of sys.argv[2:4] are numbers greater than 3. This might also be overkill for checking two numbers, but this is much more readable than checking everything separately and it should be abundantly clear to anyone who reads this what you are trying to do.
