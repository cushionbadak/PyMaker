Natural Text
Is there a good way to parse a printf-style format string and get the various bits (literal text & format points with processable options) as part of the standard library, or failing that as a third-party library? I could not find one in the stdlib, and a web search does not seem to turn up anything useful.Python 2.6 added string.Formatter which allows processing and customising format-style strings, but I did not manage to find a similar tool for printf-style format strings.I'm looking for it to do things like validate translations, and possibly convert printf-style format strings to format-style ones (or even f-strings).
Not hard to slap one together with pyparsing, after looking at the docs:Prints:If you prefer regex, it should not be hard to convert this prototype to something workable.
