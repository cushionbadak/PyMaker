I'm more of a SQL guy but I was asked a question that stumped me during an interview. I'll put the gist of it here:there is a flatfile with two columns: 'Course' and 'Student_id' with several rowsCourse: Science, Math, Science, History, Science, MathStudent_id: 101, 103, 102, 101, 103, 101How would you go about using only base python with no packages or libraries, grouping the students by courses, returning counts of students in each course, returning 'Science' with number of students enrolled, returning 'Math' with each student_id enrolledI knew how I would go about this in SQL and with pandas but did not know how to go about this in base python without packages or libraries. Please help. 
You can build a dictionary with courses as keys and keep sets of student ids. (You could keep lists of student ids but then you might end up with duplicates which would skew your numbers, although maybe that's something you should check and warn about or stop with an error.)dict has a function setdefault which creates a value for a key only if it doesn't already exist, and returns the value. If you set a set it will return it and you can add the latest student id:
Edit:Seems I misread your description of the file format, this solution works if you get two rows with column-separated values in them - not for lots of rows with two comma sepparated values each. Leaving it in as its a mvca for the file format I thought you faced.You could do this:With that file you:Output:
