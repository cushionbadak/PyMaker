This question already has an answer here:Python for-in loop preceded by a variable                    4 answers                I'm new to Python, so I was hoping somebody could break down the following statement and explain the purpose of each part.Obviously for digit in string.split() creates a list of substrings by separating the string into elements at each space.What confuses me is the digit at the very beginning and the if statement at the very end.Is the very first digit what will be returned if digit.isdigit()?Why must this statement be wrapped in a list?I've never seen a for loop and an if statement combined into one statement like this before, but it reminds me of a particular JS syntax: for (condition) // whatever or if (condition) // whatever. However, in JS you can't combine them into a single statement (i.e. for (condition) if (condition) // whatever).
This is called a list comprehension. You will find plenty of pages explaining how it works. Just ask you favorite search engine.
