I am running on a AIX 6.1 and using Python 2.7. Want to execute following line but getting an error.
The subprocess.run() function only exists in Python 3.5 and newer.It is easy enough to backport however:There is no support for timeouts, and no custom class for completed process info, so I'm only returning the retcode, stdout and stderr information. Otherwise it does the same thing as the original.
