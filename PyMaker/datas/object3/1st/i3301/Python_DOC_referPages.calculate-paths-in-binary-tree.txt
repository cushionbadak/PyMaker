Hi in this code I tried to calculate the paths in the binary tree(data Structure). But in some case it will give me an error said that"AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'left'"How can I fix this problem?For example in this case I will have the attribute error.The error I see is:
The exception tells you exactly what went wrong. One of your node's lefts is an integer instead of BTNode (which according to your type annotations is what left and right should be).The problem here is the BTNode(None, 1, 5). This is creating a BTNode with item = None, left = 1 and right = 5. left and right need to be BTNodes. So instead of:Try:Some ideas on how to prevent this in the future:Note that type annotations are optional in Python and not enforced by the interpreter. If you want to check if your program is typed soundly, you need to run mypy on your codebase. It will complain for a few reasons:BTNode(None, 1, 5) - because the 1 and 5 aren't BTNodesThe types of left and right need to be Optional[BTNode] since they can be None (from typing import Optional)It also may be easier to see this if you constructed the tree using named args:Also look into typing.Generic so that you can leverage the type system more when getting item out of your BTNode (and not having to do unsafe casts).
