I'm trying to scan a CSV file into an array in Python, but every time I execute this code I got the message:Any ideas how to fix this?If it helps, if I delete the penultimate line and just finish with "array.append(i)" the array scans just fine, but it prints each row as all one line. I want to be able to break them up into columns too.
Use the csv.reader from the standard library.
