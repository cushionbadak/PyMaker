I thought I'd be able to figure this one out myself based on the last answer I received for a similar problem, but am again drawing a blank.I'm making a Python 3 web scraper that scrapes MLB scores from The Score's website. What I want, is to output the relevant information to a CSV in the exact same layout as it shows on the website. The URL to use for this example would be:https://www.thescore.com/mlb/events/date/2018-06-29...and this is my current code (I know it's incorrect, but I've tried several different solutions, but none of which are giving me the output I want, trying the row.append, etc. I have the URLs list imported from a CSV currently as I want this to cycle through a list of Urls, but this is the one link to use as an example)I have also attached a picture of what my "Desired" DailyResultsOutput.csv output file should look like.One thing to mention is that where it says "Final" on the site for each particular game, that can sometimes change to say something like "Final (13)" or however many innings that game went into, so the code can't just input the string "Final", it needs to take the value from the site.  As you'll see, currently it just makes one row with all of the needed information, but I would like it laid out under the appropriate column headers. Thanks a million for all your help again. Let me know if I've missed anything.
The below code is one way of doing things. Example Code:Output:DailyResultsOutput.csvExplanation:Open file for writing.Extract html from page with GET request using requests library.Parse html tags with BeautifulSoup library.Manipulate items and write to file using csv library.
