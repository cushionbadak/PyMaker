Please help me, I'm a beginner at Python. Everything is good when I run my code but there is an error after I click the stop button. How can I resolve this problem?Code:Output:Error:
You've just misunderstood what KeyboardInterrupt means. To quote from the relevant Python docs:exception KeyboardInterruptRaised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete). During execution, a check for interrupts is made regularly. The exception inherits from BaseException so as to not be accidentally caught by code that catches Exception and thus prevent the interpreter from exiting.In this case, your "interrupt key" is just your IDE's stop button, rather than any keyboard shortcut. You didn't make any mistakes. I do think your IDE shouldn't be showing that, though, since it's not really an error, and it makes it seem like one. You can safely ignore this error, or follow blhsing's advice and wrap your code in a try / except KeyboardInterrupt to make it look prettier. Frankly, I wouldn't, but it's ultimately a matter of opinion.
The KeyboardInterrupt exception is raised when you manually abort the execution of the script with ctrl-C, so it isn't really an error, but you can make it exit gracefully when ctrl-C is pressed by catching the exception in a try block.
