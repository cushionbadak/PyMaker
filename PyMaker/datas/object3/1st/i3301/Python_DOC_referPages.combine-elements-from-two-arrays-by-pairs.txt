So I want to concatenate two arrays but by pairs. The input is as follows:And the output should be as follows: I managed to get such result by iterating over the two arrays but I wonder if there any faster way .Thank you   
For a vectorised solution, you can stack and transpose:
Using np.column_stackStack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
You can use the zip function to combine any two iterables like this.  It will continue until it reaches the end of the shorter iterable
