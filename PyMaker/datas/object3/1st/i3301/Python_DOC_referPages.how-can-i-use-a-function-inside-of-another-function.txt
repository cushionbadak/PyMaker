I am currently playing around with classes and functions since i am not familiar with python and i would like to know how i can get addy(self, addx) to call addx.line 15, in  print(one.addy()) TypeError: addy() missing 1  required positional argument: 'addx' Process finished with exit code 1
You need to call self from within a class method.self.addx()Also the addx parameter on this line shouldn't be there:def addy(self, addx):I think this is what you are going for:
You've overcomplicated things by wrapping it in a class. Take it out and it'll work (mostly) the way you expect.Since you've wrapped it in the class you've complicated the namespace. It's no longer called addx or addy, so using those names throws a NameError. You have to use the qualified name instead.Methods are always passed their owning object as a first argument when called, which is why we've got def addx(self): but then call with self.addx()
If you are attempting to relate addx in the signature of addy to the method addx, you can pass the string name of the method and use getattr:
