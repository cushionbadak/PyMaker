I want an array to loop when the code throws the IndexError. Here is the Example:My code works but when pos > 9 it still throws the IndexError.
If you want a circular iterator, use itertools.cycle. If you just want circular behaviour when indexing, you can use modulo-based indexing.
That is because when pos > 4 and pos < 10 your code throws an IndexError exception, and it then runs a[pos - len(a)] which will give the desired result.However, when pos >= 10, the control will go to the Except block, but then the statement a[pos - len(a)] will also give an IndexError exception, becuase pos - len(a) would be greater than 4, since len(a) is a constant.I would recommend you to implement a circular iterator about which coldspeed said in his answer, or do something like this if you want to follow your approach:P.S. You also don't need to put this whole thing in a try-except block. ^.^
You want to print a[pos % len(a)], not a[pos - len(a)], as anything greater than 10, minus 5, is greater than 5.
