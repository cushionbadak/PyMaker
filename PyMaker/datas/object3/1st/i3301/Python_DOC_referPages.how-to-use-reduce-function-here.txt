This question already has an answer here:Sum the second value of each tuple in a list                    4 answers                I am trying to find total of all the integers in a tupleThe above code can take the first value of integer, but i want to find the sum of all  the integers, how to do it using reduce in python
Change the definition of the adding function (there is no need to use lambda notation here):And tell reduce that the initial value is a number, not a tuple, by providing the third optional parameter:The same solution with lambda:And one more solution that does not use reduce:
If using reduce is not necessary, a much more elegant solution is
You would use operator.itemgetter(1) to get the numbers out of the tuple, and reduce with operator.add to sum themA simpler solution without reduce is sum(mark for name, mark in marks)
You can check if the first parameter (x) is a tuple:Output:
