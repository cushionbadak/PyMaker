Total python noob here. Trying to learn python. I'm using macosx with high sierra 10.13.5 and have python Python 2.7.10.  My task here is to run a mongodb query using python, but to no avail as i'm trying to use pymongo.  Here's the message that I'm seeing: (executed on command line python mydev.py)I got this same message running the python shell with just import pymongo and running the script. My python script:So, i don't know how do i get this to work.  What pkgs am I missing? Thanks for your help.
Given the hint that it was not pymongo but the fact that I have multiple versions of python running on my mac. It became clearer after more research that having multiple versions of python can be problematic.  I read this article - https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#ideI was able to successfully run the python script like so:/usr/bin/python mydev.py
