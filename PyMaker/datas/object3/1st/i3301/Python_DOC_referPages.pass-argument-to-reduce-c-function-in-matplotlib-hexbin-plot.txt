I am trying to implement a hexbin plot inside a function, and have a rather complicated reduce_C_function that will need to receive an argument a. An (albeit trivial) example:
You can make a partial function from your sum_i and pass it to plt.hexbin as a function of a single argument:  From the looks of the source code there is no other way to pass additional arguments for reduce_C_function.
