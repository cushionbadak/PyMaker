In python, I am making a turtle program and I need to loop a function, I wouldn't use def n():#code; time.sleep(time); n() as I am sure it would raise a RecursionError soon enough, due to the syntax.I soon learnt of the root.after syntax for tkinter.However, I am looking for the same syntax for the turtle library. I have checked on the internet several times but no luck so far.Is there any function in the turtle library that would meet my needs?
what about?Parameters: fun – a function with no argumentst – a number >= 0https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html#turtle.ontimer
