I have a document that I opened using python:Inside myfile I have lines like this:The ONLY lines that I need to keep are these ones:In other words, the lines that have information from information in: myfile[line][:44] I MUST keep. The other lines (the shorter lines) I must DELETE.Any ideas on how to do this?
If the lines that have to be dropped always have less than 44 characters, and the valid ones always have at least 44 (like you say), you can just do:
Perhaps I use regex as a go-to too much, but the re module seems perfect here given you want to identify a line string pattern: lines identified by the data within. If you don't know it already the re module uses 'perl' syntax string-matching patterns, see the docs hereYou can test a regex you build online using a tool such as regex 101If you are trying to identify a line such as |     1HEE     JJ    1   3.904   5.512   1.259 | I would write a regex as something like: ^\| +\w{4} +\w+ +\d +\d.\d{3} +\d.\d{3} +\d.\d{3} +\| (try it in Regex 101.Please note that this pattern makes some assumptions about the actual string pattern based upon what is given in the example.Using a method from the re module such as .findall and this pattern you should be able to gather all lines which follow your desired format. To clarify when pattern matching using the .findall method you would end up with all lines matching the desired format as a list of strings in your program that you could manipulate as you please (including making a new text file with that only has harvested data).
