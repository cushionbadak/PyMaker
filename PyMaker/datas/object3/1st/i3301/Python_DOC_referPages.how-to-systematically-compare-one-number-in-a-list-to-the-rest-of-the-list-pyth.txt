For a given item in a list, I want to compare that item to each subsequent item (let's call it item[i]). If item > item[i], I want to add 1 to P. If item < item[i], I want to add 1 to Q. I don't want to compare item to anything that came before it in the list, however.I've explored a few possibilities to achieve this, but I haven't quite cracked it. One option was to try enumerating the list and referring to each item's "count" in the list. The one that seems like it makes the most sense to me is to just refer to the index of each item in the list. However, as I don't want to just compare each item solely to the next item in the list, but rather all subsequent items, I need to compare item to a range of indices, starting at the index of the item + 1.Below I've written a simple for loop, but it of course doesn't work because the [f::] yields a The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()  error.Thoughts on this are welcome!
Here are two approaches.If you need efficiency, it's a little more work (thanks @MoxieBall !):Also, please add code to cover the case where item == following_item
Though that is a numpy error message, so I expect that something else is going on, here is how you would do this in pure python:
