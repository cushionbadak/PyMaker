I am a Java programmer struggling to learn Python, and almost certainly about to ask a duplicate question.  In my Python code, I need to create an object that basically holds a list.  When an object is instantiated, the list is to be empty.  Later in the code, I want to add items:When I run the above code, I get this error message:So it looks like the object is successfully created, but when I call addSomething(), the list is not defined.  Is that because the myList created in __init__() goes out of scope once the object constructor is completed?  I get the same error message when I move the myList = list() command to the top of the class definition:So how do I create an empty list which is available after the object is created?I should also add that I am writing on Python 2.7.  My company likes this version, so I'm stuck with it.  Don't ask.Thanks
In your __init__ function myList is just local variable. Use self.myList in order to make it as a class member. Of course access it in function addSomething() by using self as well: self.myList.append(x). Also you need to change signature of method addSomething from addSomething(cls, x) to addSomething(self, x)
In Python, there is difference between __init__ and __new__. That is, by the time your code hits __init__ it is already "constructed". Only then you can add new "fields" to an instance, like for example self.myList = [] in __init__.What def addSomething(cls, x) goes, you may named it cls but it is the instance in fact. So you should write self.myList.append() instead.
