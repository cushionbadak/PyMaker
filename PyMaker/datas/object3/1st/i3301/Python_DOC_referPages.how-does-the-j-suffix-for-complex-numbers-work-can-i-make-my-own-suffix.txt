I know what are complex numbers and how they mathematically work, but how is it done for python to know it's complex just by putting a j after a digit ?Can I make my own suffix, let's say p (for strictly positive) ?Could I do something working like this ?
This is built into Python's grammar, just like the decimal point is, or the e in scientific notation (1e10 etc.). The j makes a numeric literal imaginary.Python does not allow you to change this. That doesn't mean you can't--you could amend the grammar--but then the language is no longer Python.The closest approximation allowed in Python would be by implementing an operator.But you have to be careful of operator precedence when doing stuff like this. Why not just use the builtin abs directly?
