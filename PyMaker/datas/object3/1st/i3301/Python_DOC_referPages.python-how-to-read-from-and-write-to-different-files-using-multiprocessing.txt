I have several files and I would like to read those files, filter some keywords and write them into different files. I use Process() and it turns out that it takes more time to process the readwrite function. Do I need to separate the read and write to two functions? How I can read multiple files at one time and write key words in different files to different csv?Thank you very much.Want to edit my questions. I have more functions to modify the csv generated by the readwritevalue() functions. So, if Pool.map() is fine. Will it be ok to change all the remaining functions like this? However, it seems that it did not save much time for that.
You can extract the body of the for loop into its own function, create a multiprocessing.Pool object, then call pool.map() like so (Iâ€™ve used more descriptive names):See the linked documentation for how to control the number of workers, tasks per worker, etc.
I may have found an answer myself. Not so sure if it is indeed a good answer, but the time is 6 times shorter than before.
