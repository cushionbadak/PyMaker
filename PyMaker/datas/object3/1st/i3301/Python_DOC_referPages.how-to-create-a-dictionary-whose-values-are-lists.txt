I read a code in a book 'Think Python'. This code gets stuck at the inverse[val].[key] with an error:'str' object has no attribute 'append''Which makes sense as inverse[val] contains a string object.Here d is the input dictionary.The input dictionary is {'a': 1, 'p': 1, 'r': 2, 't': 1, 'o': 1}The expected output is {1: ['a', 'p', 't', 'o'], 2: ['r']}How do I implement this, by modifying the given block of code?
You can use collections.defaultdict to create a dictionary of lists. Then append to dictionary values while iterating your input dictionary.Your code can be improved by iterating keys and values simultaneously via dict.items, instead of iterating keys and manually extracting the value. In addition, your indentation is incorrect. After resolving these issues:
try this:
A one-liner using reduce:Output:
You can also follow a different approach in which you take all values from your dictionary and match each value with the keys that have this value in the initial dictionary:Output:
