I have a list : I would like to calculate the frequency of each word and output the sorted result like this:blabla : 3momo : 2fafa : 1   I have used counter but the output isn't like i wantOutput : Counter({'blabla.com': 3, 'momo': 2 }]How to remove the 'Counter' word from the output?
Almost there, you use the most_common([N]) method of Counter for this:Output:most_common() returns you all (or top N) results in the Counter - as tuple(name, count) 
You can also use list functionoutput:{'blabla': 3, 'momo': 2, 'zozo': 2, 'gmail': 1, 'baba.com': 1, 'fafa': 1, 'tata': 1}
