I'd like to be able to update attributes, for example MU.period = '14d' and have the data be recalculated automatically.I tried doing something likebut it threw an error 'str' object has no attribute 'setter'
That @period.setter can only be done if you've already declared period as a property.You're also going to need a getterâ€”which you usually just declare with the initial @property.Finally, you probably want to go behind the period property and store stuff directly in the raw _period attribute in your __init__, because otherwise you're going to end up setting self.data twice.So:You might also want to make data a read-only @property while you're at it, to make sure nobody accidentally breaks it, but that may not be worth it ("consenting adults" and all that).
