Natural Text
I tried to put the float and int inside my coding, but it still said "can't multiply sequence by non-int of type float"
The issue is that PV is a string and not a float. input() is Python3 does not evaluate the input unlike in Python2.You need to convert it into a int/float:If you multiply a string with an int, it performs concatenation. That is why multiplying by float does not make sense.
