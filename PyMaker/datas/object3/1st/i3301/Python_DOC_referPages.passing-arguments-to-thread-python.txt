I have this method in my class called "interaction":that ivokes a thread with User and Pass as parameters.Then I have the class called "ThreadBrowser" with this "run" method:but it turns out that I'm certainly struggling sending the arguments to the thread function because it gives an execution error:TypeError: run() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'user' and 'password'Any idea how to solve this ?
The args constructor argument can't provide additional arguments to run. It provides the arguments to target, which you aren't specifying. Specifically:the default implementation of run() invokes self.target(*self._args, **self._kwargs), where _args and _kwargs are provided by the constructor, and default to empty tuple and dict respectively.by implementing run you opted out of Python invoking target(*args) automatically. It is then up to your code to store the state that your run will pick up. The idiomatic option is to store it in the constructor, much like your run method does now.For example:The ThreadBrowser can then be constructed naturally as ThreadBrowser(username, password) and started with t.start() as before.
Run takes 2 arguments user, pass
