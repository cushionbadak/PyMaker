I'm looking for something like: find(pred, iter) in pythonHow to:   find(lambda x: x.get("name") == "bbbb", obj.get("foo_list", []))
Array.prototype.find() returns the first matching element in an array, given a predicate function, or undefined when there is no match.Python has the filter() function, which filters an iterable on a predicate, and next(), which produces the first element of an iterable or an optional default. Combining these give you the equivalent:where pred is a callable that returns True when an element matches the search criteria. Demo:If you remove the second argument to next(), a StopIteration exception is raised when there is no matching element.
