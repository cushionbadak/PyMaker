My Code snipet:But the result's value is None and I am not able figure out why.Kindly let me know if I am missing something very basic.
Possible misconceptions and the corresponding explanations:You need a raw string r'\bfoo\b' to make python not interpret the special characters (in this example the backslash`) and pass them unchanged to the regular expression library.You probably want to re.escape the word in case it contains more regular expression special characters..search() only finds the first match. To find all matches use .findall() or .finditer()
