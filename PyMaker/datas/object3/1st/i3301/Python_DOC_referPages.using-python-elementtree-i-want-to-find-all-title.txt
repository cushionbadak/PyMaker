You almost have it. My advice to you is that you read through the documentation for the xml.etree.ElementTree module once more.https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlYou are parsing XML with an XML parser. This Python module lets you access Element objects of the parsed tree. Each Element object has a dictionary of attributes attached to it. So, for each Element, you can see whether or not there is a title attribute. See below (Note: I modified your code a bit):Looping through every element in the tree manually and testing whether or not a title attribute exists is probably not the most efficient method. A better approach would be to use XPath expressions. So, in your case, it would look something like this:This is all mentioned in the documentation for the module that I had linked above. Be sure to give it a careful read next time.
