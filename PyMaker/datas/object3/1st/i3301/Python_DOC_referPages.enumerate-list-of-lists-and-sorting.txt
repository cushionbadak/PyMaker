I am following a tutorial online, and having trouble understanding what the code does.Here, questions_int is a list of lists containing numbers in the following format:The goal is to sort by the questions by its length to reduce amount of padding time during training the data for sequence 2 sequence model. But I don't understand how the code works and how it helps sorting by length.
Okay, so let's take this line by line.for length in range(1, max_line_length+1): iterates from 1 to max_line_length.  This means length will first be equal to 1, then when the loop finishes length will be equal to 2, etc. until length is finally equal tomax_line_length` (20 in this case)for i in enumerate(questions_int): makes i equal to a tuple of (index, element), meaning that len(i[1]) will be the length of the ith question.  As length increases in value from one, the shortest questions and answers will gradually be added to the lists, hence the append( calls within the 2nd for loopThe line sorted_questions.append(questions_int[i[0]]) will append the question at the current index where len(i[1])==length.  Remember that i is a tuple of 2 elements, and the first is the index of the current question.  So questions_int[i[0]] is the question that has length length.Similarly, answers_int[i[0]] is the answer corresponding to that question.  So whenever we find a slightly longer question using the if condition, the list sorted_answers gets longer by 1 with the new answer, and sorted_questions does as wellPlease ask a follow up question wherever you are confused
