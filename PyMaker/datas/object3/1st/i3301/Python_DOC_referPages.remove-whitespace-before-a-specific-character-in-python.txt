Natural Text
I was wondering if you knew the best way to do this.This program uses OCR to read text. Occasionally, spaces appear before a decimal point like so:as you can see, a space appears before the decimal point on the last entry. Any ideas on how to strip JUST this whitespace?Thank you :)EDIT: contents before decimal point may contain a varying amount of whitespace. Like 
Use regular expressions.Result will be
You can just strip out all whitespace from the string, assuming that they follow the same format.  SOmething like this: The key part is replacing the whitespace with no whitespace.If you just want the whitespace before the ".", then you could use:.replace(" .", ".") instead.This would only replace 1 white space.  To replace multiple, you could use a while loop like this: 
For your dict obj:-Even if there is varying space; replace would work fine. See this:-
This is trivial with split and join:This works because splits on one or more spaces. To do this for each value in a dictionary:
i think that maybe you want something more generic not only for that key:in this way independent of the key othe number of space the result will be without white spaces
Sure:
