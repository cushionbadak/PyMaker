Apparently running os.path.join on Ubuntu on Windows 10 gives the path in the Windows OS (with the backslash separator). Is there a way to override that (other than, of course, booting from an actual Ubuntu machine?)I'm trying to use sqlalchemy on an sqlite file, and create_engine('sqlite:///{0}'.format(db_filepath)) is giving me headaches.
