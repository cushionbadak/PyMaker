Suppose I have a main dataframeI also have 3 dataframesWhat I want is to add value from each frame df to total in the main_df according to Crii.e. main_df will becomemain_df Of course I can do it using for loop, but at the end I want to apply the method to a large amount of data, say 50000 rows in each dataframe.Is there other ways to solve it?Thank you!
First you should align your numeric column names. In this case:Then you have a couple of options.concat + groupbyYou can concatenate and then perform a groupby with sum:    set_index + reduce / addAlternatively, you can create a list of dataframes indexed by your criteria columns. Then use functools.reduce with pd.DataFrame.add to sum these dataframes.
