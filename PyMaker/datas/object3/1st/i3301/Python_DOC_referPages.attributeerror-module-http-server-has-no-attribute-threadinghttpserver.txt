Im trying the code on this documentation page of Python3 about HTTP Server.The code posted on the site is:this code is working. I would to try the ThreadingHTTPServer so, as the documentation says:This class (ThreadingHTTPServer) is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle requests by using the ThreadingMixIn. This is useful to handle web browsers pre-opening sockets, on which HTTPServer would wait indefinitely.So, I changed the code above to:but I get following error:I would like to add that it is only recently that I use Python, so I may have missed something.What do you think is the cause of the error? Where am I doing wrong?
I think I know why you got this issue. If you read carefully:class http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer(server_address,  RequestHandlerClass)This class is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle requests by using the ThreadingMixIn. This is useful to handle web  browsers pre-opening sockets, on which HTTPServer would wait  indefinitely.New in version 3.7. <-thisIt is possible you don't have the newest version.
