Is there an easy way in Python to resolve path operators like ..?  For instance is there a function call that will convert: /../../test/../path to /path?
You can use os.path.realpath() to get the canonical path.  To get a normalised relative path, use os.path.normpath().
You can use abspath in the os.path module.os.path.abspath(path)Return a normalized absolutized  version of the pathname path. On most  platforms, this is equivalent to  normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path)).
If you are using the pathlib library, the method to use is resolve:
you can use the function os.path.abspath from os.path
