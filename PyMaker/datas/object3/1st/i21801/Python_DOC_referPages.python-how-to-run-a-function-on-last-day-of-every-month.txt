This calls for the use of a cron job or a similiar scheduling application.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CronNow we can add this line to your crontab (which can be accessed by crontab -eIf you are using Windows you can use the commandline tool schtasks with the argument LASTDAY for setting a task to occur on the last day of the month.

If you want a python solution you could look into celery.
There is no "function in Python" to run code at a specific time. The only way to do it is to have a function running all the time that does this. It would look something like this:So you can do it, but it's a bit daft. Use cron and schtask instead. Really.
