I want to convert 1/2 in python so that when i say print x (where x = 1/2) it returns 0.5I am looking for the most basic way of doing this, without using any split functions, loops or mapsI have tried float(1/2) but I get 0... can someone explain me why and how to fix it?Is it possible to do this without modifying the variable x= 1/2 ??Thanks
in python 3.x any division returns a float;to achieve that in python 2.x, you have to force float conversion:or to import the division from the "future"An extra: there is no a built-in fraction type, but there is in the official library:and so on...
You're probably using Python 2. You can "fix" division by using:at the start of your script (before any other imports). By default in Python 2, the / operator performs integer division when using integer operands, which discards fractional parts of the result. This has been changed in Python 3 so that / is always floating point division. The new // operator performs integer division.
Alternatively, you can force floating point division by specifying a decimal or by multiplying by 1.0. For instance (from inside the python interpreter):EDIT: Looks like I was beaten to the punch in the time it took to type up my response :)
If the input is a string,then you could use Fraction directly on the input:
There is no quantity 1/2 anywhere. Python does not represent rational numbers with a built-in type - just integers and floating-point numbers. 1 is divided by 2 - following the integer division rules - resulting in 0. float(0) is 0.
