Python - what is difference in os.popen and subprocess.Popen?
The os process functionality is considered obsolete. The subprocess module was introduced in Python 2.4 as a unified, more powerful replacement for several older modules and functions related to subprocesses. They are listed here:os.systemos.spawn*os.popen*popen2.*commands.*os.popen was deprecated in Python 2.6 (but, interestingly, it is not deprecated in Python 3, where it is implemented in terms of subprocess.Popen). There is a paragraph in the documentation on how to replace it with subprocess.Popen.
