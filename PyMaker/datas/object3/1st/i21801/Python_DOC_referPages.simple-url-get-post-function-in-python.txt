I can't seem to Google it, but I want a function that does this:Accept 3 arguments (or more, whatever):URL a dictionary of paramsPOST or GETReturn me the results, and the response code.Is there a snippet that does this?
requestshttps://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/Here's a few common ways to use it:httplib2https://github.com/jcgregorio/httplib2
Even easier: via the requests module.To send data that is not form-encoded, send it serialised as a string (example taken from the documentation):
You could use this to wrap urllib2:That will return a Request object that has result data and response codes.
[Update]Some of these answers are old. Today I would use the requests module like the answer by robaple.
I know you asked for GET and POST but I will provide CRUD since others may need this just in case: (this was tested in Python 3.7)
