I used the above code but obtained output is 0.0. How can I get a valid answer?
You forgot the first parameter to SequenceMatcher.http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html
From the docs:The SequenceMatcher class has this constructor:class difflib.SequenceMatcher(isjunk=None, a='', b='', autojunk=True)The problem in your code is that by doing you are passing a as value for isjunk and b as value for a, leaving the default '' value for b. This results in a ratio of 0.0.One way to overcome this (already mentioned by Lennart) is to explicitly pass None as extra first parameter so all the keyword arguments get assigned the correct values.However I just found, and wanted to mention another solution, that doesn't touch the isjunk argument but uses the set_seqs() method to specify the different sequences.
