How do you do reverse gmtime(), where you put the time + date and get the number of seconds?I have strings like 'Jul 9, 2009 @ 20:02:58 UTC', and I want to get back the number of seconds between the epoch and July 9, 2009.I have tried time.strftime but I don't know how to use it properly, or if it is the correct command to use.
You want calendar.timegm().You can turn your string into a time tuple with time.strptime(), which returns a time tuple that you can pass to calendar.timegm():More information about calendar module here
Use the time module:
Note that time.gmtime maps timestamp 0 to 1970-1-1 00:00:00.time.mktime(time.gmtime(0)) gives you a timestamp shifted by an amount that depends on your locale, which in general may not be 0. The inverse of time.gmtime is calendar.timegm:
This should be different from int(time.time()), but it is safe to use something like x % (60*60*24)datetime â€” Basic date and time types: Unlike the time module, the datetime module does not support leap seconds.

There are two ways, depending on your original timestamp:mktime() and timegm()http://docs.python.org/library/time.html
