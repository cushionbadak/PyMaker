I'm trying to do a HEAD request of a page using Python 2.I am tryingwith misc_urllib2.py containingBut I am gettingIf I just dothen it works fine
This works just fine:Tested with quick and dirty HTTPd hacked in python:I've added a custom header field X-REQUEST_METHOD to show it works :)Here is HTTPd log:Edit: there is also httplib2
Try httplibSee How do you send a HEAD HTTP request in Python 2?
The problem lies with your class HeadRequest, which inherits from urllib2.Request. According to doc, urllib2.Request.__init__ signature isso you must pass an url argument to it. In your second try, you just do not use HeadRequest, this is why it works.
you shoud not add HeadRequest to build_opener or add_handler it should be called like this
