Please refer to this Regular Expression HOWTO for python3https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#performing-matchesI have read that for regular expression containing '\', the raw strings should be used like r'\d+' but in this code snippet re.compile('\d+') is used without using the r specifier. And it works fine. Why does it work in the first place? Why does this regular expression not need an 'r' preceding it?
It happens to work because '\d' doesn't correspond to a special character like '\n' or '\t' do. Sometimes a raw string turns out the same as the regular string version. Generally, though, raw strings will ensure that you don't get any surprises in your expression.
