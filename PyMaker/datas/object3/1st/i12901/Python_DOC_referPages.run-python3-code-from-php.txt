I have a Python3 script that I would like to call from my webpage. My webhost says they will not add Python3 to their site (their version of python is 2.6.6).Is there anyway I can run a Python3 script from my webpage if I do not have Python3 installed? I can use Perl to run Python if it would be possible.
You cannot run it as it is, obviously, without the python3 interpreter.You can compile it though (http://www.pyinstaller.org/) and run that from php.
