This question already has an answer here:Run a Python script from another Python script, passing in arguments [duplicate]                    7 answers                I'm trying to pass arguments to my test_script.py but I'm getting the following error. I know this isn't the best way to do this but it's the only one that will work since I won't know what functions are in test_script.py. How can I pass arguments as stdin input?test_script.pymain_script.pyError
If do not want to use argv, however is odd, consider Popen and operating/communicating on stdin/stdoutAs a reference from SO Python subprocess and user interaction.And even more info on https://pymotw.com/2/subprocess/
Not sure what are you trying to do but here is one working example:And your main_script.py:
That is jot going to work, test_script.py expects for keyboard input not the argument. If you want main_script.py to pass arguments to test_script.py you have to amend test_script.py below code should do the trickotherwise you can chek argparse https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html
