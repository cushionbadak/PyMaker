In my factorial computation program, I get a number from the userI wanted to change it so that the number would be converted to an integer instead of a float:But this doesn't work when I input a float number like "4.5". The error code is:I've converted the int number to float since I decided to enter a float number but it looks like it hasn't been converted or what...The program still works with the first version, but what's the problem there? What is the difference between those conversions?
The problem is that the input() function returns a string object:As the documentation states, when you donÂ´t pass a string instance representing a so called integer literal to Pythons int() function, you will get an ValueError.To avoid this you could catch this error or convert the string first to a floating point number (using float() -- so the number type is not important -- and afterwards to an int:Hope this helps :)
