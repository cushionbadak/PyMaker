I am trying to maintain a list a names and times, sorted by increasing time.This essentially works but it leaves a blank line below every line, except the newly added line.I would like something like:but I am getting:Bill,34.22 being the last entry.
The problem is that when reading the file there is a \n at the end of each line that does not automatically get stripped off. In your code shown here the variable strtime still contains a \n character at the end.The \n in the call to f.write() is fine. You just need to strip off the \n when you read. rstrip() will remove whitespace characters from the right side of the string.Do this:
Since what you're creating is technically a .csv file, you could also look into the csv moduleNote that this will give you some weird errors if you're deleting lines. This doesn't truncate the file before writing to it -- you're overwriting data, so replacingwithWill give you
