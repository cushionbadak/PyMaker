To reverse the elements in the list, you can simply use reversed function, and recreate the list, like thisIf possible I don't want to append duplicates in the listAs you want to remove the duplicates as well, the best option would be to use collections.OrderedDict like this
Didn't quite follow what you meant with i though. But a simple list comprehension will workOr just use a normal for-loop. You can either append to the same list, or add items to new list and then extend. I personally prefer new list and then extend as otherwise you will end up iterating over the newly appended items (which makes no difference aside from efficiency)
