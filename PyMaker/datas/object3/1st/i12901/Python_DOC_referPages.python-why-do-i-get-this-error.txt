This question already has an answer here:Syntax error on print with Python 3 [duplicate]                    9 answers                I am a python newbie.  I am trying to understand why I get this error:SyntaxError: invalid syntaxHere is the full code:
print() is a function in Python 3, but print is a keyword in Python 2. Check PEP 3105 for more info. Also here's a good question on SO.You should try changing it to this:
as @JoshRumbut has pointed out, print() is really a function.In Python2, you could write print 12, but this has been abandoned in Python3, so you now must write print(12).Luckily, Python2 understands the functional version as well, so in general you are better off using this one.
