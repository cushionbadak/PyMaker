Im trying to resolve an issue with my code, where I am executing my function play() , but the argument i pass in of --b is an int, what am I doing wrong?I am executing this via:
All arguments in the argument list to subprocess.call (or other functions of the module) need to be string. So if you change the 10 to be a string '10' instead, it will work just fine:Note that calling a Python file using subprocess will not give you any exception when the called file fails to execute. It’s a completely separate process which—if it fails—just produces some error output you can read from the subprocess then.
