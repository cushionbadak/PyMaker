I'm having some trouble with my code - I have a csv file and I have to save the first line in the csv as a list. Then I have to clear the file and rewrite the line using the list. This is my code:The trouble is, when I open the csv in Excel it's clearly wrong. Each character fills up a cell - I want the file to look exactly the same as when I written the file.
From the issue you describe, I guess that you don't want to dowhich simply creates a list of each charater, but more something likewhich create a list of the string separated by commas.Or, even better, use a csv.reader, so it handle quotes and all little details of csv's.Here is an untested sample code of what you should do.
