I have data that comes in the following string format "dd Mmm YYYY, HH:mm" (e.g. "07 Aug 2008, 16:25")What is the most efficient way to convert this in Python into the datetime string format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" for MySQL?
Do you mean do the covert in Python?Check the document for more details.
Should do it, althougha) when I tried, I got some AttributeError about day_abbr in strptime. Seems like some kind of localization problem on my system. Give it a try on yours?b) isoformat also gives you subseconds, which you might not want :/Anyway, the things you want to study in the datetime library are strptime/strftime and isoformat (<- ISO 8601, best date + time format evar; if possible, try to use this everywhere).
