So, in my code I have it create a dictionary from 2 rows in a CSV file, this works perfectly.However, I randomise a question out of the dictionary for the range of the length of the dictionary. Basically, I was wondering, do I then need to remove/delete this instance(the question) from the dictionary because I have used it because it could randomise it out again, or will a dictionary not randomise a string out twice?If I do need to remove it how would I go about doing that,Thanks
You can do it without destroying your dictionary, by applying random.sample() on the dictionary's items with k set to the length of the dictionary. This will return a list of the items from the dictionary in random order which you can then iterate over.Sample output
Yes, you would need to remove it if you don't want it to be randomly chosen again.  If have selecting a random key from your dict, you could use dict.pop for getting the value and removing the item at the same time.  Otherwise, just use del my_dict[k].
