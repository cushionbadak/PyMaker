I am trying to increment through all of the possible base-n numbers, where numbers are represented by a list of chars.For example,For base-5 numbers (where n = 5) limited to 4 places, and the base 5 numbers are represented by the list:incrementation would look likeWhat is the most pragmatic approach in python to do this where n=5 or n=105
You can get the result with itertools.product, like thisWhat is the most pragmatic approach in python to do this where n=5 or n=105I would say, don't create the list at all. You might exhaust the computer's memory. Better use the iterator and use the value as and when you need it. That is exactly why product returns an iterator.
