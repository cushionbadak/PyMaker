I have to check for multiple 'and' conditions in ifEg:can I do above using for loop in if, say something like Above suggested won't work as it sets the condition as true even if one of them is true.
Simply use all() here:From the document:Return True if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty).And (a[i]==b[i] for i in range(1, 5)) return a generator(it's an iterable), then all() return True if all elements in that generator is True, else False. Like your code does.
You can do Usage of all():if all the elements in iterable  are True returns True if one lement is False it return Falseeg: all([True,True]) --> Trueall([False,True])--> False
