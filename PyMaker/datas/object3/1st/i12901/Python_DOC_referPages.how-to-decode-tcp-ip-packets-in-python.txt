I get a tick by tick market data stream in a IP Address with a specified port in a TCP/IP packet format continuously. I want to log that in a csv file or work around the data stream for trading and data analysis.Server sends all the packets in following formatAll the packets received from server consist of compress batch header.Compress batch header gives the information about the data packetcompressed or not, number of packets in the following data packet and the total size of data packet. Client needs to decompress the data packet usingLZO decompression algorithm. After decompression each data packetconsists of ST_INFO_HEADER, which has the iCode field to identify the typeof the packet. Using iCode field, data info packet is mapped to the respectivedata packet.So is there any way that I can decode the data in those packets using some Python Library and work around.Thanks in advance!
Use the socket library.  Here is a sample of code to connect to the tcp/ip port and parse the data directly from Python's site (set HOST static to desired IP):For Python 2.x:https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.htmlFor Python 3.x:https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.htmlLZO Library for Python:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lzo/1.08
