I'm trying to convert the following lists in Python:  to a dictionary of tuples with the Col2 used as the unique key so the output would like like below:So far I've managed to transpose and zip it to a dictionary with columns as keys but I stucked there.  Can you help?Thanks in advance.
Iterate the data list items, and build new dictionary with row[1] as a key and row[:1] + row[2:] for values (list items):dict.setdefault is used to populate the dictionary with a empty list when there's no key in the dictionary, so the list.append call can be done safely.If you use collections.defaultdict, it could be simpler:
Hope this helps..
