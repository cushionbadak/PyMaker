I have the following code that runs LM_CMD program and writes the output into file fp_arpa. Right after that I have another function that reads and processes that file (fp_arpa). However, according to the function the file is empty, while in the file system it is not. I am guessing subprocess locks the file pointer until the whole Python program finishes (I might be wrong though). How can I avoid this problem?
subprocess.Popen returns immediately as soon as the process is started. It doesn't wait for the process to finish. Call subprocess.check_call() instead:
