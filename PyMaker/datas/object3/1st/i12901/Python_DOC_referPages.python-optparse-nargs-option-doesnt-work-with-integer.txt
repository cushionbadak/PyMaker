I have a problem with the nargs option of optparse.This is my code:I need to be able to use the code as:or or without -b flag (case default).The error is:Can someone suggest some solutions? 
The optparse module doesn't support specifying '*' as a valid value for the nargs argument. An integer must be specified, as implied by the official documentation:Option.nargs (default: 1)  How many arguments of type type should be consumed when this option is seen. If > 1, optparse will store a tuple of values to dest.However, the argparse module does support it:'*'. All command-line arguments present are gathered into a list.Furthermore, since version 2.7 the optparse module is deprecated in favor of the argparse module:Deprecated since version 2.7: The optparse module is deprecated and will not be developed further; development will continue with the argparse module.The argparse module also supports specifying custom help and usage messages, relieving one of the need to print them himself.
