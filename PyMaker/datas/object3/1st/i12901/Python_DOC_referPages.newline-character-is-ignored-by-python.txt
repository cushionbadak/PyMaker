Natural Text
When I'm trying to write a string b'<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> \n<response list="true">\n <audio>\n  <aid>412317542</aid>\n... to a new .xml file, it gets written as a single line, ignoring all \n characters. Why is it happening, and how do I get several lines? My code:
Your string looks like is bytes object, so you should use bytes.decode(), not just str():
