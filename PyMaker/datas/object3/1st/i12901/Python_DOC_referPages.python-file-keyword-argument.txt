In command line I am able to pass arguments to a python file as:I can than retrieve arg1 and arg2 within script.py as:However, I would like to send keyword arguments to a python script, and retrieve them as a dictionary:Then I would like to access the keyword arguments as a dictionary within python:Is this possible?
I think what you're looking for is the argparse module https://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html.It will allows you to use command line option and argument parsing.e.g. Assume the following for script.pyNow, if you try:you will see:as output. I think this is what you were after.But read the documentation, since this is a very watered down example of how to use argparse. For instance the '3' and '4' I passed in are viewed as str's not as integers
