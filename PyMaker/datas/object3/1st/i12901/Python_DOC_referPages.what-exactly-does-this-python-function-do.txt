I am unable to understand what is the purpose of this method (taken from Python Brain Teaser Question bank). I figured out that the input seems to be a collection of dictionaries. But, what is the method trying to do?
It is taking a bunch of items that are indexable by string, and grouping them by the value at the "type" key. The result is a dictionary where the key is the value of "type", and the value is a list of all the items having said key as their "type". It does seem to be a bit broken though, because it is returning the function. I think the expected behavior is to have return d at the end. With the following implementation:You provide the following input:And you get the following output:
The input is a sequence of mappings, each of which have a "type" entry. The code bins each mapping by the value of its "type" entry.Returning g instead of d is likely just a thinko.
