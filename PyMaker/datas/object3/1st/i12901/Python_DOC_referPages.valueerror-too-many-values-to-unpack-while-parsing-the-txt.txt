Natural Text
I have a small txt file, where I need to replace the multiple spaces with single tab on the lines that begin with specific keyword, so for that firstly I replace the multiple spaces with single one, that will be then replaced by tabMy script:and I have this error:Why it could happen? 
If you really need i, which is a number (starting from 0 if start keyword argument is not defined) that increments on each iteration and generated by enumerate :Try adding enumerate():If you don't, just use:Regarding "double white-space deletion", there is no need to use while. Just use if and replace:Regarding open(), you can avoid closing the opened file by using with statement.This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after its  suite finishesSee the last example of this section https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objectsChange open() mode from "rw" to "r+", to avoid the following error:IOError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor
