I am trying to make it so the if statment checks if all of the variable 'password' is lowercase but the all function is not working for me.My problem is that there is an error message saying How can I use the all function and any function with another function like .islower? Also is the function .isalnum and .isalpha mean it check if all of the variable is a number or alphabetical? 
For a password tester, you want to check if any of the characters are in a certain group:This is only going to be true if there is at least 1 lowercase character. You can combine these tests with and (don't use all() here, no point as there is no loop):would only be true if there is at least one lowercase character and one digit in the password.However, stringing these tests together gets unwieldy, fast. It is much easier to create a separate function, and spell out each password test:and then just defer to that function when you need to see if your password is at least 8 characters long, uses both lowercase and uppercase letters, and contains at least 1 digit and 1 'special' character, for example:Using a dedicated function is far more maintainable.If your password checker needs to be more flexible still, you use separate tests and collect them in a sequence. Only then is the all() function helpful, all tests need to pass:
i think the problem is that all expects an iterable,form docs  all(iterable) -> boolbut the linehow you should use it:
