I'm using the list object by declaringin my code, and without initializing it, I wroteWhere data2 is another list that contains lots of numbers.An error happened at this line:How do I fix this?
You may want to try using data.extend (data2) instead of using the operator.See this question for an extended discussion about adding two lists together: Python: take the content of a list and append it to another list
Getting 'referenced before assignment' after you initializing data can't happen if you are in the same scope.The possibility is that you are creating a function (creating a new scope) so when you say data+=data2 it meansSo if you want to refer the global variable use already available (global) data you have to explicitly say global data or pass that as a parameter to the funciton.
You have to initialize your array first. Here is a working example of how to fix this problem. 
If you use data += data2 in function you need global dataor send data as argument
Your problem is covered in the docs herehttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.iaddFor instance, if x is an instance of a class with an __iadd__()  method, x += y is equivalent to x = x.__iadd__(y) .So you see data is being rebound (to itself in this case), but it still counts as an assignment.Since data += data2 appears inside a function scope where data has not been declared to be global, a local variable called data is assumed.
