I am trying to create a python program that can periodically poll the output from airodump-ng, a wifi sniffing tool. I am doing this on a RPI running Raspbian and Python 3.4I've looked up how to do this on several website but whenever I try this I get a sort of deadlock and the program stalls.I am using this code:So the weird thing is that when I type these commands one by one into IDLE running on the RPI, everything works but after 10 seconds I get a timeout error. When not using the timeout argument, the program simply stalls. Using the extra argument 'stdout=subprocess.PIPE' also doesn't work.But when I go to terminal and start up python using the command 'python3' and then typing in the first and second line, the whole screen is then filled with the output from airodump-ng and I cannot type anything anymore!So how can I solve this? I just want to get the most recent output from airodump-ng and the output of airodum-ng can simply be updated in the background, in another thread. I just want the most recent output.
see the doc, works as intended, especially the NoteIf the process does not terminate after timeout seconds, a TimeoutExpired exception will be raised. Catching this exception and retrying communication will not lose any output.NoteThe data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method if the  data size is large or unlimited.I would look at wifite code which make extensive use of airodump !
