Natural Text
I have some simple code code made with Python 3.4's asyncio using call_later. The code should print, waits 10 seconds, and then print again (but instead raises TypeError when end() should be excecuted, see below):Gives the error:From what I can tell from the docs (https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutine), call_later takes a coroutine object, which is obtained by calling a coroutine function. This appears to be what I've done, but asyncio does not call end() properly.How is this supposed to be done?
call_later is designed to take a callback (meaning a regular function object), not a coroutine. Newer versions of Python will actually say this explicitly:To make your code work, end needs to be a regular function, which you then pass to call_later:Output:If end needs to be a coroutine, a more natural way to call it after a delay would be to use asyncio.sleep:Though technically, this does work:
