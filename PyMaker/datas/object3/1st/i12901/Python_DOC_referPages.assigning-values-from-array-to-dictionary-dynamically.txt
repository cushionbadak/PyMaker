I have a problem. It looks quite simple but I'm stuck at it.I have two vars; One is an array that looks like this:The other is a dictionary that looks like this:Now I'm trying to dynamically assign values from array to dictionary and wrap it in array.My code looks like:But it does not work correctly as I planned, I'm getting weird results.  When printed new_log looks like:Looks like:Print new_log:My goal is for it to look like this:
I'd do something like this
You can simply store the keys in a tuple, like thisthen zip this with the elements of the list, and pass it to dict function, like thisHere, the zip function will combine the corresponding elements from keys and item and produce a new tuple. For example,we use list function to create a list because zip just returns an iterator. Now, we pass this iterator which returns tuples to dict function, which produces the dictionary.
What about this? 
First of all result is not required at all - you can just create dictionaries on the fly. Second I think you have the append in the wrong place, you're doing it after the two for loops which are identical to each other. What's the difference between:and:Well one gives you the item and the other gives you the index of it, but if you use the index to look up the item subsequently than it's basically the same thing. You normally don't use for index in range unless you need to know the index for some reason. If you're using that index just to look up the item, you're doing it wrong.So in the end the two loops together give you this kind of pattern:To cut to the chase, as others seem to have pointed out already, this could all be a lot simpler - as simple as:
