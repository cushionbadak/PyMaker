I was doing an exercise to show "hello world!",but when I open the website,django gave out an exception.What should I do to fix the problem? The exception is:My project structure is:My urls.py in directory DemoGuitarProject is :My urls.py in app directory release_news is :My views.py file is :My settings.py file:
Code from DemoGuitarProject/urls.pyread file apps/release_news/__init__.pyI guess this file is empty. Add to this file:or change DemoGuitarProject/urls.py
