This pythonic solution should give you your answer, as well as having all possible answers for unique pairs of elements in your list.
Using any() will not give you a count. It only tells you whether the condition is true anywhere inside of the given iterable a.Remove any and you end up with a generator expression:If we turn that generator expression into a list we get:To get the final count call the count method of list with a parameter of True (you want the count of True items):Or you could convert your generator expression to a list comprehension and move the condition to become an if statement after the for loop which keeps only those items that match the condition. The count is then the length of the list:
