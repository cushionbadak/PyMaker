I'm wondering why the below fails; basically that an inheriting subclass (SubClass) doesn't appear to have access to an attribute in the superclass (SuperClass) that it inherits from.By the way, all three files below are in the same directory and, for completeness, I'm using Python3.Any ideas? I think it's something stunningly simple. Thank you!The super class (SuperClass in ./super_class.py) ...The inheriting sub class (SubClass in ./sub_class.py) ...The driver/tester script (./driver.py) ...The exception ...
You are using the super() function wrong. You should be using:Or in python3The way you have it written you are starting the MRO just after the parent class, not just after your own class..
In the inheriting sub class (SubClass in ./sub_class.py), change this:To this:Btw, the python-3 new incantation avoids the possible bug of typing the wrong class.
