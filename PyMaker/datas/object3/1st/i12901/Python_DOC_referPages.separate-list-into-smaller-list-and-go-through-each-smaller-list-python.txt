I have a list like this I want to separate this list, to group items into 4elements together:the result of this command is this:Into each 4-group I have to check where is 1 element so if the first element on a 4group is 1 it return "first" if second return "second" till four and that value to put inside json_obj['value_1_in_list'] .In the code above I have a list called lista where I create JSON obj, the condition for record in records: will be executed  17 times, also I have 17 small lists with 4 elements. For each time that for loop will be executed a JSON is created.Now I want inside this for loop to include the value that is 1(first,second,third,fourth) inside one list of 4elements, and next time that for loop will be executed to include the other small list inside results list that contains 4elements how can i do that, any help?
Using a dictionary and list's index method Code:Output:Warning this may not work as expected for cases where there are more then one 1 in the list and OP has not told there will be situation like that
This can be implemented in a very straightforward way. You have clearly defined criteria (return a value based on an input). That is just a spec for a function. Write a function (one_location) and map it to your data set.

uses itertools.compress:works for more than one 1s in a sublist
