Natural Text
I'm trying to create an app which should allow to choose a directory and after pressing the button send the selected path to another function outside the App class. Also there is a predefined directory set as default path and displayed in the QLineEdit widget. This is what I've tried:However, the log_path is always equal to default_path no matter if it is changed by the user or not. I have been looking for the answer for a couple of hours already and still haven't managed to find the bug, since I'm new to PyQt. How should I edit/pass the text in the labelSavedPath widget correctly, minding possible changes?
You seem to have misunderstood what partial does. It allows you to call a function with some its arguments pre-filled with fixed values - which is exactly what you don't want. Use a lambda instead:NB: if you're using Python 3, there's no need to wrap everything with str().
