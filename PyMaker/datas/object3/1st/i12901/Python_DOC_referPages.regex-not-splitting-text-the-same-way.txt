Natural Text
I have a spider with scrapy and I am using a regex to split text on every word. It works in English and Korean, but when I try to scrape Spanish it doesn't break things up the same.I just can't see why this would be treated any differently than the other languages.
Unlike other regular expressions, [\u0000-\u00FF] include space character (\u0020).Adjust the regular expression to exclude the space character. For example: [\u0000-\u001f\u0021-\u00FF]+But, using regular expression here is not necessary. Simply using str.split is enough to get words splitted by spaces:
There are a good number of Unicode whitespace definitions both above and below your \u00FF boundary. See here for example. Can't you use \w+ ? It would be the much preferred approach.
