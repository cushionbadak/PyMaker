Lets say i have array like this :How i can divide d[0] [2] element with d[0] [2], d[1] [2],d[2] [2], d[3] [2] ....... and etc?I will explain it by using numbers:And i want that my result would be in array :Or (if its easier) result can be added to current array : As you can see result is the last array of array element: If anyone need more explanation please write in a comment section dont add -1 :( 
This should work for your example:
If you just want the last element of each inner list you could doand if you want it as a list you can use list comprehension 
If you're using Numpy, you can add a column to your array and fill it with the results of your division:
The simpler would be to compute a list comprehension (solution proposed by @elzell) result = [d[0][2]/dx[2] for dx in d]You can also add the resul as last element of each sublist (array in numpy is a different animal)
