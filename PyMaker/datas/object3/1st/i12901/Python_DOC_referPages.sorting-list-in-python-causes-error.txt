I'm having a problem sorting list in Python here's my code:Error is:
The sort method sorts the list in-place; it always returns None.What you can do:Or, as @Delgan pointed out, you can use the sorted function, which returns the sorted list:
.sort() doesn't return anything.  If you want to modify the list to be sorted you can door if you want to keep the list in the original order you can use sorted which returns a new list of the sorted elements:
list.sort() only change the list but return None, you need: Or simply use sorted():sorted() return a new list but sorted, note that it doesn't change the current list.
