This is a problem which is solved using regular expressions. Try using findall from the re module:Output:
findall only returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.It doesn't contain inforamtion about position, which is probably what you want.Try finditer instead, it returns an iterator yielding match objects, while match objects contain those info. The above code doesn't work if matched patterns overlap. To find all overlapping matches, see Python regex find all overlapping matches?.For your questionSince your specific pattern definitly won't lead to overlapping, it makes no difference which form you use.
