Is there a function to compare how many characters two strings (of the same length) differ by? I mean only substitutions. For example, AAA would differ from AAT by 1 character. 
This is a nice use case for the zip function!Usage:From the docs:
This will work:The above solution uses sum, enumerate, and a generator expression.Because True can evaluate to 1, you could even do:But I personally prefer the first solution because it is clearer.
Building on what poke said I would suggest the jellyfish package. It has several distance measures like what you are asking for. Example from the documentation:or using your example:This will work for many different string lengths and should be able to handle most of what you throw at it.
Similar to simon's answer, but you don't have to zip things in order to just call a function on the resulting tuples because that's what map does anyway (and itertools.imap in Python 2). And there's a handy function for != in operator. Hence:
