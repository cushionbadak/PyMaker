Natural Text
I would like to rewrite a small Perl programm to Python.I am processing text files with it as follows:Input:Desired output:Here is the working Perl code:It call it from the command line: perl_regex.pl input.txtExplanation of the Perl-style regex:Could anyone tell me, how to get the same result in Python? Especially for the $1 and $2 variables I couldn't find something alike.
Python regular expression is very similar to Perl's, except:In Python there's no regular expression literal. It should be expressed using string. I used r'raw string literal' in the following code.Backreferences are expressed as \1, \2, .. or \g<1>, \g<2>, .....Use re.sub to replace.
The replace instruction for s/pattern/replace/ in python regexes is the re.sub(pattern, replace, string) function, or re.compile(pattern).sub(replace, string). In your case, you will do it so:Note that $1 becomes \1. As for perl, you need to iterate over your lines the way you want to do it (open, inputfile, splitlines, ...).
