Natural Text
I have text which contains newline character like below. I wondered whether it possible to use Python's regexps which will just ignore newlines like \n or \r does not exists in string?For example, in text:find by regexp /sit amet,consectetur adipisicing/ should return one match.As I understand re.MULTILINE here in unapplicable and re.DOTALL also because it is just treating dot char as newline also. In my case I do nto want to expand regexp.NOTE: I cannot just trim newline chars because this text must be saved back.
At first: /sit amet,consectetur adipisicing/ is not a pattern, it is a fixed sequence of characters. If you would allow newlines between the words, it could become a pattern, but then you need to describe this in your regex.What you could do is to replace every space in your pattern with \s+:See it here on Regexr\s is a whitespace character, including \r and \n, see python.org
