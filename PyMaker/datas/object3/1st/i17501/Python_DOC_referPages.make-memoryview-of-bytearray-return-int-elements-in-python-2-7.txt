Since the type(b[0]) is int, I would expect type(m[0]) to be int also.  Starting in Python 3.2 this is true.  But in Python 2.7, the type is str.  I need to be able to pass a memoryview to functions which expect an array of int.In Python 2.7, I could create a wrapper class and override __getitem__ . But is there a trick to tell a memoryview object to return int elements?
No, there's no way to cause memoryview's __getitem__ to return int objects.
Using ord should do the trick:This is because in Python 2 byte data is stored in strings. Python 3 now distinguishes bytes and strings (unicode).
