I'm trying to place two strings together but when I run this code I keep getting an error.I'm sure this is something basic but I ahave been playing with this for 30 minutes and can't figure out what's wrong
Like most languages, Python does not allow you to create a name that starts with a number.  This means that you need to rename 1output because its name is illegal:Below is a demonstration:When creating names in Python, you must obey the following rules*:The first character must be either a letter or an underscore.The rest of the characters must be letters, underscores, and/or numbers.The finished name cannot be the same as one of the keywords (if, def, for, etc.).*Note: In addition, you should refrain from creating a name that is the same as one of the built-in functions (str, input, list, etc.).  While doing so is legal, it is considered a bad practice by many Python coders (author included).  This is because it will overshadow the built-in and thereby make it unusable in the current scope.
