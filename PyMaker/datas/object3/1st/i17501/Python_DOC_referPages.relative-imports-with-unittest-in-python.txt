Edit II:To clarify, at this point I have attempted to run my test file in 3 different ways:All three fail with the same error as above.  When I use the same three syntaxes but in the project directory, I get this error:Thanks again.  
In my experience it is easiest if your project root is not a package, like so:However, as of python 3.2 , the unittest module provides the -t option, which lets you set the top level directory, so you could do (from package/):More details at the unittest docs.
I run with the same problem and kai's answer solved it. I just want to complement his answer with the content of test.py (as @gsanta asked). I've only tested it on Python 2.7:then you can just
