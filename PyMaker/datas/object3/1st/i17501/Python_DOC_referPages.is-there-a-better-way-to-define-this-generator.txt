Say I want to make a generator that returns a fixed number of users from a list, and if the number of users I want is greater than the length of the list, it just repeats the last user. I wrote a generator to do this below:So if I had a list of users users = ['one', 'two', 'three'] and I call gen_users(users, 5) I get back one, two, three, three, three.Is there a more pythonic way to do this? Is using generators a valid approach to this problem?
Using itertools.islice:Alternatively you can use users[:total], but it will create temporary sequence.UPDATESlightly modified version of Hans Zauber's code:
