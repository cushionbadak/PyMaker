When using the thumbnail() method in the Pillow (PIL) module, the following convention must be observed where two sets of (nested) parenthesis are used:If only one set is used, Python generates the following error:TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptableDoes the inner-most parentheses have a formal name?PS: Following also works:Also: Is it a deficiency on part of the Python parser to not be able to figure out the intention here?
The fact the the parenthesis` are nested has nothing to do with anything.It is the , (comma) that is important. Which is why box = 128, 128 works and whose end result is the equivalent of box = (128, 128)For example, in python:but(128,) is called a tuple which is something like a LIST (mylist = [])One of the main differences is a LIST can be modified, a tuple cannot:e.g.
You are passing a tuple to the thumbnail() method. The distinction is as follows:Your box variable is also a tuple, which is why it works as well:
Its called a tuple. See this link on tuples and other sequence types.
thumbnail is a function that takes a tuple as its first argument. When you do thumbnail(128, 128), python tries to treat 128 as a tuple (by indexing it), which it isn't, and so you get your error.In the case of variable assignment like box = 128, 128, python understands that box is meant to be a tuple, but in the context of thumbnail(128, 128), python assumes you meant to pass in two int arguments, and not a single tuple.
