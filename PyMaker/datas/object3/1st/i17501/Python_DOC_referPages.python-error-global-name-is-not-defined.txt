My code:what I wanna do is to return the file type if it is one of those in suffix. but I get the error "NameError: global name 'x' is not defined". seems like I can't use "x" since it's in the [statement]? then how can I print the x here?thanks
x from the list comprehension is local to the comprehension; in Python 3, a list comprehension is executed in a new frame (like a function) and names in the expression are locals.Use a generator expression with next() instead:The next(iterable, default) form returns either the first element of the iterable, or the default. The generator expression returns any x that is a suffix of the file path.An alternative approach would be to use os.path.splitext():
