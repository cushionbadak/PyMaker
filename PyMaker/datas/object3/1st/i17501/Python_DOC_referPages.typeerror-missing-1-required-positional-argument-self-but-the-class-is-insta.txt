I am trying to write a Zoo programm  but i allways get the following outputhere is the sourcecode:Does anyone have an idea why i get that error.
You are calling the unbound method on the parent class:Add in self there:or use super() to load the next method in the hierarchy; super() binds the method for you:This assumes you are using Python 3; in Python 2, Zoo must inherit from object and you must pass in the current class (by name) and self to super():Inheriting from object makes the Zoo class and all subclasses new-style classes. This is the default in Python 3.
