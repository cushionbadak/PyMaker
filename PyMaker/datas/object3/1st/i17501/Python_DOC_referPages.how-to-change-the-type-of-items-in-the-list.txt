This question already has an answer here:How to convert a list of string to a list of int                    4 answers                I have a list that consists of elements of type "string".I need to change the type of each element on the "int". use cycles are not desirable.
By using the map function, which returns a generator and so does lazy casting in this case (cast only when you need a new element from the list):With your example (and Python 3)As pointed by @hivert, map is some kind of deprecated in the Python community. You could use a list comprehension or a generator instead:
Use a list comprehension together with the int type:If you don't necessarily need all the items in the list, a generator might be more appropriate. This will avoid evaluating each item until it is needed.This is equivalent to map(int, li) but (IMO) more readable.
You can cast it using this code: it will create new list with each element in the old list but with casting to int.
you just need to cast the string to an int. Python does this with the int() function:After running this you have a new list that contains all the values but as ints.If you want to change the items in li without creating a new list just do:
You can do it using map function
Use int() in a list comprehension:
