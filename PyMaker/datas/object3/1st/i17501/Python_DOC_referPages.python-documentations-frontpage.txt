http://docs.python.org/3/I would like to mimic python documentations fronpage for my own project. Trouble is every other page has show source link in the sidebar except for the front page.How can I archive the same effect on new sphinx project?
The documentation front page at http://docs.python.org/3/ is based on Jinja templates.The top-level template is layout.html, which extends a Sphinx template with the same name.indexcontent.html provides the structure for the main content. The sidebar has its own special template: indexsidebar.html.The theme is called pydoctheme (html_theme = 'pydoctheme' in conf.py).More information about templates and themes in Sphinx:http://sphinx-doc.org/templating.htmlhttp://sphinx-doc.org/theming.html
