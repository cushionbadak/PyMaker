I've file that contain MAC among other information, I'm trying to replace the MAC every time it is found.the file contains something likeI have wrote this code, but it's not workingso I'm searching for mac, here I have two problems, first, it only finds the first occurrence of mac in the line. Second, when I tried the code on the second occurrence only, it got 21-00:11:ee:20:66:22 instead of just 00:11:ee:20:66:22and then I'm doing some arithmetics (this part works), but then when I tried to replace the old value with the new one. it didn't work, I checked the file, and nothing has be replace.I can't figure out why, so can help me, please?UpdateI've changed the code, and now it write the changes to filenow the remaining problem is that it only find the first mac occurrence 55:aa:cc:77:dd:bb: and move to the next line without matching the second one 00:11:ee:20:66:22, so is there a way to make it continue to search after finding the first match??Thanks
Remove the hyphen from your regex. MAC adress components are usually separated with colons.
