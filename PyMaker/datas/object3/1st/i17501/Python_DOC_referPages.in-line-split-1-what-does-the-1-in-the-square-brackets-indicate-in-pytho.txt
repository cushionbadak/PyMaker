Let's assume that we have this code:What does the -1 do? I have seen it in various codes but not sure on what it does?And what would the difference be if there was a [0] or a [1]?
The line of code you gave is basically doing three things:It takes the string line and splits it on +'s using str.split.  This will return a list of substrings:The [-1] then indexes that list at position -1. Doing so will return the last item:It takes this item and assigns it as a value for the variable name.Below is a more complete demonstration of the concepts mentioned above:
Negative indexes in Python are syntactic sugar for accessing the elements in reverse order, from right-to-left, starting in -1. So -1 is the last item, -2 is the second-to-last item, and so on - the first item would be lst[-len(lst)]. For example:
str.split returns a list:list[-1] yields the last item (negative index starts from -1)See Lists - Python tutorial (contains indexing, slicing).
Split will create list and from that you are getting the last element using [-1]
