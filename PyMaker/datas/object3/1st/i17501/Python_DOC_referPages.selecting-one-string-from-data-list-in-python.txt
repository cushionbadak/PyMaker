I am relatively new to programming, so be easy on me.  I have made a program (much like a magic 8 ball) that the user asks a question, and then I have created a list with all my answers inside of it (14 answers). My program shuffles all the answers, but then I now need to assign every piece of data (using a random number generator from 1-14 (which I've completed), and then have it match the shuffled data with a random number and print that.  I have created the random number generator, and the answer list shuffles.  I just need to know how to assign the number to the strings in my list, and then print that one string.  
Lists have indices; if your number is between 0 and 13 (inclusive), then you can just use that directly on your list:However, the random module has a dedicated function for just this use case; random.choice() picks one value from a sequence at random:No need to shuffle anything that way..Demo:
