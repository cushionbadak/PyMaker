Trying to find how to execute ipdb (or pdb) commands such as disable.Calling the h command on disable says disable bpnumber [bpnumber ...]  Disables the breakpoints given as a space separated list of  bp numbers.So how whould I get those bp numbers? was looking through the list of commands and couldn't get any to display the bp numbers[EDIT]The break, b and info breakpoints commands don't do anything, although in my module i clearly have 1 breakpoint set like this import pdb; pdb.set_trace( ) - same for ipdb. Moreover info is not defined.The output of help in pdb:Documented commands (type help ):  ======================================== EOF    bt         cont      enable  jump  pp       run      unt    a      c          continue   exit    l     q        s        until  alias  cl         d         h  list  quit     step     up     args   clear      debug     help    n  r        tbreak   w      b      commands   disable   ignore  next   restart  u        whatis break  condition  down      j       p  return   unalias  where Miscellaneous help topics:  ========================== exec  pdbUndocumented commands:  ====================== retval  rvAnd for ipdb:Documented commands (type help ):  ======================================== EOF    bt         cont      enable  jump  pdef    psource  run      unt    a      c  continue  exit    l     pdoc    q        s        until  alias  cl  d         h       list  pfile   quit     step     up     args   clear   debug     help    n     pinfo   r        tbreak   w      b  commands   disable   ignore  next  pinfo2  restart  u        whatis  break  condition  down      j       p     pp      return   unalias   where Miscellaneous help topics:  ========================== exec  pdbUndocumented commands:  ====================== retval  rvI have saved my module as pb3.py and am executing it within the command line like thispython -m pb3  The execution does indeed stop at the breakpoint, but within di pdb (ipdb) console, the commands indicated don't display anything - or display a NameErrorIf more info is needed, i will provide it.
Use the break command. Don't add any line numbers and it will list all instead of adding them.
info breakpointsor just info b lists all breakpoints.
