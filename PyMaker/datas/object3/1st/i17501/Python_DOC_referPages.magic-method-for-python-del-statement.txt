Quick question, what is the magic method python calls when you say del object? I know it's not __del__ and it isn't __delete__, so what gets called if anything? If nothing is called, then how can I customize the events that occur when you delete an object? Take a look at the following example:When I delete log I would like it to set Logger._instance to None again, so you can reinitialize the singleton. How might I do this?
You could use a weak reference instead; as all references to the Logger() instances are cleaned up, the weak reference won't prevent the object from being reaped.cls._instance is now a weak reference object; you call it to retrieve the referenced object, and if it returns None the object is gone and you'll need to create a new one.Just take into account that the deletion is not necessarily going to be instantaneous; garbage collection needs to run to reap the object once the last regular reference has been removed.The gc.collect() call as the first line in the __call__ ensures that any weak refences are cleaned up before testing.
