Natural Text
So I have a text file,How can I then import these dictionaries so that I could use them like this, So the out come would beI would like this so that I can add questions to a text file from within the program and then save them should I add more, If this is possible another way please let me know!
The simplest way would be to store your questions into a JSON file, like @Thom Wiggers is suggesting.Here's an example:You can read more about the JSON module in the official documentation.
If you only want to serialize data, you want to use pickle or json. exec will execute all Python code, and can be a serious security problem.pickle is faster, and is specificity tailored to Python, while json can be read & written work by just about any programming language, and is still fairly human-readable & human-editable.Now, to answer the question as you asked it (you probably don't want to do this):You can use exec()This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. object must  be either a string or a code object. If it is a string, the string is  parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed (unless  a syntax error occurs).ie.  exec(open('data.txt', 'r').read())Another way to do is would be to (ab)use import, assuming your file is named data.py:This is obviously not what import was intended for... I've 'used' import like this in the past, and regretted it (there are a number of caveats, I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to think about what they might be).Warning Both are eval-like statements, and should be used with care, any Python code in data.txt will be executed, which may be potentially dangerous. Be very sure you trust the source of whatever you pass to exec(), and don't use if you only want to serialize data (instead of running Python code as such).
