HISTORY OF THE SOFTWAREPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting  Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands  as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's  principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for  National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)  in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the  software.In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to  BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same  year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope  Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software  Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a  non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related  Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the  PSF.All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for  Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit:
