I'm writing python2 code that will be be portable for python3 as well (by running 2to3 during user installation).But 2to3 sometimes makes multiple imports:How can I make 2to3 aware of duplicates?
This might be the reason http://www.diveinto.org/python3/porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.htmlSpecifically, the urllib library changes between python 2 and python 3.  Here are the specific changesAs far as I can tell there is no way to avoid this without parsing of some kind - if you want to pursue that method then isort (as suggested in the comments to your question) is likely your best bet.  Alternatively you could parse the code on your own, or just accept that you can't easily fix this issue and it is unlikely to cause any real problems in your code.
