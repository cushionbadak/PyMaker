I am writing some unit tests and want to use Mock.Given the following code:when run, I get TypeError: 'Mock' object is not iterableI have tried patchingbut I just can't seem to get it to work.I haven't succeeded in figuring out what really goes on when the query set "used" by the for-loop.Help is greatly appreciated![edited with further added example code, after first solution proposal]
You have to use iterator and MagicMock which has __iter__ defined
Usually I mock the QuerySet to be a list instead, that seems easier. So:where something is the function or place where you're computing the QuerySet. As an actual example:This only works if you're not using QuerySet specific characteristics.
A colleague of mine helped me solve this. The following code does I wanted.
