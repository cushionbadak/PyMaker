I'm currently writing a script that downloads a file from a URLAccording to the docs, urllib.request.urlretrieve is a legacy interface and might become deprecated, therefore I would like to avoid it so I don't have to rewrite this code in the near future.I'm unable to find another interface like download(url, filename) in standard libraries.  If urlretrieve is considered a legacy interface in Python 3, what is the replacement?
Deprecated is one thing, might become deprecated at some point in the future is another.If it suits your needs, I'd continuing using urlretrieve.That said, you can do without it:
requests is really nice for this.  There are a few dependencies though to install it.  Here is an example.
Another solution without the use of shutil and no other external libraries like requests.
