I am trying to print out just the dict values inside a list in python.So it is printing: ...and so onI want to be able to print it like so:So i want to be able to print just the values....with the headers ordered a certain way. Is it possible to do this? Thanks.
The tricky part is aligning the several table entries and the table headers. For this, we first have to find out how long the longest entry in each column is. pad then can be used to add a number of padding spaces to the given string.Now, we can print the headers and the several entries in car_objects using the pad function defined above.This should work, assuming that the elements of car_objects are Python dictionaries. If not, try to replace car[f] with getattr(c, f) in the above code.Update: Of course, perfectly aligning the columns of the table only works if you know all the rows before actually printing them. If you have to print them while still reading entries from the database, you have to 'guess' by how many spaces to pad the strings so they are nicely aligned in a table. This makes everything much simpler. Just put this line before your for loop for printing the table headers:And this line inside your loop, before the yield:str.ljust(n) is a standard string function that return the string aligned to the left within a total width of n characters. There are similar functions for aligning right and center alignment: rjust and center. And since your cars seem to be instances of some class, you can use the builtin function getattr(<object>, <attribute name>) to retrieve the individual attributes of the cars (similar to your getVariable method).For more on string formatting, take a look a this Python documentation page.
Try this: 
Try the following... I tested it with dictionaries so I access the attributes you have as car_object[obj][key.lower()]. I can't say without looking at your Cars class, but you should probably replace it with something like car_obj[obj].__getattribute__(key.lower())
Yes. Here's a quick function that takes a list and prints out what you want.It should print out as many cars that you put it.  although i am not positive about the spacing.
