I am currently working on a program that splits a flat file at the '|' symbol and seperates each entity into a new object defined in the code. It looks like this:EDIT 1This is the version of the program that does not work and gives me the error message need more than 1 value to unpack, resolving to the a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m = line.split('|') line.The format of the data from the file I am calling is as follows:Is there a reason it would interpret that as a single line and not spread each entity into its own object? The program runs fine when I do it like this:But I want people to be able to search for information based on specific columns of the file (i.e search a for x, search d for y, etc.). How would I go about doing that?
You probably have empty lines in your input. Skip these:but you probably want to use the csv module instead:
