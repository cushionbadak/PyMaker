When I type in import Crypt on the command line it says:
The crypt module is an interface to the Unix crypt library which is used for encrypting Unix passwords. It is documented as not being available on Windows. It is not a general purpose cryptography library.
If all you're looking for is an implementation of crypt(3), I've knocked up a pure-Python implementation here, ported from this public domain C implementation. It's pretty damn slow (about 2800 times slower than Python's built-in crypt on my machine, which is already about half the speed of OpenSSL's DES_crypt), but if you're just calculating the occasional hash, that shouldn't really be a problem.Are you writing an imageboard, by any chance?
