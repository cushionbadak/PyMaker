Design a logical expression equivalent to the following statement:x is a list of three or five elements, the second element of which is  the string 'Hip' and the first of which is not a number or Boolean.What I have: My question: How do you check for whether or not it is a Boolean or a number?
To answer the specific question:This checks if x[0] is an instance of any of the types in the tuple (int, float).You can add bool in there, too, but it's not necessary, because bool is itself a subclass of int.Doc reference: isinstance()built-in numeric typesTo comment on your current code, you shouldn't rely on interning of short strings. You are supposed to compare strings with the == operator:
Easiest i would say:
In python3 this would be: type(x)==bool see example.

You should compare the type of x to the bool class:or:Here is more on the type methodFrom Data model docs:Booleans (bool)These represent the truth values False and True. The two objects representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects. The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts, the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings "False" or "True" are returned, respectively.
