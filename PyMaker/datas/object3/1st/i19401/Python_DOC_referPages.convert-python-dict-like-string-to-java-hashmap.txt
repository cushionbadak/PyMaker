I am working on a project which has a python wrapper around java code.So, there is a communication between python and java code. (I am aware of jython, but we wanted to keep each implementation separate.)To talk from python to java, we pass a string like  which is  a dict in python and we pass as a string to java code.Is there I library in java which does parsing a python dict like string to a java hash-map or equivalent for easy traversal?Solution:The json solution worked. Used simplejson in python to convert the dict to json format and java gson library. Here is the java part:
I tried that but I am doing something like java -dname="TheAboveString" and retriving it by System.getProperty("name"), so not able to pass a well formed json.. â€“ kmad 15 mins ago...and why are you passing it as a system property? Just pipe in the JSON echo "TheAboveString" | java and dump it from stdin to a JSON parser. This should be a little easier and much safer using the subprocess module.
