I don't if I am being stupid tonight, but for some reason this wont work in Python. I am trying to set variables in functions within python and whenever I print them I get a 'function + name of function + Hex values instead of string', can anyone give me some advice with this please.Thanks
Declare globalness inside the function:Personally I prefer to avoid globals and would instead write:
In your code, you're not printing the result of whatever you did in the function, you're printing the reference to the function itself (which is the name and I'm presuming the location of the function in memory). In addition to fixing the globals as discussed in the other answers, you also need to print the variable names, not the function references.
Problem 1global serverAdd will write over your serverAdd function.  If you call serverAdd a second time it won't be a function anymore.Problem 2The global in serverPort is portNumber, but you print serverPort which is a function.Problem 3The global in serverPassword is password but you print serverPassword which is a function.SolutionMake your globals different from your function names, and print the right ones.ORUse a Python library to parse your parameters (argparse, tutorial):Example UsageYou even get help!
The problem with the current code is that your declaring global variables with the same name as the function! Functions in python are variables - and as such, they share the same namespace! So when you access the variable name serverAddress Python has to determine which serverAddress you're referring to - the global variable or the local variable (the function). As a matter of how the scope works, it references local variable first. That's why when you print it, it prints out the functions information, and not the global variable.Working code is below:
