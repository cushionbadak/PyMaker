i'm creating a python program, and i want to split it up into seperate files. I'm using import to do this, but its not working (specifically, a variable is stored in one python file, and its not being read by the main one.I have in main.py:and config.py hasI should be getting the output "hello", when i'm executing the file main.py, but i'm not. I have the same problem with functions stored in functions.pyAny help would be great,
Importing the module with a simple import statement does not copy the names from that module into your own global namespace.Either refer to the main name through attribute access:or use the from ... import ... syntax:instead.You can learn more about how importing works in the Modules section of the Python tutorial.
