This question already has an answer here:Python the Hard Way - exercise 6 - %r versus %s                    7 answers                Well, i just always use %r on python, but I don't know when I have to use these other formats...
This is explained in the Python documentation.  In short,%d will format a number for display.%s will insert the presentation string representation of the object (i.e. str(o))%r will insert the canonical string representation of the object (i.e. repr(o))If you are formatting an integer, then these are equivalent.  For most objects this is not the case.
