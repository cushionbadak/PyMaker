This question already has an answer here:inheritance from str or int                    5 answers                I'd like to know how inheritance works for int, list, string and other immutable types.Basically I'd just inherit a class like this:I can't seem to figure out, how do I set the value like it's set for int? If I do self.value = value then my class will be used like this:Whereas I want to use it like this:How do I do this?
You can subclass int, but because it is immutable you need to provide a .__new__() constructor hook:You do need to call the base __new__ constructor to get your subclass properly created.In Python 3, you can omit the arguments to super() altogether:Of course, this assumes you wanted to manipulate value before passing in to super().__new__() or manipulate new_myint some more before returning; otherwise you may as well remove the whole __new__ method and just implement this as class MyInt(int): pass.
