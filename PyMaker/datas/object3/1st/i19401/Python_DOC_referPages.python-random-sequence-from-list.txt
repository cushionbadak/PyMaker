If I had a list that ranged from 0 - 9 for example. How would I use the random.seed function to get a random selection from that range of numbers? Also how I define the length of the results.
Use random.sample. It works on any sequence:As with all functions within the random module, you can define the seed just as you normally would:

If you got numpy loaded, you can use np.random.permutation. If you give it a single integer as argument it returns a shuffled array with the elements from np.arange(x), if you give it a list like object the elements are shuffled, in case of numpy arrays, the arrays are copied.
