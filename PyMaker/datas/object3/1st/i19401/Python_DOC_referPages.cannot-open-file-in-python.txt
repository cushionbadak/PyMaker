I'm having trouble with opening files, python (2.7) tells me that there is no such file, but there is.this code is suposed to read 5 csv files and store their content in data (except for the first line)At first chdir tells me he found Stats20120903.csv then I ask the program to open said file but I get an error : why?Thanks
os.chdir does not tell you what is in the directory, it changes the current working path. All relative file path you give are relative to the working dir.You should eitherremove the os.chdir("../result/files/") and call os.listdir("../result/files/") ornot add "../result/files/" to the filename you want to open.
Doinstead of looking relative to the directory you've changed to.
You could try using os.path.abspath() to find out what actual path Python is trying to use.
