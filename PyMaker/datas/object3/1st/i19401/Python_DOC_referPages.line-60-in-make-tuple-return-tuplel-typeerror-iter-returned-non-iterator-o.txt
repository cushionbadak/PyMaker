I am new to Vectors and making classes. I am trying to construct my own vector class but when i pass it through my code which is:position += heading*distance_movedwhere position and heading are both vectors. heading is normalized. my goal is to repeat my code until position = destination.What is wrong with this class?import math
I guess you are using python 3.x, because I've got a similar error.I'm also new on making class, but it would be nice to share what I learned :)In 3.x, use __next__() instead of next() in the definition of classes.The error haven't occurred after I renamed it in your code, but I got another problem, "'Vector' object has no attribute 'current'" :)I think it might be better for you to understand iterators (and class?) more.A simplest example is:and the outputs are 0,1,2,3,.With a vector class, I want to iterate the components of the vector. So:and the iterator outputs the sequence x, y, z.Note that the most important feature of iterators is to give the sequence step by step without creating whole list. So it is not very good idea to make self.list if the sequence will be very long.More details here: python tutorial
The first argument that's being passed into make_tuple is your Vector instance (it's the same self argument that you put everywhere).You have to pass in what you want to turn into a tuple, which is probably your x and y coordinates:
