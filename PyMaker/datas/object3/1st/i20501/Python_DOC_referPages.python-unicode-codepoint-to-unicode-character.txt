I'm trying to write out to a flat file some Chinese, or Russian or various non-English character-sets for testing purposes. I'm getting stuck on how to output a Unicode hex-decimal or decimal value to its corresponding character. For example in Python, if you had a hard coded set of characters like абвгдежзийкл you would assign value = u"абвгдежзийкл" and no problem. If however you had a single decimal or hex decimal like 1081 / 0439 stored in a variable and you wanted to print that out with it's corresponding actual character (and not just output 0x439) how would this be done? The Unicode decimal/hex value above refers to й.
Python 2: Use unichr():Python 3:  Use chr():
So the answer to the question is:convert the hexadecimal value to decimal with int(hex_value, 16)then get the corresponding strin with chr().To sum up:
If you run into the error:ValueError: unichr() arg not in range(0x10000) (narrow Python build)While trying to convert your hex value using unichr, you can get around that error by doing something like:
