I have both python2.7 and python3.2 installed in Ubuntu 12.04.The symbolic link python links to python2.7.When I type:It will default install python2 version of package-name.Some package supports both python2 and python3.How to install python3 version of package-name via pip?
You may want to build a virtualenv of python3, then install packages of python3 after activating the virtualenv. So your system won't be messed up :)This could be something like:
Ubuntu 12.10+ and Fedora 13+ have a package called python3-pip which will install pip-3.2 (or pip-3.3, pip-3.4 or pip3 for newer versions) without needing this jumping through hoops.I came across this and fixed this without needing the likes of wget or virtualenvs (assuming Ubuntu 12.04):Install package python3-setuptools: run sudo aptitude install python3-setuptools, this will give you the command easy_install3.Install pip using Python 3's setuptools: run sudo easy_install3 pip, this will give you the command pip-3.2 like kev's solution.Install your PyPI packages: run sudo pip-3.2 install <package> (installing python packages into your base system requires root, of course).â€¦Profit!
Short AnswerSource: Shashank Bharadwaj's commentLong AnswerThe short answer applies only on newer systems. On some versions of Ubuntu the command is pip-3.2:If it doesn't work, this method should work for any Linux distro and supported version:If you don't have curl, use wget. If you don't have sudo, switch to root. If pip3 symlink does not exists, check for something like pip-3.XMuch python packages require also the dev package, so install it too:Sources:python installing packages with pipPip latest install Check also Tobu's answer if you want an even more upgraded version of Python.I want to add that using a virtual environment is usually the preferred way to develop a python application, so @felixyan answer is probably the best in an ideal world. But if you really want to install that package globally, or if need to test / use it frequently without activating a virtual environment, I suppose installing it as a global package is the way to go.
Well, on ubuntu 13.10/14.04, things are a little different.InstallInstall packagesNOT pip-3.3 install
The easiest way to install latest pip2/pip3 and corresponding packages:Note: please run these commands as root
I had the same problem while trying to install pylab, and I have found this linkSo what I have done to install pylab within Python 3 is:It has worked properly, and as you can see in the link you can do this for every Python version you have, so I guess this solves your problem.
Old question, but none of the answers satisfies me.  One of my systems is running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and for some reason there's no package python3-pip or python-pip for Python 3.  So here is what I've done (all commands were executed as root):Install setuptools for Python3 in case you haven't.orWith Python 2.4+ you can invoke easy_install with specific Python version by using python -m easy_install.  So pip for Python 3 could be installed by:That's it, you got pip for Python 3.  Now just invoke pip with the specific version of Python to install package for Python 3.  For example, with Python 3.2 installed on my system, I used:
If you have pip installed in both pythons, and both are in your path, just use:References:http://www.pip-installer.org/docs/pip/en/0.8.3/news.html#id4https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/200This is a duplicate of question #2812520
If your system has python2 as default, use below command to install packages to python3$ python3 -m pip install <package-name>
Easy enough:If you want Python 3.3, which isn't the default as of Ubuntu 12.10:
You can alternatively just run pip3 install packagename instead of pip,
Firstly, you need to install pip for the Python 3 installation that you want. Then you run that pip to install packages for that Python version.Since you have both pip and python 3 in /usr/bin, I assume they are both installed with a package manager of some sort. That package manager should also have a Python 3 pip. That's the one you should install.Felix' recommendation of virtualenv is a good one. If you are only testing, or you are doing development, then you shouldn't install the package in the system python. Using virtualenv, or even building your own Pythons for development, is better in those cases.But if you actually do want to install this package in the system python, installing pip for Python 3 is the way to go.
Although the question relates to Ubuntu, let me contribute by saying that I'm on Mac and my python command defaults to Python 2.7.5. I have Python 3 as well, accessible via python3, so knowing the pip package origin, I just downloaded it and issued sudo python3 setup.py install against it and, surely enough, only Python 3 has now this module inside its site packages. Hope this helps a wandering Mac-stranger.
Execute the pip binary directly.First locate the version of PIP you want.Then execute.
You should install ALL dependencies:sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-setuptools  python3-numpy python3-scipy libatlas-dev libatlas3gf-baseInstall pip3(if you have installed, please look step 3):sudo apt-get install python3-pipIinstall scikit-learn by pip3pip3 install -U scikit-learnOpen your terminal and entry python3 environment, type import sklearn to check  it.Gook Luck!
If you just installed Python 3.3 and now want to install pip 3.3 locally:This works in Ubuntu 12.04. Don't forget to add $HOME/.local/bin to your path.
Another way to install python3 is using wget. Below are the steps for installation.Also,one can create an alias for the same usingNow open a new terminal and type py and press Enter.
