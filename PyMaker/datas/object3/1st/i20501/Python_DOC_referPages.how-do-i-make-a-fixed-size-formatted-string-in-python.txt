An example explains better, here there are clearly 3 distinct fields and the string is a fixed size:How can I apply such formatting to a string in python (2.7)?
Sure, use the .format method. E.g.,will printYou can adjust the field sizes as desired. Note that .format works independently of print to format a string. I just used print to display the strings. Brief explanation:10s format a string with 10 spaces, left justified by default3d format an integer reserving 3 spaces, right justified by default7.2f format a float, reserving 7 spaces, 2 after the decimal point,  right justfied by default.There are many additional options to position/format strings (padding, left/right justify etc), String Formatting Operations will provide more information.
