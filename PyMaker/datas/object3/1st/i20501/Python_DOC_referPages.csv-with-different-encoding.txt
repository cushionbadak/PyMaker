Possible Duplicate:Open a file in the proper encoding automatically my code:the problem is that it works well only if csv is UTF-8 encoded. What should I change to serve the iso-8859-2 or windows-1250 encoding?(the best solution is to autorecognize the encoding, but hand converting is also acceptable)
The solution for now:
Have a look at the examples section of the csv module documentation.  At the end, you'll find classes you can use for exactly that purpose, specifying the encoding.
Pass a file-descriptor opened with codecs.open. You can't autorecognize encodings, or not very well. To guess the encoding you can use chardet.
