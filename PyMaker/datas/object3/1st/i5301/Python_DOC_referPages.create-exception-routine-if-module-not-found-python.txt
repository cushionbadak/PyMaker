I have a simple Python programm. This programm contains two functions, that can be called by using programm.function_1() from a second programm. If a user types package.function_01() the attribute error 'module not found' comes up. I want to except that error and call the function help(). Where do I have to insert my try - except routine to handle the attribute error?Thanks in advance!
Surround the code that can break with a try ... except block. You may call your Exception handler under the except SomeException: clause Take a look into Python exception docs enter link description here
