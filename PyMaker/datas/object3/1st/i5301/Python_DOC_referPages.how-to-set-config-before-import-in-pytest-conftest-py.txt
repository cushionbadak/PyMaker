I have myprj project, and files are as below.config.pymy_logger.pymy_module.pytest_my_module.pysetup.pytox.iniWhen I run tox it fails with path not exists for log file.I get that, log file path is not exists in my local system, and it gives error.I tried to set the LOG_FILE variable in config.py using conftest.py fixture.conftest.pyBut still it return same error. If I am able to invoke something before start the test execution, like, py.test's first execution step, then I can set the LOG_FILE and it would not raise error.
In the global scope of my_module.py, you create an instance my_logger.MyLogger() and in MyLogger.__init__ logging handlers are set up.  Your problem is the anti-pattern of setting up logging handlers at import time.  Don't do that.  For apps, logging handlers should be configured at runtime (done by main() or whatever).  For libraries, logging handlers should not be configured at all (with the exception of possibly adding a NullHandler) - it is up to the user of your library to decide how they want handlers configured.  Note that pytest does not require logging handlers in order to test the records logged.
