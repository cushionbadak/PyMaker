I am trying to take multiple csv files (15 by 15 matrices), flatten them out into 1D matrices and then write them row by row into a new csv file using python.An example of an input csv file:This is the approach I am currently using:However when I open trainingdata.csv it looks like this:It is not delimiting the elements with ',' and also adds a lot of 0s rather than simply keeping the values as 1s or 0s.Any help would be appreciated. Thanks 
The 2d array approach is neater, but here's a way to do it with pandas only:
At the moment you are writing one line at the time into your file (and by that overwrite the line before). As pointed out by @hpaulj in the comments you could think about using a 2D array. The following shows an example for the 2D case:The fmt argument formats the values as integers as you wished.If you really want to override the lines before or use a 1D array otherwise it can be saved as follows:Note the [df[i]] which effectively makes a 2D array of the 1D array before writing it to the file. This prevents the comma issue you described. The reason for that is, that by using [df[i]] you are telling np.savetxt that you want 1 row with 15 columns. If you enter a simple 1D array with 15 elements, it is interpreted as 15 rows with 1 column each. You did not recognize that, because you set the value of newline = ' ' which causes them be in the same line of the file although they are actually multiple "lines" separated by spaces.
