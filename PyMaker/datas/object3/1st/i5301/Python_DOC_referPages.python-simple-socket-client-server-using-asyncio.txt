I would like to re-implement my code using asyncio coroutines instead of multi-threading.server.pyclient.pyI know there are some appropriate asynchronous network librairies to do that. But I just want to only use asyncio core library on this case in order to have a better understanding of it.It would have been so nice to only add async keyword before handle client definition... Here a piece of code which seems to work, but I'm still confused about the implementation.asyncio_server.pyHow adapt this in the best way and using async await keywords.
The closest literal translation of the threading code would create the socket as before, and use asyncio low-level socket operations to implement the server. Here is an example, sticking to the more relevant server part (the client is single-threaded and likely fine as-is):The above works, but is not the intended way to use asyncio. While the correct abstraction will depend on the application, you probably want to at least utilize asyncio.start_server and not work with raw sockets. This significantly reduces the line count of code:See the documentation for additional details.
