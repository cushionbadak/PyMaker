I am figuring out the differences between the pickle.load() and pickle.loads(). Somebody said what kind of object that pickle.load() process is "file_like_object",  however, pickle.loads() corresponds to "file object".
Your choice of which function to use depends on the object from whence you are loading the pickled data:pickle.loads is used to load pickled data from a bytes string. The "s" in loads refers to the fact that in Python 2, the data was loaded from a string.For example:pickle.load is used to load pickled data from a file-like object. This is any object that acts like a file - in this case, meaning it has a read() method that returns bytes.For example:This same convention applies to the dump/dumps functions in the pickle library, as well as the json module and others.
