I am taking user input to get historical data of a particular stock and I want to handle 2 possible errors, 1 being an error generated due to bad inputs and the code generating an error and 2nd if the input is bad but the code gets executed and I get an empty dataframeThe above code handles if any systematic error happens but when an user inputs wrong stock symbol, example for SBI symbol is SBIN but if someone enters SBINSE or lets say someone enters ZOO as stock symbol, data returns an empty dataframe without any errors, I want to put a condition that if the dataframe returned is empty then the loop should keep on going. Please help.In the above code ns is nsepy module. My python ver is 3.6.4

Thanks David A for pointing me to right direction.This is the change that I implemented on my code and now it seems to handle all empty dataframe issue when a wrong symbol of a stock is entered
This should work, I haven't tested it though. You can als make your own exception, but it' not necessary.
