I'm trying to read a csv file in python and build a data frame from it. Here is an example of a row from my csv file:|ab/5 (cd ef 6| text1/123 (lala| ghj) lal/1234/567|   I would like to slice the row and assign each element to a column.The row should look sit in the data frame like so:Setting up a distributor while opening the file in excel is pointless because sometimes '|' appears in place, in which case it should not be split.For the first element ab/5 I was trying to do it like this:However, an error occurred:Does anyone have an idea how to solve this?
There is no point to use the csv.reader function if you intend to delimitate manually. You can instead use open and split the line at the first instance of '|' as shown below:The split('|',1) function will split the string only at the first '|' character. If you wish to remove the whitespace, you can also add .replace(' ','') before split.Alternatively, if your csv file is only 3 columns and the extra '|' characters only appear in column 2 as shown in your example, then you can recombine them after using csv.reader
This is wrong way to implement split.You should do "cell" parsing while you're reading csv, not after. For python csv module, dialects support custom delimiters. So, you can just docsv.reader will do all parsing and splitting for you, and you will iterate over parsed listsLook for more examples and recipes in docs
