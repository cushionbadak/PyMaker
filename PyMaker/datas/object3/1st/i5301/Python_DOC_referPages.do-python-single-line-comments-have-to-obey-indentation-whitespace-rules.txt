If I have python code that requires indenting (for, with, function, etc), will a single line comment end potentially the context of the construct if I place it incorrectly? For example, presuming step1, step2 and step3 are functions already defined, will:(unintentionally) reduce the scope of myFunc() so that it only contains step1? If I only want to remove step2 from the 3-step sequence, must I place the # at the same level of indentation as the statements within the scope of the construct? All the code I have seen so far suggests this is a requirement, but it might just be a coding habit.
Try it out:which outputs:So yeah, the answer is "Line comments don't need to match indentation". That said, PEP8 really prefers that they do, just for readability.
Syntax-wise, blank lines are ignored. Blank lines include lines that have any amount of white space followed by a comment. https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#blank-linesIndenting a comment the way you show in your example does not change the block of code included in your function.Convention-wise, PEP8 calls for comments indented to the same indentation as code.
It doesn't really matter where you place the #Either in the first identation level or close to the instruction, everything underneath it is going to be executed.I suggest you to play with the code below and You'll figure it out yourself.
