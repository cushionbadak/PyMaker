Suppose that I have a list lst of some objects.What value of an object is used to perform sorted(lst) if key function is not provided? Is it hash or some id?
when no key is provided, sort uses exclusively the < operator, as demonstrated in this example:here I get:sort used the defined __lt__ (less than) operator internally, only, not equal not superior. Sorting is only performed with < operator.(commenting the __lt__ operator leads to TypeError: unorderable types: A() < A())
Python sort()This method sorts the list in place, using only < comparisons between  items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations  fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be  left in a partially modified state).Refer: list.sort()
