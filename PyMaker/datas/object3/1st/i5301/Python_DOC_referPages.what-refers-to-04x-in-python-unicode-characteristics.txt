Natural Text
In the above code what refers to %04x?
It doesn't have anything directly to do with Unicode. %04x is a format specifier, which only makes sense with the % operator. It specifies that the number to be formatted (in this case, ord(c)) should be formatted as a hexadecimal with four digits and zero-padding on the left. So if c is "A", whose Unicode code point is 65, it will be printed as 0041.
