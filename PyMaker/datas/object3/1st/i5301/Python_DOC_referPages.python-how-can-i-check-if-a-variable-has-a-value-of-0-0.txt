I have a variable that can sometimes have a value of -0.0, and I want to change its value to 0.0 whenever this is the case.The problem is, I can't find a nice way to check if it has a value of -0.0! I can't use something like:because a can have other values like False (and False == -0.0).I thought if I used is, then that would work, but -0.0 is -0.0 is false!Another idea I had was to try: Unfortunately, this is also problematic because a can have a value of '-0.0', which I want to keep as a string.So, right now I can only think of doing:which is pretty crazy considering what I want to do...Does anyone know of any better ways to do this? Thanks so much for the help! :) 
You could also use abs() which outputs the absolute value:Therefore, a check for a == -0.0 becomes unnecessary.
if type(a) is float and a == -0.0
elaborating on previous answers, the simplest way would be to:check typecheck if equals 0.0and in that case set to 0.0, we don't care if a is -0.0 or 0.0, force 0.0 in all cases
