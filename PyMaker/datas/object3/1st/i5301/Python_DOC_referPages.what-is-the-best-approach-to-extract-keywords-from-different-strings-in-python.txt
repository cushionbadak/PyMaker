Natural Text
I am looking to extract important keywords from a set of text pieces which are actually text messages received after any transaction.Below is a sample dataset:And I need to extract information from the messages about the transaction amount, the remaining balance, the date, and the type of transaction.What approach should I take and what module will be the best?FYI The messages from the same number have the same message format but I have to deal with a large number of formats so writing code for each number will be repetitive and time consuming.
Use regular expressions from the re module.For example to find the date for each string we could use the regex pattern r" on (\d\d[-\/]\d\d[-\/]\d{2,4})"
