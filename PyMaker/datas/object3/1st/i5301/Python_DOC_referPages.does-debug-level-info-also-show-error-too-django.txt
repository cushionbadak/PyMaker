I have such LOGGING setup for my django, but I realized using DEBUG level, it shows TOO much especially the template variableDoesNotExist debug is quite annoying.I have this as my current setup}I am wondering if I change the level to INFO will it just show INFO and not show ERROR level if any?Else, is it possible to split different levels into different files?I tried something like this, but not sure if it'll work properlyThanks in advance for any suggestions
Setting a log level always means to show anything at that level or higher.As you can see from the docs, ERROR is higher than INFO, so setting the level to INFO will show both - as well as WARNING and CRITICAL, which is the highest level.However, you certainly can set up two different loggers for different levels.
