I need a code where Python can invoke a cmd process, run a command.I have to find whether that command succeeds or not and proceed accordingly in the python code.The codes I have fount on stackoverflow deals only with opening cmd and running commands.I don't want to use the runas as it requires admin privilege, which I have incorporated in my program later and should not be used here.(suggest it only if doesn't invoke a UAC and doesn't require admin privileges.the only code I have found to run cmd without admin privilege is:I don't know if the proc variable can be used to detect the return value or any other thing, guide me accordingly and suggest better code if possible.
