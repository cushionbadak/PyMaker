Natural Text
I'm not great on all the technical terms so I'll do my best to explain my problem.I've written a small script to open android SDK and check for attached devices (using windows 10 and python 2.7.14). The code I've got is as follows:That all works fine, but I want to get the last 3 lines to save to a text file. I've tried f = open('logfile.txt', 'w') then converting it all to a string  using s = str(t, 'Checking for connected devices:', os.system('adb devices -l')) and writing it to the file and closing it, but it's not working. It's not even creating the file, let alone writing anything to it.I'm probably missing something key but I'm a newbie at this so please be nice! Any help would be much appreciated.Many thanksEdit: whole code with the write stuff included:
Try the following:
os.system executes the command in a subshell and returns the command's exit code. It does not provide any mean to capture the outputs of the command ("outputs" => what the command prints to it's stdout/stderr streams).To capture the command's outputs you'll have to use some of the subprocess module's feature, the most obvious here being subprocess.check_output 
Thanks everyone for your help. The answer was: 
With Python 3.5+ you can (and probably should) use subprocess.run() which conveniently replaces the legacy subprocess.check_output() with a more versatile API.Directly connecting the stdout of the subprocess to an open file handle is possible via the old check_output() API too, mind you.
