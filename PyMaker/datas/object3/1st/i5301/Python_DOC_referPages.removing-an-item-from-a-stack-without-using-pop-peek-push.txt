I don't understand what they're asking. Can someone just clarify the question? The question is: (They gave us the doc-string for it)Write and test the method combine in the stack_array module. Test it from a module named q3.py.This is extending the Stack class. It should produce the same result as Question 1, but it must work at the lowest level of the Stack code definition. In other words, this method cannot call the Stack push and pop, it has to work with _values directly.I've solved it using push,pop, and peek.
Since you can't use your stack methods, you need to go back to the basics.In order to interlace s1 and s2, you need to first have a loop that keeps adding corresponding elements from both stacks until one of them is empty. There are builtin functions you can use here such as zip() and itertools.zip_longest , but for now we will just keep it simple. Let's say you have your two stacks lists and s3 declared as:You can use a counter to add the corresponding elements together:Which basically iterates until i has exceeded the length of either first or second. So if you had s1 as [1,2,3] and s2 as [4, 5], this would create [1, 4, 2, 5]. However, as shown above, if the lists are not the same length, you need to extend the rest of the bigger list to s3. In order to do this, you need to check if i is less than the original lengths of first and second.Here is how you could do this:And if none of these conditions are triggered, then both lists were the same size to begin with. There are more pythonic ways to do this, such as using iterators and builtin functions, but this bare minimum logic should allow you to complete your task. Since this is homework, I'll leave the rest to you.
