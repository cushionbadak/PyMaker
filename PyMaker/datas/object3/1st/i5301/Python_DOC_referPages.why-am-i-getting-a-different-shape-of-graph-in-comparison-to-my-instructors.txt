what i tried drawing:G = nx.gnp_random_graph(20,0.5)what i got with plt.show(G):my resultwhat my instrutor drew: with same commands:instructor's result
Code like:will use current time or other resources to init the PRNG (as seed=None)As networkx is pure python and reuses the standardlib, this boils down to python's random module seed:random.seed(a=None, version=2)You can set the seed to make it deterministic like:The last line will always output the same graph (the docs explicitly call for an int!).If your instructor did not fix the seed, it's somewhat bogus to try to reproduce it.
