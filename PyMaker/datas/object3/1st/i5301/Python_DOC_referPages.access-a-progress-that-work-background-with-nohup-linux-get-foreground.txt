I am working on a chat program with Python. I would like to use nohup because users always can access server when I am logout. I could run nohup very well. It was great.But I am a admin and I can write messages,and can see online users as using python. after I worked nohup, and logout, when I login I can't access the python progress. I want to foreground it again. Yeah, I can see it in background with ps -aux . I see its PID,STAT but I don't know how to access it. I should access it.jobs doesn't see it. fg don't work. or I can't do. How can I do? 
If you nohup a process, when you log out the parent of the process switches to being init (1) and you can't get control of it again.The best approach is to have the program open a socket and then use that for ipc. You probably want to split your code in to 2 pieces - a daemon that runs in the background and keeps a socket open, and a client which connects to the socket to control the daemon.
