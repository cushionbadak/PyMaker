I am using Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape the newegg website and grab product pricing, name and shipping costs. However, when I run the program, the output sends back only the first product entry from the website. Can anybody help me with what I'm doing wrong? 
The print and write statements should be put inside the for block.
You can try this:Output:
You need either another for loop around your call to f.write(), or to write within your first for loop.You are only writing one 'product' to the file because that line of code is only executing once.Easiest solution is move to right afterbe sure to indent to match the rest of your for loop contents.Do yourself a favor and read the python docs. https://docs.python.org/3/
