This question already has an answer here:Reference - What does this regex mean?                    1 answer                Regex to find if a string contains all numbers 0-9 be it in any order.Can anyone help?Suppose I have a string- "01230912747238507156" This has all characters from 0-9. So I should get True. 
This solution can handle all sorts of strings, not only numeric characters.How it works:Find all digits in the string with regex findall. Join all matches to one string and get unique characters by putting it in a set. Then count the length of the set. If all digits are represented the length will be 10.
You can use Python's built-in all() functionSee code in use hereYou could also replace [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] with list(range(0,10))
You could use a counter like thisIf you are really looking for a regex solution (learning purposes?), you could use multiple lookaheads (not advisable, really redundant code):That is:
You could just use .isDigit() to filter for non numbers it returns a bool
