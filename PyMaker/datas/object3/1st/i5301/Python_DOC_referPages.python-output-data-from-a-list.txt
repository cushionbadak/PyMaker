I'm trying to figure out how to output list items.  the code below is taking answers and checking them against a key to see which answers are correct.  for each student correct answers are stored in correct_count.  Then I'm sorting in ascending order based on the correct count.if I print out grades the output looks like thiswhat I'm interested in is the last row.  The first number of each set corresponds to a student id and it's sorted in ascending order based on the 2nd number which represents a grade (4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8).I'm not sure how to grab that last row and iterate through it so that i get output likestudent 3 has a grade of 4 and student 2 has a grade of 5
What you were doing was printing grades while you were still in the loop. If you would've printed grades after both loops, you would've only seen the last line: [[3, 4], [2, 5], [1, 6], [0, 7], [5, 7], [6, 7], [7, 7], [4, 8]], then just loop through grades and python will "unpack" the list into the student, and grade, respectively ash shown above.Here is the output:Don't forget to click the check mark if you like this answer.
What about something like the following:Now you have a dictionary with the id of students mapping to their score ;)Of course, you can change the enumerate to have the true list of ids instead!
While MMelvin0581 already addressed the problem in your code, You can also use nested list comprehension to achieve the same resultsThis will produce output like:Then you can sort your results based on the criteriaNote: itemgetter will have slight performance benefit over lambda. The above operation will produce output like:Then finally print your list like:
