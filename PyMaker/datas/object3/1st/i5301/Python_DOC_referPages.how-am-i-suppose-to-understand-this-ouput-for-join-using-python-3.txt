Strings can be iterated through, and when you do iterate through one, it will spin through each individual letter.str.join(iterable) will join the iterable inside the brackets together using the string outside the brackets.If the iterable was a list, it'd be easy to see what is going onAnd with a string,
String is a sequence of characters. Join function concatenates the sequence (iterable) to a new string by joining them on the string you called the function on. In this case it's s with value of 'HI'.Its not different than:That results in "hello world".
The thing is, string.join receives a iterable as a parameter, so the string you are passing it, will be treated as a iterable and not a string, so you will do b, joined with y joined with e. If you do s.join(['bye']), then the output will be the one I assume you were expecting
