I have a question about using data from functions in another function.When I try the following:I get the following result:Why does it print out 6 instead of 36 and how can I write it such that it uses the df to calculate df2?
The return value of input() is summing the arguments you have passed to it i.e. 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.You never call the calculator function. Therefore, in order to use the result of input in calculator, you need to return the result and then pass this into the calculator function.Note: I would advise against calling a function you write yourself input as this will shadow the built-in input function.
I don't see any trouble in your code, you get 6 because you are calling input, but if you call calculator with that result:
There is a another way to implement this, calling on a feature from functional programming:We've created a composite function and now you don't have to work with nested functions. This is often useful if you have several functions feeding each other. It makes your code cleaner and easier to follow.
