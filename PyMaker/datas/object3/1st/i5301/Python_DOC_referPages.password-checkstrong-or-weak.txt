Write a function that determines whether or not a password is good. Wewill define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long andcontains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least one number.This is the code that I've come up with. However, it doesn't seems to work and I cannot tell why. Can anyone explain me? I am still a novice in programming. 
I would looking into using pythons built in functions of .isdigit(), .isupper(), and .islower() this could save you some lines to check the passwords for those conditions.Also you should replace your elif's with if's. The way your code is now, once one if condition is met it doesn't check the rest. So if you want all conditions to be met you need to check if each of those is true.EDIT: As Fred noted below the second part of this is not technically correct. Although the statement about if vs. elif is true, it need not be used in your code, for the very reason Fred mentioned.
You need to convert 'num' list of int to a list of string. Because you cannot compare int and str Changeto
After doing some running and some test, I came into a simple solution, as the other users said, a str is not equals as a num, meaning 0 != "0", so, you can convert the first list into a list of str that contain numbers by doing this:now your list is:finally when you try your code:(I change a little the name to make calre it to myself)import stringnum = [str(i) for i in range(0,10)]letdown = list(string.ascii_lowercase)letup = list(string.ascii_uppercase)
I believe it will be better to use "any" method:
