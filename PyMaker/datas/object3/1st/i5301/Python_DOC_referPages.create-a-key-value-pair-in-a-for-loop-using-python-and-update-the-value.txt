I am new to python and learning the stuff from scratch. One thing I want to do, but couldn't find out how is to create a key-value pair list using the for loop and update just the value. A sample code is:The integer x is different for each i.  How do I create a list like {0:x0,1:x1,2:x2,3:x3,4:x4,5:x5}, using the for loop?
You're looking for Python Dictionaries.Do note, however, that since your keys are just 0, 1, 2 etc., you may want to just use a list instead:Note that dictionary access using sample[key] will look identical to list access using sample[index] since you're just using consecutive numeric keys.
Is this what you are looking for?
