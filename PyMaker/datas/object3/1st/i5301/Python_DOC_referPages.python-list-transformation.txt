I have a list in the following formatI wonder if there is a pythonic way to transform this list to a list of tuples like belowI know I can parse each element in the list, but that would be very inefficient, I am looking for a pythonic way with maybe a couple of simple lines.
Assuming the objects are collections.namedtuples:Output:
[(d.Id, d.value, d.ratio) for d in data]data being your list.See: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
