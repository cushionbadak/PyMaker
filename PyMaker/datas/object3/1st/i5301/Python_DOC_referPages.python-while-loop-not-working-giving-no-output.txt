I am trying to use a while loop to make a script run every 10 or so minutes (in this example shorter for the sake of understanding if it's working). It won't work and I'm not sure why - difficult to understand exactly what it is that isn't working. Basically it runs without an issue but nothing is going into the CSV file I am trying to save. Ideally I want it too save across a row, then go down another row with every loop. Thanks in advance!This is an example of the XML it's pulling as I obviously can't provide the code to the API i'm using.Yet again Stack, appreciate any help. This task has upped my learning of python significantly - excited to get this little script working!
open's 'w' argument truncates the file each time it's invoked.  You need an 'a'.From https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html:mode can be 'r' when the file will only be read, 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. 'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing.Also, it seems that the script subsequent to lastTime += 10 should be indented to be in the timing loop, otherwise you never get there.UPDATE:Looking more closely, I think you mean something like:Otherwise the while loop exits after the argument is false the first time.UPDATE 2:Actually, a simpler way to write this is:This also has the benefit that your CPU isn't constantly looping waiting for 10s to pass, freeing up resources for other processes.
