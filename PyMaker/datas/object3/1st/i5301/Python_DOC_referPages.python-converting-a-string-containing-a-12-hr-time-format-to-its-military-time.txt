Coding in PythonI have a CSV file with a column called time that consists of strings like 12:00:00 AM and 10:00:00 PM. I simply want to convert these strings into their corresponding military time representation either by string or integer such that 12:00:00 AM becomes "0" or 0 and 10:00:00 PM becomes "22" or 22.I am new to coding in general so I have no idea what are the correct keywords to search for. Thanks!
Try coding it first by yourself and update your question by posting your code when you encounter errors with it. To give you a head start, you can start by reading the time module of python. In particular, you will be needing the time.strptime to convert your string format to a time format then output your desired military time format using time.strftime.Make sure to check out the directives properly for the formatting of your strings. Happy coding!
then you can access the hour with t_dt.hour
