I encountered something that makes no sense to me. See this use of sorted with range and lambda:Which outputs this in the Python shell:Now, for the life of me, I don't get this! I've been playing around with sorted, lambda, and range, and it doesn't make sense. For example, if you run the range bit in a for loop, you get something like this:And the lambda bit:But putting it all together... I don't understand how using the key this way makes the order independent of the sign.But this makes sense to me:Can someone shed some light on this?
Let's go through this step by step:The sequence you're sorting is range(-5, 6), which is [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].The elements of this sequence with their corresponding keys are:Now let's sort this table by key:This means that the output of sorted() will be 0, then -1 and 1 in some order, then -2 and 2 in some order, etc.  sorted() performs a stable sort, so any input elements with the same key will be output in the same order that they appear in the input; since the negatives occur before the positives in range(-5, 6), this means that sorted() will output -1 before 1, -2 before 2, etc.Thus, the final output is [0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4, -5, 5].
