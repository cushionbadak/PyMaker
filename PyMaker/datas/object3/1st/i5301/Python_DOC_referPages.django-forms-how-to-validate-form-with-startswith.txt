Natural Text
I am trying to work out how to get the following bit of code working so that everything that starts with the tuple is valid, e.g. if the postcode 'GU15 56L' is entered it permits the postcode. Currently only the GU15 part is working (for this example). Something like start with but not sure where to start. Thanks for your help in advance
You can simply check if the first 4 characters are permitted:or
But you use self.cleaned_data['pcode'].lower() and your set contains all upper-cased words. Try with self.cleaned_data['pcode'].upper()
