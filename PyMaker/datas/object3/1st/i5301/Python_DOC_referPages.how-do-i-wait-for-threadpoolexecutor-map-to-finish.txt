I have the following code, which has been simplified:The documentation is weak regarding ThreadPoolExecutor.map. Help would be great.Thanks! 
Executor.map will run jobs in parallel and wait futures to finish, collect results and return a generator. It has done the wait for you. If you set a timeout, it will wait until timeout and throw exception in generator.map(func, *iterables, timeout=None, chunksize=1)the iterables are collected immediately rather than lazily; func is executed asynchronously and several calls to func may be made    concurrently.To get a list of futures and do the wait manually, you can use:Executor.submit will return a future object, call result on future will explicitly wait for it to finish:
