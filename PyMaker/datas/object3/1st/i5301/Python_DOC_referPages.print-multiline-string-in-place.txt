Natural Text
How to print multiline string in python in place without moving to next line when the string is updated?I tried pandas, numpy, print, \r works only for last row of the string that is printed.. any idea or workaround this?The output should be only two lines that are updated with values.line one:0 > update this value to 1line two:2 > update this value to 3
You could try curses to replace the text in any position of the screen. This example will show consecutive numbers from i to i+5 in different lines.
Your question was not clear . So I thought this code will be usefull*
