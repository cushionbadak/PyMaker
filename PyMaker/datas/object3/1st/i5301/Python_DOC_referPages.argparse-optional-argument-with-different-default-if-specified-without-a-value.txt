Consider three different runs of a program:Is it possible to use argparse such that, for example, in the first case, x==None, in the second case, x==1, and in the third, x==2?
nargs'?' with a const parameter handles this 3-way input nicely..I could have also given it a default parameter.how to add multiple argument options in python using argparse?
If you are happy to do a little post-processing, you can get it:However, it is bending the tool in a bit of a strange way.  You may want to consider instead the count action, which is commonly used to specify verbosity levels, for example  (-v, -vv, -vvv).
