Let's say I have a stringI want to extract only ab@cD!.2e out of it. I am trying this:But still getting the output as ab@cD!.2e.cp. Can someone please tell me where I am doing it wrong and what should be the correct regex for this?
Instead of re.search, use re.findall:Output:
You probably meant to add 1 as parameter to group:
If it is really just about extracting everything before a certain string - as your title suggests - you don't need a regex at all but a simple split will do:yieldsPlease be aware that this will return the original string if .cp was not found:will return
