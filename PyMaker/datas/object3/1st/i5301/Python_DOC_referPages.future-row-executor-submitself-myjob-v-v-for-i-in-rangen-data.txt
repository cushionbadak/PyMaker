I found some python code through the Internetand I can't not understand the expression it meansMay I ask for some help here?future_row = {executor.submit(self.myjob, v): v for i in  range(n_data)}
This piece of code is a dictionary comprehension that is equivalent to:
This expression will return a dictionary "future_row" whose keys are concurrent.futures.Future objects and whose values are the elements of a sequence of arguments, v in range(n_data). Each v in range n_data will be submitted to an executor whose future results stored in the keys of "future_row" will eventually contain the value of self.myjob(v) for a particular v.To collect the results of the futures that are the keys in future_row, you will need to await them using something like concurrent.futures.wait.
