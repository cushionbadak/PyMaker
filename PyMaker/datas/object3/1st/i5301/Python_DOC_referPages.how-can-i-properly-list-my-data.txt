My data is a file full of these strings. The first 2 elements, let's take 10 and 0, are the characteristics of a sample, for example 10-1 is a different sample.What I want is a dictionary where these 2 elements, in this case 10 and 0, are the name under that format 10-0 and 10-0 being a list explained below:Same for 2-29 it would be another element of that dictionary containing 2 lists. I referred to https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html but what I have to do is much more complex than their documentation. 
Consider:Output:A defaultdict is a dictionary which default value is executed by the function passed in its creation, so for example if you create a d = defaultdict(int), d[5] will output 0. In case of using list the value is an empty list []. For a more complex example if you write d = dafaultdict(lambda: [0 ,0]) the default value will be a list of length 2 with 2 0 in it.
