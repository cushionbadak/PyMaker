I am trying to build a pulp distributor plugin which will execute a bash script containing arbitrary code so that I may trigger actions after an RPM repo is published.These plugins are generally created using distutils. However, when I attempt to install my module, I receive the error:Typically, this means that the working directory is incorrect or __init.py__ is missing. In my case however, I am attempting to install from the correct working directory and I did create __init.py__ files (see the repo here).I suspect that I am running into a pathing issue having something to do with my code being in a subdirectory so far removed from setup.py. What am I doing wrong? Why won't my module install? 
When you face errors like this, one of the first things to check is what packages are actually being added to your distribution when you build it. In your case the package list is empty, but should contain at least the pulp_hook package:So why does setuptools not recognize pulp_hook as a regular package? Look at its structure: you have added file named __init.py__, but its name should be __init__.py. Once you rename the files, the pulp_hook and its subdirectories become regular packages:Now build/lib will be created because now distutils finds at least one package to install:
