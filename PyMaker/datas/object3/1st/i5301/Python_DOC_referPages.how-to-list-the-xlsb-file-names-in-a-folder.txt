I have these lines to get filenames in a folder.It doesn’t work when the folder contains .xlsb files. (Excel Binary Workbook file)The error returned is:I tried changed the last line to encode/decode to make them work but still can’t.How can I have them displayed properly?
Your output terminal doesn't handle the Unicode characters in some of your filenames.  The easiest solution is to write the output to a UTF-8-encoded file and then read the result with a Unicode-capable editor using a font that supports the Unicode characters used.  Another solution where you can still use print is to get a UTF-8-capable IDE.Notes:#coding:utf8 only declares the encoding of the source file.  If your source is all ASCII characters it doesn't do anything.https://anonbadger.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/why-sys-setdefaultencoding-will-break-code/
