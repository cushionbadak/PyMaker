Natural Text
I am working on a character level Recurrent Neural Network. To train the net I copied a text corpus from the internet. Here is the chunk of code that has the error in it :Basically all I am doing is converting characters to their ASCII equivalent. y_sequence is the character sequence and y_sequence_ix is its corresponding ASCII sequence. VOCAB_SIZE variable contains the number of unique character in the text corpus. The error occurs in this line :Complete source code along with text corpus : https://github.com/tanmay-edgelord/charRNNPlease ask for any information that is required in order for you to answer the question.EDITTRACEBACK upon calling function traceback.print_stack()
The issue is in y_sequence_ix[j] because your j range function is using SEQ_LENGTH+1.  This is what you want since you're predicting the next value in the list but it also creates an issue in that y_sequence_ix is 1 sample too short on the last iteration of i when data splits evenly with SEQ_LENGTH.  Other that the data creation at the top, the only thing modified here is use len(data)-1 in the data creation instead of len(data).  By truncating a single value, you assure you won't get an index out of range type error. This is the easiest thing to do, however you could also set SEQ_LENGTH to be a value that isn't an even multiple of len(data), ie.. 6 would work for the above example.
