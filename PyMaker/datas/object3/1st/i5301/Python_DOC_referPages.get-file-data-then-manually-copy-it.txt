I'm trying to read a file then create an exact copy of it this way, I'm doingand, for some reason, when I try to run this, running new2.mp3mp3 won't play, it refuses to start, but new.mp3 is fine
If copying the file is all you want, is there any reason why you can't simply use shutil? You can use a high level function like shutil.copy2(source, dest):Anyway, if you insist on doing it your way, you need to open new2 in write binary mode.
The b for binary matters on output too (although you can get away with not using it in Python 2 on POSIX systems).
