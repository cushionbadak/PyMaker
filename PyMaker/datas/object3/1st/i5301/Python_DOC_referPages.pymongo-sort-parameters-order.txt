I have a sort like this:It has 2 sort fields, mongo will sort the create_time field first, then status.But in python dict is disordered, it sometimes sorts create_time first, sometimes status first, so the question is how can I make sure it always sorts the create_time first?
You can simply go by a sort instead of aggregateThis is the pattern:You can chain the functions so that you can limit the documents to sort by a filter first:As a side note: the fields in .find() and .sort() do not need to be different.
