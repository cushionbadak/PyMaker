I have a python 3 programme here that's supposed to take four numbers and cross-multiply them; after this it's supposed to take answers, divide them and return the square root. However, I have a little problem, Here's the full programme: Input example (separated by spaces): ratio numbers: 5 6 7 8 whenever I try to use numbers with decimal points (eg. 5.6) i get this output:Does anyone know how to fix this error?Operating system: Linux Mint Cinnamon,IDE: IDLE
If you have a input with space separated numbers, you can split them in parts with split:
list(input(...)) makes a list of each individual character in the input, which is probably not what you wanted.Try this instead:
Use python's split() function which splits, by default, on all whitespace characters and will give you list of numbers.Then, your float conversion & multiplication would work.
