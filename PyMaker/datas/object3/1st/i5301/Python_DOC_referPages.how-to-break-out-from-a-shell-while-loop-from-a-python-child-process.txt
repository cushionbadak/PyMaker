I start a python script multiple times with a shell script. After some python script runs, i want to break out from the while-loop. In my current solution i send a kill signal from python for the shell script PID. But i would like to prevent the parent process from dying before the child process finished.My current shell script:The relevant parts of my python script:
I would suggest a solution where you do not kill the parent process, but use the exit code instead.shell script:python script:The default exit code of a python script is 0. So when it exits at the end, then the shell-loop will run again. when it exits with sys.exit('python script ends with errorcode 1'), than the shell-loop will stop.https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit:[...] If another type of object is passed, None is equivalent to passing zero, and any other object is printed to stderr and results in an exit code of 1. In particular, sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a program when an error occurs.In case there are other error, that should not cause the shell script to exit from the loop, a precise error code can be used with sys.exit(123) and python3 my_py_script.py; lastexitcode=$?.
