I am trying to compare elements in two lists. Both of the lists contain numbers and are sorted from greatest to least. I want to find the list with the highest number. If they contain the same highest number, I want to look at the next highest number, etc. So if I had a list: [14, 5, 4, 3, 2]And I was comparing it to: [14, 7, 4, 3, 2]The second list would be bigger because the next highest number is a 7. Likewise, if I had a list: [13, 12, 9, 7, 3]And: [13, 12, 9, 8, 2] The second would again be the larger of the two. Any help would be appreciated!I tried one of these suggestions: def compare_high_card(hand_a,hand_b):    '''    Determines which hand has the highest high-card,    returns 1 if hand_a has higher card, -1 if hand_b has higher_card    :param hand_a: The first hand to compare    :param hand_b: The second hand to compare    :return: 1 if hand_a has higher card, -1 if hand_b has higher_card    '''hand_a = [14, 9, 4, 3, 2]hand_b = [14, 8, 5, 3, 2]This code only prints out -1. 
If the lists are sorted, simply do:Ref: Comparing Sequences and Other Types:"Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same  sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the  first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines the  outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are  compared, and so on, until either sequence is exhausted"
You can use any:
Edit: Straightforward way:
For unsorted lists:
Here is recursive approach:output:
