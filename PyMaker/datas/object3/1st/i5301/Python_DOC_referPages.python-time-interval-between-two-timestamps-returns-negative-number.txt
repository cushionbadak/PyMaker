I am trying to get time difference between y and x, it gives me -ve value in milliseconds.I'm getting -686 as result but I expect 61. What is gonig wrong here?
The value .83is the decimal value of the timestamp 2018-01-28 08:58:10.83. This timestamp can also be written as 2018-01-28 08:58:10.830, and this value is larger than 2018-01-28 08:58:10.144, just like .830 is greater than .144.
from the documentation (emphasis mine):%f is an extension to the set of format characters in the C standard (but implemented separately in datetime objects, and therefore always available). When used with the strptime() method, the %f directive accepts from one to six digits and zero pads on the right."right" not "left". So .83 is seen as .830 you need:(%f is supposed to represent a floating point part starting with ., padding is from the right not left: ex: 0.1 == 0.10)
