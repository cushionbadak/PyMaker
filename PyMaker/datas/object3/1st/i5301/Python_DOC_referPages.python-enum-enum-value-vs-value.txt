This prints What is the difference between _ value_ and value?
The difference is that .value is the property-backed version and cannot be changed:But ._value_ is where the actual value is stored in the instance-dict, and can be changed:As Tobias explained, names that begin with an underscore should be avoided unless you have a really good reason, as you can break things using them:
The docs are a bit unclear, but as I understand the docs, _value_ is only to be used to set the value if you write your own __new__ constructor. This will later result in value being set by the metaclass provided by the enum module.https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#supported-sunder-namesPer convention, names starting with an underscore are "private" members of a class so definitely go with .value.
