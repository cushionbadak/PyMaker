I'm trying to create a function that will convert a given list into a given dictionary (where I can specify/assign values if I want). So for instance, if I have a list and I want to convert to a dictionary like this I know how to do this using a dictionary comprehension but I can't figure out how to make this into a more generalized function that would be able to turn any list into a dictionary. What's the best approach here?
Pass enumerated list to dict constructorHere enumerate(items, 1) will yield tuples of element and its index. Indices will start from 1 (note the second argument of enumerate). Using this expression you can define a function inline like:Invoke it like:Or a regular function
If the keys are just the index of the element in the list, as in your example:
Iterate through the list and assign every value to a number (starting from 1).Replace n + 1 with n if you want the dictionary to start from zero.
