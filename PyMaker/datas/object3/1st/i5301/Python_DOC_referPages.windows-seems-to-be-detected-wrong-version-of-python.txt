So I think there is a problem with my system not identifying python3 correctly. I am using windows 10 and the Bash on Ubuntu on Windows Terminal. My program is trying to run parallel processes and when I use: my terminal responses with: I call the program on my terminal using:So I know Python 2.7 uses raw_input() and that was done away with in python3+ which now uses input(). But I wanted to test some stuff out, so I replaced     input() with raw_input as follows:and used the same command:And it worked with no error. Can anyone provide any insight why this may be happening although I am explicitly using python3 in my command line? ! side note when I type in  python3 --version it returns version 3.5.2I have included a screenshot of my terminal window.calling_process.pycalled_pocess.py
It looks like for whatever reason your script is only getting run with python 2, not python 3. raw_input doesn't even exist in python 3 - you should see a NameError if you try to use it:But input in python 2 can produce exactly the error you get:That's because in python 2, input attempts to parse what you type in - and if you type nothing, well, it raises this SyntaxError. The reason that's happening is that you can't read from stdin from a process spawned by multiprocessing. This is to prevent subprocesses from stealing input from your main process.The reason you're getting python 2 instead of python 3 is the way you're calling your subprocess:You're execing python, not python3! This means you'll get the default python, which must be python 2. If you change this to program = "python3", this will get you past your error.
