I am trying to write a regex that can match any word in the following or similar words. * in these strings are exact * and not any character.I want to keeo the length fixed.  I was using the following statements but for some reason, i am not able to to the correct translation. It accepts other strings as well. 
This is a fairly straightforward regex. We want to match a word, but allow each character to be an asterisk. The regex is therefore a sequence of character groups of the form [x*]:See it in action at regex101.If you only want to match these exact words, make sure to use the pattern with re.fullmatch.
