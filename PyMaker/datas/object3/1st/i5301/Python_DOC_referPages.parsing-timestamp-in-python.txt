I have an application in which I need to parse timestamps of four different formats.How can I write a function to parse any of these formats into a timedelta object?I have tried iterating through the characters one by one and breaking when I see the :, but my code is a mess, so I would rather not have it here as a baseline.
Here's a way to do it using datetime.datetime.strptime():If you don't know ahead of time which format your input will be in, you can try all of them wrapped in a try/catch block.strptime() returns a datetime object, so call the .time() function to get only the time part. See this post for more details.Examples:Output:Or if you know the specific format, you can use datetime.datetime.strptime(ts, f).time() directly.Update 1 If you want to convert to timedeltas, you can do so using the output of parse_timestamp() and the timedelta constructor:Here is a related post that you may also find useful.
