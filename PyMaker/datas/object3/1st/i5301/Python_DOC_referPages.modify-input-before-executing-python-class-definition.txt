I am still learning how Python classes work. Here is my sample code:Then the output for >>> str1 is Alice and str1.output is Alic. How do I make str1 have the same result as str1.output?I tried __repr__ but that only changes what is displayed and not what the value of str1 actually is. Is there a way to make a statement like self = self.output?
Strings are immutable.  I guess you'll have to approach this with __new__, not __init__:
