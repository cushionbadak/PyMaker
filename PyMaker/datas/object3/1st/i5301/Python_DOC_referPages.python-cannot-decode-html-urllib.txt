I'm trying to write html from webpage to file, but I have problem with decode characters:Last line causes error:response.info().get_content_charset() returns iso-8859-2, but if i check content of response without decoding (print(resposne.read())) there is "utf-8" encoding as html metatag. If i use "utf-8" in decode function there is also similar problem:What's going on?
You can ignore invalid characters usingInstead of ignore there are other options, e.g. replacehttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_encode.htmhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#the-string-type(There is also str.encode(encoding='UTF-8',errors='strict') for strings.)
