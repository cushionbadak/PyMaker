I have recently started to develop a game called falldown and have completed making the controls, start screen, and the ball but I am struggling in randomly spawning the platforms. I had been able to temporarily draw a random platform, but in order to give the illusion that the specific platform was moving up, I needed to draw the same platform again and I couldn't figure out how to do that. I researched a lot and found these two code samples:https://github.com/Beavotropper2/FallDownhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/falldown/but I couldn't really understand how they solved this issue. Can you help me understand how to possibly create the multiple platforms generated that move up like in falldown?
I'd implement the platforms as follows: The Platform class only needs to contain an image (pygame.Surface) and a pygame.Rect which is used to store the position (can also be utilized for collision detection).In the update method I only change the self.rect.y position to move the sprite and delete it when it's above the top of the screen.To store the platform sprites, I use a pygame.sprite.Group which allows me to update and blit all contained sprites with two method calls.The sprites get added to the group separately in the add_platforms function, where I first call random.randint to get the number of platforms and then pass it and the range(0, 800, 100) to random.sample to get 4-7 random x-coords. Then you can just loop over this list and pass the coords to the sprite instances.I use the pygame.time.set_timer function to generate a custom event (ADD_PLATFORM_EVENT) every two seconds, which you can handle in the event loop to call the add_platforms function.
