Simple problem: I have u = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. I want v = [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)]. How?Obviously, one solution is:But this is so ugly and lame I hate looking at it every time I do it. Is there a better way?
zip is a pythonic solution.
Here's a more general solution for iterables that don't support slice notationNote that any leftover values (say your input list has an odd number of elements) aren't included in the output.  We an correct this by using the itertools.zip_longest function.Both of the above will return iterators over the grouped values.  You can either build a list out of them manuallyor iterate over them directly
