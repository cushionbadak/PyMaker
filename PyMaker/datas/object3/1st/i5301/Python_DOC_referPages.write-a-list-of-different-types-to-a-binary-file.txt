I have a variable of list, airMod, consisting of different types of data: char, uint32, and float. Here is how it looks like in my visual studio code debug mode:Now I'd like to save it in a binary file(raw buffer. I will use C++ to process it byte by byte). I am wondering how I should do it. I searched how it should be done, but mostly the solution of save a list containing same data type (ex. bytearray, to_byte.....). I would like to save the data, then process it in C++ ((fseek, tellg, ifstream, etc. ).Thanks a lot.
Use the built-in struct module, described here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.htmlYou can use it to serialize a set of objects (often numbers) to bytes.  For example:That will write an 8 byte file which can be interpreted using a C or C++ struct like this, assuming you're on a little-endian machine like x86:When defining such a struct in C or C++, you must take care about the alignment, padding, and endianness of the fields.  __attribute__((packed))__ is useful if you use GCC or Clang and might have unaligned fields.Another option in Python is to use a NumPy "structured array".  You can create one like this:
