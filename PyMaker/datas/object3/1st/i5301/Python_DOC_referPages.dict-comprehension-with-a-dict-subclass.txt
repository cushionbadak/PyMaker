This question already has an answer here:OrderedDict comprehensions                    3 answers                Is it possible (in Python 3.6+) to have or implement dict comprehensions on a dict subclass, with the result being an instance of that subclass instead of a normal dict? Something like CustomDict{k: v for k, v in list_of_tuples}?Is there any way at all to customize list/dict comprehensions?
Your subclass can consume an iterable of 2-tuples:You can't use the language construct style {...} on your subclass, unless of course, you want to tweak some Python internals.
