This one has me stumped so I thought I would challenge others.I am trying to change one element of a dictionary in a shelve and it is being stubborn. Here is a demo:This is happening on Python 3.6.1 on a RHEL 7 host.Having upgraded from an earlier RHEL and Python 2 I understand that the underlying libraries have more to do with how shelves function but this is a bit of weird one.Appologies to 'bob'
From the Python docs for shelf,Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable persistent-dictionary entry is modified. By default modified objects are written only when assigned to the shelfYour first try, db['bob']['gender'] = 'u', doesn't work since it's not an assignment to the shelf itself (it's an assignment to the dict db['bob']['gender']). Your second try does work since it is assignment to a key of the shelf  itself. The examples in the docs will further hammer in this point.If you were to open with writeback=True, you would be able to code normally. However, as the docs note "it would also consume more memory and make the d.close() operation slower."
