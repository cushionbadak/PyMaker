So given this numpy array:How can I convert this into a vector of probabilities? Such that the result would be:
This essentially requires a grouping operation, which numpy isn't great at... but pandas is. You can do this with groupby + transform + count, and divide the result by the length of vector. 
You can use collections.Counter to first determine the frequency of each element. Then create an intermediate mapping dict which will contain key as the element and value as the frequency. Finally using numpy.vectorize to transform the array to your desired formatAt this point the freq_dict will contains frequency of each element likeNext build a probability dict of the format element: probability, using dict comprehensionFinally using numpy.vectorize to get your desired outputThis will produce:
[Update to a general one]How about this one using np.histogram:
