This question already has an answer here:Python wildcard search in string                    6 answers                I have a list of strings that looks like this: ['ban*', 'c*rr*r', 'pl*s', pist*l ]. I want to check if those strings have matching equivalents in another list of strings which is the following:Comparing first string from the list I have'banner' and 'bannana' and that would mean that there is a word that is matching that string ("ban*") So the '*' means that there can be one or more letters in that word.
