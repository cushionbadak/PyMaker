You're not supplying any command line arguments. argv variable contains the command line arguments passed into a program. Like when you do python your_script.py verbose print, the argv variable contains ['your_script.py', 'verbose', 'print']. However, if you only supply python your_script.py argv contains ['your_script.py'] (only one element argv[0]). So, call to argv[1] is an IndexError.Python documentation on sys.agv:sys.argv  The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script. argv[0] is the script name (it is operating system dependent whether this is a full pathname or not). If the command was executed using the -c command line option to the interpreter, argv[0] is set to the string '-c'. If no script name was passed to the Python interpreter, argv[0] is the empty string.
