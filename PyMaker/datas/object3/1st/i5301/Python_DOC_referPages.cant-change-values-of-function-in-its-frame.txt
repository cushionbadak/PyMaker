This question already has an answer here:Why does modifying parent frame in Python work only for module frames?                    1 answer                In some educational purposes I want to work with function's frame from "inspect" module. I want to change the value of local var outer the function. I get the frame of this function and tried to change its value, but nothing is happened. Why? Here's the simpled code:outputs: 1337As you can see, the value of var in the frame hasn't changed. What's going on?
A frame's f_locals is the same dict returned by the locals function inside that frame. The warning from the locals docs also applies to f_locals:Note: The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by  the interpreter.
