I have dictionary tuple as follows(for value, I have many parameters defined)When I pick a value from the dictionary (I have number of Tuples) I do not know the key. I want to pick an item, Using  the "**state**" parameter defined in **Value** field.For example, I want to pick one item which contains **state** as '**unprocessed**', After picking that item, I'll update that **state** parameter.( eg: unprocessed --> processed)How can I do this in Python?p.s: I want to first iterate the dictionary(please note i'm talking about python Dictionary data structure) for the tuples which contains a "state" parameter.My Sample dictionary:gives the output:
As @puspendra suggested the solution, that is efficient indeed i was also going to suggest same solution, you can also try this solution if you want :Updateafter you pasted new list with update , here is my code for your new list :
You can do something like thisfirst, extract the dictionary from the list which contains tuple
I have many Tuples in my dictionary, some tuples contains 'state': 'unprocessed' and some contain 'state': 'processed' . I want to iterate that dictionary using state parameter and pick the very first tuple which contains 'state' as 'unprocessed' Edit, based on your comment, if you only need to change the first dict, then use next to get the first item:Use operatorThat should just change the first item that matches:If you want to change all the items in the list:
If the given expression is assigned to variable a then 'state' would be updated as follows: Updated code after getting your full response.
