I am currently using python 2.7 and will need to ping windows and linux.I want to create a function that will return the IP address from a ping within a python script. I currently have this functionRight now it just returns true or false but is there a way I can run ping(google.com) and have it return 216.58.217.206. I have a list of servers and IPs and I need to make sure that the IP addresses match the FQDN.
You can use the socket to get the IP of the host.
Not sure how no-one has tried this method yet (for windows anyways)!Use a WMI query of W32_PingStatusWith this method we return an object full of goodies Screenshot of output:
