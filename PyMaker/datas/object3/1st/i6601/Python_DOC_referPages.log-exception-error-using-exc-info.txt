How to patch logging at runtime for support exc_info key?Example:Return error:This is in Python 2.6.6
The exception method is the single method which doesn't accept exc_info because it is meant to be called from exception clauses where logging of the exception is wanted (i.e. exc_info is implicitly set). If you want the same effect as setting exc_info to False, use the error method of a logger rather than the exception method. From the documentation:Logger.error(msg, *args, **kwargs)Logs a message with level ERROR on this logger. The arguments are interpreted as for debug()....Logger.exception(msg, *args, **kwargs)Logs a message with level ERROR on this logger. The arguments are interpreted as for debug(). Exception info is added to the logging message. This method should only be called from an exception handler.
Use tracebackhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/traceback.htmlTraceback will print the exception and the stack trace showing the code caused the exception
