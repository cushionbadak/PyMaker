Natural Text
I am trying to understand the following topic and have some outstanding questions. Can anyone help me?:====================================Question: what is the purpose of the following code?
I think there are two things you need to know to understand this code snippet.JSON serialization and deserialization.JSON is a data-exchange format. Particularly it is text-based, which means if you want to save your data into a text file, you have to determine how to represent your data as the text (The serialization process). Of course, when you load data from a text file, you also need to determine how to parse the text into the memory structure (The deserialization process). Luckily, by default, the json module of python would handle most of the built-in data types, e.g., scalar type, list, dict and etc. But for your case, you have created your own data type, thus you have to specify how to serialize your own data type. This is what function convert_to_builtin_type does.Python data modelNow we come across the problem how to serialize the self-defined object Myobj. There is no uniform answer for this question, but the base line is that you can recover your object (deserialize) by the serialized text. In your case:The obj.__dict__ is a built-in dictionary that stores attributes of obj. You may read the python documentation Data Model to understand it. The intention here is try to give enough information to recover obj. For example:__class__=<c> provides the name of the class__module__=<m> provides the module to find the class.s=<v> provides the attribute and value of Myobj.sWith these three, you can recover the object you previously stored. For these hidden (built-in) attributes starting with __, you need to check the python document.Hope this would be helpful.
