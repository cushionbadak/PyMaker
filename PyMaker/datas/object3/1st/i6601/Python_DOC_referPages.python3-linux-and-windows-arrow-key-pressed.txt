I was looking for a while now all over the Internet but I cant seem to find a unique way for Linux and Windows that allows to catch a arrow up, down etc. event.With the msvcrt package on windows i found this solution:For Linux I used the termios package:I also found a Package that is supported by Linux and Windows: keyboardThis seems to work great on Windows but not on Linux.(I found all those implementations on Stack overflow.)My goal is it to move my arrow up and down on different selections. Alternative methods to complete this task are welcome as well.
I suppose your question is with respect to catching arrow key events solely on the terminal or the command prompt. If that is the case, then using getch() for windows and termios+tty in Linux is the way to go, as you mentioned.Alternate Cross Platform Methods Include:On Linux the curses module is recommended in general, and you can also find the unofficial binaries for this module for windows support here, or also by running:pip install http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/xugyqnq9/curses-2.2-cp27-none-win32.whlThe keyboard module mentioned in the question works on linux only with sudo permissions, as mentioned here. You could also try PyUserInput, which seems to work on my Linux machine.In general though you are better off implementing your own solution in msvcrt/ttty+termios, or using a GUI Libraries like Pygame or Tkinter (If the application does not specifically require to run on a terminal), which provide facilities for catching keyboard events.
