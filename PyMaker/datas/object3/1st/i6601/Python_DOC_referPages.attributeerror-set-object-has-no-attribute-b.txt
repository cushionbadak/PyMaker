I have the following code:With typical input, the list b looks like this:What is the issue with a.b[0](c)? Apparently I am not evaluating it correctly. The concept seems fine, but it seems like set a is not able to take an attribute which is actually an element of a list.what I want to evaluate is:Here's the error I get:
You can't do that kind of indirect attribute access using the dot operator in Python. Use getattr() instead:
I think you want to use getattr, to get an attribute who's name stored as a string in another variable:Your current code is looking for an attribute named b on the a set.
