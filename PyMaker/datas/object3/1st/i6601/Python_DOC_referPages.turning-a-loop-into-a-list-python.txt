Below is my code: I am trying to turn the loop results I get from this code into a list. Any ideas?
if you don't want to change much of your code, create an empty list before your loop like thisand in your loop append the content like this:EDIT1:The reason I used myList.append(...) above instead of myList[len(myList)] or something similar, is because you have to use the append method to extend already existing lists with new content.EDIT2:Concerning your problem with None pointers in your list:If your list looks like [None, None, ...] when printed after the for loop, you can be sure now that you have still a list of strings, and they contain the word None (like this ['None','None',...]).This would mean, that your x.get_text() method returned no string, but a None-pointer from the beginning. In other words your error would lie buried somewhere else.Just in case. A complete example would be:
A straightforward way to convert the results of a for loop into a list is list comprehension.We can convert:into:Basic (list comprehension has a more advanced syntax) has as grammar:it constructs a list where Python will iterate over the <iterable> and assigns values to <var> it adds for every <var> in <iterable> the outcome of <expr> to the list.
Just loop over it.
