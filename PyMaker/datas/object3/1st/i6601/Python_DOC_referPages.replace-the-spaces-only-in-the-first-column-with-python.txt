when replacing all spaces with commas in a row using `fileout.write(x) .replace (' '. ',') . but how do I change the spaces only in the first column? I want to break the date and time below into 2 columns separated by commas
Given this is likely CSV, you could just use the csv module to get the columns as elements in a list (representing a given row), then work with only the first columnIf you know for a fact that every column needs this replacement exactly once, you can use str.replace's optional third parameter to limit replacementSolving via #2 is trivial:Approach #1 is only slightly more involved (and likely more correct):In the latter case, you may want to perform checks to confirm that row[0].split(None, 1) actually produced two results, so you don't silently muck up some rows and not others.
Is this what you need?outputs:2017/06/07,10:40:02,RuleVWIRE02,webbrowsing
