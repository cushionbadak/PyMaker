Basically, I would like to create an infinite generator from the given list l with some batch size of batch_size. For example, if I have list of l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and batch_size = 2, I'd like to generate infinite loop of [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 1], [2, 3], ... (similar to itertool.circular with additional batch size)My current approach is the following which doesn't give the right solution yet because at the end I just pad the first element of list when I reach the end:Is there a way to do that in a circular way?
Yes, you basically want a combination of "take" and cycle:From the recipes in the docs you'll see that take is a basic tool, so using that:
This should work:
