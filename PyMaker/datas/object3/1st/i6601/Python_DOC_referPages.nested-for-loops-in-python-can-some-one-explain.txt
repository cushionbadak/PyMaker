I'm studying how to use for loops and so on and I'm trying to come up with a way to make a string of similar characters sort itself so that no characters are repeatedI know that the first loop iterates through all the values in charsnum, but what are the second, third, and so on for loops iterating through? Also, what could be a good solution to making my string 'babbbaba' in to a string like 'bababababa' or 'ababababa' where no values repeat. 
You are asking several for loops to all iterate over the same, single iterator. You did not create copies, they share one object. The outer loop advances the charsnum object by one step, then the next for loop advances it once to start its iteration, and so on. The innermost for loop takes the remaining items to iterate over, and by the time you go back up to the for z loop there is nothing left to iterate over.You can do the same thing, advancing the iterator like for does, with the next() function:You could create separate enumerate() objects for each for loop:but that's just more work than you need. For nested loops repeating the same iterable, use itertools.product() and tell it to repeat; it'll keep copies as needed:This won't eliminate repeated characters, however; this produces the cartesian product of 4 (index, char) tuples out of all possible such tuples from your char string.You probably want to create permutations form the unique letters, and string out the patterns those make into something the same length:This produces
The "problem" is not at the for loops, but at charsnum. The object charsnum is a generator that yelds the next value everytime it is called.In the first for loop (for j in charsnum) it yelds the first item in chars but in the inner loop (for z in charsnum) charsnum will yeld the next item in chars. So this inner loop will never access the first item in chars.
Your question and example are really confusing, I think this is what you are looking for.A way easier way to do this is to use a list comprehension, which will iterate through your set of characters in a more compact, pythonic manner.Result:Now you can iterate over your indices to check if they are equal to the previous.Result:Or if you want to print them out in a single string...Result
