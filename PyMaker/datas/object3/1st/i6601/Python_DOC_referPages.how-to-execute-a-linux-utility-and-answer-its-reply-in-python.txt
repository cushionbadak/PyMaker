When I am executing an utility, blab, and it will ask yes or no for confirmation, what can I do? Thanks,The code is as below:
Popen.communicate() documentation:If you want to send data to process's stdin using python, create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE too.
