this code prints out the values from -30 up to 40, but I need it to print out the values from -30 to 40 in steps of 10. Can someone help me? I wasn't able to find anything when googeling this problem.
The third argument for range is the step, so just use:However note that the stop is exclusive, so if you wanted to include 40 it should be:
Following the documentation:The documentation defines range as taking three arguments:range(start, stop[, step])The last argument, step, is the interval for each loop. So, to loop x in intervals of 10, we can set the step argument to 10:which prints out the following values for x:N.B. that as range stops when it reaches the stop argument (exclusive), 40 is not included.
Since print in python 3+ is a function, you can achieve the same result using:Code:outputBasically print will unpack the range and use separator \n.
