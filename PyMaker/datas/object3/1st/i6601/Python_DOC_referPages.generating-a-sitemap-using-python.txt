I'm trying to parse a webpage and create a site map using python. I've written the below piece of code -The above code prints all the links in example.com(external and internal). I need to filter out the external links and print only the internal links, I know I can differentiate them using domain name "example.com" and "somethingelse.com" or whatever the name is, but I'm unable to the RE format to get this - or if there is any built in library that helps in achieveing thisOnce I get all the internal links - how do I map them. For instance "example.com" has link to "example.com/page1" which has link to "example.com/page3". What is the ideal way to create a map for this kind of flow ? I'm looking for a library or logic which shows "example.com" -> "example.com/page1" -> "example.com/page3" or something similar
For your first question, you can use urlparse to parse hostnames and check the domain. Do not use hand rolled regex to do that, it is much easier with a core library like that. See:For your second question, your data structure looks like a graph doesn't it? You could use a custom graph data structure with nodes and links between them. Or you could use a graph database made for this purpose. Both of these solutions will be much complex for your needs though. I think it might be better to just use a dictionary data type where key is the page's URL and value is a list of links in that page for example. You can't easily follow links in this case as in a graph but it will still do the trick. You can also keep another set data type for tracking links you have visited.
