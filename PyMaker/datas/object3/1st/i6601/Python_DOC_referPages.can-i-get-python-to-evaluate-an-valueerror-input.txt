I'm creating a code that calculates some values for buying a house. It'll be asking the user for a lot of input and I want to make sure the program asks them for integers if they input non-integers.I made a function that will check if an input is an integer or not, but the interpreter only returns a value error if I input a string. Is it possible to get it to run the string through the integer check function after it's inputted?
Surround try .. except .. around int(..) call; Checking against the return value of the int() call has no meaning once the exception raised, because control flow will not reach there if the input string was not an integer string.Pass the string to the function, and the function should try to convert to int:
You can type cast:Further, since you only have a pass/fail condition in your main program, change:to:
