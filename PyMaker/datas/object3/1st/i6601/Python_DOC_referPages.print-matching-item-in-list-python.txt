You can use itertools.groupby output: 
You can use a dictionary to better group your values:Output:Or, using groupby in list comprehension:Output:
Kind of slow since you're doing an 26 * len(i) iterations to create the sorted list. I'm not sure if this answers your question fully... what happens when an item like 'ab111' is in the list? Will it ignore this?
