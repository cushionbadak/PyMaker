This question already has an answer here:Confused by python file mode “w+”                    6 answers                The coding that I am using to learn:So if i understand all right this will create a .html file and write the google.com html code that i request (r) in it.If i run this now:Does the f.write(r.text) rewrite everything that's on 'r' variable like it was a blank file or it will just edit the file with new stuff i add into 'r'? didn't knew how to ask. ThanksEDIT: nevermind I am a noob! use f = open("./page.html", "a") if i want to append and 'w' if i want to overwrite
That all depends on how you open the fileThe mode indicates, how the file is going to be opened "r" for  reading, "w" for writing and "a" for a appending.
