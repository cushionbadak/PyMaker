I tried to look at the python docs about making some i18n mechanism on a python project. Although I usually like python docs, this section didn't look intuitive to me, and I looked another resources. By looking these:inventwithpython.com/blog/translate-your-python-3-program-with-the-gettext-module/Python docs: localizing-your-application I managed to do the source code I pasted below. First it was giving a domain error, but after adding the .mo files, now it doesn't work or show any error.main.py.mo file sampleLayout (pokerProject sub-tree)
I found the problem and a provisional but not satisfactory solution.My code had the line:and it was not needed. As a matter of fact, when I deleted this line, everything went perfectly.I don't understand well why, but this solved it. I don't know if this will work when I will have another classes with i18n strings
