I played around with the logging module and found some things that are not quite clear to me. First of all, because it is a big programm I wanted the code to be as simple as possible, therefore use a json config file. }This json file is imported and used. It seems to work fine. Unfortuantely there are some problems. After finishing the code (still working on it) the logger does not close the file. And due to this in the next run he is appending the new run to the old log file. No possibility to delete it or truncate() without problems.Thus I wanted to remove the handlers writing the files. Unfortunately it seems like logger.handlers is empty, and thus I can not find them anywhere. Probably got an idea? Also the log files have a major problem. The logger is just appending everything new without starting a new line. Which ends up in an endless one-line log.main test programme:
The file is closed when the program exits, but the default mode for logfiles is 'a' (append). If you want to truncate the logfile on each run, specify "mode": "w" where you specify the "filename": "XXX.log".Not sure why newlines aren't in the logfile. You would need to post a small self-contained test script which exhibits the problem.
