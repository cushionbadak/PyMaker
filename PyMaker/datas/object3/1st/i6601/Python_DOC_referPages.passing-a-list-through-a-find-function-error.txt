I defined a function that allows me to find a specific character in a parameter and returns all subsequent characters. Example:This seems to execute without issue.  However, I am having a problem with my second function, which allows me to pass a list through the first function, compare, and return True or FalseThen, I define my list and variable1 to for function2 and print:I cannot seem to figure out what I've been doing wrong.  Something seems to be off wither how I am passing through the list, resulting in errors regarding split or find (I've tried both), and/or my comparison of Variable1 and parameter1.  I'm sure there's a small issue here that I keep getting tripped up on, but for the life of me I cannot figure it out.
You are mixing list and parameter1.Also, this function returns when the first item in list is checked. You can return True if one of items fits or False if nothing is fitting:
