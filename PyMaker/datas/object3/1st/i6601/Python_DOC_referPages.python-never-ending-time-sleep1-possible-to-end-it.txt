So I have been playing around with schedule and finally got it to work. I was too excited to relized that there came ANOTHER problem haha. However the issue is now that it doesn't end whenever the main is finished and I can't really find the solution. I know the issue sits on the row Time.sleep(1) because whenever I keyboardInterrput then there comes a error saying Time.sleep(1) was the "Issue" and I can't really find a soulution to end it. Im using a schedule from a github : Github schedule
You code is encapsulated in while loops with true as the argument. Either you did this by mistake or this is poor structure. This is the problem.If you don't want to remove the while loops then atleast add a break somewhere.If you need help structuring your code, go to Code Review.
You could use the for keyword. The for statement can define your iterations and the halting conditions. Or using the range() function to iterate over your numerical sequence. Being used to traditional if-then-else statements, the break statement will break you out of your while loop. It needs to be with your innermost for or while loop.  Your else clause needs to belong to your for loop and not part of the if statement.  And the continue statement will move your loop forward.
