I've been a reader only user for a long time now, and i'm thankful for all the questions answered by this big community.I have 2 related questions, one is about programming and the other one is about translating process.I want to develop a multilanguage application and with my little knowledge I've done the following in dialog.py:So lets say in main.py I can use:The first question, is there a way to do something like this without decorating and repeating the code for each one of the strings (this is not very pythonic)? The final goal is to have such a nice code in the main file, so it doesnt get messy.The second, I know little about app development, is this how I am supposed to work or there is a better way that I didnt find out? How do developers handle this situation?Thank you very much!
You seem to be trying very hard to create a class to hold data.  It's okay to just create a data structure to hold data.You could create key-value pairs for each language.  Save these in json files and use the language-key to read in the correct json file.  Deference the text with the key of a dictionary rather than the property of an object.
