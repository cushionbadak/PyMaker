Go like this:Where:Converts your list to int, and sum() adds up those integers.Another approach is using map():This also converts list1 into int and sums up the contents.Finally you can reduce() your list using the anonymous function lambda that adds up elements converted to int:
Just write single line of pythonic code to sum a list.
You can do it just in one linemap - this will map every element of list1 to int
Just Do :Your list is a list of strings, so here we are converting each element to int and than taking sum of it.
You are trying to sum a string and not a list of integer. You need to convert your list to a list of numbers and then you can sum then:
