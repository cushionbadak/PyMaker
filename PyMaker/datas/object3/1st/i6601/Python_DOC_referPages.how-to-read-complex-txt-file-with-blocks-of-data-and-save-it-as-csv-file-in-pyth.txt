If i have a file organized like thisAnd i want to put data in csv file with these columns: How do I do it in Python? Problem is, in some lists there is missing data, so i know some rows in csv file will end up all messed up, but i don't mind doing some manual work tweaking the database after i do this. Another problem is, country names vary, so i would need to use ++++++++++++++ as separator.I tried something like thisBut it doesn't work.ERROR: `Traceback (most recent call last):  File "test.py", line 22, in     csv.write(ITEMS)AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'write'`
In the very last line you wrote your file object "csv" instead of "CSV", that was the reason there was an error.I added the procedure on how to use the csv module within python to your code.All you have to do now is work on your parsing method.Code:Output:
When you save to csv file use csv.writer. But first you must prepare parser for structure of your listofdata.txt file and then you can save data to csv file. Alternatively, you can use csv.DictWriter but you must prepare parser first anyway.
