So this is my code right now: It works perfectly, but I need to get the output so that it goes two decimals after the integer and stops. For example, my current code's output is 1234.56789 and 3456.0, I need to get it to say 1234.57 and 3456.00 instead
You can use round:Example Usage:
simply round it like:output: 1234.57
