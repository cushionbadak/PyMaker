How could I generate all the 2 character combinations containing a-z characters and numbers.I believe there are 36^2 possibilities.Thank youSolution based on Rhosu's answer:
TryThis should give a list of all possible 36^2 two character strings using all letters and numbers.Edit: modified to use string.digits
itertools.product gives you the cartesian product of N iterables, which is exactly what you're looking for here. You could either do:Or use the convenience keyword argument repeat to productresult is now a itertools.product generator object that produces your result set. If you absolutely need that to be a literal list, you can cast it to list to convert.But unless you run over this set more than once, it's unlikely to be necessary.
Here is a solution without any imports (may not be the ideal solution),
The itertools library provides several tools to do this... If you really want combinations... try this...Which selects characters from the string abcdef123 two characters at a time.Modify your collection of input characters to suit your needs.
