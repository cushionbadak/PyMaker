So currently im trying to get a function right. Basically im trying to do a multiple (Concurrently) thread that takes information from a Json file into the program and then for every thread it should use each json object and then execute the code with those information.What I have done so far - This code is only for Multiprocess which indeed works.: Output:Which is great. But the issues is:That whenever I want to etc use those info EXEMPLEIs that it wont recognize those attributes but what I need to do is that I need to call them by item1.. item[2] etc from that order that is from def stringify(key, next_layer): which I don't know by now how to make it so I don't need to do it. The other problem is that whenever we say ETC that I use item1 in the code. Then it will only use the last thread and skip the rest. So if I do Then the only output that will come is the last one which is HelloSo the problems I need to get solved:1. To make each thread to execute concurrently and execute the code with those information2. Make a fix so I don't need to use item1 but to use instead item['Name'].So the question is, is this possible and what is the ideas about this?EDIT - This is the code i'm currently having with only one Json profile and that is working fine with just one profile. This is WITHOUT multiprocessingJson fileCodeEDIT I just wanted to print out what Yaroslav code gives for output
