I have a python dictionary, A sample configuration is as below:I want to print this dictionary, but while printing i want to mask password field in it. Print statement should return something like below:Is there a way to achieve it in python?
If what you want is to modify the behavior of the print function regarding your dictionary, you should create your own dictionary class, inherited from the default Python dict and then define your own __repr__ function.

I think you just want to print the items in your dictionary, rather than customise the dictionary class like others are suggesting. Something like this ought to do:
Here's a simple function that doesn't use external modules, that replaces the password field with *'s.
