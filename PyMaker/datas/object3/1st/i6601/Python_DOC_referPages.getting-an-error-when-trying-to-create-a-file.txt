I'm creating this program where you translate a DNA sequence from a file to RNA and then create a file with the RNA stored in it. I'm having this error,  
First, you have to define f in python before you try to write anything on it:where filename.txt is the name and format of your file and 'w' is called mode that we use for writing in files if you want to read a file you can use 'r' mode.You can read more at this link https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
