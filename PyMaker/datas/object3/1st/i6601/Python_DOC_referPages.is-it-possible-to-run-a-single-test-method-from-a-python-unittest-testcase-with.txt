Suppose I have the following TestCaseIs it possible for me to run TestSomething.test_a if I have a reference to that test? What I am looking to do is something like:I know that it's an awkward thing to do for normal unit testing. What I am trying to do is provide a test to be run as an argument to a function decorator. Essentially:And then in the decorator basically check if the test for that function passes before running the function.
OP clearly stated that the real world use case is more involved, but this still needs saying:Disclaimer: This is not a good, standard way to run unit tests. If you use this code to run unit tests, you're [probably] doing it wrong.That said, your question intrigued me, so I went ahead and wrote a working demo for you:gistThe introspection will be a little different in Python 2.See also: unittest.TestCase docs
