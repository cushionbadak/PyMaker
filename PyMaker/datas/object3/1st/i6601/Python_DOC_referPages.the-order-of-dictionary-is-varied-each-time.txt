The order of dictionary is varied each time although using OrderedDict.I wrote in views.py and I wrote in index.htmlVariable of i&j&k&l&m has result of json_data,but this dictionary of json_data is not the order.For example i has {'items': [{'---': '---', ‘A’: ‘a’, ‘B’: ‘b’, ‘C: ‘c’, ‘D’: ‘d’}]} but the order of drill down is b=>c=>d=>a.I want to show a =>b=>c=>d .I think this can be done by using OrderedDict() but it is wrong.How should i fix this?What should I write it?
All you've done is overwrite your parsed JSON with an OrderedDict object; that doesn't do anything useful at all.Instead, as the documentation shows, you can pass that class as the object_pairs_hook parameter:
Your idea is correct. Using OrderedDict will preserve the order of the items in the dictionary. However there is an error in your code:First you initialize json_data as OrderedDict, but in the second statement you override the variable and assign it the value of json_dict.Daniel Roseman was faster than me and gave you better answer, I'd just naively done this:
