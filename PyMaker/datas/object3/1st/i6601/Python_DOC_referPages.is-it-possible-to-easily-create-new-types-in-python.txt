I would like to know if there is an easy way to create 'custom' types in Python.I created a function that takes a parameter which is currently a MAC address. I would like to change it so it would be either an IP address or a MAC address then check the 'type' inside the function for further processing.In order to do so I can check with regexes but I wonder if I could define two types, ip_add and mac_add, and check my parameter's type before processing it.I read something about defining new types here but it's not straightforward at all. Maybe there's a particular package existing ?
The doc you link to in your question is for creating new types in C in the CPython runtime (the "interpreter") for C-coded extensions. Python has a much more straightforward way to create new types in Python module: classes.Defining a new class is as simple as:This being said, as AK47 rightly mentions, the netaddr package seems to already provide the features you're looking for.
