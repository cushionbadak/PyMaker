I have some files in the same directory which have the same extension(.html). Those files need to all be copied to another directory. I've looked up documentations on both shutil and os but couldn't find any proper answer... I have some pseudo codes as below:If anyone knows how to solve this, pls let me know. Appreciated!!
Some time ago I created this script for sorting files in a folder. try it.
[assuming python3, but should be similiar in 2.7]you can use listdir from os and copy from shutil:warning: this is scrapped together without testing. corrections welcomeedit (cause i can't comment):@ryan9025 splitext is fromos.path, my bad.
I finally got an correct answer by myself with a combinations of all the replies.So if I have a python script in (a) directory, all the source files in (b) directory, and the destination is in (c) directory. Below is the correct code that should work, and it looks very neat as well.
