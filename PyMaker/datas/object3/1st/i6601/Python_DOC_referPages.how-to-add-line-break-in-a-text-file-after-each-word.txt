Natural Text
I have a text file with this contents "one two three four" and I want to create a new text file with one word for each line, like this: I came up with this code:It prints each word in new line, so my question how I can write these words in new file that have one word each line?
You're close to the proper answer but you need to split the line differently. for line in f already reads the file newline-by-newline. So just do a normal split to break the line using whitespace characters. This will usually split text files into words successfully.You can handle multiple files in a with statement, which is very convenient for scripts like yours. Writing to a file is a lot like print with a few small differences. write is straightforward, but doesn't do newlines automatically. There's a couple other ways to write data to a file and seek through it, and I highly recommend you learn a bit more about them by reading the docs.Below is your code with the changes applied. Be sure to take a look and understand why the changes were needed:
