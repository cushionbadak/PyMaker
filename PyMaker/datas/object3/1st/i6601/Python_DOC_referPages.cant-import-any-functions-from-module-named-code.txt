I created a module named code: code.py and wrote a simple function:I tried dropping this file inside site-packages and when I run:I get the following error: AttributeError: module 'code' has no attribute 'main'.Interestingly enough, if I rename the module to foo.py, this code works just fine:Code isn't a reserved word so why can't I name a module code?
code is a Python module already, that is what is being imported, not your file
