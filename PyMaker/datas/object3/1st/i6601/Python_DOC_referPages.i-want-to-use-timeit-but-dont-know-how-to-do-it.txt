First, I'm still really new to Python. I've seen some examples that use %timeit and it looks really useful for doing some optimization work. The problem is, I haven't found how to actually get started with it. It looks like there's some similar ways to do this and I found some Python 2.7 examples too. Okay, so here's some easy points for a Python Guru out there.I'm using Python 3.6.What do I need to import? Either import syntax is fine.It looks like I can use %timeit on loops and some other constructs. Can they be used on "def" too? I'm fine if you drop me a link and say "rtfm", it will at least get me going in the right direction.Thanks!
%timeit is ipython magic; you can only use it by installing IPython and using it as your interactive interpreter instead of plain python. It's built on top of the timeit module's timeit.repeat (possibly reimplemented; it does some extra work to make the results more useful to humans at a glance), which you can use in regular Python, but %timeit's convenience requires ipython.
