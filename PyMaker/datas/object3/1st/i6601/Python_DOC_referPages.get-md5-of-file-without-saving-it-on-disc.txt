I am using pillow to edit image, after editing I use method save and next count md5 on saved file. Saving file takes 0.012s, for me is too long. Is any way to count md5 on Image object with out saving to file?
Here's a quick demo of using a BytesIO object to get the MD5 checksum of the file data without having to save the file to disk.outputIf we un-comment img.save('red.png') and then pass 'red.png' to a standard MD5sum program, we get the same result.
