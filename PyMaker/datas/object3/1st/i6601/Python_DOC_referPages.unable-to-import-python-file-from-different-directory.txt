I have the following folder hierarchy.I simply want to import apriltag.py into my Jupyter Notebook. I tried doing it this way..However, when I try to access a class from apriltag, like so:I get the following error:Suggesting that the module was not imported correctly. I've tried creating __init__.py at the root of the python directory as well but the same thing occurred.
Ok, I'm going to buzz in a little bit early.  I may have the solution to your problem.  If I don't, we can go back to figuring it out.As you've probably seen, the docs say The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, Now, you're running my_notebook.ipynb, so it's directory is the very beginning of the search path.  And you probably have an __init__.py file in the apriltag directory that's at the same level.  As such, it's being found as a module, and loaded.  And there are no .py files in that "module", and nothing in your __init__.py there, so it's loading as an empty module.Instead, don't try modifying the sys.path directory, just make empty __init__.py files in both the apriltag and the python directories.Then, you should be able to do the following:The apriltag that gets imported should be the one you need.  (And dir(apriltag) will give you much nicer results.)Generally, I always set up all my code in directories with empty __init__.py and invoke them all with the from syntax.  It made modules a lot easier to handle.
