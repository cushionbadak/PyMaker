Natural Text
I need to count the number of characters in a given file. The problem is, I am not splitting the file properly. If my input file has content "The! dog-ate #####the,cat", I don't need the special characters in the output.o/p: t:4 h:2 e:3 !:1 d:1 o:1 g:1 -:1 #:5.... Also, I need to remove the "-" sign and make sure that the word does not concatenate.Could someone please help me with this ?
