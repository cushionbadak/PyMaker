Lets say I have a method method1() which has a blocking HTTP request using urllib.Say if this HTTP request doesn't return within 3 seconds I want to stop this and return a different method's value, say method2(). How can this be done? 
You can mention the timeout for your urllib request in the optional parameter timeout.Where you can pass the time value in the timeout parameter, you can do other functions according to the data you get.
