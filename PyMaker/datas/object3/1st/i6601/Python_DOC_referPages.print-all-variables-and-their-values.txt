This question already has an answer here:'too many values to unpack', iterating over a dict. key=>string, value=>list                    8 answers                This question has been asked quite a bit, and I've tried each solution I come across, but haven't had any success. I'm trying to print out every variable and its value using the following two lines.This gives an error: Too many values to unpackWhen I run: I only get the names of the variables. Any help would be appreciated. 
globals() returns a dict - so, to iterate through a dict's key/value pairs, you call it's items() method:This is explained within the docs for Data Structures, available here!Python 3 version:if we do not copy the output globals functions then there will be RuntimeError.Also if there are list and dictionaries in the output of some variable then use deepcopy() instead of copy()
