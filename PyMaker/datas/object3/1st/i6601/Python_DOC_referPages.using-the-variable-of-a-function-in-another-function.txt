I have the following functions to calculate two different things:In the first function, I calculate the variable X and in the second I find Z based on X and plot its histogram. I am not able to understand how I can pass the variable X to the second function. I am running following for the first function:and this for the second:I am also aware I can use some packages to make these things (LCM random generation and exp distr), however, I wanted to make something to practice.
Since you are returning the X values from the first function you could pass them to the second function as follows:You just need to add an argument to exponential for the X values.
You need to pass the value returned from the LCM function into a variable so you do-And then you pass the value of x as an argument into the exponential function as - Another way is you can declare a global variable X=[ ] outside both your function and you can use them in both of your functions. Without passing it as an argument in the second.
You can use a global variable in other functions by declaring it as global in each function that assigns to it:and expect 1. Instead, you need do declare that you intend to use the global x:I hope it will help you. Or at least get you closer to solution.
