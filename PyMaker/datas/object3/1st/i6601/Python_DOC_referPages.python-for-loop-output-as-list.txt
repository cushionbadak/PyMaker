I need to get some calculations for a range of elements at an array.So, at my views.py my code is:and, when I print calc1, for example, my output returns and,  my output has to be like thisI've already tried to do something likebut it gives me Somebody could help me, please? Thank you.
Since you need your values output as a list, I would recommend using a list comprehension rather than a for loop, if possible. It is faster and easier to read, and it should produce the results you want. For example, if the values you need printed are stored in array, I would use the following code:[str(x) for x in array]By using hard brackets around your code, each value is compiled into a list following evaluation as a string value.Hope this proves helpful for you.
Using enumerate() returns tuples that contain indexes into the array along with their values (0,'item1') (1,'item2') etc. But given your interest in 'x', I'm going to assume that your input is actually a dictionary and you are interested in a list of keys ('key1','item1') ('key2','item2') etc.If you're in Python3, use items() on the dictionary to get an iterator over the sequence. And use a looping shortcut for key,value to immediately extract the key and a value for each item as the loop progresses.Then using list comprehensions you can build the final list in one line:If you don't need the value parts and just the keys, you can simplify to
