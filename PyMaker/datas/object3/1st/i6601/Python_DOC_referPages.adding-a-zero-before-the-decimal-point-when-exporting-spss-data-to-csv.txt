Is there a way to export data from SPSS to CSV including a zero before the decimal point?Currently, I have ".41" and I would like to export "0.41" into my CSV file.Any suggestion?
It seems difficult to do it directly in SPSS. One possible answer: using python + pandas.More info about the "g" formatting: Format Specification Mini-Language.And be careful with the floating point problem (e.g., see the answer to this question)
