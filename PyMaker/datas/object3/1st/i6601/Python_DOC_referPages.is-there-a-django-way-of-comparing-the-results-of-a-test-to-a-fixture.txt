I'm trying to understand fixtures and unit tests in Django. I can successfully load a fixture and use the data in my unit test.What I want to do is compare the results of the test to a second fixture, fixture_2, which represents how the data should look.Here's a step-by-step of what I am talking about:Import fixture_1, generating the initial test data.Run the test on the data, changing it.Somehow compare the results of the test to fixture_2.Is there a way to do step 3?
