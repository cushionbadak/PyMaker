I have a python dictionary in a file in a format like this:(dp0   S'Test'   p1   S'Test1'   p2   sS'Test2'   p3   S'Test2'   p4   sS'Starspy'   p5   S'SHSN4N'   p6   s.see:Save a dictionary to a file (alternative to pickle) in Python?and I want to read it back.According to the question in the link, this has been created saving it with pickle. But, when I try to save a dictionary with pickle the format that I obtain does not correspond.For example, the code:produces a file with the content€}q (X   aqKX   bqKX   cqKu.I can read it back OK, but it has not the format of my file (that correspond to a nested dictionary). So, I have two questions:First, how can I write a file with the format ... (dp0S'Test'p1S'Test1'p2sS'Test2'p3S'Test2'p4sS'Starspy'p5S'SHSN4N'p6s.?Second, how can I read a file with that format? 
If you want readable dictionaries then go with json it built into python and the output is pretty much like a dictionary.
The question is answered in the pickle module documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#data-stream-formatThere are currently 3 different protocols which can be used for  pickling.Protocol version 0 is the original ASCII protocol and is backwards  compatible with earlier versions of Python.Protocol version 1 is the  old binary format which is also compatible with earlier versions of  Python. Protocol version 2 was introduced in Python 2.3. It provides  much more efficient pickling of new-style classes.Whatever you show in the beginning, it the protocol version 0, and is the default. In the end — the binary protocol versions 1 or 2.Just specify the protocol version number:PS: Why not just use a readable format, e.g. json?
The issue I have was a problem of version. I was using version 3 and it works with version 2. In thar case I can create a file with the format I have in the file I want to read, and I can now read it. Thank you very much!!!
