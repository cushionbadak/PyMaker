Natural Text
The purpose of the code is best explained below, for example if I were to enter 'hello' then 'luck' then 'liar' the proper outputs should be '5' 'eouia' 3' and 'ckr'. When I do this however it keeps prompting me for more inputs after entering 'liar'. 
I'd keep a set of the all the required vowels and subtract all the letters you input until the set is empty:
You can use list comprehensions to get the vowels and return the len.CodeTrailing consonants could be found via takewhile of each reversed word.DetailsNote, takewhile grabs all consonants before the first observed vowel.  By reversing each word, we get the trailing consonants.
