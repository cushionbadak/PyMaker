Why is the third split of 'Error on the field:' not being picked up in the initial split of pieces, but is picked up when you split pieces[4]?
positional arguments of re.split are:regexstringmaxsplit (default value: unlimited)flags (default value: no flags)split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)you're passing re.IGNORECASE (the value of the flag is 2) as maxsplit argument (as postional) which explains the strange effect. It works to some point then it stops the splits as instructed after 2 splits.Just do flags=re.IGNORECASE (keyword, not positional) instead and it works.In re.compile you can pass that flag as positional safely: compile(pattern, flags=0), and that's true for re.match and re.search as well, but not for re.split & re.sub, so it's an easy trap to fall into. When in doubt, always use pass-by-keyword for optional arguments.
You need to state to use flags explicitly by using flags= when using re.split:Output:N.B. re.I is the same as re.IGNORECASE
