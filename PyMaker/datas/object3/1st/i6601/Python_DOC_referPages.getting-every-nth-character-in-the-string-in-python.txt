Natural Text
I have the following function but it doesn't give me the intended result:
str.index() finds the first match for your letter. If you have a letter that appears more than once, that'll give you the wrong index. For any given character, you only test if their first occurrence in the string is at a n'th position.To demonstrate, take a look at the string 'hello world' with the character indices (I used . to mark the space):For the letter l, text.index('l') will return 2, so it'll only be included in the output if n is 1 or 2. It doesn't matter that l also appears at index 3 or 9, because you only ever test 2 % n == 0. The same applies for 'o' (positions 4 and 7), only 4 % n == 0 is tested for either.You could use the enumerate() function to give you a running index:Now index is correct for every letter, repeated or not.However, it'll be much easier to use slicing:This takes every n'th letter too:
If somebody asked me to give every nth character in a string, I wouldn't include the first character. I would rather do something like below:This would yield these results:123456789012345678901234567890123456789024680246802468024680369258147036900000
Hope this will help.!
Using Python's slicing syntax:Python's slicing syntax is much like the range() function. It accepts a start, stop and step value:string[start : stop : step]where you can leave any of the parameters blank and they will default to 0, the length of the string and 1 respectively.This means you can do:string[::n]to get a string's every nth characterter.So you can write the function as:Hope this does what you want!
The problem with the code is everytime the index of same repeated letter will give same result.For example 'Hello World!'.index('o') will be always 4 so it will not give intended result.The best way is to enumerate the for loop. so you will get appropriate index.You should also remember array starts with 0 not 1.
