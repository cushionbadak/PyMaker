I've plotted a curve along the width of an array, of the sum of the array columns:The commented-out function is my attempt at numerically computing the derivative of the curve, but I get aThe questions here and here aren't quite what I'm trying to solve. How can I fix my little function to plot the derivative? Or is there a built-in function to do it? All of the built-ins (such as scipy.misc.derivative I've found depend on knowing the function you're differentiating.
In Python v3.x range() creates a range object instead of a list.  Apparently range objects don't support arithmetic. Try using a numpy ndarray instead.
