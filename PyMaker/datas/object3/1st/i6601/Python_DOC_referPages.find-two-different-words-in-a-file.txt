Here's a regex that does what you want. I added an extra entry to the data so we can see that the regex correctly handles an entry that doesn't fit the pattern you're looking for.The key is to specify the multiline mode flag (with re.M), and to use non-greedy matching (with *?).outputBTW,doesn't do what you want: it will return from the function on the first iteration. I suggest that you simply return the whole list that .findall finds. Or you could make the function into a generator that yields each found item, one by one.
