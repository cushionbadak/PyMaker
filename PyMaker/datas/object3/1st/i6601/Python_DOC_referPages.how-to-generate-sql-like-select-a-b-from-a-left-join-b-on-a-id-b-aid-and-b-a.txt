I have a database "News" created via SQLAlchemy: I also have a function f(title), that gets a string and returns one of 3 variants of strings: 'good', 'maybe' or 'never'. I try to get filtered rows:But program fails, raising this error:How can I resolve it? 
The problem is this:Python does not allow overriding the behaviour of boolean operations and and or. You can influence them to some extent with __bool__ in Python 3 and __nonzero__ in Python 2, but all that does is that it defines the truth value of your object.If the objects in question had not implemented __bool__ and thrown the error, or the implementation had not thrown, you would've gotten possibly rather cryptic errors due to the short-circuiting nature of and and or:becauseThis could and would lead to hair pulling in the form of incorrect SQL expressions:To produce boolean SQL expressions either use the and_(), or_(), and not_() sql expression functions, or the binary &, |, and ~ operator overloads:oror pass multiple criterion to a call to Query.filter():or combine multiple calls to filter():
