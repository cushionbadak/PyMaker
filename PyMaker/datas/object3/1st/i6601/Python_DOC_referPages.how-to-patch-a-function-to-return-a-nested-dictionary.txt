Natural Text
I am trying to patch a function to return a nested dictionary like so:This fails, as when accessing the dictionary, the code just finds MogicMock functions e.g. <MagicMock name='client().create_platform_endpoint().__getitem__()' id='4619515160'> or <MagicMock name='client().get_endpoint_attributes().__getitem__().__getitem__()()' id='4424507800'>I guess I could mock these __getitem__() calls, but is there a more elegant solution than pretending to be a dictionary?
Assuming that create_platform_endpoint and get_endpoint_attributes are methods of the class boto3.client, this might work for you:Assuming that create_platform_endpoint and get_endpoint_attributes are attributes of the method boto3.client, this might work for you:Check out the documentation for patch here.Few other pointers:If you have something like this in your class:And now if you want the dictionary returned from Foo().bar() to be patched with some other return value, then this can help you:If you want to mock the value Foo().bar().value, then try to mock the client method itself
