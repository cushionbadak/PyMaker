Entering py -3.4 -m pip install pygame in the command-line is the least error prone way to install pygame on Windows (replace 3.4 by your specific Python version).

But using the Python launcher py -3 or py -3.4 and running pip as a module -m pip usually works.
First install pipAdd your python C:\Pythonx\Scripts to the system paththen run
