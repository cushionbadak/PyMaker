This question already has an answer here:Print without space in python 3                    3 answers                Simple question but cannot find a simple solution. If I have this code:It prints:How do I get rid of the space between FavColour and the comma , as I want my work to be grammatically correct. If I remove the commas, it becomes a syntax error.
Either construct the entire string instead of passing pieces to print():or use print()'s sep argument to change the spaces to nothing:
Try:
You can combine Strings using the '+' sign, this way it will not print out an extra space. But if you are trying to print out a number/decimal you might have to cast it to a string using str(number/decimal) to convert it into a string. If this doesn't work let me know, I'm kind of rusty on Python.
