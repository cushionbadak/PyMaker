Suppose I have a dictionary here:and each value on the list is from a specific period of time. (i.e. 100 for AAPL stock, 100.03 for GOOGL stock is the value for period 1, 100.3 for AAPL stock, 150.22 for SSNLF stock is period 2 and so on).So here I am creating a function that will help me find the maximum stock price at a certain period of time.My goal is to input periods such that the function looks maximum([periods]) in order to find the maximum stock price at that period of time. Expected result example should look like:maximum([0, 1])[100.89, 200.11]this shows 100.89 is the highest price in period 1 among all stocks and 200.11 is the highest price in period 2. 
You can use dict.values to iterate dictionary values. Get period values of out of the value using list comprehension / generator expression; Use max to get maximum value:
I believe you are looking for something like this:Output:By using *args, you can specify as many columns as you want:Output:
