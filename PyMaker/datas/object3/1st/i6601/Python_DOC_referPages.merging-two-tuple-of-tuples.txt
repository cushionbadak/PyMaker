I have two tuples a = (('1',), ('2',))and b = (('3',), ('4',))I need an output likeI have tried converting the tuples into a list and used zip to merge into a single tuple tuple(zip(list(a), list(b))) and also tuple(zip(a,b)) which yields ((('1',), ('3',)), (('2',), ('4',))) as the result. What should I be doing to get the desired result? I saw about immutability of tuples but I am getting the tuples from another service and I all I can do is to convert the obtained tuple to a list to get the expected output.
Zipping is the right approach, but you then have to flatten your paired tuples still; you could concatenate them:Alternatively, flatten your a and b tuples before zipping:Flattening can also be done with itertools.chain(), which is perhaps more readable:Demo:
Something like this maybe?
