Natural Text
I have the following working code in python But it doesn't work without "%s". What is the purpose of "%s" here?
%s is a placeholder for a string. It uses the same syntax as "".format(), to provide the URL to the browser program. This isn't a documented usage of webbrowser.get, and it seems to be doing approximately os.system("C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe %s".format("http://google.com"))I would suggest webbrowser.get('chrome').open("http://google.com") is simpler and more portable, or the even more portable webbrowser.open("http://google.com"), if you want to respect your user's choice of preferred browser.
