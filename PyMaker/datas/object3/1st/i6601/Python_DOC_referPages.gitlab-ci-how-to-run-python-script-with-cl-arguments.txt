I want to run a python script, which expects cl arguments, before the actual build, so I added the following piece in .gitlab-ci.yml:but I am getting the following error:If the arguments are just strings (i.e. not variables), then it works fine, but it does not read the variables $arg1 etc.In the gitlab docs it is mentioned, that I can use the bash syntax to supply variables, so $arg1 must the correct reference.I use argparse in the script to get the cl arguments.What is the correct way to call the variables in gitlab-ci.yml as the python script arguments?
Your variables is a list, but it requires a dictionary. Just remove the - from it.More about yaml syntax
