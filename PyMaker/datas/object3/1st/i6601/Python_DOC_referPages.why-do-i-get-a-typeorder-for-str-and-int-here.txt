This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                My assignment is:Write a program to fetch employee  name and the salary.  Calculate the  Federal tax and state tax based on the following criteria:   If the  salary is greater than 100000 then calculate the federal tax at 20%  otherwise calculate the federal tax at 15%   Calculate the state tax  at 5%   Calculate the net salary of the employee. To calculate the net  salary, subtract federal and state tax from the gross salary.My code:The output:
