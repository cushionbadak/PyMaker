Natural Text
I have a .txt file with coordinates and earthquake magnitudes. I need to extract only 3 of the columns (latitude, longitude and magnitude) but the loadtxt in numpy module is not working. I wanted to convert the txt file into a csv file to see if I can extract the data I need... Here is what I have now. It returns a .csv file with each character printed as a separate row. Here are a few lines of the .txt file:And here are a few lines of the .csv file my code creates:How can I get it to separate each element with a comma! 
You're not extracting the first 3 columns like you should. I'd recommend iterating over each line in the input, and concurrently writing to the out-file. You can use the with...as context manager to make this easy.What's more, you should write your output to a separate file, with a different name.
You should add quoting to the csv.reader. I don't know why but for the first time when I was reading file via csv module the same occurred to me after adding the quoting to the csv.reader all is goodWorked for me try experimenting with it check the man page for csv library
