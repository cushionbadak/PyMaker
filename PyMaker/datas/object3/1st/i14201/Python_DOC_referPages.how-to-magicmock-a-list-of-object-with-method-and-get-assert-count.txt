I am new to unit testing in python with MagicMock. I have the following code to assert the correct method count in python: I wish to perform an assertion call count of the method shooMethod() in my unit test code to see if for N objects in booObjectList it performs N calls. The above function is not my unit test code. It is a method to be tested by creating a new method test_methodFoo() in my unit test class. How do I go about it? Thanks for you help.
Mock objects have an attribute called that tracks whether a Mock has been called, and an attribute call_count that tracks how many times they were called.Note however that you can't do something like:since o is a new object each time.
As Adam Smith has already answered your question, just a personal advice - I too faced lot of issues working with mock library when I started doing mocking. Besides python-mock does not works for other teating clients like pytest etc. So I recommend you to use fudge library. It is more pythonic and works with all testing clients.
