I want to loop through a list of strings...eg: I want to loop through the list items and search for the location of 'Hello!' within the string in each case an record its location.Any ideas?
Use a list comprehension to collect the indexes of your wanted string:Note how the negative 1 shows that the final string does not contain the value you're looking for.
Use the string.find method.
You could try list comprehensions[(s, s.lower().index('hello')) for s in list_of_strings if s.lower() == 'hello']
Using a comprehension list, loop over the list and check if the string has the Hello! string inside, if yes, append the position to the matches list.Note: The enumerate build in brings you the index for each element in the list.
in case you are searching for multiple items in a list say Hello and namefind = lambda searchList, elem: [[i for i, x in enumerate(searchList) if x == e] for e in elem]find(list_of_strings,['Hello','name'])output is a list with the positions of the elements you are searching for in the order that you listed them
