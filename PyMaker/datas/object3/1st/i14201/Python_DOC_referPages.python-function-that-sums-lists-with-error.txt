x = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]]print(somalist(x))is that the function, it works doing the sum of each sublist but it preserves the the index [0], [1], [2] and [3] and sum the anothers. In this example I will use the list x, in this list the function works correctly. The exit of the program is:[1, 2, 3, 4, 32, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 22]is what I've said it preserves the members [0],[1],[2],[3] and sum the other indices of each sublist.But when we use some number more than once, it fails.using:X = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,**6**,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]]the 6 (index 4) in second sublist was writen twice (the another at the index 5 at the same sublist)the exit was :[1, 2, 3, 4, **22**, 12, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33]It's wrong!The correct exit should be: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33]Can someone tell me where my code is wrong?
I would recommend ditching the index() approach entirely.This works on lists with repeated elements.
