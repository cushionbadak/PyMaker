I want to know how can I remove consecutive value in list or string.If my list is:I should get:
You can use list comprehensions
you can use groupby from itertoolsPerformance
Using map, filter and zip is very instructive:

1. The List ProblemYou can do that using Python's built-in reduce function, with assumption that you have at least one element in your list:So what you basically do here is initialise a new list containing the first element of your original list. Then using reduce you iterate over the rest of the elements one-by-one and apply the function supplied to reduce. Wht that function does, is simply check, whether the current element is equal to the last element of the aggregated one. If it is equal, it ignores the current element, by returning just the aggregated list, otherwise, it appends it to the aggregated list and returns.2. The Brackets ProblemAs for your brackets problem, you can use the filter built-in function, with a help of custom stack handling in a classic way:where escaped is defined in the following way:
