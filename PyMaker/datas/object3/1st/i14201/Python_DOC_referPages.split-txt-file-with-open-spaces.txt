Natural Text
I'm trying to split a text file in Python but I get the following error:My code:the format of the text file isbut some lines are missing numbers or letters, for exampleSo I guess that is why I get the error, but I can't find a way to resolve it.Is it possible to also count the blank spaces as a variable?
And then just check for the special value '_' that signalizes a missing value.
This answer assumes the lines are missing fields, @Poke's answer assumes the fields have been replaced with a space (leaving three spaces between the other fields).The docs on .split() tell you everything you need to know.If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns [].So simply specify sep=' ' in your call to .split(), i.e.:So that the separator is exactly one space.
Assuming the number of spaces between each character is only 1 , and an extra whitespace in between indicates an empty variable. I think your best bet would be to not use line.split() function , instead move over each character in the line and determine the values you need.A code like this -Then you can unpack the list from whereever you are calling the above function
