This question already has an answer here:Eval not working on multi-line string                    1 answer                Can eval() in python be used in this way or is there anything I'm missing . 
eval is used only for expressions. From the documentationThe expression argument is parsed and evaluated as a Python expressionUse exec hereHowever do note that both the statements are quite risky to use. (See eval really is dangerous)
