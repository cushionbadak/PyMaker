I was looking at the online doc for round() function in python, which says,round(number[, ndigits])....The return value is an integer if called with one argument, otherwise of the same type as number.So, I wrote the below code.Let me explain the last two prints I used in above snippet.The second print is through trial-and-error method. (Today is my Day 1 for Python)The third print is added referring to this answer.Surprisingly, the current output isx is now :  33.0<type 'float'> floatI was expectingx is now :  33<type 'int'> intI'm out of ideas. What am I missing?P.S. For anybody interested, a LIVE VERSION
In python 2.x, round always returns a float. Judging by the syntax of your print statements, you're on python 2.x.
Instead of using round...!try this because round function is to round-off the float values..However round and type-casting to int both do same work @ backgroundHope this helps..!!or
