Natural Text
I would like to create different if statements based on the order of content in a string.So if "Long" comes before "Short" in string do x.Or if "Short" comes before "Long" in string do y.Note that string does not necessarily have to contain both "Long" and "Short". It can contain just one of them, or none.Currently I use the code below to do different things if there is one of "Long" or "Short". But if both are present, I would like to set length to the one occurring first.
Use str.index and EAFP
use string.find to get the index of a substring. It will return -1 if not present.
Here is a generic solution, utilising .find() that will return the first sub-string that is matched from a list of n sub-strings, rather than simply n=2 i.e.'Long' or 'Short', this solution can be extended to any number of possible sub-stringsTwo-Line Generic SolutionMore Informative FunctionTakes s as the string to search across and sLst as a list of substrings to search for.It returns the the first subS that is found in s, from sLst or None if none are found.Example
