I just started to learn Python and I am confused in its syntax.I am not sure what square brackets around the variable word mean... I understand word should be our value and prev is a key.I also do not understand this expressionNeed your help to clarify this.I checked out documentation for python dictionary, but it was not much of help.Sorry for such a basic question, but I really could not figure it out by googling. 
[word] is a list containing a single element, the value of the word variable.+ can be used to concatenate two lists. This adds word to the list returned by mimic_dict.get(prev, []).And what does mimic_dict.get(prev, []) do? It is the same as mimic_dict[prev], but if the key prev doesn't exist then it returns a default value of [] (an empty list). It ensures you always get a list back whether or not the key exists.
