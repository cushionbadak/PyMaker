I have an array of zeros and ones like [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]. How to write a program to save neighboring 0's and 1's in different arrays.E.g.[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1] giving [0,0,0],[1,1,1],[0,0,0],[1,1].
You can group them with itertools.groupby, like thisThe result of groupby, will be a tuple of actual item and an iterator which gives the grouped items. We just convert the grouped items to a list, with list(group).As per the comments,Create a generator which will give the values multiplied,Now, group based on the result of calling bool on each of the numbers. So, if the bool is called on 0, it will give False, otherwise True.
