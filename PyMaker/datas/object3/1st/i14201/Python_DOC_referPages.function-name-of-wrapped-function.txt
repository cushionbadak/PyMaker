This question already has an answer here:What does functools.wraps do?                    6 answers                How can I get the name of the original function?result: wrapped_f, but I need A!
Use functools.wraps():Straight from the docs:Without the use of this decorator factory, the name of the example function would have been 'wrapper', and the docstring of the original example() would have been lost.Example:Output:
Use functools.wraps or update wrapped_f's __name__ attribute manually.
