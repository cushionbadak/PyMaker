Natural Text
I have got a number of inner dictionaries, my logic is off somewhat as my output is close to what I want to accomplish but not quite there yet.  I would like to concatenate the values of two variables from inner dictionaries.While in the loops my variables print correctly, but when I use another variable to concatenate both, I receive only a few values.  This data is coming from a JSON structure.Code:Output for BulkyItemInfo:Output for Quantity and Type when printed in respective loopsJson Example:Desired output from above json
I am not sure exactly what you need but this code gives the desired output from the given json string:Note that I chose to store everything in a string before printing it. It is not necessary but it is a straightforward way to get the desired output.
