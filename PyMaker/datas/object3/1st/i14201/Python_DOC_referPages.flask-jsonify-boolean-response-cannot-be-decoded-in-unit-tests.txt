I am performing tests on my Flask application and I am expecting a json response built with jsonify. I use the ast library to decode the response. But I am getting the following error:My test function is as follows:And the application's function is:Jsonify is sending the following response:But ast does not recognize the lower case true as Boolean. Hence, it raises a ValueError. Any idea how to transform jsonify's response into a Dict that maintains the Boolean value so I can perform the Boolean assertion?
Don't use literal_eval to load JSON.  Ever.Use Flask's JSON decoder, or the app-specific decoder.Or if you're not using Flask, and need to load JSON, use the built-in module.
