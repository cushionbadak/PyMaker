I want to generate a one-line string from an Exception which tells me what happened where (don't need a full backtrace). The following information would be nice:filename / linenumberexception typeexception description (what you get from str(e))nice to have: function/method/classCurrently I do the following:which gives me:Is there a more elegant way to print out the details given in this example? I'm thinking about s.th. likeI'd like to avoid importing extra modules except there is one exactly for this purpose. 
I think traceback.format_exception_only does exactly what you want.
