Python 3.4 seemingly randomly decides whether it returns the real or complex root of a number using the ** operator:  Is there a way to ensure you get the real root when cube rooting rather than one of the complex ones?
In the second case actually the cube root is getting evaluated first then the minus sign is getting applied, hence the real root.That is -1636.281**(1/3) becomes -(1636.281**(1/3)) . And you can use a similar logic to get the real cubic roots as well.But actually, when doing cubic root of negative numbers you always get complex numbers in python.If you want real numbers you can add code like -
