Natural Text
I am trying to check to see if a user's input only contains letters. Other forums seem like the 'isalpha' function seems to be what I'm looking for, yet when I use it in my code and run it, an error appears saying AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'isalpha'.This is my code: I don't understand where I'm going wrong.
As most people in the comment have mentioned that tool you have online does not work properly and you should stay away from it.From the website you provided:This is a simple online Python interpreter, built using the Skulpt  engine (slightly modified by kwalsh).Put your Python code below (copy-and-paste or just type it in  directly), then click run.Note: this isn't a complete version of Python. See below.If you must use an online interpreter, you might try out the engine that is provided by your school (Skulpt).But I highly recommend you get python installed onto your laptop, you're less likely to run through any errors.
