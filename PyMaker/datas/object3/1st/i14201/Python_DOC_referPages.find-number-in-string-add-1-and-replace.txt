Natural Text
I need to write a code where a string contains a number, then this number is incremented by 1, and then printed out within the initial string input. It should work like thisso far I have this, but I know it is wrong and honestly I don't know how to do this.
Possible error in your code is: you are trying to replace with int type data in the string directly.Also only checking numbers.isdigit() will modify all numbers irrespective of what you specified to modify.Possible corrections to your code to make it run properly:You can also change your incrementNumbers(statement) function to: which I think is better than to use a for loop.
You can use re.sub hereAnother ExampleAnd you can define your function likeHowever I advice that you have a validation functionThis will prevent the user from entering values outside your range
Under your requirements that the numeric value must be between 0 and 8, you can use string.replace
