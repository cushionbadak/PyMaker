There is a way to make a scrolling menu in python-curses?I have a list of records that I got from a query in sqlite3 and I have to show them in a box but they are more than the max number of rows: can I make a little menu to show them all without making curses crashing?
This code allows you to create a little menu in a box from a list of strings. You can also use this code getting the list of strings from a sqlite query or from a csv file. To edit the max number of rows of the menu you just have to edit max_row. If you press enter the program will print the selected string value and its position.
To make a scrollable widget that can scroll through text that is larger than a screenful you will need to use curses.newpad You can find a simple example here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2523020/9205341 And the Python 3/Python 2 docs there.
