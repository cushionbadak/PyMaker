I have the following string I just want to get this :So I'm trying to use sub() from with a negate regex like this :But I don't succeed in.What is the best way to remove punctuations ?Thanks
Try something like this:The rstrip is there to get rid of the trailing whitespace left after getting rid of the question mark.Of course, this is only if you really want to use regex.  Any of the ways in the question that @f43d65 linked will probably work fine and likely be faster as well.
The best way to remove punctuation doesn't use regular expressions.Here are the Python3 docs for str.maketrans and str.translateHere are the Python2 docs for string.maketrans (not used here) and str.translateUsing regular expressions to do string translation is a bit like using a backhoe when a prybar would do. It's huge, unwieldy, and likely to foul things up if you don't do it juuuust right.
Assuming you only want to remove the last punctuation and it's a question mark:/[\?]$/That's saying remove anything in the brackets that's at the end of a string.
