Let's say I have this file:I want this output:Been trying in bash and got to a kind of close solution but I don't know how to carry this out on Python.Thank you in advance
If you want to remove the extea lines :For this aim you can check 2 condition for each like one if the line don't followed by an empty  new line, or line should precede by a line that match with following regex ^\d{2}:\d{2},\d{3}\s$.So for access to next line in each iteration you can create one file object from your main file object with the name temp using itertools.tee and apply the next function on it. and use re.match to match the regex.result :If you want to concatenate the rest to third line :And if you want to concatenate the rest lines after third line to third line you can use following regex to find all blocks that followed by \n\n or the end of file ($) :then split your blocks based on the line that in in a date format and write the parts to your output file, but note that you need to replace the new lines within 3rd part with space  :ex.txt:Demo :result :Note :In this answer the splitter function returns a generator that is very efficient when you are dealing with huge files and refuse of storing unusable lines in memory.
This works well if and only if the file as per your given sampleNote:There may be a faster way if  regex is used and it might also be simpler but wanted to do it in a logical wayCode:Input:output:
You can use re.sub with your own custom replacement feature.
