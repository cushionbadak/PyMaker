I'm dealing lately with concurrent.futures, I submitted several funcs in one executor , I'd like to know which future returns first.now is the main part, I'd like to know that when future_monitor ends , so I would terminate all other action futures.I've found on docs the following(https://docs.python.org/dev/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.as_completed):, so I can wait to return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED , but how can I assure that it's indeed the monitor future.tnx in Advance!
According to the documentation, the method wait returns two sets: done, not_done futures.Check if the future you want to check is in done set.
