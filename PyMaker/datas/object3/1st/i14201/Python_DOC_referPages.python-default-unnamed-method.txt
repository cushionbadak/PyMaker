As a matter of fact, every time you create a class object you are using a callable class (the class's metaclass) without realizing it. Usually we make a class this way: But you can also make a class this way: The type class is the metaclass of all Python classes. The class C is an instance of type. So now, when you instantiate an object of type C using C(), you are actually calling the type class. You can see this in action by replacing type with your own metaclass:
