This is the code I have:for the listen(), I have tried 0 and 1 but in both cases once one client connects, future clients will hang until the first connects. I would like any additional clients that attempt to connect to fail instead of waiting.  Presently, the only thing I can think of is to periodically check sock and    close any queued connections. Is there a better way?Thanks
This might sound trivial, but: Close the listening socket -- that will stop it from listening!
Use it as a context manager to automatically close it after use.
