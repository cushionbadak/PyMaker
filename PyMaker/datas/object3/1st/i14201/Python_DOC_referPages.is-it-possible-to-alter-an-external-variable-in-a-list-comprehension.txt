For example, you could call list.append to modify a different list, e.g.But this is very rarely useful, and most of the times ends up in a more confusing expression. Itâ€™s far more recommended to just split it up to a standard for loop then; this also avoids the overhead of the generated list.

Therefore, your code produces a syntax error.What you can do instead, if you are just interested in n:If you are just interested in i, go with @poke's answer:That said, expressions don't have to be side-effect-free.  If you want both i and n, you can do this:
