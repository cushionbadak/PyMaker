Natural Text
I'm trying to open a text file with a dynamic path. How could I make it work something like this?:date, month, and week are the current date, month, and week.
You can use str.format:I suggest you finish the Python tutorial before trying anything too ambitious!
Use the datetime module with strftime formatting.For a date of June 8, 2015, this creates a filename of 08/06/23.txt.
you can try this. using string format and datetime for a complete solutionmy personal preference on the naming convention for dates and a file would be in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd' you can include the week on this too, which would look like thisthat would result in a file of this format. 2015-06-08-24.txt
