Every element of the array "data" have to be changed as follows:For example,4 should be seen in names_A and data_A.The names_A for 4 is 'David'.Now 'David' should be seen in names_B and data_B.The data_B for 'David' is 30.So, the element 4 must be changed by 30; and so on.How is the easiest and simplest way of doing it?I tried it as follows:But, it's giving wrong results. How would you do it?
Use dictionaries to create a mapping.Now the keys in mapping will be the numbers from data_A with the corresponding values from data_B.I never worked with numpy but it looks like an easy task to do the replacement now.Just to give an example with a simple list:data now is [30, 30, 51, 51, 11, 11, 29, 29, 51, 51].Edited after installing numpyIf you created the mapping dictionary you can do the following:data is now:As I never worked with numpy before there might be easier (or more pythonic) solutions, but at least this does what it should do.
