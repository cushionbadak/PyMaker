I want to distinguish between these three cases:The flag is not present at all python example.py;The flag is present but without a value python example.py -t; andThe flag is present and has a value python example.py -t ~/some/path.How can I do this with Python argparse? The first two cases would be covered by action='store_true' but then the third case becomes invalid.
You can do this with nargs='?':One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible, and  produced as a single item. If no command-line argument is present, the  value from default will be produced. Note that for optional arguments,  there is an additional case - the option string is present but not  followed by a command-line argument. In this case the value from const  will be produced.Your three cases would give:The default value;The const value; and'~/some/path'respectively.
