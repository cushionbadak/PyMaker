This is my program. The user must input all the prices of their items and when they are done they input: total. This is then supposed to add up all the prices that they input and return them a total. Every time I run the program, it says:I under stand that I cannot force list to be a number, but I can't think of a fix.This is my program:
As the traceback says, the error is here:This one line actually contains a few mistakes:priceItems[0:] is a slice from the beginning to the end of priceItems - in other words, [0:] is doing nothing. That's not an error exactly, but it is pointless, and suggests that you don't really know what you're trying to achieve with it.int(priceItems[0:]) is trying to convert the list to an integer, which obviously won't work.If you had somehow been able to convert the list to an integer, sum(int(priceItems[0:])) would then try to get the sum of that integer, which doesn't make sense either; you sum a collection of numbers, not a single one.Instead, use the function map:That'll take each item in the list, convert it to an integer and sum the results.Note though, that the entire thing could be written as:
If you prefer a less functional style, you can use a generator expressionBetter yet convert the items to int as part of your input validation so you are creating a list of int
