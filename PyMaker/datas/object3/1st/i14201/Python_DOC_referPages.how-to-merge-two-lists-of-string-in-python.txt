I have two lists of string:I should result:What is the most pythonic way to do this ?
Probably with zip:You can also put multiple sublists into one large iterable and use the * operator to unpack it, passing each sublist as a separate argument to zip:You can even use the * operator with zip to go in the other direction:
You can use zip
How about:
You can use zip:You can also use enumerate with list comprehension:
You can use lambda together with map:Or add zip to manage more than 2 lists:For python < 3 I would prefer the former option or replace zip() for izip(), for python 3 the change is not necessary (zip already return an iterator).
