Natural Text
I am trying to import a text with a list about 10 words.That doesn't work... Anyway, Can I import the file without this showing up?Any sort of help is appreciated. 
You can import modules but not text files. If you want to print the content do the following:Open a text file for reading:Store content in a variable:Print content of this file:After you're done close a file:
As you can't import a .txt file, I would suggest to read words this way.
The "import" keyword is for attaching python definitions that are created external to the current python program. So in your case, where you just want to read a file with some text in it, use:text = open("words.txt", "rb").read()
Import gives you access to other modules in your program. You can't decide to import a text file. If you want to read from a file that's in the same directory, you can look at this. Here's another StackOverflow post about it.
numpy's genfromtxt or loadtxt is what I use:This got me headed in the right direction and solved my problem.
