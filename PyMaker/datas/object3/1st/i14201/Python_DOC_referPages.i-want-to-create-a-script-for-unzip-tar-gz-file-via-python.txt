I am trying to make a script for unzipping all the .tar.gz files from folders in one directory. For example, I will have a file which it calls ( testing.tar.gz). Then if I do manually, I can press to "extract here" then the .tar.gz file will create a new file, and it calls testing.tar. Finally, if I repeat the process of pressing "extract here", the .tar file prodcudes me all the .pdf files.I wonder that how can I do it, and I have my code here and it seems doesn't realty work tho.
Why do you want to "press" twice to extract a .tar.gz, when you can easily do it once?  Here is a simple code to extract both .tar and .tar.gz in one go:
Here is a simpler option:
When I ran your program, it worked perfectly for a tar.gz and a .tgz file, it didn't give me the correct items when I opened the zip, but .tbz was the only one that raised an error. I think you used the wrong method to unpack a .tbz because the error said I had an incorrect file type, but I didn't. One way you could solve the .zip issue is to us os.command() and unzip it with a command line (depending on your os) because it returned a _MACOSX folder with nothing inside of it even though I entered the path correctly. The only other error I encountered was that you used improper syntax for raising an error. This is what you should have used:You used a comma and no parenthesis. Hope this helps!
