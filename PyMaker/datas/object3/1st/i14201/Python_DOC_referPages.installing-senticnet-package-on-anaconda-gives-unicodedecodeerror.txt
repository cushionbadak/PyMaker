When I try to install SenticNet for sentiment analysis using Conda it cannot find it. Then I tried pip install and I got the error:I have Anaconda 64-bit, python 3.4.3 and pip 7.0.3 
This is due to Python not opening the file as UTF-8 when reading.  It appears like Windows does not use Unicode by default so you have to pass in encoding='utf-8' to the call to open.  Looking at your error code, you need to change line 20 in setup.py toFor more information, checkout Python's Unicode HOWTO specifically the reading and writing of data.
Clone the github repository from:After unzipping the file, open setup.py and replace line number 20 with:license=open('LICENSE', encoding='utf-8').read()after this, open command prompt here(make sure you have environment variable set for python)run the command -> 'python setup.py install' This will install senticnet for python, now to get it running in Anaconda, copy the following folder:C:\Users\HP\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Lib\site-packages\senticnet-1.3-py3.6.egg\senticnetto:C:\Users\HP\Anaconda4\Lib\site-packages\senticnet(the path will be different based upon your configurations)
