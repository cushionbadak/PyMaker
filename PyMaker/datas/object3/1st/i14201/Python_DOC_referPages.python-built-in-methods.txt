This question already has an answer here:accessing a python int literals methods [duplicate]I can call str methods on string literal. But I cannot call int methods on a integer number literal:Why is that?
Python treats 1. as a beginning of a float number, but fails to parse the rest of the line. Change it toby enclosing the number literal with parenthesis, we make sure that python evaluates the expression within the parens, which is 1 and call the method on that number.Python defines floating point literal like thisAs per that definition, the lexical analyzer thinks that 1.bit_length() would be a float literal, since 1. matches the [intpart] fraction's beginning. But the rest of the line doesn't match. That is why it fails.
