I am talking to a piece of a test equipment using a serial interface.  The two letter ascii ID of the device is encoded as a base 10 integer in a specific register. Each pair of integers needs to be converted to an ascii character.  My question is what is the best way to do this conversion.  I used the method below but it seems fairly complicated for a such a simple task.Example input: 5270Desired output: '4F' (ascii values of 52 and 70)
Add a bit of maths./ - Integer division% - Modulus operatorCodeAnd to match desired output
