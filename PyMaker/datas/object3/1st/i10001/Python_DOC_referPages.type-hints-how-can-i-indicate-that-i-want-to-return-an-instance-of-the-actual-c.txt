When I try to combine Type Hints and object creation througha classmethod I get the following NameError:How can I indicate through type hinting that I want to return an instance of the class which I am currently defining? (see example)Example:The definition of the classmethod from_dict fails because Python cannot resolve the class Person.
You need to use a TypeVar.
Use a string:This makes the return type of the classmethod a Person. This is also useful when writing classes that depend on each other.
