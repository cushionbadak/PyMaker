This question already has an answer here:Python 'subprocess' CalledProcessError: Command '[â€¦]' returned non-zero exit status 1 [duplicate]                    2 answers                I'm trying to run this aws s3 ls command:with this python:But it's failing with this error:The command itself works when I run it. The python script is being called by the same user on the same machine. What gives?
