Natural Text
I have the following code:The code is working.I can read all my messages.But my question is how I can get the body as a String?Is it possible to just get the body text as a String?Thx
Disclaimer: I never used poplib myself but I did read the official docs here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/poplib.html#poplib.POP3.retrWhen you call .retr(i+1) here:retr(i+1) returns 3 values: (response, ['line', ...], octets).Here you take only the second value (by doing .retr(i+1)[1]), which contains a list of the message lines.Just join all these lines to get a single string message by doing:And if you want to parse the actual MIME content, you can use the email lib as suggested by @larsks
