So I have a python list (called lst in the snippet below) of urls.I want to create another list of only the /file.zip part of each url. So far I have this:and it returns the /file.zip part as expected. But my question is how can I do this for the entire list?
Assuming lst = [url1, url2, ...], your current code is very close to working optimally.The last line of the code lst2.append(i[0].split('/')][-1]) is where the problems lie.By calling i[0] you are essentially getting the first character of the i string (since the i derives from the strings inside lst), and then splitting it based on /, which would not work. Then you have an error with the lone ] after the split.So, to fix this code, here is what you would do.and then, printing lst2 would give['file.zip', 'file1.zip', ...]which is your desired output.To explain, i in lst is getting every item inside the lst list, which are strings. Then, inside the loop, the string i is being split according to the / inside it, which generates another array. But you want the final part of that string, hence the final item in the array, which can be accessed using [-1].
You can use a list comprehension:
You can accomplish this with a list comprehension. lst2 now looks like this:
In addition to @Wintro answer:Do you need the leading '/' in your results (/file1.zip) ? Then you have to preprend it again because split() will make it disappear.I suggest that you use python builtin pathlib or os.path.basename or os.path.split: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.basenameAlso, you can use loop comprehension:
Although it may not be necessary in this case, it is always a good idea to use the proper library for these functions. In this case, that is the os module:
