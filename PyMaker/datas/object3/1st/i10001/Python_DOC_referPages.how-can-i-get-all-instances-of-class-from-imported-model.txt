For example:But I don`t know how each variable called and how much variables exist in a given file. How can i get all objects of imported file? The goal is to create list() of objects from several files.
A good way to do this would be with inspect.getmembers by utilizing its pred parameter.Firstly, you could get all user defined classes in the module with inspect.isclass and then, create a new predicate to capture any instances that are of the class(es) you got before.Initially, grabbing the classes is easy with isclass as defined in inspect:Now, clses is a tuple of classes:If classes are already known beforehand, the previous step is of course, not needed; just create a tuple of the classes you need to find and continue with the next step.You can then create a new predicate (a simple lambda would suffice) that grabs objects that are instances of any of the classes in clses:The result now being that instances is populated with any name in the module obj that is True for the the isinstance check in pred:
