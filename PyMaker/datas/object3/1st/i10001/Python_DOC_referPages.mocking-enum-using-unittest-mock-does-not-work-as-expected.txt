I'm trying to Mock an enum in Python so that I can assert whether a method of the class tested calls a method on the enum.This does not work as expected. The method in question is never called because an identity comparison of the mock with the actual enum always fails.
Rather than trying to create a mock member of an enumeration, just patch that method:Now you can pass a real member, but intercept calls to do_something. This gets around the fact that there's no way to mock identity.
