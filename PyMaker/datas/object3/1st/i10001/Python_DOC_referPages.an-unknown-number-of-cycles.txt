If n=1 I want to write:if n=2 I want to write:if n=3 I want to write:etc.n can be 1 or 2 or 3 .. 20. n is a random number from 1 to 20How can I write the next code:My attempt to find a solution:Maybe we can use recursionthis method will not workMaybe we can use lists. For example,So we have matrix(n,21). But I don't see how I can use this matrix to solve my problem. Maybe we need to use trees but I've never worked with themMaybe I can use a library to solve the equation a1*x1+a2*x2+...+an*xn=1 but it's not interesting. I want to know how I can solve this task myself.
