Your students variable is a list with three students (erm... three dictionaries). When you do results.append(get_average(students));, you're passing that list to your get_average method, in an argument called student (but within the get_average, function that still is a list, since the argument's name is irrelevant)Then, in get_average, you try to access that list as student['homework']. Since the student argument is a list, that's why you get the error.You might wanna do something like this?EDIT (A per the OP's comment to this answer):I guess good resources could be this and this (there's way more Googling python lists dictionaries)
results.append(get_average(students)) should instead iterate over the list, since get_average expects a dict. Replace with:Or simply:
