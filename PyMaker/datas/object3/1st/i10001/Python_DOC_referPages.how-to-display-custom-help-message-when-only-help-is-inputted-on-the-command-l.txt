Natural Text
Currently my program works by taking in two arguments after the program name in the terminal.i.e. python myscript.py file1 file2 worksHow can I change it so that when I type in just:A help message (from a text file I have made) is generated?Is there a very simple way of doing this?
You need to perform a check of sys.argv[1] and see if it equals "help". In this block, you then print out your help file to the user. If sys.argv[1] does not equal "help", continue with your current logic.An alternative is to utilize argparse. It can automatically generate the "help" for you when you pass -hUsing this, if you pass -h to your command line, you get a helpful message like so:It will accept 2 file names. If you pass anything other than two values, it will produce an appropriate response.
