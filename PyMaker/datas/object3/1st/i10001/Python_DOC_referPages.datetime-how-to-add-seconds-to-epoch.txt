Natural Text
I do not even know how to tackle this.  I need to first turn a str() into a datetime object, convert it to epoch time add a number of seconds then turn it back into the date in a properly formatted object.  A sample of the str is:"2016-11-04T03:02:00Z"I'm guessing some regex to break up the str()??
Use a timedelta object, e.g:See docs https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html and make sure that my TIMESTRING_FORMAT string is correct.
