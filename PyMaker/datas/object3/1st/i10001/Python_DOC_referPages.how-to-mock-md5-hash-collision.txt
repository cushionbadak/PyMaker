I am using a private Ubuntu server and am testing a private applicationI am using the Python hashlib library for generating MD5 hashes.Now I want the MD5 function always return my specific number although different input. How can I do this? Is there a config file?
DISCLAIMERAs mentioned in the comments this is most likely a TERRIBLE idea and is very likely an X / Y problem.For the sake of clarity, this is what I was referring to when I said it could be done via a monkey patch:As long as this is imported / executed before the hashlib call is used elsewhere it will replace the result of a hexdigest with a constant value.  Any other method would return the real md5 (like digest).  
tl;drYou can't, unless you write your own function or implement a monkey patch.Hashes are not designed to return the same value for multiple completely different snippets of data (although inevitably there have been collisions, like with MD5, due to the length of the hash). You could write your own function to check the value passed, and have it return a unique value if you need to. An example:In this case, the same hash would be returned if you passed cheese or football to the function, otherwise it would return another hash.Also, there is no 'config file'. It is just a specific algorithm written in a C program. If you are desperate, you might be able to change it, but it would only work on your system.You could also implement what is known as a monkey patch. I'm not knowledgeable in that area, but you can find out more information from this SO post.As others have pointed out, I can not think of a use case for this sort of problem, although if you need to do it, then you have your answer.
