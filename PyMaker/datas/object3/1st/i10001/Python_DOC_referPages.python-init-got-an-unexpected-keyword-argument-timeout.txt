I have the following code with a timeout set to 60 secI don't understand why I am getting the error message of I have looked into this previous post with the same error, but the other user uses subprocess.call() while I am using subprocess.Popen() so I am confused why this is happening.
Popen class does not have a timeout argument in its signature:https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.PopenYou can pass the timeout argument when you actually communicate though:https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate
Same reason. There is no timeout argument.List of all valid arguments for a Popen: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen
the other user uses subprocess.call() while I am using subprocess.Popen() so I am confused why this is happening.call() blocks until the command ends or the timeout happens. Popen() does NOT wait for the command to finish; it returns immediately and therefore it does not accept timeout parameter. You could pass timeout to wait() or communicate() methods which do wait until the process finishes or the timeout happens.
