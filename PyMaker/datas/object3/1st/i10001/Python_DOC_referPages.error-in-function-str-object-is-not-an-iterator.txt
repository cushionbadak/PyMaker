I have a problem with the following function in python (where swap is a function that I have previously created and that works fine):when I run this function it works fine but if I use doctest to see if there are mistakes it tells me: I don't know where this error comes from.Can anyone help me?complete output of the doctest:
The function is called swap2 but within the doctests, you are using next which happens to be a built-in function that does something completely different. That’s why you are seeing that error.At times like this, it’s really important to actually look at the error messages. It clearly told you what was called:So if you don’t know where that was supposed to come from, then check out the error message. Doctest will tell you what it is executing: swap2[0], swap2[1], etc. tells you the function name the docstring that is being executed is by doctest and which test case it is (0 is the first, 1 the second etc.). It even gives you the line number (within the doctest case) where the error appeared, and of course the line that was causing the error. So use that information to go to the problematic code, and figure out what the problem is.
