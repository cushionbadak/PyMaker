Ok let's try this again.  I have 1 set of data.  I want to make 2 copies, and then sort the copies in descending order based on different columns.  Then I want to get the cumulative sum of the respective columns.  When I run the following code I get different results for the two instances I call on print (setA[x][2]).This produces:but I expected it to produceinstead.
sorted() creates a shallow copy of the sequence being sorted. This means that your nested lists are not copied, they are merely referenced:So the last element in set is exactly the same object as setA[0] and setB[2]. Making changes to any one of those references is reflected in the others:This is why the set object (from which you produced your sorted setA and setB lists) is also changed after running your code:You need to create a proper copy of the nested lists; you could use the copy.deepcopy() function to create a recursive copy of the list objects, or you could use a generator expression when sorting:This shallowly copies the nested lists; this is fine because those nested lists only contain immutable objects themselves.
