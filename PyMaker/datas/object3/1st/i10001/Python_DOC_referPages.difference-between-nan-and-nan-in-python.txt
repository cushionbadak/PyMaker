I have two lists I wanted to remove nan from the lists. So I used this on list 'a' and 'b'So it works fine for list 'a' because I think it was taking 'nan' as a string but not with list b. How can I remove those nan from list b. Thanks in advance.
When you don't put it in quotes, nan is a number (it's a special number used to represent a nonexistent result, called "Not a Number"). It's so special that it doesn't even equal itself. Use math.isnan or numpy.isnan to test if a number is nan
'nan' is a string nan is Not A number, you can check it by method math.isnan()In your case:
'nan' is a string, but nan is a floating-point number.  Which is funny, because "nan" stands for Not A Number, but that's really what it is:nan has a number of tricky properties, and one of the trickiest is that it compares unequal to everything, including itself.  You have to use a special function to check for it, math.isnan.Note: Python does not define a built-in constant nan, even though the repr of a NaN value is nan.  (Contrast True, False, None, etc.)  3.5 and later have math.nan, but before that you have to say float('nan').
