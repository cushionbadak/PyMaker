UnicodeDecodeError I get the following error everytime i try and run this function in python 3.5.2 but it works fine in 3.4.3, I cannot figure out what is causing this error. 
In Python 3, open defaults to using the encoding returned by locale.getpreferredencoding(False).  It isn't usually ascii, though, but it can be if running under some kind of framework, which your error message indicates.Instead, specify the encoding of the file you are trying to read.  If the file was created under Windows, it is likely the encoding is cp1252, especially since the byte \x97 is an EM DASH under that encoding.Try:
I believe One way to solve your question is by putting this code at the top of your file.This will set the encoding to UTF8Another (better) solution is a library called codecs, that is very easy to use.The fileObj is then a normal file object that can be read from and written to. Source for Method 1Source for Method 2Note for Method 1 This can be extremely dangerous when using third party apps that use ASCII as their encoding. Use with caution.
