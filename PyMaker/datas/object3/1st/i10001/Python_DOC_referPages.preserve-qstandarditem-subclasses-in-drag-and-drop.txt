There is no way to preserve the specific subclass of the item if there are multiple subclasses being used. A model can have only one prototype, and that is used for all items that are created internally by Qt.This means you should not use multiple QStandardItem subclasses if you need to distinguish between different item types. Instead, you should use a single subclass and reimplement QStandardItem.type to distinguish between them:
