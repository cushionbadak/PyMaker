Hoping someone can help. I mainly work in Java and have an assignment that I have to do in Python and I know next to nothing about it.I have a CSV file which I'm reading in and have managed to create a list or lists of each item. Each line represents a thingID, time of request, time requested, time needed to fill. I need to place these into a priority queue, run them through and print results. Though I haven't gotten farther than what is shown below as I clearly have no idea how functions work. The whole self and __init__ stuff has me confused, along with everything else that this language requires to operate.This gives me a list of arrays like so:I have another Things.py (am not supposed to have multiple classes in a single .py) in which I have:I tried creating another def below the __init__ but I can't do anything.I'm trying to separate out the different parts of the list object so I can then operate on the various parts of it like ID, time requested, etc., but have no idea how to do this. I've tried various things but get Attribute Error of Type Error. I'm at a total loss. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just need a few steps in the right direction as I've completely hit a wall.
List unpacking may be what your want:
Hope this template helps:
You could explicitly separate out the different parts of the list object passed to Things.__init__() by indexing them like this (same as in Java ):
