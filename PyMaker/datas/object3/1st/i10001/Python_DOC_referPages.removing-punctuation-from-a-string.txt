This question already has an answer here:Best way to strip punctuation from a string in Python                    24 answers                How do I remove punctuation from a string in python? I followed the approach that someone posted on Stackoverflow, but it is not working. 
I find using a combination of gencomp and "".join() works well:And as a side note, do not use str as an identifier as it already has a meaning in the Python language.The reason that your code is not working, is probably because you're misunderstanding what input() does. input() simply gets input from the user and returns the input. It looks to me that all you want to do is have a string, in which just do: sstr = "Hi, my name is Yael Shapiro!"
