Natural Text
New to python and looking for help.The output of this is ['Lion', 'TigerWhite 2', 'BearBlue 3'] which is what I want BUT I'd like to add two more splits - "White" and "Blue" to get the output ['Lion', 'Tiger', 'Bear'].
Not sure what you mean by specified characters, I assume your want to filter based on the color words.
Assumption: You want the first word out of each list (correct me if I am wrong)OUTPUT:
You can use the built-in str.rsplit or check out this question.
