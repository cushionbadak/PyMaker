I have these 2 simple functions to sum and count list elements without using standard python commands like sum() and len().ex. if x=[1,5] - should return 6ex. if x=[1,5] - should return 2The problem is I cant understand how they work. More specifically:1) What does n=0 represents before the loop? Is it some kind of starting point?2) After that, I can understand what the for-loop does, but I cant get what the n= n+i and n=n+1 actually means. What is "n" in this case, and why if I add "i" (n+i) gives the sum while adding "1" (n+1) gives the length of the list?
Make use of print statements to help you understand how the loop is working. (copy paste the code and run)To answer you questionsn -> is the variable that holds the values of n+i and n+1 , so value of n+i and n+1 gets stored in n (The code moves left to right). You can think of it as a starting pointso n+i or n+1 does the computation needed and stores the number in n and then returns it in the next step.To answer you question "why if I add "i" (n+i) gives the sum while adding "1" (n+1) gives the length of the list?" : i will keep changing with every loop iteration but in n+1 , only n changes everytime. Therefore sum function gives you the sum and the count function gives you the length.You can use len to get the number of elements in a listHope this helps.I have added more print statements to help you understand it better, run the code and see if it helps.
