Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Splitting large text file by a delimiter in Python                    2 answers                I have been trying to write the following function:This function is meant to operate on a file with the following format:How do I tell the function to operate on this file path and more precisely on the text inside each border?
Write a generator, that counts detect border lines and use groupby to separate these blocks:
The following approach would read your file in, and give you a list of non border lines:So if your input file was:It would display the following output:This works by reading your file in line by line, and using Python's groupby function to group lines matching a given test. In this case the test is whether or not the line starts -BORDER-. It returns all following lines which return the same result. The k is the test result, and the g is the group of matching lines. So if the test result is True, it means it did not start with -BORDER-. Next, as each of your lines has a newline, a list comprehension is used to strip this from each of the returned lines.If you wanted to count the words (assuming they are delimited by spaces) then you could do the following:Giving you:
To retrieve the text from your text file you can do as follows :text_list will contain all the text lines you are looking for. You can, if needed, strip the lines using .strip()
