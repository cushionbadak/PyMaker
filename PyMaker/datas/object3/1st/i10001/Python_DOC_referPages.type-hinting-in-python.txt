OrderedDict is not a subclass of typing.Generic and therefore cannot be parametrized. However you may easily define the corresponding type as follows:You may then use it in all type hints : OrderedDictType[str,XV] instead of OrderedDict[str,XV].See https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#user-defined-generic-typesand typing.py source for details and examples (I used the typing.List class as an example).
