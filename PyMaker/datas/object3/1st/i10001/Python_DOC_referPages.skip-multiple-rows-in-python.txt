Natural Text
so I'm trying to skip over several rows from a .txt file and then creating a CSV file using csv reader. 18 rows need to be skipped. This gets the job done but I'm pretty sure there is an easy way of skipping 18 rows instead of using next() 18 times.This works for me but how would I clean up the code to a much simpler version. Thanks!
Use range:
Use a for loop.  Or you can use itertools.dropwhile
That's strange that you used a for loop below, but haven't considered it for the same problem.your code can easily be replaced by something like thisThis will call next(cr) 18 times, and afterwards call writer.writerow
How about this,As mentioned by @PatrickHaugh, the above solution is not effective for a large file. Below is the solution for a big files.
