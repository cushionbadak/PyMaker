Short version: Can I just use the Requests module for POST, GET, and DELETE?I'm trying to use the Pinterest REST API. (Pinterest API Explorer)I'm going the simple route and just manually got my authentication token via oauth, so basically all I need to know how to do is POST, GET, and DELETE to a specific URL and also include the parameters, then return a json. I really only need three API functions, list authorized user's followers (GET), follow user (POST), and unfollow user (DELETE). The only param I need for any of those is my access_token that I got manually.It seems like a simple problem, but there's about 5 python Pinterest API wrappers, none of them complete, some of them not working at all. I've looked at the pycurl, httplib, and requests modules. They all look like they have a simple enough method for GET, but it gets more complicated with POST and maybe DELETE. It seems like it should be super simple, a function that takes a method (POST/GET/DELETE/etc), a url, and a set of parameters, so why is it more complicated than that? If it were that easy, I don't understand why all these API wrappers would be half done since it theoretically should be as simple as calling a function with those 3 parameters (with an array for the 3rd parameter) for every function in the API.In the Requests python package, there's this function under the RequestMethods class:def request(self, method, url, fields=None, headers=None, **urlopen_kw)Looks like I understand everything except what the headers are and the **urlopen_kw, but I think it should work without those to variables, correct?I'd appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.
From the docs:Here is an example of doing a PUT request using Request:In your case the method would be 'POST', 'Delete' or whatever you like.If you want to make more complex requests, have a look at this guide for the httplib2 library - it's worth reading.
