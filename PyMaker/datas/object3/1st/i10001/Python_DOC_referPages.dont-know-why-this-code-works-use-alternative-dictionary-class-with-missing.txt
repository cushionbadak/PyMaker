this question arises when i read the book "Python cookbook" by  David Beazley, Brian K. Jones, in page 61, 62. I summarize:Now, if just want to replace {name}, but don't want to replace {n}, define an alternative dictionary class with a __missing__() methodthenyou get the desired result:my question:why need __missing__() method to make this code work?
format_map() will look in its argument for the key 'n'. Because this key is missing, it would raise a KeyError in a normal dict. Defining the __missing__ method determines what happens here instead: '{n}' is returned so that the formatted string remains the same.
