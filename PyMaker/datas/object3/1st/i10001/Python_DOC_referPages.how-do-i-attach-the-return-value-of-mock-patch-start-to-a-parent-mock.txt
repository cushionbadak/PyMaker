The mock examples list this example:I would like to accomplish the same thing, but with explicit start and stop calls on a patcher instead of the context manager, and it seems patcher.start() returns something which isn't really a mock in the same sense that contextualized one is, at least with respect to the ability to attach them to a parent mock:Am I missing something, or is this a bug, and what is the best way to go about mocking out several such calls and verifying that they are all made in the expected order?
Because of autospec=True and a function is being mocked out, patch will return a function, as well. In order to access the mock object, you can access patch(â€¦).start().mock.
