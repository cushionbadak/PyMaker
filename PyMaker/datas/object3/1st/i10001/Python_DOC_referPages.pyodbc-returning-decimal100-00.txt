I'm using pyodbc to read a numeric value from a table, but instead of just giving me '100', it gives me "(Decimal('100.00'),).Is there a way to get just the number?I'm running:My apologies if this has already been answered, but I haven't been able to find out how to solve this.
Presumably the table defines that column as DECIMAL type, so pyodbc is returning a Decimal object to faithfully represent that value. Assuming that the value may have digits after the decimal point, you could "get just the number" by calling float(), but you don't want to do that if the column represents money (as the name "CurrentBalance" suggests). Using float values to represent money is a Bad Idea.Instead, you should probably just continue to use the value as a Decimal.
I managed to get just the number by doing the following:"result[0]" was returning "(Decimal('100.00'),)", but when I used "result [0][0] it returns only "100.00"
It would be cleaner to take care of it in your query from the start:
