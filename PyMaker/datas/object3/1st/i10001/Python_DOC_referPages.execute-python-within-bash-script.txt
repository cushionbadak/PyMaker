I need to execute the following code from within a shell script. Typically in languages such as node.js I could write node -e "code here" to execute the code. How can I replicate this functionality with Python?
I guess you could use a here document.For example, here's a simple test script:You could do the same thing by putting your python logic in a separate  python script (that takes commandline args) and then just calling it in your shell script.  For example:
You can... it's very confusing (at least it is for me) as soon as you get more than... 3 lines, but you can. For instance:The important part is the -c (to run the text after it as a command passed to the interpreter)More information here.I'd put that in a file if possible, though. If you need the ability to make the port configurable, you can use sys.argsv in your Python code and pass it in the command call as an argument.For instance, put this in a script:run_server.py:And call it with python ./run_server.py 8000 The content of sys.argv is a list, where the first item is the script's name, and then the rest are the arguments passed in the call. In this example's case, that would be: ['./run_server.py', '8000']
