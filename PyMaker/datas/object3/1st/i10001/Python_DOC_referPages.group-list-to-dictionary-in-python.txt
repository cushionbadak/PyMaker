This question already has an answer here:Grouping Python dictionary keys as a list and create a new dictionary with this list as a value                    2 answers                Given the listhow do I get the dictionaryin Python?Edit: I was looking for a functional solution (using only 1 expression).
You may use the collections.defaultdict(). Alternatively, in case you do not want to import collections , you may achieve the same behavior with normal dict using dict.setdefault() as:
After defininguse group(l, key = lambda x: x[0], value = lambda x: x[1])).
Using defaultdict from the collections module.You can iterate the list and extract the (key, value) pairs from the tuples in the list and build your dictionary.
Here is a simple solution to your problem using dict()
