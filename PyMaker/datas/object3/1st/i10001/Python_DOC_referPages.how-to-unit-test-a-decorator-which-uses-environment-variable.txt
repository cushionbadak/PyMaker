I created a decorator to allow functions be be run in specific environments only:That seems to work, but I'd like to unit test it.The problem is: my tests are potentialy run in every environment (local, staging, prod). Plus, I think it's not safe my tests are able to change environment variables.Should I "mock" this behaviour? How would you do? Thanks!
Use mock to override the value of settings.ENV_NAME for a test.
