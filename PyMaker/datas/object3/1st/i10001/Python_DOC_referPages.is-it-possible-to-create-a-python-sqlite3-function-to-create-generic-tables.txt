I’m trying to create a python program which logs stock prices over certain periods of time, then creates a table for the individual stock where I can record the buy price and sell price of the stock at given times.However, I don’t want to have to code individual tables for each stock, I’d rather code a function which lets me put variables as the table/column name, and have a series of variables in a list which i can then run the function and create 5 tables from a list for example.So far I’ve gotten:I’m trying to execute this in a loopBut it just doesn’t work.
