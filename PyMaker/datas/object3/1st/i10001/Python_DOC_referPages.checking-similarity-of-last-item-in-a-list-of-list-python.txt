I have a long list of list, I want to check whether the last item of each list inside the big list if they are equal, if they are then I want to create a new list adding them in order and adding the item before  the item "^" into a new list of list, for example, I have the following format ( this is just an example, the data can be changed each time so the code should be generlized):I want to return:corresponding in index to the created list of list:taking the names right before the item of "^" and adding everything corresponding to the index in  list1, I don't know how to do the logic but my trial:
You can use OrderedDict where key is the last element from nested list and value is list containing the items before '^':Output:
The desired output can be achieved with groupby from itertools and reduce from functools:I hope this helps.
