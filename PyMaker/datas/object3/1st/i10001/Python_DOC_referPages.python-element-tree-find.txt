Natural Text
I have an xml string that looks something like this:I am using the Element Tree libraryI want to get some values of the Category Node, let's call them Wanted Parms 1 and 2. However I am getting an AttributeError probably because the code I wrote is not able to find the child node of the Category item.AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'text'.
The XML elements are in the default namespace urn:ebay:apis:eBLBaseComponents So all tags get prepended with the full URI of the namespace.Changing your find() parameter to include the URI should work.You can find more information on dealing with namespaces on the element tree docs here or this stack overflow post.
