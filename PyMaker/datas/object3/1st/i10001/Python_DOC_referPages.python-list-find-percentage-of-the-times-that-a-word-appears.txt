This question already has an answer here:item frequency count in python                    11 answers                I have a list in python: [adam,josh,drake]I want to output the percentage of the times that a word is used out of all of the words(eg. adam-33%, josh 33% etc.). So that if I add a word to the list, the percentage will change accordingly. 
You can use collections.Counter to count how often each word occurs.Then you can iterate through the resulting object and divide each count by the length of the original list to get a decimal percentage from 0.0 to 1.0, which can be multiplied by 100 to give a percentage between 0 and 100 to be printed out.
You should look at the collections module, in particular https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.CounterThe items method on the Counter produces a list of tuples of the name and the number of times that name appears in the original list.
