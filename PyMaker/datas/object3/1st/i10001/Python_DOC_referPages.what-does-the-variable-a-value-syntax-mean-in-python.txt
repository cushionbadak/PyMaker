This question already has an answer here:What does //= in python do? [duplicate]                    3 answers                I came across with the code syntax d //= 2 where d is a variable. This is not a part of any loop, I don't quite get the expression. Can anybody enlighten me  please?   
// is a floor division operator. The = beside it means to operate on the variable "in-place". It's similar to the += and *= operators, if you've seen those before, except for this is with division.Suppose I have a variable called d. I set it's value to 65, like this.Calling d //= 2 will divide d by 2, and then assign that result to d. Since, d // 2 is 32 (32.5, but with the decimal part taken off), d becomes 32:It's the same as calling d = d // 2.
It divides d by 2, rounding down. Python can be run interactively, Try it.
Divides the variable with floor division by two and assigns the new amount to the variable.
