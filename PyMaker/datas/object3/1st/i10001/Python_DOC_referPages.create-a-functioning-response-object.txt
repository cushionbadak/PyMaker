For testing purposes I'm trying to create a Response() object in python but it proves harder then it sounds.i tried this:but when I attempted the_response.json() i got an error because the function tries to get len(self.content) and a.content is null.So I set a._content = "{}" but then I get an encoding error, so I have to change a.encoding, but then it fails to decode the content....this goes on and on. Is there a simple way to create a Response object that's functional and has an arbitrary status_code and content?
That because the _content attribute  on the Response objects (on python3) has to be bytes and not unicodes.Here is how to do it:
Create a mock object, rather than trying to build a real one:Providing a spec ensures that the mock will complain if you try to access methods and attributes a real Response doesn't have.
Just use the responses library to do it for you:This has the advantage that it intercepts a real request, rather than having to inject a response somewhere.
