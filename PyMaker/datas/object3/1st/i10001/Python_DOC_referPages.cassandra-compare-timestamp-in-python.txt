I am using Cassandra Python Driver, a little confused.Cluster key day is timestamp in Cassandra. what myday should be? epoch in milliseconds, OR epoch in seconds, OR string like 2016-10-26 00:00:00?Any performance difference?Any comments welcomed. Thanks.
There is a doc page that discusses the details of working with time with the Python driver.You are correct that it can be either a datetime, or integer milliseconds from epoch.Integer input would be marginally more efficient, but you will probably not observe any performance difference, since [query time] >> [parameter encoding].
From the link you provided, the python datetime is cast to the CQL timestamp.  Read more about datetime here.
