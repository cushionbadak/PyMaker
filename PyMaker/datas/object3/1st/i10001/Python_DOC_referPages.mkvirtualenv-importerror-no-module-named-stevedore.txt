I've got a Mac which has python installed and virtualenvwrapper installed. I'm trying to create a new environment by running:To which I get the following error:I have python installed here:If I try sudo pip install stevedore then it says its already installed with some warnings:If I try sudo -H pip install stevedore then I get the following errors:If I create a .bash_profile and put into it:and reload a terminal window then I get the following error:Curious and curiouser.Any suggestions on what's going wrong and how to fix this?ThanksSidharth 
I was very confused with this problem, too. And I have solved it by uninstalling the old stevedore and reinstall it.
Looks like you managed to install virtualwrapper without stevedore, which is a dependency. Try installing it.
with python 2.7 sudo pip install stevedore
