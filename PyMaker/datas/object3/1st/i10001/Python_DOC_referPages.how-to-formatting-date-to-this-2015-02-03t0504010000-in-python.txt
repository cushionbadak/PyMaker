Natural Text
please, help to formatting any file creation date to such format:I have already tried many formats, but its not working. Please help to solve this issue.So, the basic script to get file creation date is:
If you want to parse text to datetime object, use strptime:You can see the format I used ('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+0000') you can see the full details on how the format works on the link I provided, also keep in mind that you can use normal chars (like the T or +0000) to match the exact format you had.
Here Duan is right. But for the "+0000" you can use "%z".Other formatting char you can see here https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html
