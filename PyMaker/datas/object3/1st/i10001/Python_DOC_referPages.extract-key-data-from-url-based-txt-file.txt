Natural Text
I'm trying to make a bit of code that analyses the text file at this link weather report and then finds the line in the file and reads the Celsius value of temperature and returns it. The reading for temperature is not always on the same line but it always has the same format on the line.After doing some reading here on stack overflow I used the re library and an online regex calculator to get some code going for me. This is what I have so far:I am getting this error:does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this error/ an easier way to do what I am trying to do? I feel like I am over complicating things a bit...
As you said ... temperature is not always on the same line but it always has the same format on the line.So, you don't need the complexity of a regex to solve this issue.EditIf you want to return the value as an int or float, just convert it using the correspondent functions.
