This question already has an answer here:Skip the headers when editing a csv file using Python                    3 answers                fileInput consists of a csv file with some 30 rows and I want to access only the second row.for row in csv.reader(fileInput):I need to access the second row not the first one(first one contains col names). row[1] gives second column in row0?only the second row not from the first row!
You might want to consider using DictReader. It'll handle the header for you and allow you to access the columns by name rather than index (which can help with keeping code readable).eg.
reader returns an iterator: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader
