This question already has an answer here:Calling variable defined inside one function from another function                    4 answers                I was wondering how I would use the "adj" variable from def getInput and connect it to adjectives(), I am trying to make it so I can get input from the user and then have the random.choice activate depending on how many adjectives the user inputs. As a student for this project, I can only use user defined functions.
Here's one option. Another option is using global keyword within the function, or simply declaring your number values in the global scope to begin with 
If you want to take the value of the "adj" variable in getInput() and use it in adjective(), you will want to return it from getInput() and you can then call getInput(). If you just add the line return adj at the end of getInput() then in another function - such as adjective() - you can use the assignment adj = getInput() to use it in that function. In general you can return values from functions and pass values in as arguments to share values between functions - Python's documentation explains how this works:https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions
