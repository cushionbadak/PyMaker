I am calling from matlab (R2015b) a python module that I created. Now I've noticed that, we can only send to python a 1xN vector. So I fixed this in Matlab Matlab Code:Then I sent a as parameter to python function.Now my problem that python doesn't return Matlab matrixI noticed that I am returning an ndarray while debugging.This is my python code:I guess I need to make the ndarray a matrix once againBut how do I convert it ?Thanks in advance!

This is a shot in the dark, because I don't have Matlab to test it, but I suspect you'll have to return a python array object, not a numpy array.So something like this:
