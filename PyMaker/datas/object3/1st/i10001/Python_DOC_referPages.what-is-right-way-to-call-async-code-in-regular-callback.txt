What is right way to call async code in regular callback?This code works, but looks not pretty. I do not like how respond called: it needs to pass caller address through all functions. How to set timeout to handler?I placed questions in comments.Use netcat to test nc -u 127.0.0.1 10012
You may use asyncio.Queue to put there tasks in one coroutine (handle) and await them in another (respond):
