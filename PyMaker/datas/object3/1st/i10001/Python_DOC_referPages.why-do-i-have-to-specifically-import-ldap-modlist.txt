What is so special about ldap.modlist that I have to explicitly import it?  Importing ldap is not enough:But if I explicitly import it, then all is well:Why?  Other modules don't behave like this:
The difference between the modules ldap.dn and ldap.modlist is this:The module ldap.dn is loaded during the initialization of the ldap package and is therefore already present as an attribute in the ldap package (see The Import System: Submodules for a description about submodules):The module ldap.modlist on the other hand is not loaded during the initalization of the ldap package.
