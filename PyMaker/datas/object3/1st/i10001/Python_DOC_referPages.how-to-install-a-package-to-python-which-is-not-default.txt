This question already has an answer here:no module named zlib                    8 answers                I am trying to add zlib package to my python. However, after I install it using "yum install zlib", only the default python (which is python 2.4.3) can import it. While the other python (3.4.4) still cannot use zlib.When I try to import zlib in python 3.4.4 byimport zlibIt displaysTraceback (most recent call last):File "< stdin >", line 1, in ImportError: No module named 'zlib'My question is, how can I install package to python which is not default?PS. I installed both zlib and zlib-develThanks
You might need to install the zlib-devel package as well: yum install zlib-devel.Otherwise you need to post the full error message when you try to run import zlib.
