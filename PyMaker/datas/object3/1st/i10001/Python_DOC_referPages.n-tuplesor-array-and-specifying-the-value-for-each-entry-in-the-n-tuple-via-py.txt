how would I create an n vector(or array) on Python and specify the value for each entry? For instance, let's say I want the vector (a1,...,a10) thus n=10 and each ai can be a value from [1,20]. So a1 can be any value from 1 through 20, thus a1 is any element in [1,20] , moreover a2 can be any value from [1,20] and so on. Or if n =15, then for (a1,...,a15) each ai can be a value [1,20]. Basically I would like to generalize it to any n tuple (a1,...,an) where each ai is a value from [1,20] and run through different values for nExample.)if I wanted all tuples for n=2 and where each element ai can be a number 1 through 4 or in other words (a1,a2) where a1 is in [1,4] and a2 is in [1,4] this would give me:(1,1) ,(1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3),(3,2),(3,3),(4,3),(3,4) and (4,4) I not only want all combinations but each element has to be a value in the range [1,20]
According to your updated description if I understand correctly what you need is itertools.product (in general itertools module deals with permutations and combinations and the docs are excellent. For example:Below some further code I've written a while ago making use itertools for my own needs :) (note if you are in python2 uncomment the first line from __future__ import print_function, division line.
Python arrays default to lists (unless you're using Numpy). See this link for more. You can actually build a list relatively easily. Hope this helps.
Use the array module if you want a very fast and efficient implementation of "true" arrays (as opposed to lists)More information on the array module is here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.htmlRegards
