Okay, first off I know this question has been asked quite a few times, however, none of the previous questions have included the use of UDP sockets.I've tested this code without using UDP sockets and it works just fine.Thank you in advance, here's my code:Client.py:Server.py:Traceback (most recent call last): File"C:\Users\Myhat2you\Desktop\client.p", line 8, in         clientSocket.sendto(int(num1), func, int(num2)(serverName, serverPort))  TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
Problem is indeed here: According to docs, sendto accepts str, not int, str and int.However, traceback You got is there because You tried to call some int value as function (say num2 is "5", then, int(num2) will be 5, and You're calling 5(serverName, serverPort).If You want to send those values to server, I suggest one of the following:1) send them one by one2) send them as string separated by some special character (ie. |)
