I'm relatively new to python and would like to write clean code from the beginning. I need a parser of a string which formats a date in the form of "20140101" into "2014-01-01". How I achieved this is via:which works perfectly fine but looks not very clean. Maybe there is no other solution but if there is a more pythonic way to code it would be appreciated if you would share this!
Might have made a small error, but that should do the trick, given how you're doing this.See also pyformat.info for more information about Python's string formatting.Also, I suggest looking into the datetime module for more info about even more Pythonic ways of dealing with dates. ;)
You can use format, as mentioned by B. Eckles.  But you can also do:Using format seems unnecessary as you aren't actually using it for anything more than substituting portions of your string.
