Suppose I had the following subclass that I'm using to temporarily endow list with some extra methods,and then I do something likeNow, that is all well and good until I try to open the fileand I get a complaint that MyList doesn't exist. Is there a way to somehowget MyList to pickle as a plain list so that when I later try to loadthe pickle file, I don't get this missing class error? I would like the pickle file to only refer to the built-in list type.
I think what you wanted to do is to pickle the class instance and bundle up the class description in the pickled object.  pickle doesn't pickle a class description, but dill does.And then upon loading, it just works...
