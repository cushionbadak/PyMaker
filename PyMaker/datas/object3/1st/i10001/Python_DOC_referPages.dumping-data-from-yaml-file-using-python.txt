I have a YAML file like the following:I can parse the file using the following Python script:output:But I'm looking for is something like:
Your output doesn't match your input as the toplevel of your YAML file is a sequence that maps to a Python list.The other thing not entirely clear is where the workload and especially the 1 in workload1 come from. In the following I have assumed they come from  the key of the mapping that constitutes the sequence elements resp. the position of that sequence element (starting at 1, hence the idx+1).The name is popped from a copy of the values, so that the rest can be recursively dumped correctly:gives:This was done using ruamel.yaml, a YAML 1.2 parser, of which I am the author. If you only have YAML 1.1 code (as supported by PyYAML) you should still use ruamel.yaml as its round_trip_loader guarantees that your workload_param_p1 is printed before workload_param_p2 (with PyYAML that is not guaranteed).
