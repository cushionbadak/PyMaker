Natural Text
I am using Python 3.5.2. I took the following code from interactivepython website but when I test it to my IDLE (I saved it as a script, save->run) it throws a ValueError: substring not foundI replaced .index with .find and it worked but still the question remains...I know that str.index() does throw an error if it can't find anything. I am wondering if the code is correct, what am I missing here?
You could easily check out what you are missing by handling exception you get as follows:Now you will get the right log printed for each missing char.
