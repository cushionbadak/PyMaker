Given an array of ints, return True if the array contains a 2 next to a 2 somewhere.has22([1, 2, 2]) → Truehas22([1, 2, 1, 2]) → Falsehas22([2, 1, 2]) → FalseMy attempt at this was:Which results in Error: list index out of range. If anyone can explain why this is happening that'd be appreciated.
First, pairwise(). And then:
I like the pairwise idea, and here is other without importing anything The problem with your code is that not only will fail when 2 is the first or last element, it also will fail when the pair of 2s is not the with the first 2 like for example [1,2,3,2,2] because .index only give you the first position of the first 2.
