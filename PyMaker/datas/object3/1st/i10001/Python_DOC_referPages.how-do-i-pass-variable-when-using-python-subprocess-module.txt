I'm trying to use python Subprocess module to enable/disable Ethernet connection from python code. Below is my code in which the first step is looking for the available "Ethernet Connections" and the next step enables/disables the ethernet connection according to the parameter passed in "%interfaces%".Now when using in python I couldn't pass the variable, not sure if it's even possible though. Passing only command as below works as expected:I want to do something like:
subprocess.call takes a list as an argument:You could instead pass shell=True and your string would work, but it is a security risk, since an user could for example call another command by using $(command_here)If you still want to use a string, you could use shlex.split.
Use string formatting, interpolation, or concatenation:
