I have log a file:Then, when I run the following code, it does not print the dubug message. why is that?
Ah, I got it!You also need to set the level in your handlers.In your config file, your StreamHandler has level INFO. That means that even though your root logger l is going to emit the l.debug('adfa') message, the handler itself is not going to register it. This is intended so you can have a finer control on what messages to log. For instance, let's say you want to have two handlers: one that writes to the terminal and another that writes to a file. In the terminal, it might be OK to output everything, but you might get concerned the files get too big, right? So you create a FileHandler with its level set to WARN level, so you could place l.debug(...) statements in your code which would get printed to the console, but not to the file.If you don't wanna change your configuration file, you can do this:From the docs for Python 3.1 (bit older, but it looks like the sentence I'm gonna paste below was removed in the Python 3.5 docs)Why are there two setLevel() methods? The level set in the logger determines which severity of messages it will pass to its handlers. The level set in each handler determines which messages that handler will send on.
You've set your log level as INFO. You can replace:With
