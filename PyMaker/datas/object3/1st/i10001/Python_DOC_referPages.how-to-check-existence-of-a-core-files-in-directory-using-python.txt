This question already has an answer here:How do I check whether a file exists without exceptions?                    42 answers                I want to parsing some program's log and I want to check the existence of a core file in the log directory. Assume the path is the log directory, and core file names always begins with string core (e.g., name is core.20161027.183805.28273.0001.dmp). Then is there any directed API I can use to check a core file in the path directory? Thanks 
Use the built-in glob module:More reading here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html
This may be dupe, is this the solution?
Also os lib can do the trick for you, returns true or falseimport osos.path.exists(dir_or_file_to_check)
