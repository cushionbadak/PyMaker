Suppose we have The functions are given. It is not code that I can modify.We know they return either an integer or a sequence of them.I would like to assign the return to a variable, where the variable should take only the first of the integers if the return is a sequence of them.Is there a build-in syntactic device in Python that allows me to do this?Note: Assume that we don't know which of the functions return the sequence and which return just a number.
Is there a build-in syntactic deviceNo. The usual practice is to ask for forgivness:
I wouldnt go for try-except statement. To me it's an overkill.More likely I would try to do something like:
Going in the other direction, wrap f_2 in another function to ensure that the function called in the body of the loop always returns a sequence.The additional overhead of another function call may make this approach undesirable.
