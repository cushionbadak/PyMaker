Natural Text
I am wondering how to randomly change n characters in a string, e.g.that I want to randomly select two positions (orig[1] and orig[4]) in the string, and replace the chars in the positions of the original string (hello) with randomly selected chars (a and e here), results in a new string halle.

If you just want to change the different characters at random index in a string the below function will help. This script will ask for the input string(i.e., word) and the total places/ indexes ((i.e.,)value or 'n' places) you need to change with random characters, and this will print the modified string as needed.Output
