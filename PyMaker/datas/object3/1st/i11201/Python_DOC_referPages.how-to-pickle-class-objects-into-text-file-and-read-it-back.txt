Natural Text
As shown above, I have a object h1 of class Person needed to be saved as text file (.txt). I'm wondering how to fulfill this persistence and read it back?Some users suggested to use pickle, I think I probably need more detail here.
Here is a possible solution to get you started. I renamed the person instance name and changed the parameter to a name ;-)when being run on my machine and with python v2 this results in:Executed with Python v3:The default protocol has changed I guess :-)Please try to look up the details you might need for extending and fitting your use case at the normative documentation eg. 12.1. pickle â€” Python object serialization... and always take care, when unpickling, if the data might have been tempered with, as you have to rely on your trust what goes in through this channel. It is a powerful one.So like with JSON and other (de)serializing modules, there are methods optimized for strings, files etc. You can easily read that up in the docs. Here I used dumps() and loads() where the postfix s stands for string.For output of the content of the serialized person (here in a string variable) to a file and reading back in xou can easily look that up in aforementiioned excellent Python documentation.
