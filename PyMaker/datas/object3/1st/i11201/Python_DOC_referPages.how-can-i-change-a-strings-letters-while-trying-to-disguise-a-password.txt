I'm trying to create a simple username and password script in Python 3.5.1, and I cannot figure out how to make the user input a password, and then for it to be covered up with an asterisk so it cannot be read.This is my code so far:
Use the getpass module for this. getpass.getpass() allows the user to enter input without echoing (printing to the terminal).You may also want to look at getpass.user() for some of your program's functionality.
