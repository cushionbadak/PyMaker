So basically I have an "/add" route where it is used to manually seed in test user data to mongodb and I want to be able to pass that user's ID to the URL for the route "/agreement" so when the user is on the agreement page, their "_id" will be mapped to that URI and the info they enter on the agreement page will update their data that we seeded in the "/add" route.  I think the issue lies in the agreement resource where maybe I should write /agreement/<id> but I think I am missing a fundamental understanding of where the <id> is instantiated.  I also don't completely understand what the function of the agreement parameter is but I put (id) because this seems like something I would have to do in order to get the user's info passed to another resource.  I also think user = mongo.db.users.find("_id") might not be correct as well as return render_template('agreement.html', user=user).  Part of me thinks that maybe I should do redirect instead of render but if anyone can lend a hand I would greatly appreciate it.
Try this:URL parameter names in Flask are specified in the route parameter, and they have to match the decorated function's signature.Querying in Mongo is done by passing a dict specifying the constraints, so db.users.find_one({"_id": user_id}) will return a single result with _id matching the user_id variable.Edit: Actually, as per the documentation, you can just do:db.users.find_one(user_id).
