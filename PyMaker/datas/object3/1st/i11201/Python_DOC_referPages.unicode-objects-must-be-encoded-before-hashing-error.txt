Questions dealing with similar issues: SO 1, SO 2, SO 3.I've tried their answers, encoding pretty much any string to utf-8, but hmac still tells me to encode my unicoe chars. The biggest problem is that I can't even identify the offending variable; print outputs tell me they're either strings or bytes; in the case of the former I attach .encode(), but that hasn't helped. I'm trying to query the GDAX API and am also using the code as given on their API page. Being written for Python2.7, I figured there might be issues with encoding and all, but this is just not making sense to me.My code:The error:When I type check the objects I feed to my hmac.new() call, it tells me I have a str object and a bytes object.Naturally, I thought I need to encode that sucker too:which resulted in an error on this line:namely:..So I can't have unencoded unicode objects, but I cant have bytes later on either? How on earth do I fix this? Appreciating any help on this, because I'm profoundly confused.
"Parameter msg can be of any type supported by hashlib."."Note: Feeding string objects into  is not supported, as hashes work on bytes, not on characters.".Thus, your message must be of type bytes. Use .encode() on the message wich will give you the bytes object.Note: This is only necessary for python 3!To encode the digest to base64 use the base64 library.
