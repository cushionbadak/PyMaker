I'm trying to split a filename use it by parts. The file is always an apache binary (for example, httpd-2.2.31.tar.gz) and I only need the version (in this case 22) in that specific format.I have done it and it works, but I believe there should be a better wayIs it possible to do it in a better way?
if you want to do it in one line,may be it will help :will return 22
use reSee demo.Regex101 demoorPythex demo
You could make it a little easier by using regular expressions. There's a nifty site called Pythex where you can experiment with these yourself. To fix your example:
As far as a better way there is no such thing as long as your code solves the problem you set out to solve, and in this case it does. As far as performance goes there are probably faster ways to achieve the same thing but even with a list of thousands of string to parse the difference in speed would be minimal or indistinguishable. Therefore I assume you are instead asking for a different way to accomplish the same goal, so I have written a small function and several test segments. The function gives slightly more control.
