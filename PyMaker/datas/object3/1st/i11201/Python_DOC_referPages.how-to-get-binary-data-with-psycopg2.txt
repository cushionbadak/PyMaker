I have a column containing binary data. If I do fetchone() it is not giving me any data, instead I do fetchall() then get the result below. How can O get that binary data into a variable and then convert it into a base64 encoded string?
psycopg2 returns the binary data (probably stored in a bytea column in your table) in a buffer object in Python 2, or in a memoryview in Python 3.Both buffer and memoryview objects can be passed directly to a base64 string encoder, so this will encode the binary data in base 64:In Python 2, if you want the binary data itself you can use str() or slice with [:] the buffer object. In Python 3 you can use the tobytes() method of the memoryview object.
You need to read the buffer:
