How does while loop work in python when reading lines?so depending on the state variable while loop is executed, and type(state) can be bool,intbut to read lines from file using while as mentioned belowafter reading all lines finally line='' but type('') is strSo how did while loop terminate? I knew this could be done better using with and for , reason for not using while loop for this purpose would be helpful 
There are a few implicit boolean conversions in Python.1) bool(0) evaluates to False, any other integers evaluate to True2) bool(''), bool([]), bool({}) also evaluate to False. This is useful to test whether a container has any items in it (non-empty strings, lists, dicts etc. evaluate to True)So in your case readline read the empty string, which got implicitly turned to bool and evaluated to False, therefore the loop has terminated
Whenever you use a variable as a condition to an if or a while loop it is evaluated as a boolean value. In Python an empty string is treated as False, therefore the while loop terminates.reason for not using while loop for this purpose would be helpfulYou should ask for a reason to use a while loop for this purpose.Compare this:To that:
f.readline() is a generator object that returns '' at the end of the file. But '' has a falsy value:Hence, when the while evaluates the line at EOF (End Of File), the value is the same as False.The following values are considered False (see the docs):
Empty string is treated as False in python. So, it won't enter the loop. FYI the better way of looping over the lines is You can even do like this also.
You can add:or alternatively:
