I am new to Python and the syntax is really throwing me off. I need to execute a script in which I'd like to execute a function based on the arguments passed on Command Line. Following is the pseudo code:Can someone guide me how to structure this in Python's world or if there is any other way to do it?
If you must use sys.argv, it's just a normal Python list, you can use len on it to check how many arguments were passed (remember, the 0th element is the program itself).I'd recommend looking at something like the argparse module though; it's more work to learn, but it means your scripts get -h/--help support automatically, which makes it much easier to use the script, without implementing a usage message separately, risking it getting out of sync.Alternatively, if you are up for using third party packages, docopt is generally praised as an alternative to argparse.
I believe this is what you are looking for. sys.argv is the list containing your command line arguments. sys.argv[0] is typically the command you ran, so you're interested in the ones after that.
sys.argv will get you the arguments the script was called with e. g. if you run your script like this:sys.argv will be:Also the builtin len function will return the length of an array. So for the above example len should be 3.Knowing this you should be able to write your code.If you struggle getting this to work here is a hint:
The simplest thing that does what you ask could looks at the length of the list given by sys.argvYou seem to have noticed the first arg is the program itself.Think about what should happen if the wrong number of arguments is passed. Have a look at the argparse module
