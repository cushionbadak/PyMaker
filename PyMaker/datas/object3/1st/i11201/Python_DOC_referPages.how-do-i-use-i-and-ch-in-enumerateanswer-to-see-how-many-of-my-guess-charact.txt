Specifically: We are to print out how many of the guess character are exactly right (correct character in thecorrect position) andand how many of the guess characters are correct values but are not in the correctposition.Here's my code:
The line does not make all that much sense. Using enumerate, i is the position, that's fine, but ch is the character at that position. key[ch] does not make sense. Did you mean key.count(ch)? But even then there is no easy way to get the "correct value at incorrect position" part easily with enumerate. Consider the case of "abcd" and "baca": Here, a has different count in both strings, and yet that should be +1 for correct_countInstead, let me suggest this: For "correct value at correct position", just zip the two strings and compare the characters. The "correct value at incorrect position" case is a bit more difficult, but can be done by creating two Counter objects and &-ing those together.When calculating the totals, remember that the correct_count number includes the correct_position number, so you need to subtract those:
Down votes are coming because your criteria is not well defined, but I think that you are asking for a basic master-mind type problem. It is easy enough if you define your problem such that the hidden values do not repeat. If your hidden value, as I define it below can have repeating values than the problem gets more complex. It can be made to work - it just takes a bit more thought. Anyway, here is a basic implementation that I've tested on my box.
