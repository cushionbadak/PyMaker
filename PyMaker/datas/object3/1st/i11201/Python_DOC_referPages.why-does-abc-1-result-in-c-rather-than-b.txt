I thought that it started counting backwards from the start, so A is 0, B is -1 and C is -2.
As Henry pointed out, negative indices indicate counting from the right.Naturally, A is 0, B is 1 and C is 2, when counting from the left:When going backwards, -1 is the end of the array, like so:For more context, look at it like this, as if two copies were lined up:According to the documentation String and List objects support negative indices, but Range objects to not. 
A negative index means "start counting from the right". Put another way: sequence[0] is the start of the sequence, why would you expect sequence[-1] to be anything other than the end of the sequence?
