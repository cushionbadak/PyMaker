I am new to Python and I have difficulties in the basics of functionsa.pyb.pyI am using IntelliJ IDE 
import is not #include.  It automatically namespaces everything to the imported name.  Your first example should look like thisNotice how I had to do b.B() to get the B class, because it was namespaced to b, the module that was imported.Python is not staticly-typed.  You could pass any object into B.method2().  You're expecting your editor to auto-complete for the SafeConfigParser object because that's what you're passing to it in A, but that's just one instance.  Python (and your editor) has no way of knowing all the possible types of your arguments you may pass to method2() (unless you're using type hinting, which is a fairly new feature, and still doesn't enforce variable types, it would simply be for display purposes in your editor).
There are two possible reasons:The hint doesn't show up because this code has typos and will not run anyway. You're missing () after method1 and a colon after method2(config). Also your B class will not be automatically visible, you should refer to it as b.B in your a.py file.Your editor doesn't guess at all the possible program flows. For example you could call method2 from some other place with a string or integer or anything else as a parameter. The editor is just guessing here, so it's just as likely to not give you any hints.Without saying what the editor is, it's hard to say what the real reason is. Fix the code first, then look for specific answers.If you're using python > 3.5, then you can use type hints which may help as well. (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
You can something similar to what you're looking for with the dir() function in python3. This will print everything that's in the scope of the variable. Just change your b.py file to this:
