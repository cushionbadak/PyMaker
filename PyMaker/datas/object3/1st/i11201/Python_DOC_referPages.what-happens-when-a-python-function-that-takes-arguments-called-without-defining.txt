When this code is run, why a exception is not thrown since the function compare called within sort function has not been given exactly two arguments?when the code is run it gives the output as,
You are not calling directly the functionYou are passing to the sort function a 'pointer' or a 'reference' to the function that will be used as a comparatorif you need more debugging info add a line that print what is being compared as followand you will also notice that the number of calls depends on L dis-orderthere are several ways to solve the problem of order an arraysome of that are merge-sort , binary-sort and still othersthis is the link to the source code of python list object
You are not calling compare in L.sort(compare). You are just passing a reference to the function that will be called internally by sort. You don't need any other arguments for that. Remember that in order to call a function you use (), so if you were actually calling it you would have written L.sort(compare())
