Below is my complete code for binary search written in python3 version.I was able to:-i) create a list, ii) sorted the list using bubble sort algorithm, iii)wrote code snippet for searching a number using binary search, But while searching for any number (which is present/not present in the list), my code goes into an infinite loop and does not gives any result. I tried looking for the error,But was unable to debug the code.Also, how to get the index of the number in list? I thought of using list.index() method. Can it work in case of sorted list or my index number output will be wrongly displayed? 
The infinite loop is from the lineI think what you meant wasThe error was that the case list[mid]<target would happen, but since low is being changed not last, mid never changes the case will be triggered again on the next iteration.EDIT: Also note that mid is the index of the number in the list
