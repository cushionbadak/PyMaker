In a Python CGI environment, I used the following code to print values from a GET/POST request:The output is:Here, I supplied the name parameter with a value of 'john', and I got it as expected.But why are the first two values None?  What are they used for, and what do they hold?
According to the source of the cgi.py module, the FieldStorage.__repr__ method is:Both name and filename are optional values.  For FieldStorage, the are set automatically from the content-disposition header, if any.name seems to be used as the key for this FieldStorage when using the dict-style methods like keys and __getitem__.filename is used by CGI scripts that accept file uploads.If you get a MiniFieldStorage ("for use when no file uploads are possible"), it's __repr__ is just:Same as above, minus the filename field.  Unlike FieldStorage, it takes the value of name in __init__ and does nothing with it except repeat it in __repr__.  (It's probably also used as a dictionary key... somewhere.)The doc-strings for these two classes are, frankly, much better than what you can find in the cgi module's official docs.  (Also, the FieldStorage class does a lot of different things, making it hard to describe in words.)
