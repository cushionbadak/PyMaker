Python 3 seems to have some arbitrary limit to Decimal sizes that Python 2 does not. The following code works on Python 2:But on Python 3 I get:Increasing the precision does not help. Why is this happening? Is there something I can do about it?
It would appear that Decimals actually can't hold arbitrarily long numbers: Indeed, I never heard that arbitrarily long numbers was the point of Decimal - just proper rounding and decimals of arbitrary precision. If you want an arbitrarily long number, that's what longs are for, and in Python3 that's just what you've got.(Though it takes a long long while to compute this. My Mac book with I believe a core i5 still hasn't finished after a couple of minutes. Heck, even the string 1, followed by all those zeroes, is going to be really really big.)For further kicks and grins, I discovered that you can configure the overflow value, apparently, though you still can't get such a whopping big number:
