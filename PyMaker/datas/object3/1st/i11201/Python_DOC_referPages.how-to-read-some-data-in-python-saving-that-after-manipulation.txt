Suppose I read a file a csv file as a nested list in python. data in python looks like this:and so on. Suppose I have to do some cleaning with data in python( for several purpose). Data continues to look as a nested list in python. Now I want to take this data and export into a csv file so I can read them later without doing any cleaning process. Csv file would look like a classic excel file: for example first listshould be first row of the csv file and so on.In which way should I proceed?
