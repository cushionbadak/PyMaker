I need to have static or external list, that will be used by every object of A class. The values of the list need to be initialized only once and should be taken from constructor parameters, e.g:How to make this work? Maybe it is better to move the static_member to another module? Or is it possible to write to static_member in __init__ function?
If you want the static member to be initialized from the first object of the class, you could initialize it to None in class definition, and test its value in instance constructor:
It seems like you actually want to provide x and y when the class is created, not when an instance is created. If all instances will share the same values, you do not need to provide them as parameters to __init__.Depending on how complex your class is you may need to use a metaclass for this, but with such a simple example you can just use type:This creates the class you want and all of the instances share the state you're expecting:* Note that I needed to add the line static_to_return = [] to initialize to get this to run.
