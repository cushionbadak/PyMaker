So  every time I move my project to another machine or just reinstall python i need to download them again. So my question is. Is there a way to store necessory modules in the project folder and use them from it without moving to default python installation folder. 
You can use virtual environment or docker to install the required modules in your project dir so it is isolated from your system Python installation. In fact, you don't need Python installed on your machine when using docker.Here is my workflow when developing Django web app with Docker. If your project dir is in /Projects/sampleapp, change the current working directory to the project dir and run the following.Run a docker container from your terminal:On the container's shell, install the required packages:The --user options along with the PYTHONUSERBASE environment variable will make pip installs the packages in /app/.vendors.Create the django project and develop the app as usual:The directory structure will look like this:This configuration enables you to install the packages in your project dir, isolated from your system. Note that you need to add requirements.txt to your VCS, but remember to exclude .vendors/ dir.When you need to move and run the project on another machine, run the docker command above and reinstall the required packages on the container's shell:
