I'm implementing component tests for a web service. I want to use the class method setUpClass(cls): to start my web service only once in the beginning, however setUpClass(cls): is executed before each of my test cases. Why? The documentation says it is executed only once before the test cases are executed. Any ideas?I'm using Python 3.5.
Looking at the Python tools for Visual Studio source code, the VS test runner runs each test case entirely in isolation.Each test case is run as a separate command-line invocation of the Python interpreter (using a custom test launcher, passing in the module and test name for each), which is why the class setup and teardown are called for each test. Python is never given the opportunity to run these tests together.If this matters to you, you'll have to file a ticket with the Python Tools project; I see no relevant open ticket for the test adapter at this time.Alternatively, run your tests with a different test runner. You could use the built-in unittest command line, for example:or pick any of the popular tools available.
