I have a source code of 500Mb having more than 5K of files written in Python. Sometimes I get exception messages but no idea about the line number and file name of exception. Even sometimes exceptions are not seen on terminal unlit I specifically use pdb.Is there any convenient way to get to know about the exception location ?  Thanks.
Try the traceback module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.htmlIt contains the tb_lineno function which takes the traceback as a parameter, returning the line number of the exception. EDIT:
