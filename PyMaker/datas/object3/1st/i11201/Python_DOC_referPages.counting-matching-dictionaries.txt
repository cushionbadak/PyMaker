I have a list containing dictionaries:I wish to count the incidents of each dict and create a new field countThe desired outcome looks like this:I am unsure how to match dicts.
You can pass your list of dicts as the data arg to DataFrame ctor:you can then groubpy on the cols and call size to get a count:and then call to_dict:You can wrap the above into a list:You can reset_index, rename the column and pass arg orient='records':
This is a job for collections.Counter. But first you have to convert your dicts to actual tuples, as dicts are not hashable and thus can not be used as keys in a Counter object:Then, you can turn those back into dicts with the added "count" key:
You can use Counter and frozenset for this:
You can achieve that easily with  code belowAnother option is to use counter. There are plenty of answers of how to dial with collections.Counter :)Good Luck!
