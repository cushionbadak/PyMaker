Natural Text
I have a query which users order_by on a number of aggregated fields in a database, like so:I'm using this is several places within my code and I'd rather have it in some centralized place.I was wondering the best way in django to reuse this.
You can add a manager to your model class to include that as a base filter.For example:With this you can simply do:You can find more about managers hereOne big advantage of doing this over having the queryset written down somewhere is that you can still chain the queryset with additional filters / parameters and you comply with the django standard
