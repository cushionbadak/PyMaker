Shouldn't the below lambda expression return a list? Currently, it isn't.
append is a side-effecting function; it appends a value to an existing list without returning a value (or None, depending on how you want to think of it).Perhaps you want:This creates a new list from the existing list with an element appended at the end.
list.append() does not return a value but because the python list is a mutable object, 3 will indeed be appended, it just doesn't get returned.For example this will work:If you do not want to modify t you can writeas the lambda will not modify the list t but just return a new list.
the function append returns None so your lambda returns None, too. Also the append changes the local variable l only
