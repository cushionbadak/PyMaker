I am taking a class and i'm confused. It would really help if you could guide me through the proccess of this and tell me what I am doing wrong. I have an error that has to do with the parentheses since theres nothing in them. I am a newbie so i'm sorry.
Your function is taking in arguments a, b, c, and d, but you're not using them anywhere. You're instead defining four new variables. Try:and get rid of your empty parentheses bits, see if that does what you are trying to do.
you cannot declare a variable as you are doing n = () and then try to assign an integer or string to it. n=() does not mean:n equals nothing at the moment but i will assign a  variable shortly.() ---> Tuples  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlThey are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types â€”  list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other  sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard  sequence data type: the tuple.so within your function, if you want you varialbes to be assigned what is passed as an argumentfor Ex:consider reading more on tuples from the above link
n=() is a valid python statement and there is no issue with that. However n=() is evaluating n to an empty tuple(). I believe that what you are trying to do is as follows. here is a simpiler way of writing the same function
