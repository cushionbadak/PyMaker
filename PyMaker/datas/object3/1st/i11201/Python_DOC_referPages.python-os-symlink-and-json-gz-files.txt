I am creating a symlink with Python. First, I check if the file exists and then create the symlink.However, when I ran a script that required this symlink, it failed. On inspection with finder I get The operation can’t be completed because the original item for “nodes1.json.gz” can’t be found.I am sure I have the right paths and it is correctly setting the symlink. Is there an issue with using .gz files?
symlink paths are relative to the directory where the symlink lives. Your real file is two levels up from the current directory but your symlink is only one level up and then an extra level deep. If I make up names for your parent directories, it would be something likeYour symlink should be one more level deepA good way to check symlinks is to go into the directory holding the link and then follow it to see where things go wrong.
Unless you specify the dir_fd argument to the os.symlink() function, you need to specify the absolute path for both src and dst argument.
