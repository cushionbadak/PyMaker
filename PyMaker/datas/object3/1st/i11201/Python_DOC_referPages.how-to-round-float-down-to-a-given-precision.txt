Something like this should work for whatever number of digits you want to do:
You've got a friend in quantize and ROUND_FLOOR Note that you can use ROUND_DOWN for positive numbers. As interjay mentions in a comment, ROUND_DOWN Rounds towards zero and hence may return incorrect values for negative numbers. 
You can use math.floor to "round down" to the nearest whole number. So to round to the 3rd decimal place, you can try math.floor(1000*number) / 1000.In general, to "round down" a number num to precision n, you can try:
You can also play around this using stringsPatch the code with more checks like precision is not negative among others.
