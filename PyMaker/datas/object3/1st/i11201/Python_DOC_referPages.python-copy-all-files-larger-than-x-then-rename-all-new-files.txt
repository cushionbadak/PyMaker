I need a script to copy all files larger than 5mb from a given folder to a new folder that the script needs to create on desktop. Then it needs to rename all files in increasing order also changing extension. For example files: slides.ppt, math.doc, essay.docxto:lec1.doc, lec2.doc, lec3.docI got this script to work and it lists all files larger than 5mb:Now this prints out the list and the list is correct but how can I go from here?I looked into os and glob but I'm having a hard time figuering this out.Thank you guys for helping out.Dany
Try the shutil package. It handles high level file operationswhere source and destination might be files or folders.Just set destination to the final name of the file, instead of copying and then renaming.
You can use the rename method from oswhere the src is the original file or directory name and dst is the new name.
