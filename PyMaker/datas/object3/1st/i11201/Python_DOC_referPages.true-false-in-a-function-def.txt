I understand what the function below does, but I don't quite get the significance (or difference) between returning True and False.Both clauses make the program exit; i.e. upon entering a positive or negative response, the Python prompt is returned, so what actually changes internally?Also, if I were to design such a function myself, should I use True or False if I just wanted the program to return the prompt to me without actually doing anything?
Functions rarely get used alone. Returning True or False here is to help the rest of your program determine what to do. For example:However, if your function is designed to return to the prompt, you can use sys.exit() to return a success code that calling programs (vs functions) can take advantage of.
Since the user's answer can be one of two sides y or n, yes or no, y or nope, yes or nope, y or no in any order, the function simply maps this list of dichotomies into a simple True or False. So you can use the function as a condition to perform an action.Without having to re-evaluate the user's original verbose response.This is quite consistent with the idea of ensuring a function has only one function, which in this case is to booleanise a user's response or throw an error if the response is inconsistent after a number of trials
