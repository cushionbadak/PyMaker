Natural Text
I have found a script on GitHub that I want to edit for my own use. The original script is https://github.com/PoorBillionaire/sitereviewThe idea I want to implement in my fork is to look up a list of websites in a text file instead of manually typing into the python script each time to check a site and then output results to a file.So, I have started to research this and thing that I need to add some options into the scriptso this would allow to use where as at the moment it is but what i don't understand is how to tell the script to go to the file and check the first line and get the results and dump it to the file, then go back and check the next line on the input file and go and dump that etc, until there are no most lines to process..Can someone point me where to look to work this out or provide a sample of the bits I need and I can try to edit them into the fork I am practicing on?
