This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between rb and r+b modes in file objects                    4 answers                This was in Python: reading in a csv file and saving columns as variables. I couldn't comment, but I'm really confused. What does 'rb' mean? 
It means: Read the file in Binary mode.For a complete list of options view this.
From open() in the Built-in functions documentation:open(name[, mode[, buffering]])The most commonly-used values of mode are 'r' for reading, (...) Thus,  when opening a binary file, you should append 'b' to the mode value  to open the file in binary mode, which will improve portability.So this opens the file to read in a binary mode.
The second argument o open() is the mode the file will be opened in. 'rb' is for Read Binary mode. Read more about it here
