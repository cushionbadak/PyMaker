Natural Text
I'm writing a small RPG in Python, and I want my different world objects to have varying colors.  I've tried exploring colorama and some similar modules; however, the string always prints as a small box with some numbers and letters in it, instead of, let's say, a blue '~' character for a water tile.  I create my world arrays with a variable that looks like this: I then add world objects to it through a few different functions, to structure a random-esque world environment, like this one: This is of course all stored within a class object. This function is how I create randomized oceans within the world, by calling replacetiles(gamemap, 9, 0, 5, '~', 3) which would replace a few of the indexes with '~'.How would I be able to change the output color of the '~' within the game map? EDIT: My question seems much more specific than the other thread listed.  The problem I am having, is when I print text through colorama, or any of the answers below or in the other thread, in a stand alone file simply printing colored text, it works.  However, when I use that same code to change the color of the char argument in replacetiles, I get this odd box icon, regardless of the method I used to change the color of the string text.Here is a screen shot:
You can use this package called termcolor, instead of hard coding the values.
You can add ASCII escape codes to the strings you add to your worldArray. To make your water blue, just replace grid[row][i] = char with grid[row][i] = "\033[34m" + char + "\033[0m".For more color codes, see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#ColorsYou can then print your world using:
