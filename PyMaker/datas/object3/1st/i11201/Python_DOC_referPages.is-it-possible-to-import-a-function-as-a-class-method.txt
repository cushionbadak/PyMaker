I'm wondering if this is even possible. Let's say, there are two files. in a.py:in b.py:I'd like to import a function x() from b.py to a.py's class A so that the class A has a method x.so that i can use like thisThank you!
If the functions signature doesn't allow for an instance of A to be passed as the first argument the best you can do is make them staticmethods:However if you had functions that could take an A instance as the first argument then it would just be:
Why not try it?a.pyb.pyYikes, that didn't work!But that's simple enough to fix, methods expect a class instance to be passed to them! Let's just modify b.py...b.py, modifiedExecuting this will print:Hi, I'm x!Remember to try before you post - often the answer is as simple as "Yes, just do it!" :)
