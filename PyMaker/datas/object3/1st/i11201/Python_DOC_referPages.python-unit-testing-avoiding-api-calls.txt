I've written some code that makes calls to the SalesforceIQ API.  I'm now trying to unit test my code (writing a unit test for each of my functions).  I'm a little unsure how to go about this since I need to do something to avoid making API calls.Here's an example function I'm trying to test:contact.update() is an API call.  So I'd like to avoid calling contact.update() while still testing update_contact is updating those three fields (name, phone, address).Any recs for how to go about this?Thanks!
You can use patch (mock.patch in python2, unittest.mock.patch in python3) to patch that method:Python documentation.
Is there a __repr__() or __str__() method for the Contact object? If not, why not write one? Then you can just print the contact and see what it is. Or do something else with the string it returns if you want to further automate your testing.
