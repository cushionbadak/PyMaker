I am creating a picture and I use numpy. I tried something like that but got an error    data = np.zeros((pic.size[0], pic.size[1],2),dtype= [[(0,0,0)],])I am trying to make it look likehow can i do it? i need to put this data in the putdata() methodwhich get matrix of tuples.
You can create a NumPy array of zeros, split it at 3rd index and then map them to tuple with a loop comrehension, like so -Sample run -
When I test your first line I get an errorDoes that expression run for you or not?  You make it sound like it does.  If it doesn't you should be clear about the error.But what exactly do you mean by a matrix of tuples? Just something that displays You mention a putdata method.  What package are you talking about? Not numpy.I can create a structure array that displays like thisTechnically this doesn't contain tuples, though it uses the tuple syntax.  Converting it to a list may be better.This last result is a nested list - list of lists of tuples.But is really important that the inner elements be tuples?Often in Python lists and tuples are interchangeable.  We need to know more about that putdata method.===============I'm guessing from a search that putdata is a PIL method.In that case, this works:im.putdata(np.ones((10,10),dtype='i,i,i').tolist()) doesn't work; it looks like the data has to be a flat listim.putdata([(0,1,0)]*100) also works, since it is just a simple list replication of the tuple.
