I do not succeed to create a python 3 virtualenv. This is what I get:I am running OS X 10.11.4
You are using the virtualenv for Python 2.7 to create a virtual environment for Python 3.5, which I don't think will work.Instead of virtualenv, On Python 3.3+ you could use the built-in pyvenv tool to create a virtual environment instead.
