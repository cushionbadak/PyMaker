Situation: I'm new to python and currently trying to learn the ropes, I've attempted creating a linked list class to assist in getting a better understanding of the language and its structures. I know that the __repr__ function is basically supposed to return the same thing as __str__ but I'm unsure on what the actual difference is. Here's my class so far: When I test this code against the below code, I'll get an error basically saying the blank string '[]' isn't actually being returned when using the repr function. How could I edit this methods body to fix this issue? I've also tried return str(self) and I'm not sure why that won't work either.
The __repr__ function returns a string representation of a Python object that may be evaluated by the Python interpreter to instantiate another instance of the object. So if you had a list:Its __repr__ string would be:And you could do:It's a way to get a string representation of a Python object that can be converted back into a new instance of said object.Basically the difference between __str__ and __repr__ is that the former returns a string representation of the object meant to be read by a person and the latter returns a string representation of the object meant to be parsed by the Python interpreter. Be very careful with this!In your example code, it appears that __str__ and __repr__ return the same string representation. That's fine. However, if you wanted, you could make your __str__ return some prettier formatted version (for instance with carriage returns and no brackets), but __repr__ should always return a string that could be parsed by the Python interpreter to reconstruct the object.
