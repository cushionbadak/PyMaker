This question already has an answer here:How do I properly override __setattr__ and __getattribute__ on new-style classes in Python?                    2 answers                I want to override the __setattr__ method on python classes using python 3.4.3. I found this answer but it does not seem to work as I get an error. The full code is as follows: and the error isI assume the attribute x cannot be set as it is not yet defined. And the line trying to define this atribute (in __init__) cannot define the attribute, as it calls the overwritten method...How to define the attribute x without implicity calling the overwritten __setattr__ method then?
super doesn't need arguments in Python3 (at least in the case of overriding instance methods):is the equivalent of Python2'swhich still works though.
You called super with just the class, which is valid in some cases, but in this case you wanted super for the instance.  In Python 2, you would call it with the class and self, in Python 3 you can call it without arguments.
