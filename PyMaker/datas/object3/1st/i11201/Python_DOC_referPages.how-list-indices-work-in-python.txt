My question is why "and" here have the same index of 0 instead of 0, 3, 5?WhyIt's because list.index() returns the index of the first occurrence, so since "and" first appears in index 0 in the list, that's what you'll always get.SolutionIf you want to follow the index as you go try enumerate()Which gives the output you want:
Use enumerate. Output 
From the Python documentation, index returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the list:list.index(x)Return the index in the list of the first item whose value is x. It is an error if there is no such item.
