Can you explain the this constructor of deque:I saw it's documentation but couldn't find this form being used anywhere.
class collections.deque([iterable[, maxlen]])Returns a new deque object initialized left-to-right (using append())  with data from iterable. If iterable is not specified, the new deque  is empty.In your example , buff = collections.deque([], 100),creates a new empty deque object buff, specified by the first argument, with maxlen 100. It means the deque object is bounded to a maximum length of 100.Here is the link to the documentation, it's explained nicely and pretty clear.
