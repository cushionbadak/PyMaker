I have a python program, and I want to get the path to the program from within the program, but INCLUDING the file name itself. The name of my file is PyWrapper.py. Right now I'm doing this:The output is:This is the path to the directory in which my file is saved, but I would like it to output:Which is the path, including the filename itself. Is this possible? Thanks.
should work.  __file__ returns the path of the executed file
Take a look at __file__. This gives you a filename where the code actually is.Also, there's another option:This gives you a filename of a script being run (similar to what your argv does).The difference comes into play when the code is imported by another script.
Just in case you would like to find the absolute path for other files, not just the one you are currently running, in that same directory, a general approach could look like this:As others are mentioning, you could take advantage of the __file__ attribute. You can use the __file__ attribute to return several different paths relevant to the currently loaded Python module (copied from another StackOverflow answer):When a module is loaded in Python, file is set to its name. You can then use that with other functions to find the directory that the file is located in.Remember to be wary of where the module you are loading came from. It could affect the contents of the __file__ attribute (copied from Python 3 Data model documentation):__file__ is the pathname of the file from which the module was loaded, if it was loaded from a file. The __file__ attribute may be missing for certain types of modules, such as C modules that are statically linked into the interpreter; for extension modules loaded dynamically from a shared library, it is the pathname of the shared library file.
try using __file__. as long as the module is ran from a file, i.e. not code in an editor, __file__ will be the abs path to the module!Or for command line.
