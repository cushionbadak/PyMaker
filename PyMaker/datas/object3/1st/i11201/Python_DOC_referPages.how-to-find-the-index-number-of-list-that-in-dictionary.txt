Then, you would have quick O(1) lookups into the dictionary by key.But, in this state of the problem, you can solve it with zip() and next():Note that if the amount would not be found, next() would fail with a StopIteration exception. You can either handle it, or you can provide a default beforehand:
You can try this :Thanks to index(), you are able to get the index of the required value (914.25 in this case).
