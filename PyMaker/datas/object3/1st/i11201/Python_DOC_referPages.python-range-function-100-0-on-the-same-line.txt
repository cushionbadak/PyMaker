Natural Text
so one of my assignments is to make a program in python to countdown 100 - 0 in increments of 10, i wrote the code but cannot figure out how to make it work on the same line instead of it using multiple lines to countdown. here is what i have so far.
Use str.join,Or use print with the argument end=' ', as mentioned by @PadraicCunningham, but notice that there is one more space at the end, as pointed by @user2357112.
You can pass an end=" " parameter to printThis will override the default newline character '\n'
