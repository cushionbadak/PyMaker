I am trying to write a small script that will allow me to see information related to the cookies set by my website.I want to know if it has secure or httpOnly flags set on them. But so far I wasn't able to do it, I only figured out how to get cookie names and values. Here is my current code:So far this works fine, but I want to get information related to the cookies, not the value itself. Cookie meta-data if you will.How can I achieve that?
You can extract the information from each cookie individually:This is because r.cookies is an instance of RequestsCookieJar which extends from CookieJar (Python 2: cookielib.CookieJar, Python 3: http.cookiejar.CookieJar). A CookieJar has Cookie objects.References:cookielib: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/cookielib.htmlcookielib.Cookie.secure: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/cookielib.html#cookielib.Cookie.securehttps://stackoverflow.com/a/27523891/295246Update:I have not found a way to retrieve the httponly value from a Cookie object. In Python 3, you can define a Mosel object via a dictionary, and it considers httponly to be a standard attribute of a cookie (https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html), but I couldn't find any reference to httponly in the defining specification RFC2109 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt).That said, if httponly is in fact a non-standard attribute, then you can use the following to check if a cookie has it:cookie.has_nonstandard_attr('httponly')
