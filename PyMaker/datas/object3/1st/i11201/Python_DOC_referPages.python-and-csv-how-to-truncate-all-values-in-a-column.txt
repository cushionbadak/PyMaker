Given a simple CSV file like this:How do you truncate all the values in the last column so that only the first three digits remain?  (unrelated:  so they can be used in math operations)Desired CSV:Here is what I have tried so far:I've verified the regex in re.sub works correctly.  Have tried dozens of variations, many hours searching, but cannot get the desired output.
Without using re module,As @TigerRedMike pointed out in Python 3.X, instead of 'rb' and 'wb', 'r' and 'w' should be used respectively to read and write the files.

First thing is re.sub returns a new value, it doesn't replace the value in the row.secondly, row is a running variable, you should handle this within the loop.Here your code modified to work correctly (for python3):
re.sub returns the string with the substitution. it does not affect the third argument itself
