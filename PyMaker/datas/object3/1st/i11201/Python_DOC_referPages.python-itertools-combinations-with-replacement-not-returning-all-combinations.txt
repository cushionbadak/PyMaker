I have written a simple python program:This outputs the following:However for it to be all combinations of the numbers 1 2 and 3, it would need to include:And as you can see above, it does not.  I have seen other posts giving the  combinations_with_replacement function given as the solution to get all possible combinations of the characters passed in.  Yet this does not seem to be happening.  What am I doing wrong here, and how can I get all possible combinations of the characters in the characters variable?Thanks for your time ;-)
"combinations" is an order-insensitive term; if you have 113, then you don't need 131 or 311, because all of them are the same "combination" (if the input sequence to combinations_with_replacement is unique, you could view the outputs as being all unique values after converting to collections.Counter; regardless of order, two 1s and a 3 is just collections.Counter({1: 2, 3:1})).If you want an order sensitive version of combinations_with_replacement (so 113, 131 and 311 are all separate outputs), use itertools.product with the repeat argument (repeat must be passed by keyword due to design of product, where it takes variable length positional arguments):
