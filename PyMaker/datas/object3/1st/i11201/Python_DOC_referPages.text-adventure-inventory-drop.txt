I am making a rogue-like game and was wondering if there was a way to allow a player to drop an item by entering: Drop [Item Name]Drop being the command and the item name being one located in your inventory, e.g. if I had a rock that I wanted to get rid of I would input: Drop Rock.
Since you're using numbered slots (rather than e.g. "bag", "pocket") a simpler approach would be to use a list for your inventory. You can index into a list, and find items in a list by value, easily.I would also suggest you use None or at least an empty string "" to represent the empty slot ( as these both equate to False:You can then adapt your function as follows:Note that because Python indexing is zero-based, if you want to allow the user to enter 1 for the first slot, rather than 0, you will need to subtract one from the provided value.To print the inventory in a nice list you could use something like the following. The i or "Empty" cosntruction might be new to you:In i or "Empty" we make use of the falsey value of an empty string together with or shortcutting. If i is True the value in i will be shown, if it is False (e.g. empty string) the value after the or will be printed instead. An equivalent without this would be:Finally, an example of a drop_by_name function, where you use .index() to find the location of something in your list Inventory and remove it:
you might want to take a look at cmd, which makes command handling much easieryou can create functions for each command, that are then being called
I took it one step further than @mfitzp and made it all one line of code so that Drop Stick will drop a stick. Here is the code I used:
