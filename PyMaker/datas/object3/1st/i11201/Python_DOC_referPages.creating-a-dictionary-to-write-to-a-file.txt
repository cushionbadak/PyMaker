Natural Text
I am trying to change the format in which a file is written. The file is written in a generic file format. I am putting headers into the file and writing it so that it can be read by another program in the future by simply using a pandas dictionary or an xarray datarray. In order to do this, I am trying to make columns in the file that are more separate than what I have now. I have the following code:I am not overly familiar with dictionaries and so it has been a bit difficult to come up with the code I have. I know there may be inconsistencies/errors.
