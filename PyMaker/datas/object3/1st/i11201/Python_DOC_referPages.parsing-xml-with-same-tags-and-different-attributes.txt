I have a network file created from osm using Netconvert. The root element is edge with different attributes. For example, in the first part of the file, the edges are organized as follows.In the second part, the attributes of the edge file changes and it looks like belowAs you can see, there are different attributes for the element edge. When I try to access the elements using the following code,I get a KeyError:'from'When I change the key to 'function' instead of 'from', the code prints me multiple lines of 'internal' and when it approaches the end of the first part, it again throw meKeyError: 'function'.I understand that I have to selectively iterate through the edges in which the attribute 'from' is present, but have no idea on how to proceed. Can someone help?Thanks
Python's get() method for dictionaries is very helpful in these situations because it returns None when a key isn't found in a dict.
You have tagged this lxml so there are much simpler ways to to selectively iterate through the edges in which the attribute 'from' is present , you can use the following xpath to find all the edges that have the from attribute:If you want to check for having multiple attributes you can use and:
You could detect wich part of the file you are proccessing by the presence of the attributes e.g.:If one of the edges suddendly does not contain one of the attributes this will sort it out and return an error (or just print it and continue), instead of returning None like in gr1zzly be4r's answer.
