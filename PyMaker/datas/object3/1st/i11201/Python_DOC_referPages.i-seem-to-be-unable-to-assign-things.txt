Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Python: can't assign to literal                    8 answers                I'm trying to write a text adventure. At the beginning, it asks whether a person is male or female. If they input "male", I want it to use the words him, his and he. if they input "female", I want it to use the words her and she etc.I want the words to show up when I put in the numbers for example:This should say "he went with him", or "she went with her", But it doesn't.
This is an example of how it could look like.
Python variable name rules:Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_)Other characters can be letters, numbers or _Case SensitiveCan be any (reasonable) lengthThere are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.from here
