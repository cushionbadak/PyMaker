This question already has an answer here:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'float' and 'float'                    1 answer                I'm trying to convert a continuous variable to a categorical variable using the following code:but I get the following error:I would've though that float and numpy.float64 would be compatible but that doesn't seem to be the case.Any help in this regard would be much appreciated. TIA.
Here x>=0.25 & x<0.5 & performs a bitwise AND operation (for example, 1 & 52 is zero, which will be treated as False), while you certainly meant to check whether both x>=0.25 and x<0.5 are true.So, do this:The same mistake is on the next line.
