I'd like to sort the output of this by words that appeared the greatest number of times to words that appeared the least number of times.  How can this be accomplished?    
Simply use Counter. It will both shorten your code and get you the ordering that you want.Quoting from the documentation:A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is an  unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and  their counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to be  any integer value including zero or negative counts. The Counter class  is similar to bags or multisets in other languages.
You can view the sorted dictionary using operator.itemgetter():Output:
This should do it for you:-
