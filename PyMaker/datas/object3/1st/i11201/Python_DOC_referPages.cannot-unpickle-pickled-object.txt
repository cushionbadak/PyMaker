This question already has an answer here:How to pickle a ssl.SSLContext object                    1 answer                Running Python 3.4.3 on linux.I don't do much pickling, so forgive me if this is well know.I had a bit of a look around the only I found this about pickle in the What's new In Python 3.4 which suggests this should work. Other than that just issues pickling between different python versions.I also tried setting pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL but this didn't help either.(BTW I've already worked around this issue but I'm curious why it does not work.)
Classes that take extra arguments to __new__ need to provide a __getnewargs__ method to tell pickle what the extra arguments are.You can monkey-patch SSLProtocol to add a __getnewargs__ method:The new feature of pickle in Python 3.4 is that it also supports a __getnewargs_ex__ method that can supply keyword arguments for __new__; but classes still need to provide __getnewargs__ and/or __getnewargs_ex__ themselves.
