I am trying to get a Python module called MTpy to run on my computer; this package allows handling and processing of magnetotelluric (geophysical) data.I am using Python 3.5 with the Anaconda/Spyder IDE under Windows 10. I am just getting started with Python so I apologize if my question seems trivial!My problem is, I can import the mtpy module and all of its submodules, but then I cannot call any of the functions contained in these subfolders.For instance, mtpy contains a submodule called analysis.I can successfully run:Running will return:However when trying to access the distortion.py function contained in the analysis folder, I get the following error message:FYI, both my module (mtpy) and submodule folders (e.g. analysis) contain the init file.  Many thanks for your help!Cheers,Sheldon
distortion.py isn't a function it's a sub package of analysis and it's not callable. You can methods which is defined in mtpy.analysis.distortion. You can get more info on python 3 modules tutorial.Good luck!
