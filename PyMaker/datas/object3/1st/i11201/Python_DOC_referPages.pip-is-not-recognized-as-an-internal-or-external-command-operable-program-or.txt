I'm trying to install Tweepy using pip, but I keep getting this as the response:I've seen similar problems and people always suggest adding C:\Python34\Scripts to your PATH. Here is what happens when I try and do that:Then when I do echo %PATH% it doesn't show the path that I added. Using pip still does not work. How do I make it to where I am able to use pip? I looked through multiple other questions that were VERY similar to mine, but none of the solutions worked.Thanks for the help in advance!
I would recommend using this guide for adding a new folder to your system path, normally works for me. It goes through a GUI instead of adding through the command line.http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-pathA second solution is that you can just cd into the directory that contains pip and use it from there each time, but thats only if nothing else works.
It seems like you are using windows so you need to download the get-pip.py and run like this.Path_to_your_Python.exe\python.exe Path_to_get-pip.py\get-pip.py tweepyHere is the link for download get-pip.py
