Natural Text
I have a for loop that retrieves bigram data of a page of text from an SQLite3 database.I tried using txt += txt but this only gives me a single paragraph worth bigram data when I tried to print cache outside the function bigram_db(). So how do I store all of the bigram data that is going to be output by the for loop, which can be accessed outside of the for loop and then when I print it, I want the entire bigram data of the database to be available.
