My directory contains several folders, each with several subdirectories of their own. I need to move all of the files that contain 'Volume.csv' into a directory called Volume. I'm trying combinations of os.walk and regex to retrieve the files by filename but not having much luck.Any ideas?Thank you!Sunworshipper, thank you for the answer! I ran the following code and it moved the entire directory rather than just file name containing 'Volume'. Is it clear why that happened?
You can use glob for this. It returns a list of path names matching the expression you give it. I used relative paths but you can also use absolute paths. shutil moves the documents to the new location. See the glob.glob documentation for more info.
Setup your source and destination directoriesThis set will now hold paths of all files matching your substring.Now I only consider the directories that contain a file which has a substring "hello" in the filename.And now you just move them to your destination with shutil.    Sorry for the misread :)Best regards
