This question has been asked many times, and I searched diligently to no avail. Here is an example of my question:dict = {"a":"1", "b":"2", "c":"3"}The output I am looking for is as below:dict = {"c":"3", "b":"2", "a":"1"}I am really unsure how to attack this, as here is my current code:What I am currently doing is grabbing the tuple pair as a key/value, as these need to remain the same. I am not sure how to insert this pair in a reverse order though.
A dictionary is unordered by definition:It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). Therefore, your question cannot be answered and you should consider using a different data structure. Perhaps an OrderedDict which can be reversed:
Firstly, the dict object of python is a hashtable, so It have no order.but if you only want to get a list is order you can use sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False) method.def order(dic):   return sorted(dic.items(),key=lambda x:x[1],reverse=True)
