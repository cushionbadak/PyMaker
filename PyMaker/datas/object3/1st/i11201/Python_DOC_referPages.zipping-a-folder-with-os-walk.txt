I'm trying to zip a folder and every contained subfolder and file using os.walk(), but I am having trouble removing the folder path to the root folder - meaning I would like to remove D:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop when opening up the zipfile, but instead open straight to the root folder. I've been trying to use os.path.basename() and zipfile's arcname argument, but just can't seem to get it right:
If you want to avoid chdir, which impacts the whole process, you can use relpath to get the relative path starting from your top folder.You could use something like
Use os.chdir to change your current pathMake sure that the parameter of os.walk is relative path*Should be careful when using os.chdir
Made some revisions based on user2313067's answer above and finally got what I wanted in case anyone was curious:
