This is my first post on StackOverflow so I apologise if it is too vague. Essentially, I have LOTS of files that are outputted from a program, and I am trying to automate the process of collecting all the Data. All I want is the values of a string to be returned in a printed format. Which I have managed to achieve. However, I want to also make a column on the newly printed file to tell me which file that string came from. I've only been using python for about 6 hours ... so any help would be very appreciated ! Snippet of the file Content : Here is what I have so far. Current Output: 
You could use the file object's name attribute.
So I've been searching a bit further and found this really useful post [https://askubuntu.com/questions/352198/reading-all-files-from-a-directory][1]And Tried to combine that with my existing code... and it doesn't seem to be printing to output file :| 
Alternative method ... that actually worked. Thanks @Gabor Fekete.
