I've been writing a simple method to check if a web address has subdirectories and, if it does, separate them for me into a list. The code I wrote should ignore the last subdirectory the URL has (this was a mistake I realized after I noticed the loop was iterating about 4 times while checking a URL with a single subdirectory).Here is the code:This code actually returns a subdirectory, as my unittest says it ran the test successfully:So, I tested the following in the python console:Also, if I ask python to printBefore the loop begins, I get the string "docs", without a forward slash.What am I missing here?
As @TadhgMcDonald-Jensen explained, what is happening is that Python is iterating over each one of the characters, @Evert's suggested using a 'while' loop, which gives the result I was originally looking for.I'll probably end up using urllib.parse as @Blckknght suggested. @TheLazyScripter Mentioned that what can also be done is to separate the string using test = some_string_url.split('/'). This is a much more elegant solution than what I had in mind.Thank you everybody.
