Natural Text
I need help in python about making a code that will first ask a number for a starting number and then ask a number in which it will count spaces with that number until 0. For example: input -10 and then input 2 and it will count from -10 to 0(0 not included) with 2 spaces: -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 My Attempt
Here is my solution to your problem, I hope this helps!Will return a list of each value.I did not include any error checking to make sure the user typed in a correct value; no floats, only positive int for step etc...
