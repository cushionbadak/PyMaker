This question already has an answer here:How to randomly select an item from a list?                    14 answers                I am trying to assign two teams out of 16 teams to 8 people out of 8 people,Here is what I have:
This can be done with random.choice([List])Example:The result is a dictionary.If you want to avoid duplicates you have to iterate over the list.
So the thing you're trying to do is just pick random "the length of names" elements from teams. In this case, you should use random.sample():From the documentation:random.sample(population, k)Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence or set. Used for random sampling without replacement.Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the original population unchanged. The resulting list is in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random samples. This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).If you want to assign two teams per person, I'd suggest you random.shuffle() the team list, then split the list into 2 sized chunks, and put the result into a dictionary:
Use random.choice(). In your case, you could have the following:people will be a list of tuples of a name and a team.
This creates a dictionary with names attached to teams, without duplicates
