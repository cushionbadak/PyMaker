I want to mock urllib.urlopen for creating unit testconfig.pyI want to mock the url_test() function but I do not understand how to mock the value of test_url. Because when I am trying to unit test the function it says me "connection refused"this is what i tried.
You would mock any external system, which here is urllib2. Assuming you are using the unittest.mock library (backported to Python 2 as the mock project):In your update you mock the wrong location:Your code uses urllib2, not urllib.
For mocking web requests in Python, I highly recommend HTTPretty.A simple example for what you want to do would look something like:There are a lot of complicated things and gotchas that come with mocking URL requests, and HTTPretty does a pretty good job of making them happen behind the scenes.In terms of your function, consider making test_url a parameter of the method instead of a global variable - it makes testing significantly easier.
