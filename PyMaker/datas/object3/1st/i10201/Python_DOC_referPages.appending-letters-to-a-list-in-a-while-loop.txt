Natural Text
I am trying to append the first word of a sentence to an empty list. The current code is below:It currently prints this:It seems to ignore my attempt to append the result to the empty list... Help, please! 
You'd better use for loop, it's less error-prone:If you want to break a sentence into words, there's a str.split method, which can help you in simple cases:
Why not use the split() function instead of appending one letter at a time:or even more simplier:or even if you are only wanting one input you don't have to appendsplit(), splits a string define by the parameter and returns a list.
