I have to convert string to tuple of float.In Python 2.7, it gives correct conversion, but in Python it is not same case.I want same behaviour in Python 2.6 Can anyone help me why this is not same in Python 2.6 and how to do in Python 2.6.Python 2.6Python 2.7Its not look good[Edit 2]I just print value and conditionI calculate tLinetextBbox value from string and which is 361.60000000000002 and fGalleyTopRightOddX value is 361.6I am working on Python Django project where apache is server.fGalleyTopRightOddX i.e. 361.6 is calculated in apache environmenttLinetextBbox i.e. 361.60000000000002 is calculated on cmd means I pass fGalleyTopRightOddX to program which run by command line os.system[Edit 3]Just one more information,when I log diction in text file then i get tLinetextBbox vale as 361.59999999999997
In order to get the same result in Python 2.6, you have to explicitly do:Better to create a custom function to do this as:As per Python's Decimal Objects Document:Changed in version 2.6: leading and trailing whitespace characters are  permitted when creating a Decimal instance from a string.Changed in version 2.7: The argument to the constructor is now  permitted to be a float instance.The answer to Why they are behaving differently? is, because float.__repr__() and float.__str__() methods in Python 2.7 changed.
