Having a hard time stripping these quotation marks and commas from my list, **SHOWN BELOW IN THE SECOND PART OF MY CODE OUTPUT**I need all of the (' ',) to be stripped from the output and I keep trying the rstrip() on my team variablebut it is giving me this ERROR.I think I may have built my code wrong....but this is a last ditch effort to stop myself from trashing it and starting over--------My Output follows-----------
Wrapping the items with ( ) makes it a tuple; you should remove the extra  parenthesis in your call to print. And you don't need strip for int type. You also don't to strip the string either (in this case):More so, collections.Counter already does what you're trying to do:
it is not part of your element . print() adds this when it display list, tuple, dict. And you see it because you used too many () and created tuple.You have where (team.strip(), count.strip()) means tuple. You need 
remove strip() from the count
Remove the parenthesis and strip
