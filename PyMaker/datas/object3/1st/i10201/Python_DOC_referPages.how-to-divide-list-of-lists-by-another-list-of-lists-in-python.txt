I have q = [[7,2,3],[4,5,6]] and r=[[6,1,2],[3,4,5]]. I need to divide q by the corresponding elements in r. (i.e. [[7/6,2/1,3/2],[4/3,5/4,6/5]])Output needed B = [[1.16,2,1.5],[1.33,1.25,1.2]]Code:B= [[float(j)/float(i) for j in q] for i in r]. However, I keep getting an error : TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number. I have imported division from future. Any suggestions? 
Use zip for bring together the sublists pairwise and then use it again to bring together the corresponding numerators and denominators:
You can do:Or, use numpy:Or, if you have int literals:
