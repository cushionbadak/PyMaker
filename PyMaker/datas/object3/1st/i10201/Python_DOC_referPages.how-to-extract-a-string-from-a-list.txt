I'm new to Python without any programming background except for some shell scripting.I want to extract 2 fields from the below list: Here I want 'title' and 'plays' and assign it to a another list eg) new_list=[title,plays]
The simplest way, of course, it is just write the assignment statement:But you probably intended to ask a more general question, like "How can I extract the 2nd item from the first two tuples in a list?" Like so:Or maybe you meant, "How can I extract the 2nd item from each tuple in a list?" Like so:
to check,ExplainThis line: Above is actually a tuple inside list. So inside the the alist, there are two tuples. Inside each tuple, there are 6 objects.So alist[0] means, you are calling the first tuple inside the alist.and alist[0][1] means your are calling second element of the first tuple. Like this, you can think about alist[1][1] also.
