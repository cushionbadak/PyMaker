I am working on the exorcism.io clock exercise and I can not figure out why this test is failing. The results look identical and even have the same type.Here is my code:
A custom class without an __eq__ method defaults to testing for identity. That is to say, two references to an instance of such a class are only equal if the reference they exact same object.You'll need to define a custom __eq__ method that returns True when two instances contain the same time:By returning the NotImplemented singleton for something that is not a Clock instance (or a subclass), you let Python know that the other object could also be asked to test for equality.However, your code accepts values greater than the normal hour and minute ranges; rather than store hours and minutes, store seconds and normalise that value:Now your two clock instances will test equal because internally they store the exact same time in a day. Note that I used the % modulus operator rather than a while loop and subtracting.
