That's not an error, but an indication that Python doesn't think that you have asked it to call chain_a_list_int.  The minimal tweak to your code is:orA reference to the name of the function chain_a_list_int, without a ( after it, does not actually cause the function's code to run.  This distinction will be useful to you later on — for now, make sure any time you type the name of a function, you put a parenthesized expression after that name.  (If @ForceBru posts an answer, you'll see a counterexample :) .)
You need to call the function to print its output, ie print(chaine_a_liste_entier('1,3,5,6')).
