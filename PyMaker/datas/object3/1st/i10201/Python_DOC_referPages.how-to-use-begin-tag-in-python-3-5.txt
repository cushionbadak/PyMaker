How to use begin() tag in python 3.5? I mean I'm trying to make a text-based RPG, but I don't know to use the begin()  tag because if you run it, it will spam the Py Shell. It'll keep on spewing "You ran into a Zombie! The Zombie has 100 HP, Do you attack?" and those things.
It will be hard to help you without writing the whole program for you, which users on this site are unlikely to do.However, I will offer you some advice that will hopefully get you in the right direction:Make sure that you define begin() (which we refer to as a function, not a tag) before you actually call it. This means before you do:you need to do:so that your program knows what begin() means.You assign choice only once, to Y or N, but you do the follwoing check inside of begin():So choice will never be 'Attack!', since if the game actually runs, we know that choice == "Y" and will until the script is run again. When checking whether the player wants to attack, you are going to need to get the player's input again:or better yet:This way the player's response does not have to be the very specific string 'Attack!', and also, the test is case-insensitive, so if the player's response is 'Y' or 'y', the test will pass. You correctly get new input from the user at the end of the begin() function with play = input('Do you want to play again? Y/N?'), but then you check the value of choice not the value of play.As for the program "spewing" out text, this will happen every time print() runs.
