I have this code: it's working and showing this:How can I store in a variable any word and print that word?
I have not tested it, but gives you an idea.
For example, I want to store the word (lo) in the second line in a variable and then print that variable.Use the re module in Python's builtin library:If you plan on trying to find more words, just add more words to the regular expression. For example, if you wanted to find the words lo and auto, you would say re.findall("lo|auto", content). If you use this method, I recommend reading the official documentation on the re module.
