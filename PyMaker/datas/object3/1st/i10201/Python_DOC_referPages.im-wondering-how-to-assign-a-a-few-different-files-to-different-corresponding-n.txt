I'm wondering how a assign the file to just one of the numbers in the list, and if they make another file it will assign it to the next corresponding number.
Let's take your program line by line.The only problem here is that number is not quite the right name for your variable.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] isn't a single number, but a list of five numbers. Choosing good names for variables is an important (and sometimes tricky) skill for a programmer, because if your names are confusing, well, you'll get confused. Let's call it number_list instead.Ok, what's next?This is the standard way to repeat forever (or until told to stop) in Python. I think what you really want to do is go through each of the numbers in number_list in turn, though, and for that, we use a for loop:On the next line you're trying to open the file for writing:There's a problem here though, because number is an integer, and filenames have to be strings. We can fix that by converting number to a string using str().Also, w is a slightly confusing name for your file variable, because it's similar to the "w" you used to say that you're writing to the file â€“ traditionally files are called f when we open them like this.Let's make both those changes:Next line:The problem here is that you're trying to write to your integer number, when you really want to write to the file you just opened, f. That's an easy fix though:Your next two lines are perfect:... but the one after isn't quite right:The way we actually tell Python to go back to the top of the loop with the next value is like this:Your last two lines are also perfect:Putting the changes together, we get:Quick question though: what happens if the user doesn't enter either '1' or '2'? Something to think about ...
