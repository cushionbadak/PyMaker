This question already has an answer here:Why is the order in dictionaries and sets arbitrary?                    6 answers                I found out something weird and I was wondering if it was a known thing. This is my code: -Python 3.5.2-And this is my output (it never changes):{9, 4, 1, 6, 7}{1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}Process finished with exit code 0If you run it you will see that the first output isn't in order but the second one is. It seems to only gets in order for some reason if the set has more then 5 objects. Wiki.python.com also says that sets dont get sorted at al. This all is really weird to me so i hoped i could get some more explanation.
sets are unordered collections by design. If you want a collection of items that retain order, consider using a list, instead. Lists have insert and append methods available to you.
It seems to only gets in order for some reason if the set has more then 5 objectsThere is nothing to really explain, it is a random observation. Append more stuff, and it will not be sortedThere is also nothing magical about 5, try outWhen documentation says that something is not sorted/ordered (or that the ordering is not guaranteed), this does not mean "for every single input, items will not ever be sorted" but rather "you cannot rely on things being sorted here, it is a completely random thing".
