I have code like this:I'd like to count how many times each value in winners appears across the three player_x_guesses lists. So I would expect to see something like:I'm not really sure what this kind of data analysis (?) is called or even what to google to achieve what I want. Thanks for any help.
Try doing this:output:Using collections:
Not sure if I'm breaking the rules here, but my approach was to search for"python compare string arrays" and I got this: Compare string with all values in arrayYou have one list/array of strings that you want to compare with three other lists/arrays.Assuming you want to know how many players guessed the correct colour and in the right position.  In other words player_1_guesses = [green, red, orange] would not count as a correct guess for red because it's not in the first position, for your example.In my head, the logic of your code would go like this (this isn't python code by the way!):get winners[0], which is 'red'check winners[0] against values in player_n_guesses[0] and record the outcome in a variable called red (e.g. if player_n_guesses[0]==winners[0]:red +=1)use nested for loops to go through everything, then make your totals list using the format method.I expect there's a more efficient way that directly compares matrices - try searching for 'string matrix comparison python' or something like that.
