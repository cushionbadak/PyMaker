I have 50 array with float values (50*7). How am I suppose to sum up the 50 arrays on same index to one with PySpark map-reducer function.Example:the result should be array3 = {4,6,5,7,10,12,14}.This is a project requirement to use PySpark on Map-Reducer platform.Now I can figure out the map part:The result here contains 50 arrays. Function random_generation gives one array with 7 random numbers.Please anyone can provide me the suggestion on the reduce part.
Edit: I think it's easier to use DataFrame.Result
