Consider the following code:What I want is to format the JSON so that JSON objects that have only a single property '$special' are rendered on a single line, as follows.I have played around with implementing a custom JSONEncoder and passing that in to json.dumps as the cls argument, but the two methods on JSONEncoder each have a problem:The JSONEncoder default method is called for each part of data, but the return value is not a raw JSON string, so there doesn't appear to be any way to adjust its formatting.The JSONEncoder encode method does return a raw JSON string, but it is only called once for the data as a whole.Is there any way I can get JSONEncoder to do what I want?
The json module is not really designed to give you that much control over the output; indentation is mostly meant to aid readability while debugging.Instead of making json produce the output, you could transform the output using the standard library tokenize module:This reformats your sample successfully:
I found the following regex-based solution to be simplest, albeit â€¦ regex-based.The output follows.
You can do it, but you'd basically have to copy/modify a lot of the code out of json.encoder because the encoding functions aren't really designed to be partially overridden.Basically, copy the entirety of _make_iterencode from json.encoder and make the changes so that your special dictionary gets printed without newline indents.  Then monkeypatch the json package to use your modified version, run the json dump, then undo the monkeypatch (if you want).The _make_iterencode function is pretty long, so I've only posted the portions that need to be changed.
