Natural Text
I'm writing a Python script to parse an XML file. When I get to the following part of the XML file,the script uses the following to parse the textThis produces a list named tokens with the single string element '(1.00000000000000,0.000000000000000E+000)'. How can I make it so that what is produced is a tuple with first element 1.00000000000000 and second element 0.000000000000000E+000? Or, at least, how can I convert the vector from string form to two-element tuple form?
