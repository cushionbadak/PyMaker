In Python 3, there's a useful raise ... from ... feature to re-raise an exception. That said, how do you find the original (/ re-raised) exception from the raised exception? Here's a (silly) example with comments to demonstrate what I mean--
It's in the __cause__ attribute of the raised exception. Taken from the docs on the raise statement it says regarding raise ... from ...:The from clause is used for exception chaining: if given, the second expression must be another exception class or instance, which will then be attached to the raised exception as the __cause__ attribute (which is writable). If the raised exception is not handled, both exceptions will be printed.So, in your given scenario, repring the __cause__ attribute:Will print out:
Whenever an exception is raised from an exception handler (the except clause), the original exception will bestored in new exception's __context__.Whenever an exception is raised using from syntax, the exception specified in from will be saved in the __cause__ attribute of the new exception.In the usual use case, that amounts to both __cause__ and __context__ containing the original exception:Here is also an example of when __context__ is set:and an example of when __cause__ is set:
