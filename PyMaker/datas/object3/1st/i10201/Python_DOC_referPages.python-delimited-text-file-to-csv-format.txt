Natural Text
I'm new to python but I'm having trouble reading a text file which contains data separated by "|" as the delimiter. How would I separate the file into columns in a CSV format.This code gets rid of the | to a blank but all the data is just in one column now. How can I format this correctly?I appreciate your help in advance.
The csv module allows you to read csv files with practically arbitrary delimiters.If you really want to reformat the file, you can use the csv.writer directly:Note that your approach doesn't work because you remove the separator instead of replacing it. data.replace("|","") will replace each | with the empty string, i.e. "foo|bar" becomes "foobar". You must replace the old separator with a new one, e.g. data.replace("|", ",").
The simplest way with your code would be to replace "|" with "," rather than removing "|"
You're importing the csv module, but aren't using it. Make use of csv.reader
