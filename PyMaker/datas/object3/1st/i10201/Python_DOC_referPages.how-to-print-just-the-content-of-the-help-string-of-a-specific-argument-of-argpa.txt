Natural Text
Is there a way to access the help strings for specific arguments of the argument parser library object? I want to print the help string content if the option was present on the command line. Not the complete help text that Argument Parser can display via ArgumentParser.print_help .So something along those lines:And this is the required behavior$program -dthe program will do X
There is parser._option_string_actions which is mapping between option strings (-d or --do_x) and Action objects. Action.help attribute holds the help string.
parser._actions is a list of the Action objects.  You can also grab object when creating the parser.Play with argparse in an interactive session.  Look at a from such an assignment.
