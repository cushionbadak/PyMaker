I'm using "The coder's apprentice: Learning Python with Python 3" (http://www.spronck.net/pythonbook/pythonbook.pdf).I'm doing this exercise: "The cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40 percent discount.Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. Calculate the total wholesale costs for 60 copies."This is my code: For whatever reason, the word the in this line of code:Produces a syntax error. Given that I remove each word until I reach for I still get a syntax error. When only for and but are left, the error: EOL while scanning string literalis produced. I don't have a clue what to do.Here's my code: Using IDLE editor (not prompt).
Because you got an extra ". Instead ofdoYou can also omit calling str(), from print() docs:All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the streamUPDAlso you skipped + at the end of error line.And as @tobias_k mentioned you forgot closing ) for str method print("Given 60 copies were shipped, it would cost " + str(sixty_shipped + ".")So for your code to work without str() methods:Or even better with format()It's now more readable.
