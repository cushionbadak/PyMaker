This question already has an answer here:How do I sort a dictionary by value?                    42 answers                When the user gives input it puts it in a dictionary. When nothing or blanc is filled in it code should stop and give all the inputs + occurences in the dictionary.I tried counter and a for loop but that doesn't work.So for instance if input = `h, d, d, hh, a, s
This looks working..is this what you wanted?
Here's a reworking of your code that does what I think you are trying to achieve. It takes advantage of Counter from the standard  collections module.
If the input is guaranteed to be separated by , (comma-space), you can use the following snippet with collections.Counter:To get your specific formatting, you can do the following:If you just want to delimit with commas and ignore other whitespace, you can replace input.split(', ') in any of the above snippets with [i.strip() for i in input.split(',')].
