Since c and b and a appear early in the string you get 2, 1 and 0 back regardless of the position of the current letter.Use the enumerate() function to give you position counter instead:The second argument is the starting value; setting this to 1 means you can avoid having to + 1 later on.

This is because s.index(a) returns the first index of the character. You can use enumerate to pair elements to their indices:Here is a Pythonic solution:
