This question already has an answer here:Function with varying number of For Loops (python)                    7 answers                Given a list like alist = [1, 3, 2, 20, 10, 13], I wanna write a function find_group_f, which can generate all possible combination of elements in alist and meanwhile I can dynamically control the number k of element in each group. For instance, if the number k is 2, the function is equal to:While the number k is 3, it would be like:I wonder how can I implement like this? Thanks in advance!
