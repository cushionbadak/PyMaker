I was wondering how you correctly use os.path. Basically what I'm trying to do is ask the user for a directory and after that, they type a letter (N in this case), and then a filename in the directory and it will combine the directory with the file.For example:andThe final result produced would be C:\Desktop\hello.':        directory = input()        search_files()        directory1=search_characteristics(directory)        #print(directory1)What am I doing wrong?
Here, this should work.If you have to use os.path.join then you can replace the line with os.sep with:
