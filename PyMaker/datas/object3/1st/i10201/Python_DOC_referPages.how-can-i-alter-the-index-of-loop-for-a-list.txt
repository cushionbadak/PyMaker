I've a list and I want to display the content with index by manually changing the value of index. I've tried to do it in two ways but it is not working.way 1:way 2:
The issue here is that both enumerate() and xrange() generate a series of values that is unaffected by external changes to i, which is an unconnected variable. Using @efferalgans's suggestion the best way might be to call the next() function twice, but this will mean storing a reference to the generator. So you want to do something like this:from which I see the result
Just use a while loop. It's the simplest, clearest and most flexible solution:As you can see, looping over a string is simple and you are completely free to change the index on the fly -- i is just a normal variable. It's not clear what your code was actually meant to do, so the above does what your code would (presumably) have done if it worked: It will skip the word that follows the word "are".
