I have a list of tuples:The tuples have the structure (int, string) and start from 1 and the max value is 10. I would like to edit and reorder them to the following:As you can see I want to create a new list that is consecutively numbered up to 10. All int's from the tuples in the first list lst that doesn't occur in the range of 1 to 10 will produce an empty string in the new list lst2.I came up with this code:however the result is weird:Can anyone please help me or tell me what I am doing wrong? Thanks.

Your inner for is excessive here.Instead of for k in range(1,11): you should use if k>=1 and k<=10:
There are already better answers, but just to show you how your loop could be modified to yield the desired result:
