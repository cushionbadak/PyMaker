having trouble with these two functions was wondering if people could tell me where I am going wrong this is a separate function as part of a spider that searches through a website of house prices here is the error raised:and for reference here is the execute for the databse as always, thank you for the support 
You have many issues:INSERT-clause has no TABLE keywordYou're trying to pass variables to an SQL query using string formatting; don't do it, ever – use placeholders, or face the consequencesYour VALUES-clause is missing commas between the value-expressionsThe sqlite3 module uses "?" as a placeholder instead of percent formatters"transaction_id NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT" is not a valid column name"AUTO_INCREMENT" is not valid SQLite syntax and you probably meant for transaction_id to be INTEGER PRIMARY KEY – also AUTOINCREMENT should usually not be usedThe below functions fix some of the errors, barring the DDL-corrections to the transactions table.
