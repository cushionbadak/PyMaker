The main questions is how do I have to iterate / indicate correctly to work with two dicts?I have given two dicts (d1, d2) which I have to compare. If the key i is the same in both, an operation is followed due to a given function. The result goes into another dict (dict1). If either d1 or d2 contains the key i, the value goes in to dict2. The return is a tup = (dict1, dict2). Here is an example.I am struggling with the correct way to properly indicate the two dicts d1 and d2. Here is my code:Do I have to loop over d1 and d2 (for i in d1 and d2:)? It seems like I have to somehow integrate both given dicts to make the for loop work. Thanks for any hints!
set gets rid of duplicates.  itertools.chain  combines the two lists of keys in the dictionaries
Use itertools.chain to get an iterable of all keys in your dicts.
