I'm reading some code which contains the following import statement:At first this syntax puzzled me, but I think it is equivalent to:Can anyone confirm whether this is the case?
You can check this on the official documentation. Here's the documentation for the import syntax:Note how you always have the import module ["as" name] and identifier ["as" name], including in the list definition:This means a comma , followed by an identifier, optionally assigned with as to a name and the )* means "this group can be repeated zero or more times, which includes the example you provided.This is also explained on the same page a bit later on:The from form uses a slightly more complex process:find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;for each of the identifiers specified in the import clauses:    check if the imported module has an attribute by that nameif not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attributeif the attribute is not found, ImportError is raised.otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the as clause if it is present, otherwise  using the attribute name
Yes, it is.Check out all the ways that one can import a module in python:https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement
