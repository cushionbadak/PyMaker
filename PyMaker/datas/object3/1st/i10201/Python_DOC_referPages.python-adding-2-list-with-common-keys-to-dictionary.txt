I am new to python. I'm extracting two rows from a csvfile.And the quantity list corresponds to each of the items in its sequence.How can i merge the two list with common keys into a dictionary? I tried splitting and joining but the quantity gets overwritten due to the common keys. I am trying to output: Please help! Will there be anyway where i can extract the csvfile row for the food items and assign its values in a dictionary? for cvs file is as follows:row 1:apple, carrot, banana chocolate, applestrawberry, orange, carrotrow 2: 1,2,12,51,2
You can use Counter to aggregate the result:Output:
Use collections.default_dict to set up a dictionary to count your items in.
