I have this:-... and was expecting it to return True.But somehow it does not.How come?My understanding is that it was suppose to match any number which has any combination of 4 or 7, with at least 2 digits.Is that correct?
It should probably be "^[47]{2,}$".I visit the regular expression syntax page quite often, because I find it hard to remember all of the little tricks for building regexes.
The syntax is {m,n} where n could be omitted.Fix:See RegEx syntax: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
