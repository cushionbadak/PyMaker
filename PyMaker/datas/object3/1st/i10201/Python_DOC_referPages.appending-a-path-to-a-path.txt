Is it possible to append a pathlib.Path generator or, combine two Paths?With this attempt you'll get:
That's because Path.glob returns a generator, i.e an object that returns values when next is called which has absolutely no idea what appending is.You have two options here, if you require a list wrap the paths in a list call:(Even though extend is probably what you're after here.)this of course defeats the purpose of the generator. So, I'd suggest using something like chain and creating a generator that will combine them and yield from them one at a time:Then iterating over paths as required while keeping the memory footprint down.
