I am looping through dictionaries and accessing the dictionary values to append to a list. Consider one dictionary as an example, example_dict:I am looping through hundreds of dictionaries. It is possible that some keys do not have values. In this case, I would like an NaN appended to the lists---after running the script, each list should have the same number of elements. If new_dict = {"first":897, "second": '', "third": "Duchamps", ...}, then second_list.append(new_dict["second"]) would append NaN. How does one write in a check for this to occur? An if statement?
You can perform a check for values that are not "" and simply do something like this:So, if key second exists in new_dict and is an empty string, then NaN will be appended to second_list. If you were looking to create a list of values from the dictionary applying the logic above, you can do the following, both are the same, first is expanded, and the second is the shortened comprehension: method 1method 2 (comprehension)
