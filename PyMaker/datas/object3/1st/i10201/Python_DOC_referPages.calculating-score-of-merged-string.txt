I am trying to figure out how to calculate the score of two merged lists of names. I need to give one point for each character (including spaces between first and last name) plus one point for each vowel in the name. I am struggling to figure out what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
So you first zip first and last names, then make then str with ' ' as separator. And then with collections.Counter count how many times so called vowel characters occur, sum them up, and add len of whole name. And that would be dict object, then you can do whatever you like with it.Output:UPDATEIf you need all possible variations of first name and last name you can do that with itertools.productOutput:
It's easier to have them as a string, you can then loop over that string. One point per character is easy, that's just length of the string. If vowel is one extra letter, just loop over letters and if vowel add a point. Voila!
