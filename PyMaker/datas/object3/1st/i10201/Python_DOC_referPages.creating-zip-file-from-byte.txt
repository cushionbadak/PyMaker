I'm sending byte string of a zip file from client side using JSZip and need to convert it back to zip on server side. the code I've tried isn't working.It gives the error:How do I save my byte string as a zip file?
ZipFile.write(filename, [arcname[, compress_type]]) takes the name of a local file to be added to the zip file. To write data from a bytearray or bytes object you need to use the ZipFile.writestr(zinfo_or_arcname, bytes[, compress_type]) method instead:Note: if request.POST.get("zipFile") already is bytes (or str in python2) you don't need to convert it to a bytearray before writing it to the archive.
JSZip already made a zip archive. The zipfile module is for accessing zip file contents, but you don't need to parse it to store it. In addition, bytearray can be created directly from strings so the map(ord,) is superfluous, and write can handle strings as well (bytearray is for handling numeric binary data or making a mutable stringlike object). So a slightly simplified variant might be:
Haven't tried it, but you could  use io.BytesIO to construct a Buffered Streamwith your bytes and then create your zip file like so:
