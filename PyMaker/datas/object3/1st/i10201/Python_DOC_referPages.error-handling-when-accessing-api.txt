I am trying to access an API (Scopus) through python, downloading multiple abstracts within the for loop below:However, upon doing so I keep receiving the following errors along the lines of below (always at different points of the for loop too).I've been told that error handling is a way around this, but being new to Python I have no idea what this is. Can anyone help? ThanksEDIT: Here is the whole error message which should include all of the correct information (sorry that it is long)
Unfortunately you haven't included 'the above exception' that is mentioned in your output.But in general, when an exceptional situation, such as an error, happens during execution of a piece of code, you can catch that exception and deal with it. An exception is an object with information on board about what went wrong. Exception handling in general is a big subject and you might start reading at: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.htmlAn example of dealing with an exception is just reporting the circumstances and the exception. This could already give you insight in what went wrong:[EDIT]I've taken a look at the error message and it seems that the server that you're trying to connect to, closed the connection. See also Why is host aborting connection? although the cause may be completely different. Try the code above to find out if this happens all the time or only with certain URL's[/EDIT]To build in some retries, use:N.B. I haven't tested this, but it should convey the general idea.The 'sleep' is to allow the server to catch its breath...
