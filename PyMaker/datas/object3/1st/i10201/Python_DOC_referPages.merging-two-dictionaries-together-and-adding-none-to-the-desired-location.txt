I've scraped some data and due to the way the website was structured I put the data into two dictionaries. I've combined the data into one master dictionary and I've attempted to put it into a csv file. The problem is that only the first person's (Marcus J. Newsome) information is exported to the csv. I think this is due to fact that there are keys/values (for example Additional compensation) that belong to Dana T. Bedden that aren't present in Marcus J Newsome's data. To address this I've tried adding None to the positions to fix this problem. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work the way I want it to. Ultimately I would like to have my output look like this:Desired OutputAnyone have any ideas?
It'd be much better to change the way you store scraped data.Pseudocode:Then you can use csv.DictWriter without any complex data manipulation:
I would restructure the data such that you have one dictionary for all relevant fields for each person. You can than easily use the dictwriter class of csv to export that data.
