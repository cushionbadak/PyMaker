I want to filter the IPv4 ips and take the one which belong to my LAN (and not to my VMware network).I coded this thing:This part:Its for getting first the ips I have (At least the row they are in.)So for example, just this row, will give me:['   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.231.1\n', '   IPv4  Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.233.1\n', '   IPv4 Address. . .  . . . . . . . . : 10.100.102.8\n'](The first two are of the VMware)When I do the Regex thing, it isnt working. Its intended to give me just the ips from the string I gave it.How can I filter the only LAN ip ('10.100.102.8' in this case.) and insert it to a string?
Watch out! [0-255] isn't a number range in regex ! (in fact it means one character in the list 0,1,2,5)You should use \d{1,3} if you want a three digit number, then extract groups if you want to check if the number is in the range.
