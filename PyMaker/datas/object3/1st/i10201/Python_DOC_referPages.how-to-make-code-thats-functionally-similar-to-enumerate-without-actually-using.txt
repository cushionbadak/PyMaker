I suppose to write a code that prints out the value of a number that occurs twice in the list given, but they don't allow us to use a built in function on python. How would I be able to write it without using enumerate? 
enumerate(sequence) is pretty much similar to a construct of the form:So, in your code, replacing enumerate altogether could be done by:Or, without assigning to an x name to temporarily hold the sequence item:Creating a little my_enumerate function, is also rather simple:start has also been defined as to match that as used in enumerate and gets a default value of 0.Rather than yielding values (if this is mystifying to you), you can create a list (generator comprehensions are similar to yielding) comprehension and return that instead:
Your own enumerate function might be something like this: Unlike the built-in enumerate, which is a generator that yields one item at a time, your function is returning a list.
