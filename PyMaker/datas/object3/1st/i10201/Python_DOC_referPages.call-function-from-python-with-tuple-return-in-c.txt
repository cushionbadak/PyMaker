I'm trying to call a python function from my C script. I success to return a double variable from the python function and print it in my C script. The problem I have now is that I need to return multiple variables (tuple) from python. How can I success that? My code with a single variable return is as follows: My python script is:This works, but I want to return other variables at the same time such as ay,az, and so on. Is my first time using embedded python and I really don't know how to do this. 
With a small caveat, you can use PyArg_ParseTuple to take apart the tuple returned by the function you call. This will work fine as long as the returned tuple matches the format string you provide to PyArg_ParseTuple. If there is a mismatch, the error produced by PyArg_ParseTuple will be misleading because it assumes that the tuple is an argument tuple.A less convenient but more general approach is to use the tuple API.
