What's the best way in Python to recursively go through all directories until you find a certain file? I want to look through all the files in my directory and see if the file I'm looking for is in that directory.If I cannot find it, I go to the parent directory and repeat the process. I also want to count how many directories and files I go through before I find the file. If there is no file at the end of the loop return that there is no filestartdir = "Users/..../file.txt"findfile is name of file. This is my current loop but I want to make it work using recursion.
Don't re-invent the directory-recursion wheel. Just use the os.walk() function, which gives you a loop over a recursive traversal of directories:
