I'd like to automatically delete a temporary file when my QWidget is destroyed (for example, at the end of the program).I tried to handle it with the destroyed signal, but it doesn't work, my callback function is never executed.Source code:
You should use closeEvent for this:
The solution is trivial: replace _on_destroyed with __del__(self), and remove the slot annotation. That's really all there's to it.Alas, you don't need to do that. Use a QTemporaryFile member and it will be automatically removed upon destruction.
