I have a python project with the following directory structurewhere setup.py is a python script. Previously, I was using an install script to symlink the script to my user's private bin (and using it with success), but decided to package it up (first time doing so). I'm able to successfully install the package in a virutalenv using $ pip install . from the project's root directory, and I am able to execute most of the script until I generate a template with jinja2. It seems as though either the templates dir is not getting installed with the rest of the package, or my script is not finding the path to the templates dir correctly.Excerpt from foo.py:Note: 'bar.tmpl' is passed to this function as template_fileExcerpt from setup.py:Contents of MANIFEST.in:Relevant Traceback:I have spent a few hours googling, reading similar stackoverflow threads, reading the jinja and setuptools docs, and reading similar code. Everything I have tested just results in the same error message, and I am somewhat at a loss. Any help is greatly appreciated.
MANIFEST.in tell what files to include in the source distribution, i.e. python setup.py sdist, but it does not directly affect what files are installed because pip install . just calls into setuptools and doesn't do anything special with package_data.You need to include the files in the setup.py file, either as package data or as additional files.See https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html for details, pay attention to data_files and package_data on the page.
