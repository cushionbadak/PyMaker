This is my XML response from a http request I am trying to parse this XML content using Python 3.5When I print this I get a None. What am I doing wrong? I also want to access the "Array" tag but that also returns None.
The XML document uses namespaces so you need to support that in your code. There is an explanation and example code in the etree documentation.Basically you can do this:
As stated in the doc, due to the xmlns="http://xml.opendap.org/ns/DAP2"attribute of the Dataset root tag, all tag names you're looking for have to be prefixed by {http://xml.opendap.org/ns/DAP2}.Reading this section of the ElementTree doc will also show you how to make something more readable with a dictionnary of namespaces.
