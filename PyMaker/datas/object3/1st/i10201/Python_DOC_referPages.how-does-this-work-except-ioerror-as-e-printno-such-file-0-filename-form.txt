The code that uses the expression in question:How does this work? What is meaning of {0.filename}.format(e)? Why do we use {0.filename} and not {1.filename}?
This essentially means takes the positional argument at position 0 (in format(e), e is the zero position arg)  and grab the filename attribute defined on it:Is similar to:It isn't 1.filename because format hasn't been called with an argument at position 1, another example might help you out even more:Here {0} will grab "No such File: " and {1.filename} will grab e.filename and add it to the resulting string.
