I am trying to figure out a way to iterate through a database and match all rows that have 02 in them using regular expressions. When a match is made the count should reset to 0 and when there is not a match the count should accumulate by negative 1. The code works when I use a list. 
You probably want to use r.search() to execute a regular expression search:Note the use of i[0] to get the first value from each tuple returned by the query.Using i == r simply compares the tuple i (as returned by the query) to the compiled regular expression patter r and will never be true. It does not execute any of the search methods of the given pattern.
