I want to create a list from an existing list after removing all duplicates.Program works if I use a "for loop" but nothing happens if I use a list comprehension.
The expression [i for i in l1 if i not in j1] is evaluated and then assigned to j1. So during the evaluation j1 stays empty.BTW: An easy was of removing duplicates is to pass the list to the set function and then to the list function if you need a list:
j1 is [] at the start and isn't updated at intermediate points within the list comprehension. Could do this instead of list comprehension though:
