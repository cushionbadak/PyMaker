While studying Pandas Style, I got to the following:How should I read is_max = s == s.max()?
s == s.max() will evaluate to a boolean (due to the == in between the variables). The next step is storing that value in is_max.
In pandas s is very often Series (column in DataFrame).So you compare all values in Series with max value of Series and get boolean mask. Output is in is_max. And then set style 'background-color: yellow' only to cell of table where is True value - where is max value.Sample:
The codeis_max = s == s.max()is evaluated asis_max = (s == s.max())The bit in parentheses is evaluated first, and that is either True or False. The result is assigned to is_max.
is_max is EQUAL TO comparison of s and s_max
According to the document, Evaluation order:Notice that while evaluating an assignment, the right-hand side is  evaluated before the left-hand side.This is quite reasonable, for you have to know the value of an expression before assigning it to a variable.So Python first evaluates s.max(), followed by checking if the calculated value is equal to s, resulting in a boolean result, and then assign this boolean to a variable called is_max.See also: Assignment statements
