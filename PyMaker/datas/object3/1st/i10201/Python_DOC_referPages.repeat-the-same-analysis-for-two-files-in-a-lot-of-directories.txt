I have a lot of data stored in two files found in folders with the structure shown on this pic.I wrote a small python script to process the two files in Subdir1 and would like to repeat it over Dir, so each Subdir gets visited. I searched stackoverflow and looked at ways of doing it:     -either with bash (using a for loop to run the python script on all files)     -or using os.walk() and walk DirThe problem is that I have two files: I am getting some data from File_1, and some data from File_2, combining the two and then writing the resulting astropy Table (or dataframe) to a file. I can do this over one subdirectory. Any ideas how to do this for all the folders? I can handle repeating tasks when there is only file per folder.Thanks.
