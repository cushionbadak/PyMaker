Natural Text
Could you help me understand why print(truth(prog.match(text, 0, 6))) equals true?
If you use the match(text, startpos, endpos) method of a compiled regex, it will act as if you've passed match(text[startpos:endpos]) (well, not exactly, but for the purposes of $, it is). This means that it'll think <HTML> is at the end of the input (which is what $ matches).However, when this is not the case the extra whitespace at the end of text will prevent $ from matching, so no match is found.
