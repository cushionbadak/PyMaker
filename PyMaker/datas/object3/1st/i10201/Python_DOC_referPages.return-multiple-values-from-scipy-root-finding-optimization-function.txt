I'm trying to return multiple values that are obtained inside a scipy root finding function (scipy.optimize.root).For example:Is there any way to return the value of B without using globals? 
I'm not aware of anything SciPy specific, but how about a simple closure:Alternatively, an instance of a class with __call__ could also be passed as the callable.
