I'm use Django-hstore library, and there is pretty admin widget. The subject table store computer's components, something like this:Next, I get data from cpu-world.com about necessary CPU and I have following inline data in admin:Look great, but sorting alphabetically instead logical, in order of loading data into database in load_cpu_data model method. Example of proper order, like on cpu-world:Is there technique, or trick, or something to help me show data in desired sequence? For example, I found python OrderedDict data type, which similar to what I need. But apparently hstore inner structure mess data order.
according to the hstore docs, hstore itself is not ordered:The order of the pairs is not significant (and may not be reproduced on output). Whitespace between pairs or around the => sign is ignored. Double-quote keys and values that include whitespace, commas, =s or >s. To include a double quote or a backslash in a key or value, escape it with a backslash.
