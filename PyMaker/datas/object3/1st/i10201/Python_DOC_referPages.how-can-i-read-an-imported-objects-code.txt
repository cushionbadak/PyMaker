I don't know what attributes an object supports. How can I open up the module and figure out what's going on "under the hood"?For example, I want to figure out what attributes the datetime object from the datetime module has in its __init__:But, since datetime has no __getitem__ method, there must be a different way of accessing each part of the time (day, month, year, etc.)I have found (by trial and error) that you can do this:but I'm not sure what the proper name for what I'm doing here is, and how I can find other methods that belong to this object/class.
In your terminal, type pydoc (whatever) and you should be able to see all the variables and functions it has. If it's undocumented, dir([whatever]) is the way to go. In any situation, obviously Google.BTW, to clarify the terms in your question, datetime is a module. You have to understand modules, classes, and objects are different things. You can learn more about modules and the dir() function here.
I find the dir function to be the most useful when dealing with unknown and undocumented objects (datetime is well documented, btw).But if it weren't documented:and so on...
