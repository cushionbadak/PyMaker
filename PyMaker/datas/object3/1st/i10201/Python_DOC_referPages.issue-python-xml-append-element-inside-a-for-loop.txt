thanks for taking the time with this one.i have an xml file with an element called selectionset. the idea is to take that element and modify some of the subelements attributes and tails, that part i have done.the shady thing for me to get is why when i try to add the new subelements to the original (called selectionsets) its only pushing the last on the list inplist
Here's what I've been able to put together and it looks like it'll do what you're looking for. Here are the main differences: (1) This will iterate over multiple selectionset items (if you end up with more than one), (2) It creates a deepcopy of the element before modifying the values (I think you were always modifying the original "col"), (3) It appends the new selectionset to the selectionsets tag rather than the root.Here's the deepcopy documentation
