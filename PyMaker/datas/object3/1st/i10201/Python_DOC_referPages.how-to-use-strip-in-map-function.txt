This question already has an answer here:Split by comma and strip whitespace in Python                    11 answers                I'd like to use map to get list of strings:but got:expected result: my_list=['1','2','3'] 
strip is still just a variable, not a reference to the str.strip() method on each of those strings.You can use the unbound str.strip method here:which will work for any str instance:In case you want to call a method named in a string, and you have a variety of types that all happen to support that method (so the unbound method reference wouldn't work), you can use a operator.methodcaller() object:However, instead of map(), I'd just use a list comprehension if you want to output a list object anyway:
You can also use a lambda to achieve your purpose by using:where each element in value.split(",") is passed to lambda x:x.strip() as parameter x and then the strip() method is invoked on it.
