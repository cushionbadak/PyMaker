I am new to python and I have a problem. I am trying to find keys with a value; however, the keys have multiple values.I want to find the value john in d and get the keys a, b and c or find jane and get keys a and c.
This can easily be done using a list comprehension. It iterates over every key/value pair from the dict's items list, which contains all key/value pairs (for key,val in d.items()) and selects only the pairs where the target string is contained in the value list (if 'john' in val), building a list out of the resulting keys ([ key ... ]).
So you have to go through the dictionary items and if the find keyword is in the item list then the corresponding key has to be stored in a list and this list has to be displayed.So this is how the logic is written in pythonAnd it will give the following output
