You can use power operator for that:Or if you really like your way of doing that, here's a fixed version of your code:
You can start with a list where first element is the beginning of the multiples:-- start with 1 or the number you like-- Output : [1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683, 59049, 177147]
