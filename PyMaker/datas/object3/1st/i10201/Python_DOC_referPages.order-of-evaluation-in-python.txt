This question already has an answer here:Python - logical evaluation order in “if” statement                    4 answers                The value for l in this code returns True. How is this possible? In the order of evaluation, comparisons are higher prioritised than the "or, not, and" operators.
They do have a higher priority, but, the or operator works by:The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.Since k is 3.3333333333333335, the expression k <= 3 is False, True is going to be evaluated (to itself) and returned making l == True.
