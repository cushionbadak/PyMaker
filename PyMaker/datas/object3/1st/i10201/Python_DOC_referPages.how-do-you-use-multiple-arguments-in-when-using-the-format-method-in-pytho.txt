I want a table in python to print like this: Clearly, I want to use the .format() method, but I have long floats that look like this: 1464.1000000000001 I need the floats to be rounded, so that they look like this: 1464.10 (always two decimal places, even if both are zeros, so I can't use the round() function).I can round the floats using "{0:.2f}".format("1464.1000000000001"), but then they do not print into nice tables. I can put them into nice tables by doing "{0:>15}.format("1464.1000000000001"), but then they are not rounded.Is there a way to do both? Something like "{0:>15,.2f}.format("1464.1000000000001")?
You were almost there, just remove the comma (and pass in a float number, not a string):See the Format Specification Mini-Language section:Breaking the above format down then:Demo:Note that for numbers, the default alignment is to the right, so the > could be omitted.
I always find this site useful for this stuff:https://pyformat.info/
