I have a pandas dataframe that I am looking to convert into an xlsx and attach to an email. I can send emails based on outlook(this is the only way I can do it). I am able to convert the dataframe into an xlsx and save it on my drive and afterwards send it as attachment but I am looking to attach it directly without having to save it on my drive. see bellow my function to send emails:attachment is the dataframe that has been transformed into xlsx
Have you tried to play with the io module in Python 3? It allows you to use streams as file-like objects, so that APIs that expect a file can read from or save their content to the stream instead.That works nicely, using a StringIO along with pandas.DataFrame.to_csv:That works, because to_csv expects a string (interpreted as a path) or a file handle, and StringIO can be used like a file handle. Unfortunately, pandas.DataFrame.to_excel works with either a string (interpreted as a path) or an ExcelWriter. In that case, we need to create the ExcelWriter ourselves, and wrap a BytesIO with it.I am not familiar with the Outlook Python tools for sending emails, I use SMTP:I hope this helps, good luck!
