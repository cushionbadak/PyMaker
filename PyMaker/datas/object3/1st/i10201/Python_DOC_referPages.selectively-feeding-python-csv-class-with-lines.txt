Natural Text
I have a csv file with a few patterns. I only want to selectively load lines into the csv reader class of python. Currently, csv only takes a file object. Is there a way to get around this?In other words, what I need is:But, currently, csv class fails if it is given a line instead of a file object.
From the csv.reader docstring:csvfile can be any object which supports the iterator protocol and returns a string each time its __next__() method is calledYou can feed csv.reader with a generator iterator that yields only the selected rows.
To read file as stream you can use this.
yields
Found a solution: As csv expects object which supports  __next__(), I'm using a StringIO class to convert string to StringIO object which in turn handles  __next__() and returns one line everytime for csv reader class.
