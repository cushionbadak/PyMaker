While studying Pandas Style, I got to the following:Which I understand means, turn every value to 2 decimal places and add a % in the end.Just after that, there is:How should I read 'B': "{:0<4.0f}"?
This is the "new" formatting string syntax, explained in https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language.The first 0 means pad with "0"The < means align to the left (so the number will be followed by a bunch of 0's, e.g. '4' will be formatted as "400000â€¦")The 4 means the minimum width is 4 charactersThe .0 means the precision is 0, i.e. don't show any decimal parts.The f means the type is a fixed-point number.Examples:
The Python documentation for format strings explains what this means.In the case of 0<4.0f, it means:
As according to the Pandas Style documentation you linked to, it's a python format specification string.The specific options break down to:0< Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space, and pads with zeros4 Specifies the width of the field.0 Specifies the precision of the number, i.e. how many decimal points should be displayedf Displays the number as a fixed-point number.
