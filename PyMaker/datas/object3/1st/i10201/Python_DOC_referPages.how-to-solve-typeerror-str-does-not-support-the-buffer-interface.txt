My code:I want to convert a long int to bytes. But I am getting TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface. 
In Python 3, strings are implicitly Unicode and are therefore detached from a specific binary representation (which depends on the encoding that is used).  Therefore, the string "%s" % y cannot be written to a file that is opened in binary mode.Instead, you can just write y directly to the file:Moreover, your code ("%s" % y) in fact creates a Unicode string containing the string representation of y (i.e., str(y)), which isn't what you think it is.  For example:
In addition to @Will answer, it is better to use with statement in to open your files. Also, if you using python 3.2 and later, you can use int.to_bytes or int.from_bytes to reverse the process.Sample of what I said:The last print is to show you how to reverse it.
