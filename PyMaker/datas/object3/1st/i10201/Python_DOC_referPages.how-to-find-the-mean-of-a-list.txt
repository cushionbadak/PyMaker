Natural Text
I'm very new to python and trying to write some code so that the user enters something. If it's an integer it's sorted into the Numbers list, if it's a string it goes into the String list. I want to be able to find the mean of all the numbers that are in the list and print out the result.And in the String section I want to be able to print out everything within the string and its length.User types 'save' to exit and if input is valid that's caught.

There is good thing called statistics.mean:
You are using Length, which has not been defined.  I think what you wanted wasand you probably don't want it inside the loop, but just after it (although that might be another typo).
I found other more convenient way to produce the mean: Use statistics model and output the mean.
