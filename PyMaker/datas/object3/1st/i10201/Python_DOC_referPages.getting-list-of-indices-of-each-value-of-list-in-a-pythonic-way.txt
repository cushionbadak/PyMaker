I have a list data of values, and I want to return a dictionary mapping each value of data to a list of the indices where this value appears.This can be done using this code:but this runs in O(n^2), and this is too slow for long lists. Can an O(n) solution be coded using a "pythonic" syntax? (it can be done with creating an empty list and updating it in a loop, but I understand this is not recommended in python.)
You can use a defaultdict of lists to achieve this in O(n):For example, if data contains the string 'abcabccbazzzqa':
