This is how my JSON return object looks like:This is how I am trying to loop thru Statements:This is the error I am getting:Is it because the return data is Unicode or something wrong with the way I am looping?
You should convert the JSON into a dictionary withThen loop:
The way it's shown in your question, bucket_policy['Policy'] contains a string, not a dictionary.Either define it as a dictionary (i.e. get rid of u' at the beginning and ' at the end) or parse the JSON with json.loads.
