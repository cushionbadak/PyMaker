Using the Python C/API, how do I create a normal Python class using the normal Python class-creation mechanism (i.e.: not an extension type)?In other words, what is the Python C/API equivalent (in the sense that it does exactly the same in all cases) of a statement
In Python you can get programmatically create a class by calling the type built in function. See this answer for example.This takes three arguments: a name, a tuple of bases, and a dictionary.You can get the Python type in the C api as PyType_Type. You then just need to call it using one of the standard methods for calling PyObject* callables:(Note that you have to do &PyType_Type - the documentation implies that it's a PyObject* but it isn't!)
I'm not sure what you mean by "the normal Python class-creation mechanism", but...There's a documentation page dedicated to this: https://docs.python.org/3/extending/newtypes.html -- it creates a new type in an extension module, which is equivalent to creating a new class in Python code.The minimal example presented there is:
