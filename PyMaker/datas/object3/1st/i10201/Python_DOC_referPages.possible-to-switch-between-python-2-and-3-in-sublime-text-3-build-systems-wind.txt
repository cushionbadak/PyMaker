All my current coding has been in python 3, which I've installed via the Anaconda package. However I need to work on some code simultaneously in python 2. Is there a way I can add a build system in Sublime so I can switch between the two fluidly? I have both python 2 and 3 installed, however can't see a way of simply editing the build system slightly to switch between the two languages. The build system I'm using for python 3 is:Thanks very much!
Specify the absolute path to the version of Python. For example, if Python version 3 is located at /usr/bin/python3 and Python version 2 is located at /usr/bin/python2:Python 3 Build Configuration:Python 2 Build Configuration:Find the location of Python via which:See Build system of Sublime Text 3 executes a different version of PHP, it is the same principal.
Old question, but...On Windows, you dont need create a new build system or specify the absolute path. Edit already existing python build system.In SublimeText\Data\Packages\ create folder Python -> like this SublimeText\Data\Packages\Python\In this folder, create file Python.sublime-build , it will overwrite the existing python build system.In this file write (python launcher documentation):For choose version of python interpretator, in the first line of your scripts write (shebang lines)#! python or#! python3
