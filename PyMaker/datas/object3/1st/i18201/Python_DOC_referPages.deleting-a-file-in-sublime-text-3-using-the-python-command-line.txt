Natural Text
I'm using sublime text 3 and I wanted to find a way to delete a file/folder using just the command line for easier development/ faster development.I've installed advance_new_file so that I can easily create files and folders using just the shortcut key ctrl + alt + n. It's pretty smooth. But now I cannot find a way to delete files.There is a command line tool in ST3 and pressing ctrl+ ` will open the command line. Is there a shortcut on deleting files without having me use the mouse?
It opens the Python Interpreter. To delete the file, you have to import os or subprocess module and invoke rm command.If you are using Linux, you are in luck. Install Guake: http://guake.org/.These two keystrokes: F12 and Alt+Tab will allow you to do your tasks without mouse quickly.
Switching to an open shell prompt with AltTab or âŒ˜Tab is probably your fastest bet, but if you have lots of open windows or just want to do everything from within sublime, there are a couple of options.Hitting Ctrl` opens the built-in version of Python, in ST3 this is 3.3. From there, you can run import os, then use os.remove() to delete a file and os.rmdir() to delete an empty directory. To delete a directory with contents, first import shutil then use shutil.rmtree(). Other shutil methods like shutil.copy() (or shutil.copy2(), for preserving metadata), shutil.move(), and shutil.copytree() are also useful.
You can try this "shell command" package.To install this, firstly follow the instruction to install the package control.(win)/(command)+shift+p to bring out the command tools and find this Package Control -> Install Package and find "shell command". You should be able to execute shell command on the fly with the shortcut key. Refer the page for more information.
