I'm looking for the fastest way to compare if a string has one of two lengths. This string must be either one letter longer or shorter, and I feel that the if statement below might not be the fastest and I don't see much of an improvement in time with it, or without it. I'm comparing between two string, if my_word length is more than 1 character less or more than compare_word then I shall continue my loop.
you do not need to call len twice,you can utilize absExample:Update: With ipython's timeit there are almost no speed gain, however:Here's another run with shorter strings, but about the same result: https://gist.github.com/miku/6904419.Nevertheless, in the context of OPs code, abs(len(s) - len(t)) > 1 really is faster.
It seems that the fastest way isIndeed:
