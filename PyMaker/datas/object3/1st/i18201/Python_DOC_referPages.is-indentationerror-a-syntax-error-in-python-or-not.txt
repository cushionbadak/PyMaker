I have a simple question, Is IndentationError a SyntaxError in Python or not? I think it is not but since I am a beginner I would like to be sure. Are syntax errors only those which give me SyntaxError as a response in an interpreter? For example, if I type I get So if there's something else (IndentationError etc), may it be a sub-type of SyntaxError or not?
It means yesMore info here and here
Your example is a SyntaxError, because you can't have an identifier that starts with a number:An IndentationError is a kind of SyntaxError, see the method resolution order in: help(IndentationError) and: http://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.IndentationErrorValid identifiers:Invalid identifiers:See also:http://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers
