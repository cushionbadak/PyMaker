My code is for a Tic Tac Toe game and checking for a draw state but I think this question could be more useful in a general sense.I have a list that represents the board, it looks like this:When a player makes a move the int they moved on is replaced with their marker ('x' or 'o'), I already have checks in place to look for a winning state, what I can't do is check for a draw state, where none of the list values are ints but a winning state has not been set.The code I have so far:The if statement works, the elif does not, I think the problem is my 'or' operator, what I want to check for is: if the every item on the board is either playerOne marker or playerTwo marker, if I where to make the code:I would be checking to see if every place on the board was playerOne or every place on the board is playerTwo, which it won't be.So how do I check if the board is taken up by a combination of playerOne markers and playerTwo markers?
all and any are functions that take an iterable and determine......in the case of all(): if all the values in that iterable are non-False;...in the case of any(): if any of the values in that iterable is non-False.The above definitions make sense also in case of an empty iterable, otherwise one could more naturally say that all sees if all values are true, and any sees if any value is true. So you misunderstood a little bit how these functions work. Hence, the following does something completely not what you thought:...because any(foobars) would first be evaluated to either True or False, and then that boolean value would be compared to big_foobar, which generally always gives you False (unless big_foobar happens to be the same boolean value).Note: the iterable can be a list, but it can also be a generator/generator expression (≈ lazily evaluated/generated list) or any other iterator.What you want instead is:which basically first constructs an iterable that yields a sequence of booleans—for each item in foobars, it compares the item to big_foobar and emits the resulting boolean to the resulting sequence:then any walks over all items in tmp and returns True as soon as it finds the first True item. It's as if you did the following:Note: As DSM pointed out, any(x == y for x in xs) is equivalent to y in xs but the latter is more readable, quicker to write and runs faster.Some examples:I would strongly suggest simply playing with any and all with various inputs on the Python shell, or better yet, on the IPython shell to get a feel of how this works before you continue writing actual code.See also: http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#all
