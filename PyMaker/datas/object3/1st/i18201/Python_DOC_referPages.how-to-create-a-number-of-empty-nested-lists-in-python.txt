This question already has an answer here:List of lists changes reflected across sublists unexpectedly                    12 answers                I want to have a variable that is a nested list of a number of empty lists that I can fill in later. Something that looks like:  However, I do not know beforehand how many lists I will need, only at the creation step, therefore I need a variable a to determine it. I thought about simple my_variable=[[]]*a, but that creates copies of lists and it is not what I want to have. I could do:but I'm looking for a more elegant solution (preferably one-liner). Is there any?
Try a list comprehension:See below:Note however that the above is for Python 2.x.  On Python 3.x., since xrange was removed, you will want this:
Edit :-This will give you the same result like above but the list are not distinct instances,they are just n references to the same instance.
