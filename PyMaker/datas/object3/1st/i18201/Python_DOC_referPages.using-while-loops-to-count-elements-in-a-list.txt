My code should print the number of cities before Sochi excluding Sochi  .  I don't understand what this line (place = places[count]) does, nor do I understand why I need it twice. 
foreach would neaten it up
Now place is always places[0], i.e. Jack. Thus the while loop only terminates on the second condition, giving you the list length of 3.place = places[count] should go in the loop.
You can use the following while loop to check for the number of places before Sochi:The break statement means you'll exit your while loop.
Why not try a more pythonic solution instead ?
