I have a Python list of dates and I'm using min and max to find the most recent and the oldest (first, is that the best method?), but also I need to format the dates into something where I can figure out the current time and subtract the oldest date in the list so I can say something like "In the last 27 minutes..." where I can state how many days, hours, or minutes have past since the oldest. Here is my list (the dates change obviously depending on what I'm pulling) so you can see the current format. How do I get the info I need?
You won't get the oldest and newest date/time entries from your list with the entries by using min and max - "Fri" will come before "Mon", for example. So you'll want to put things into a data structure that represents date/time stamps properly.Fortunately, Python's datetime module comes with a method to convert lots of date/time stamp strings into a proper representation - datetime.datetime.strptime. See the guide for how to use it.Once that's done you can use min and max and then timedelta to compute the difference.
your question can be divided into three pieces:A)how to read string formated datesB)how to sort list of dates in pythonC)how to calculate the difference between two dates
