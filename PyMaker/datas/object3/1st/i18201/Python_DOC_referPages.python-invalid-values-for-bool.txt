What are invalid values for the bool() function? I mean which arguments make it throw exceptions?As far as I know any custom data structure is True and empty list, empty strings etc. are false. So are there any values for bool arguments that make it return other than "True" or "False"?
No, bool() can only return True or False. All values in Python have boolean meaning.If the value is not an empty container, numeric 0, None or False, bool() returns True.Note that bool() will use the __len__, __nonzero__ (Python 2) and __bool__ (Python 3) special methods if present; if these throw an exception bool() will not catch it.
