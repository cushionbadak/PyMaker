I have an assignment for programming, and I'm having trouble. I'm 99% done but it's the little things that are tripping me up. Here is my code:The output before this block and this block is this:I would like it to be this:
Try this:
Rather than printing out your characters one by one, I'd suggest using str.join and generator expressions to combine your translated sequences into strings:Then you can print them with just one print call:If you wanted some more sophisticated formatting of the output (rather than just spaces separating the values), you can use the str.format method to do whatever kind of formatting you want:That will print the strings in "reverse" order, with the "last" one left-justified in a width-20 column, the middle value centered in a width-20 column with underscores padding it on each side, and a representation of the "first" value (with quotes and backslash escapes, as needed) on the right of the final 20-wide column padded with asterisks. For example, if you three strings were 'foo', 'bar' and 'baz', you'd get:You can read about the string formatting mini-language in the documentation.
