Here is my Transaction class:And when I'm trying to run the date function:I'm getting the following error:How can I fix that?
If I had to guess, you did this:at the top of your code.  This means that you have to do this:to access the strptime method.  Or, you could change the import statement to this:and access it as you are.The people who made the datetime module also named their class datetime:
Use the correct call: strptime is a classmethod of the datetime.datetime class, it's not a function in the datetime module.As mentioned by Jon Clements in the comments, some people do from datetime import datetime, which would bind the datetime name to the datetime class, and make your initial code work.To identify which case you're facing (in the future), look at your import statementsimport datetime: that's the module (that's what you have right now).from datetime import datetime: that's the class.
