I have a string like the following "0:07:38.701" which means 0 hours, 7 minutes, 38 seconds and 701 ms.I then have a datetime object like the following: datetime.datetime(1945, 1, 3, 11, 45, 0, 44000)I would like to add these times (the first one is a delta, while the second is an absolute time reference) and get a new datetime.datetime object.How can I do this?
Once you have a datetime and a timedelta, adding them is as simple as using the + operator:There is no built-in parser for timedelta objects akin to strptime for datetime objects.You can sometimes fake it by actually parsing the string as a datetime, then extracting the fields to build a timedelta, but this is both hacky and complicatedâ€”and, for your simple format, you can write one trivially:
You can use a time delta:
EDIT: As pointed out in the comment, timedelta can handle float values. i.e. if seconds=38.701, it will convert it to seconds and millisecondsVersion before edit:
One more solution, and my favorite so far since it requires no manual parsing and uses existing functionality in datetime to parse dates in string format:
