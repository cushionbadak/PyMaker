I have an array with an element from the operator module.  I tried storing this with JSON but but got the following error msg. TypeError: <built-in function ge> is not JSON serializableis there a workaround or another way to store this?
You could use the pickle module, which can serialize objects, too:Pickle will write a byte-stream, which won't be human-readable in contrast to JSON.
