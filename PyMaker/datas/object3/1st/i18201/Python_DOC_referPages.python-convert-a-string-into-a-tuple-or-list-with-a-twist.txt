I have a set of data that looks like so:Now I want to loop through this data and create a list or a tuple in a function and return each row but name that tuple using the first part of the string:now i did some spliting up of the string via | but hit a wall when i tried to use string[0] = (string[1],string[2]) to define the tuple.Could anyone give me a pointer here please.Ric
