Is there an easy way to compute the element-wise sum of N lists in python? I know if we have n lists defined (call the ith list c_i), we can do:For example:Here z = [9, 12]But what if we don't have c_i defined and instead have c_1...c_n in a list C? Is there a similar way to find z if we just have C?I hope this is clear.resolved: I was wondering what the * operator was all about...thanks!
Just do this:In the above, C is the list of c_1...c_n. As explained in the link in the comments (thanks, @kevinsa5!):* is the "splat" operator: It takes a list as input, and expands it into actual positional arguments in the function call.For additional details, take a look at the documentation, under "unpacking argument lists" and also read about calls (thanks, @abarnert!)
This isn't all that different from Óscar López's answer, but uses itertools.imap instead of a list comprehension.
