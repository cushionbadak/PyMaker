I'm trying to read a number from file and convert it to int in order to compare it to a value, but I'm getting this error:ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: \xef\xbb\xbf10I do something like this:The file inside is like a table (it's a CSV file) and inside, it looks like this:This is one line of the file; there are more lines with several IDs, so I want to see if an ID exists in file.What am I doing wrong?
What you encounter at some point is the BOM (Byte Order Mark), $EF $BB $BF.You are trying to be smarter than Python. Python has a csv module that will do the CSV parsing properly; use it instead of tinkering your own half-baked parser.
