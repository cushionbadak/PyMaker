I had a lab today about making a power set from a set of arbitrary size, but I couldn't seem to think of the best way to do it. No one in the class has done Python before either. Only done java
There's a recipe in itertools for that:
The insight is that for each set S in the powerset, a given member of the original set is either in S or it isn't. Since this is a binary decision, the powerset doubles for each additional element in the original set.This leads to a nice recursive algorithm that works for sets of "arbitrary size" as long as arbitrary is not too large.
