I want to print all of the items in all dictionary lists. But I got the following message: Can someone help?
Your code is trying to turn a string into a dict. That's just what dict does, but that doesn't make sense here.Instead, just put the objects directly into GroupList.But I really want is items in each Dictionary can be printed in separated lines.I'd just use pprint for this and be done with it:
I think this is what you want:Output:Basically, all I did was make the items in GroupList be the dictionaries, not strings.  I also removed dict in print (dict(groupname).keys()) because it is not needed.
As ICodez and Matt Ball pointed out, the better way to do it is just use a list of dictionaries, not names. You could even make a list of names to print, if you really want to print names for the dictionaries too.But if you really want to do it your way, you want to use locals(), which is a special function that returns the dictionary mapping the names of all local variables to their values.The first part of the last line, locals()[groupname] uses the name of your dictionary variable to get the actual dictionary, and then the .keys() gets the keys, as you wanted.
