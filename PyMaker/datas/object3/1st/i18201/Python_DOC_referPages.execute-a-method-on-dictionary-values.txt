What is the most pythonic way to iterate a dictionary and conditionally execute a method on values.e.g. It can't be a dict comprehension because I am not trying to create a dictionary from the result. It is just iterating a dictionary and executing some method on values of the dictionary.
What you have is perfectly fine, and you can iterate with something like:See: dict.items()For your enlightenment, it is possible to condense that into two lines:but I don't think this gains you anything... it just makes it more confusing. I would by far prefer the first approach.
Why not create a dict with lambda functions?
One way to do this is to have a dictionary of functions to call, and then use the key to locate the actual function that you wish to call:If you have a lot of functions / keys, this makes the code a lot easier to read and maintain.
Just to complicate things, if you are always going to have two methods that you are going to call then something like this will work:As you can see from all the answers there are plenty of ways to do this, but do yourself and anyone else who will be reading your code and keep it simple.
