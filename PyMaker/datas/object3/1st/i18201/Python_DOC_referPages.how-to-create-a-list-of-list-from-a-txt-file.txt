I am working in Python 3.3.2. right now I am trying to create a list of lists from a txt file. For example:I have a txt file with this data: I want python to generate a list of lists from this txt file, so I need the data to look like this: [[102547.879, 365478.456], [102547.658, 451658.263], [102658.878, 231456.454]]What must I do?Thanks for your attention!
I'd encourage use of the with statement in new programmers, it's a good habit to get into.Depending on the size of the file, you could also instead of using the out list, modify it to use the yield keyword.
This is a case where I think map is more readable, although having to wrap that in a call to list in Python 3.x detracts from it.
This might do:
