Use any() to test the sublists:This tests each subl but exits the generator expression loop early if a match is found.This does not, however, return the specific sublist that matched. You could use next() with a generator expression to find the first match:where None is a default returned if the generator expression raises a StopIteration exception, or you can omit the default and use exception handling instead:
You could use any() with list comprehensions (well, generator comprehensions here):
