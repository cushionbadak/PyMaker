When I print out my list of the top twenty occurrences all I get is the object location and not the actual data I need. Also if you have any ideas for improvement that would be greatly appreciated. Please help. Thanks.Here is my code.
Add __repr__ and __str__ methods to your class:Demo:The __str__ method is called automatically when your object is converted to a string, like the print() function does.The __repr__ method is used for repr() representations and when your object is displayed in lists and other containers.
