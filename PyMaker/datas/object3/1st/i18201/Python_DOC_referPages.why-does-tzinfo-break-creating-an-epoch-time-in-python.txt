Why does the following happen?Why is it off by one hour whether or not tzinfo is included?  I'm assuming it has to do with DST, but... UTC does not have DST.So, the difference is tm_isdst is 0 or -1.  Both seem very "No DST-ish".Just not thrilled with the workaround.Update:After reading some docs (http://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.mktime)  It appears  mktime() outputs "localtime" not UTC as I had thought.  Which confuses everything.
.strftime('%s') is not supported by Python. Do not use it.On systems where it works, it interprets the datetime object as time in local timezone i.e., datetime.now().strftime('%s') might return value near time.time().To find out utc offset or whether DST is in effect for a given local time, you could call d.utcoffset(), d.dst() where d is a datetime object with pytz timezone.As expected UTC offset is zero for UTC timezone and there is no DST transitions so .dst() is always zero all year round.
