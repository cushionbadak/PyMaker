the reason i have signed up here today is to ask for a hint to where i'm going wrong in this argument. i am very new to coding and was hoping i might be able to get some help. i feel i'm slightly cheating myself by asking for help so early, so if someone can explain where I've made mistakes i would like to try and figure out how to correct them, clues and hints would be appreciated but i would really like to understand where the errors are what to do to correct them and why, so please don't just paste the answer. thanksok here is my attempt at Writing a Car salesman program where the user enters the base price of a car. The program should add a bunch of extra fees such as tax, license, dealer prep, and destination charge. Make tax and license a percent of the base price. The other fees should be set values. Display the actual price of the car once all the extras are applied.the last time i ran the program i had a name error o.k. i hope this information helps and thank you for your time in advancealex
taxes*=0.06 is shorthand for taxes = taxes * 0.06. Which you have not yet defined. I think what you actually meant to write wasYou'll still have other issues with this program, though.
taxes *= 0.06 is shorthand for taxes = taxes * 0.06, , i.e., the new value of taxes is 0.06 times the old value of taxes. Thus the interpreter is complaining that you haven't defined taxes before using it on the right hand side.Presumably what you want is:or
You seem to be unclear on what the *= and += operators do. What you want is to assign taxes (and the other variables) some values equal to base_price * 0.06 and so on. Use the = operator to assign values to a variable (like you did in the first line), and the * operator to multiply two values together (e.g. base_price * 0.06).You've got this problem in several places, as well as an issue where I think you don't know what the input function does: if you just want to display a value, you should use the print function.I highly recommend going through the tutorials. They do a good job covering this sort of stuff.
The line taxes *= 0.06 means, taxes = taxes * 0.06. Python is telling you that it doesn't know what the value of taxes is (because you haven't assigned it a value).licence and premium_pack have the same issue.
You are incorrectly using the *= and += statements.You can't use the taxes *=0.06 statement unless you have defined taxes previously. Same is the case with licence and premium_pack.Also, the statement float(input(taxes)) is wrong, you need to pass a string as an argument to it. (http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)Next, if you are using python 2.7, the usage of the input statement is incorrect - you should use raw_input instead. (https://stackoverflow.com/a/3800862/1860929)There is an extra closing bracket in print("\n\total price:", total_price)) statementYou are using an extra \ after \n due to which, the t of total will get escaped.Finally, you need to check the logic itself. As @Wayne has pointed in his answer, you probably want to do taxes = base_price * 0.06 and not taxes = taxes * 0.06Check the following code, I think you are looking for something similar
