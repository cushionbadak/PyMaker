I am trying to write a math quiz program for my Python class, but I keep getting an error with the sum() function. The error is:Here is my code:Error:
The problem is that, at the time you call main, you haven't yet defined sum.So, why isn't this a NameError? Because there's already a builtin named sum, so you're calling that. And that function requires an iterable of values, not two separate values. (If you don't know what an iterable is: It's something you can loop over in a for loop, like a list.) So, it looks at your first argument—a random integer—and tries to use it as an iterable. And that's why you get that error.If you move your definition up above the call to main(), your code will work. However, it will still be a source of confusion. This is one reason it's better to avoid giving your functions the same name as any of the builtins.As a side note, the function you're defining already exists, as operator.add. The reason add and friends are tucked away in the operator module is that you usually don't need them. If you just want to add two numbers, a + b is always clearer than sum(a, b). You only need it as a separate function when you need to pass that function around (e.g., to use as an argument to map).
sum is already a builtin function!Usage: sum(list)In your code:
Place the sum function on the top of main function.ex:Then call the main function.
The problem is that a int can't be an iterator in sum build in function , you need to make it a list :
