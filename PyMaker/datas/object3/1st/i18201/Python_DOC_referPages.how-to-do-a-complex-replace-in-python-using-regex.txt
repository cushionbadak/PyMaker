Here is the scenario:What I want to do is to replace the str to "select * from records where year = 2003 and t1 = m1"Could anyone tell me how to do it using python regex? Thanks!
If you use {..} instead of #{..}, you can use str.format_map or str.format:Regular expression solution: Use re.sub with the replacement function as the second argument.
