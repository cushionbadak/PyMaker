I have a list L of 4-length listand two integers a and b which appear many times in the sublists. What I want is to find the index of the sublists in L which contain a AND b.I wrote a little codeThe index I am looking for are in the list r. However I am pretty sure there is another way to do it in Python since I barely know this language. Maybe if my variable L is something else than a list of lists it would be easier/faster, because I will call this procedure a lot in my main program. (len(L) is around 3000)By the way I know that the number of index is between one and four included, so I could put some break but I don't know if it will be faster.---------------- EDIT 1 ----------------Change "a or b (or is inclusive)" to "a AND b" in the second sentence. I wrote a mistake about my goal.

You can do this:enumerate will give you both indices and values in your list comprehension, and the any statement will tell you if either a or b are in x, which is a sublist in L
Use any() to test the sublists:This tests each subl but exits the generator expression loop early if a match is found.This does not, however, return the specific sublist that matched. You could use next() with a generator expression to find the first match:where None is a default returned if the generator expression raises a StopIteration exception, or you can omit the default and use exception handling instead:
This kind of thing is what list comprehension is made for.If you really want inclusive or -- then this is the list you want. In your code, currently, you've giving and.
