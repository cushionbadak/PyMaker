I made a little parser using HTMLparser and I would like to know where a link is redirected. I don't know how to explain this, so please look this example:On my page I have a link on the source: http://www.myweb.com?out=147, which redirects to http://www.mylink.com. I can parse http://www.myweb.com?out=147 without any problems, but I don't know how to get http://www.mylink.com.
You can use urllib2 (urllib.request in Python 3) and its HTTPRedirectHandler in order to find out where a URL will redirect you. Here's a function that does that:
You can not get hold of the redirection URL through parsing the HTML source code. Redirections are triggered by the server and NOT by the client. You need to perform a HTTP request to the related URL and check the HTTP response of the server - in particular for the HTTP status code 304 (Redirection) and the new URL.
