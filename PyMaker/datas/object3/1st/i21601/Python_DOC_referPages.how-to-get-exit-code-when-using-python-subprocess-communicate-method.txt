How do I retrieve the exit code when using Python's subprocess module and the communicate() method?Relevant code:Should I be doing this another way?
Popen.communicate will set the returncode attribute when it's done(*). Here's the relevant documentation section:So you can just do (I didn't test it but it should work):(*) This happens because of the way it's implemented: after setting up threads to read the child's streams, it just calls wait. 
You should first make sure that the process has completed running and the return code has been read out using the .wait method. This will return the code. If you want access to it later, it's stored as .returncode in the Popen object. 
exitcode = data.wait(). The child process will be blocked If it writes to standard output/error, and/or reads from standard input, and there are no peers.
.poll() will update the return code.TryIn addition, after .poll() is called the return code is available in the object as child.returncode.
This worked for me. It also prints the output returned by the child process
