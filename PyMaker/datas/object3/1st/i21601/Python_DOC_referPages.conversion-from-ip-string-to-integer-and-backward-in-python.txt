i have a little problem with my script, where i need to convert ip in form 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' to integer representation and go back from this form.Anybody knows how to fix that?

Python 3 has ipaddress module which features very simple conversion:
In pure python without use additional moduleResult:
You lose the left-zero-padding which breaks decoding of your string.Here's a working function:
Below are the fastest and most straightforward (to the best of my knowledge)convertors for IPv4 and IPv6:Python code not using inet_ntop() and struct module is like order of magnitude slower than this regardless of what it is doing.
One line
Let me give a more understandable way:ip to int The above:equivalent to :also:equivalent to :int to ip:or:
My approach is to straightforwardly look at the the number the way it is stored, rather than displayed, and to manipulate it from the display format to the stored format and vice versa.So, from an IP address to an int:This evaluates each field, and shifts it to its correct offset, and then sums them all up, neatly converting the IP address' display into its numerical value.In the opposite direction, from an int to an IP address:The numerical representation is first converted into its hexadecimal string representation, which can be manipulated as a sequence, making it easier to break up. Then, pairs are extracted by mapping ''.join onto tuples of pairs provided by zipping a list of two references to an iterator of the IP string (see How does zip(*[iter(s)]*n) work?), and those pairs are in turn converted from hex string representations to int string representations, and joined by '.'.
I used following:
