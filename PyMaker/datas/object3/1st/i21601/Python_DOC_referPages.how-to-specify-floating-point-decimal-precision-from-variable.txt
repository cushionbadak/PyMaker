I have the following repetitive simple code repeated several times that I would like to make a function for:I want to be able to call this function: def printStr(precision)Where it preforms the code above and returns tabStr with val to precision decimal points.  For example: printStr(3)would return 63.457 for val in tabStr.Any ideas how to accomplish this kind of functionality?
where i is the number of decimal places.BTW, in the recent Python where .format() has superseded %, you could usefor the same task.Or, with field names for clarity:If you are using Python 3.6+, you could simply use f-strings:
I know this an old thread, but there is a much simpler way to do this:Try this:
This should work toowhere i is the precision required.
