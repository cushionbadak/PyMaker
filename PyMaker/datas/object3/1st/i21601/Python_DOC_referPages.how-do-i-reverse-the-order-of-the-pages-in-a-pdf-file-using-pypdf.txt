I have a pdf file "myFile.pdf". I would like to reverse the order of its pages using pyPdf. How?

Thanks for sharing suggestions. I used them and edited a bit to make the interface more graphical when selecting and saving a file. New to all of this and what I added might not be efficient or clean, but it worked for me and thought to share.
As of (long before) January 2019, pyPdf is no longer updated, and upon testing is not compatible with (at least) Python 3.6, and likely at all with Python 3:(Moving the __all__ assignment above the import fixes this specific problem, but other SyntaxErrors due to Python 2 syntax then pop up.)Fortunately, its successor project, PyPDF2, works cleanly on Python 3.6 (at least). It appears the core user-facing API was intentionally maintained to be compatible with pyPdf, so nosklo's answer can be used in modern Python after a pip install PyPDF2 just by changing to PyPDF2 in the import statement, and switching xrange to range:I would also recommend the more Pythonic approach of just iterating over the pages directly using reversed:I don't know if this .pages collection was available in the original pyPdf, but arguably it doesn't really matter much at this point.
