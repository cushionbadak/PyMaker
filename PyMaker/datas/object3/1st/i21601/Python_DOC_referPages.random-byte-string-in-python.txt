i have buf="\x00\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\x00"how can i get the "\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF" randomize

Faster than other solutions but not cryptographically secure.
An alternative way to obtaining a secure random sequence of bytes could be to use the standard library secrets module, available since Python 3.6.Example, based on the given question:More information can be found at:https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html
Do you want the middle 4 bytes to be set to a random value?
On POSIX platforms:Use /dev/random for better randomization.
I like using numpy library for that.
Simple:
