I am trying to loop over all the zipped files in a directory and keep it's size. I saw that I can do that without extracting it, but when I try to do so, I get an ERROR: " IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:'first_gz_file.*.gz' "When I am looking for it,I can find it, so I don't understand why do I get the error.this is my code:it does print the o files correctly (if I delete the lines below it)What goes wrong there?thank you
Don't open the file use os.path.getsize(path)As for what goes wrong a quick check shows that a gzip object doesn't have a size method:I would add don't use file and dir as variable names as they are both reserved words in python that you might need to use in the original context they are both also lists in the context you are using them so use root, dirs, files or root, dir_list file_list for clarity.
