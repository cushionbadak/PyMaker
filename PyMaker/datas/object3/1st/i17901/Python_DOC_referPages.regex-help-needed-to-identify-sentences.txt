Natural Text
I have a text like this:"MarkWhatever sentenceWhatever sentence 2MattWhatever sentence 3Whatever sentence 4CarolWhatever sentence 5Whatever sentence 6"I want to be able to identify each sentence (and then make a list of each sentence). How can I do this in a easy way?It doesn't matter if Mark, Matt and Carol are identified and later added to the list because those names are always the same but the sentences can differ.I've tried a bit, but I can't figure out how to deal with the empty lines...Any help would be much appreciated even if it's just a pointer to head me in the right direction..
In Python, you don't need a regex.Just use splitlines:Then filter out all the blank lines:If by "make a list of each sentence", you mean split each sentence into words, you could do this:
If all sentences end with a newline, you can use this (very simple) regular expression:Tip: you can use http://rubular.com/ to test your regular expressions.
