How to change symbol + (button in keyboard) in python to operate your custom def rather than default addition ?
You can implement one or more of the following methods on your class:__add__ - handles the case when you have (your object) + (some other object)__radd__ - handles the case when you have (some other object) + (your object) and the other object doesn't know how to do the addition.__iadd__ - handles (your object) += (some object). You don't necessarily need to implement this, as Python will call __add__ if you don't.There are corresponding "magic" methods for other operations, mathematical and otherwise, see here.
Numeric operations on classes are delegated to various methods. Simply implement them on your class to perform the desired operation.Note that you cannot change the behavior of the standard operators when the operand or both operands are existing types.
