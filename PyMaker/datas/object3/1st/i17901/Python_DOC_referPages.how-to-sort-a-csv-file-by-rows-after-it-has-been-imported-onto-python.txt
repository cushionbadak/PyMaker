The csv file is 18 columns and 45000 rows. it is imported using these codes (it contains special characters)how would i sort this by columns?any example code or references i can look at would be appreciated. 
The Python Sorting HOW TO has some good information.  If you get the contents of your CSV file into a list, you can use the techniques documented there.
Use zip:Example:rows = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]for row in rows: print(row)columns = zip(*rows)for column in columns: print(column)Give it a shot
