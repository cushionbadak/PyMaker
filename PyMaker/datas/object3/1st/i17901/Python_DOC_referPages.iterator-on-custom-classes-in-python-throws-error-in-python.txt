This question already has an answer here:Build a Basic Python Iterator                    9 answers                I am a wring a custom class called queue that uses iterator. I have an Iterator class in a seperate file called iterator.py. I get the error below when I try to iterate using for loop.iterator.pyI get this error messageI do not understand why it is not returning an iterator. what fixes needed here?
That's because next() method should not be magic, you don't need double underscores. As mentioned before, Python 3 is different.
Iterators must themselves implement __iter__.  They can just return self.  From docs, note that custom iterator objects must support __iter__ to support for and in statements.  Also, as @Robáµ© noted, since you are using Python 2 instead of 3, you need to implement next(), not __next__().
