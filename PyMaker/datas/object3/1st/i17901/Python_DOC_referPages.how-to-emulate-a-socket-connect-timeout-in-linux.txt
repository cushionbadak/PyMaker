In MacOS, I used to go with the following solution:If another socket tries to connect to this address, it will be hung up until server calls listen.But this is not the case in Linux, trying to connect before the listen call results in Connection Refused immediately.So is there a better way to emulate connect timeout when testing?
I don't know the specifics of what you're testing, but you perhaps could go ahead and do an accept, and then sleep - you'll appear to get a connection in the client, but it doesn't do anything useful (for a while).  Or play with your firewall settings :)
You can use poll or select. It returns until n seconds , which it is specified by you, or when it is writable, which means connectable for clients.http://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=poll#multiprocessing.Connection.poll
