I'm using PyCharm to develop a GAE app in Mac OS X. Is there any way to display colours in the run console of PyCharm?I've set a handler to output colours in ansi format. Then, I've added the handler:But the colour is the same.EDIT:A response from JetBrains issue tracker: Change line 55 of the snippet from sys.stderr to sys.stdout. stderr stream is always colored with red color while stdout not.Now colours are properly displayed.
PyCharm doesn't support that feature natively, however you can download the Grep Console plugin and set the colors as you like.Here's a screenshot:http://plugins.jetbrains.com/files/7125/screenshot_14104.png (link is dead)I hope it helps somewhat :) although it doesn't provide fully colorized console, but it's a step towards it.
As of at least PyCharm 2017.2 you can do this by enabling:Run | Edit Configurations... | Configuration | Emulate terminal in output console 
Late to the party, but anyone else with this issue, here's the solution that worked for me:This came from this answer
What solved it for me (on PyCharm 2017.2) was going to Preferences -> Editor -> Color Scheme -> Console Colors and changing the color of Console -> Error output. Of course this also changes the error color but at least you don't see red all the time...
I discovered the following solution. Apparently Pycharm redirects sys.stdout. From the sys module documentation:These objects contain the original values of stdin, stderr and stdout  at the start of the program. They are used during finalization, and  could be useful to print to the actual standard stream no matter if  the sys.std* object has been redirected.It can also be used to restore the actual files to known working file  objects in case they have been overwritten with a broken object.  However, the preferred way to do this is to explicitly save the  previous stream before replacing it, and restore the saved object.Therefore, to solve this issue you can redirect output to sys.__stdout__. Example configuration from my log_config.yml:
