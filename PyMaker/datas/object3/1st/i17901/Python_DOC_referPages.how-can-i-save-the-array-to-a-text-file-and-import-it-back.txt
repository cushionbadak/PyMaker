Natural Text
Basically, I want to know how to get my array that gets data from peoples input saved to a text file and automatically imported back into the array when the program starts again. Edit: Now after this, it seems saving and reopening adds data to the same subarraysMy code:
Use JSON; Python has a json module built-in :You could also use Pickle to serialize a dictionary, but JSON is better for small data and is human-readable and editable with a simple text editor, where as Pickle is a binary format.I've updated your code to use JSON and dictionaries, and it works fine :
This module would do what you want: http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.htmlAn example:Pickle serializes your object. In essence this means it converts it to a storeable format that can be used to recreate a clone of the original. Check out the wiki entry if you're interested in more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization
Python docs have a beautiful explanation on how to handle text files among other files to read/write. Here's the link:http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.htmlHope it helps!
You need to serialize the array somehow to store it in a file.  Serialize basically just means turn into a representation that is linear.  For our purposes that means a string.  There are several ways (csv, pickle, json). My current favorite way to do that is json.dump() and json.load() to read it back in.  See json docs
