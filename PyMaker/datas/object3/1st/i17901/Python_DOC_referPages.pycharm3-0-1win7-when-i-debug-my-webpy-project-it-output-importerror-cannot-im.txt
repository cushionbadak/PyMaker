My Code is the simple webpy example，there is no problem with it。
Most likely you've created a module named code.py.If you do this, it hides the stdlib module code, so anything that needs to use that module will find your module instead.And the reason you get this error is that your code module doesn't have anything named compile_command.In general, you always want to avoid giving your modules the same name as anything in the stdlib, or any site-packages you've installed. You can work around this by, e.g., organizing your modules into packages instead of leaving them all at the top level, but it's easier to just not re-use the names.
