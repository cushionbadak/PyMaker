Can I use ContextFilters in python logging to change loglevels based on modulenames. So something like In the python documentation I haven't really found out anything about this so any help pointing to this would be great.
The appropriate way, which is documented here, is to use module-level loggers named with __name__ and to then set their levels as desired in the logging configuration. There's no need to use a Filter for this.
