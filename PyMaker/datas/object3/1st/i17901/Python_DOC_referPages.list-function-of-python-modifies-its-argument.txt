(I am quite a newbie in Python, so lots of things puzzle me even after reading the tutorial...)Initially, I had the code like the following:-- which did what I expected. But then for some reason I wanted to determine the number of members in matrix; as len(matrix) gave an error, I decided to copy it with converting to the list: mtxlist = list(matrix). Surprisingly, after this line the content of matrix seems to be changed - or at least I cannot use it the same way as above:Can anybody explain what is going on there?
You're using Python 3, correct?zip returns a generator that can only be iterated once. If you want to use it more than once, then your options are:Write zip(*strings) each time you need it.(iterate matrix as many times as you like. This is the easy option. The downside is that if zip(*strings) is big then it uses a lot of memory that the generator doesn't.)(iterate each of matrix1 and matrix2 once. This is worse than the tuple in your usage, but it's useful if you want to partially consume matrix1, then use some of matrix2, more of matrix1, etc)(iterate but using matrix(), not matrix, as many times as you like. Doesn't use extra memory for a copy of the result like the tuple solution, but the syntax for using it is a bit annoying)(iterate using matrix as many times as you like. Deals with the syntax annoyance, although you still have to beware that if you modify strings between iterations over matrix then you'll get different results.)
