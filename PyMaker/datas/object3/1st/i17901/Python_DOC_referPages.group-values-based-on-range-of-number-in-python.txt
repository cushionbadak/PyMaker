I have a list as follows:I want to add a string to the list based on the second number. If second number in the list are within 20 or so of other second numbers, they will be assigned same 'project' name. See below:I have tried groupby, but couldn't find a way to work it for range.Any help would be great. Thank you

using https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cluster/1.1.0b1
returns
Try looping through your data:Edit: Sorry, I just realized that prev=None doesn't work. I could have done some checking for whether prev is None, but I decided that for the data given, just doing prev=0 works just the same. Thanks for pointing out my mistake!
