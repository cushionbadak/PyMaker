I am trying to get the ppid of the process that I want.I used following code to get the pidNow in the str[0], I have the pid of the process say ruby, I want to get the parent process ID ppid and child process ID of the same process.I need this solution to be run on Solaris as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0Is there any way to get that like getppid() and getchildid()? Or do I need to do it by grep command again and splitting?
Using this code is a bad idea. Your code will not work on solaris.You can use 'psutil' library, that way you can keep your code independent of os.https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil
I presume there's nothing wrong with os.getppid() .Shrug.http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#process-parameters
The answer depends on your system's ps command. On Linux, ps will include the PPID for each process with the -l flag (among others), so ps -ale | grep ruby will include the ruby process id in str[3] and ruby's PPID in str[4].
