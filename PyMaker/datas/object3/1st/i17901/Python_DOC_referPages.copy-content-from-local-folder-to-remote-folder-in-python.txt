I am trying to copy files from  a local folder to a remote windows share using python. So the main requirement is to move files from source folder (which keeps changing) to a Remote Share:Not sure what I am doing wrong but below is what I have tried to so far:The sourceFolderPath keeps changing on every run with different input. Ex: it can be .\prepared\1_2 or .\prepared\2_3 which will keep changing on every script run. If I print srcArchFiles it shows list of the folders which exists in  srcArchFolderPath succesfully. Also os.makedirs(destFolder) creates a folder succesfully on the remote share location. But the files copy is failing and not sure why it's failing, I belive I am not doing something right with shutil. Following is the error I am seeing:File "C:\Python26\lib\shutil.py", line 140, in copytreenames = os.listdir(src)TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, list foundAny help in correcting this is much appreciated. 
srcArchFiles is a list of folders. shutil.copytree needs one folder as the first parameter.You have to use a loop to copy each folder.
I've found a good solution here: Execute remote commands on windows like psexec (Python recipe)
