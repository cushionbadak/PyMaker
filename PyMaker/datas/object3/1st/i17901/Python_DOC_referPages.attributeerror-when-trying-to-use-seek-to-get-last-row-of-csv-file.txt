Natural Text
I am trying to return the last row from a csv file.  I am modifying another function that I wrote previously that returns the last line from a text file.  It seemed to work as expected at first, but now when I call the function it throws an error.Can someone please help me modify my code?  I was pretty sure you could use seek in this way, maybe I'm mistaken?
Here's a slight variation of the core concept in the accepted answer to the question Have csv.reader tell when it is on the last line applied to your variation of the problem. Since each row is potentially a different length, there's really no way around having to read the whole file.UpdateHere's a simpler and likely faster way to do it using a collections.deque. I got the idea from one of the answers to the question How to read an output line containing a list of integers produced.
csv reader not support seek, so you can get csv file last line as text file, then process last line as csv.In your code, if last line length > distance, then will get only part of last line.then read csv:
