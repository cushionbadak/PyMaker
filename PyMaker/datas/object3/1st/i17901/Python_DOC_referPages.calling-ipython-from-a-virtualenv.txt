I understand that IPython is not virtualenv-aware and that the most logical solution to this is to install ipython in each virtualenv seperately using So far so good. One thing I noticed is that if the system-wide copy of IPython is called from within a virtualenv using $> ipython before IPython is installed under this virtualenv, subsequent $> ipython commands will continue to bring up the system-wide ipython copy. On the other hand, if ipython is not called prior to installing it under a virtualenv $> ipython will bring up the newly installed copy. What is the explanation for this?It also makes me wonder if this behavior means I should expect some trouble down the way? 
alias ipy="python -c 'import IPython; IPython.terminal.ipapp.launch_new_instance()'"This is a great way of always being sure that the ipython instance always belongs to the virtualenv's python version. This works only on ipython >2.0.Source
You can force IPython to use a virtual environment if available by adding file below to ~/.ipython/profile_default/startups:I recommend naming it 00-virtualenv.py so changes will be made as early as possible.Note: Make sure ipython is installed in the new virtual environment to get this to work.
The answer given by @SiddharthaRT is good! Following this approach, it is simpler for me just:This will use the module IPython through the python bin, ensuring that it refers to the bin from the virtual env.
As others mentioned, recent versions of ipython are virtualenv aware, so you can use your virtualenv bin activate script to run ipython using your virtualenv, e.g.
If you're trying to open a notebook, even ipython 5 won't help - ipython will disregard the virtualenv (at least on my machine/setup).You'll need to use rgtk's script, but please make sure to modify the optional filter part and the sys.path.insert as below:ADD1: in the original script we get back a filter object, we would break sys.path and insert below would failADD2: see this question and python documentation
(Debian/Ubuntu) assuming some version (x) of Python3 is installed, then:will launch ipython running your version of Python3.
