I have used Counter to count the number of occurrence of the list items. I have trouble in displaying it nicely. For the below code,the following is the output,I have to display the above result as follows,I tried to iterate over the counter object but I'm unsuccessful. Is there a way to print the output of the Counter operation nicely?
Counter is essentially a dictionary, thus it has keys and corresponding values - just like the ordinary dictionary.From the documentation:A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is an  unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and  their counts are stored as dictionary values.You can use this code:However, you shouldn't rely on the order of keys in dictionaries.Counter.most_common is very useful. Citing the documentation I linked:Return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the  most common to the least. If n is not specified, most_common() returns  all elements in the counter. Elements with equal counts are ordered  arbitrarily.(emphasis added)
print calls __str__ method of Counter class, so you need to override that in order to get that output for print operation.Demo:
This works:Here is a reference on sorted and one on dict.iteritems.
