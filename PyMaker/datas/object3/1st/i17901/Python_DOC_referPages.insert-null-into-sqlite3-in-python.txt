I am trying to insert a None value into a row entry of my db. The table present existsbut I get an error:how do I insert a blank value for the second field in the row?
Use a tuple, I.E.:
Last time tested on: August 2018 Python 3.6.1Python 2.7.10I'm not sure if it was the case back when the original question was posted, but as of today:throwswhen ran.Because execute() accepts sql — which is sql query to execute, and parameters — which is iterable, containing query parameters (currently this is true for both Python 2 and Python 3. As string is iterable — it treats it accordingly.Docs clearly state, that Python None type correspond to SQLite NULL type.So, correct way to do it would be:
The problem here is that the values that you're supplying are meant to be in either a list or a tuple. The second argument is expected the be a collection (array of some kind) that can be iterated over. If you supply a collection it will work, even if that collection only has the one value in it. Another problem arises though in that a string behaves like a collection of characters, and can be iterated over. So when you supply a single string without putting it in a collection itself, it says the "collection" is too big, compared to the number of bindings (question marks). The string "This is a test!" is 15 characters long, and can look like a collection (array) with 15 values when the len() function is used on it. So sqlite3 thinks you've passed a collection as it wants, but the size of the collection doesn't match the number of bindings you've got in the query.
