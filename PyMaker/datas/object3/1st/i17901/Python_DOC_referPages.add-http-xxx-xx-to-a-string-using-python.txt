How can I add "http://test.url/" to the result link.get('href') below, but only if it doesn't contain "http"

Use urlparse.urljoin:In Python 3.x, use urllib.parse.urljoin:Complete example
I would use urljoinIn your example you only need to do this when you find a relative url.
In the spirit of BeautifulSoup, this works well with your original code.If what you want is to preface the non-http sites with a http://test.url/ then you need to do this:You're set either way.
