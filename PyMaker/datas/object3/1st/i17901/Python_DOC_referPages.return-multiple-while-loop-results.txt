I have a while loop that returns data to a function.I need to know how I can return each value back to the function the while loop is in. Also, to be more specific, the data that I'm returning is actually in a list. So maybe somehow appending the new list to the old list would be a better approach. Either way, I'm lost and I need help.Thanks.
If you want to return a bunch of things, put them in a list and return that:Alternatively, it might be appropriate to yield the results, turning your function into a generator:Both of these options let you iterate over the return value to get the elements, but the generator option only lets you do so once. return halts the function immediately, so once your function hits a return, it won't continue on to further loop iterations.
You can use a Generator:
