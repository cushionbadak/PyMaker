By the way, the list that you have in your post contains ints, not strings.Also, please NEVER name your variables list or dict or any other type for that matter
writelines() needs a list of strings with line separators appended to them but your code is only giving it a list of integers. To make it work you'd need to use something like this:In Python file objects are context managers which means they can be used with a with statement so you could do the same thing a little more succinctly with the following which will close the file automatically. It also uses a generator expression (enclosed in parentheses instead of brackets) to do the string conversion since doing that avoids the need to build a temporary list just to pass to the function.
