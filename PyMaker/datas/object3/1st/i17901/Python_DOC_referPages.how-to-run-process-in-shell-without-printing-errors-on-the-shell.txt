I`m trying to run a process like this:sometimes, the qry_db returns an error, and it's ok. but I don't want the error to be printed on the shell, is there any way to do this ?
Don't use os.popen(). Use the subprocess module instead:This redirects stderr to /dev/null, effectively silencing errors. stdout is still redirected to your temporary file. You may want to pipe this instead, using subprocess.check_output(), to read the output straight into your Python script. You'd still use stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL to silence the error output.subprocess.DEVNULL was added in Python 3.3. If you are using an earlier version of Python, use:
write this in the beginning of your program.this will write all your errors to the file error.log.or if you don't want to log the error at all, on a Unix system, use the file /dev/nullSimilary you can send all the output away from the terminal by using sys.stdout
