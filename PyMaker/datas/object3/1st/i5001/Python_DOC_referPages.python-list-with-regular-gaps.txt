I want to create a python list with regular gaps. I have a general idea of how I can do it, but is there a short way to do it or an inbuilt function to do this.Suppose I want to create a list from 1 to 200, with gaps of 50. The list would be [1,..,50,101,..,150], i.e the sequence from 51 to 100 and 151 to 200 is not in the list.
One way is to define a function which skips the gaps for you.
I don't think that there is a built in function for that, but this can be easily done using concatenation of ranges:
You could use list comprehensions:
This is one-liner that should do it:
