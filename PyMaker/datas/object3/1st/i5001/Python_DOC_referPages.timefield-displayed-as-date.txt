Im using Django framework to build a simple inventory management system. There is data in the database populated using the django admin. Now when i display the data on the website (front-end), there is a time field which is displaying the date, although i am beginning to learn django, I assume my models are wrong. Below i've attached my models.py and also the error on the actual site.Models.pyActual ErrorActual_errorAs seen from the image above, even though the time is being saved, date is displayed. It was also noted that in Django admin, the said time fields display the date as well, an image has been attached belowDjango_ErrorI assumed that, in Django admin Return Time is supposed to be a timestamp then why is the date displayed ?Thanks to anyone that can help! 
As I mentioned in the comment, this is because of your __str__() in TCCheckOut model. str()Called by str(object) and the built-in functions format() and print()  to compute the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of  an object. The return value must be a string object.  To solve your problem, you can access the ReturnDate and ReturnTime by using TCCheckIn instanceBy using this kind of accessing, you can display them in your template/html
