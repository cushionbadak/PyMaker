I'm trying to do follow python code.. but every time I try, There is an error. they said Syntax error..(elif).How i figure this out.Or is there any wrong with my write function...? 
You have some indentation errors. An if-else statement should look like:Notice how all of the lines between if and elif are indented!Also, the last line of your code is file.close. That should be file.close(), it is a method. See the python documentation here.They python documentation for the if/else statements can be found here.
Your write statement is out of indent.
