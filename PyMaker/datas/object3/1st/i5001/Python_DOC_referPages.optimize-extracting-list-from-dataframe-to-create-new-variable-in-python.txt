I am extremely new to Python. I have a huge dataframe that contains two variables in list format. It has a dimension of 1416631 x 2.I am trying to extract the first element of the list to create another variable. However, the current code has been running for over an hour to no avail.Here is a snippet of the dataframe MH with two variables, col and PMID (which is currently empty):This is what I want it to look like (2 variables: PMID and col):Here is my code:This code works on a smaller dataframe, but doesn't stop running on my larger dataframe.Please advise. Thanks
Here is one way:Explanationpd.Series.apply allows you to apply any function, including an anonymous lambda function on series.The tuple (x[:1][0], x[1:]) splits your column of lists into the format you specified.zip(*x.values) unpacks an array of tuples into an array of 2 columns, which are assigned to columns "PMID" and "col".
