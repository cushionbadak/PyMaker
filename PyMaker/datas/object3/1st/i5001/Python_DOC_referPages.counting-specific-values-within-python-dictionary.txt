Trying to count the amount of times a specific value occurs within a Python dictionary but can't seem to get it to work.My dictionary is set up as so:count = ({'John': 2, 'Sam': 1, 'Brian': 2, 'Brian': 2, 'Brian': 1, 'Sam': 2,  'John': 2, 'Henry': 2, 'Brian': 1})I am to get the result so that if a user inputs 'Brian' the result would be: 4Or if the user were to enter 'Sam' the result would then be:2Is there a better way of doing this, as currently if were to type in 'Sam' it would only output '1'?Thanks !
A dictionary can have a key only once.When you create count = ({'John': 2, 'Sam': 1, 'Brian': 2, 'Brian': 2, 'Brian': 1, 'Sam': 2, 'John': 2, 'Henry': 2, 'Brian': 1}), Python stores {'John': 2, 'Brian': 1, 'Sam': 2, 'Henry': 2} (values can change as there is no rule on what value to keep for a key which appears more than once). Cf the Python documentation for dictionariesSo the count will always be 1.If you want to have a key multiple times, don't use a dictionary but a list of pairs (tuples of size 2).
Since python dictionaries must have unique keys, counting how many times a key occurs wont work here. You can read the documentation for more comprehensive details about this data structure. Furthermore, You can store counts for each name in a dictionary:Then call each key to obtain the count value:You could also just keep the names as a list, and call collections.Counter to count how many times a name occurs:Which returns a Counter() object, a subclass of dict.
