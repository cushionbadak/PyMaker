While checking python grammar at official documentation, here is what it readsThen, 10.bit_length() is a valid syntax according to that definition but not according to the python interpreter. Instead, n=10;n.bit_length() is valid syntax for both the specifications and the interpreter.Where should I find the real definition of atom and atom_expr?
Thanks to juanpa's comment and the answers in the related question, it appears that the problem comes from 10.. The definition of NUMBER includes the dot such that 10.bit_length() is of kind NUMBER NAME trailer and not NUMBER '.' NAME trailer.In order to obtain an atom_expr, one must separate the dot: both 10 .bit_length() and (10).bit_length() give the correct answer.
