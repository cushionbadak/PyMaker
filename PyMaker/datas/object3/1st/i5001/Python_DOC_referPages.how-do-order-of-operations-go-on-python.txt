My question looks like this:                                I am supposed to solve the equation.And my answer seems to come out as 8 when using PEMDASBut when putting it into python, I get a 2. Why?It seems the programs order is as such:I don't get it
PEMDAS is P, E, MD, AS; multiplication and division have the same precedence, and the same goes for addition and subtraction. When a division operator appears before multiplication, division goes first.The order Python operators are executed in is governed by the operator precedence, and follow the same rules. Operators with higher precedence are executed before those with lower precedence, but operators have matching precedence when they are in the same group.For 10-7//2*3+1, you have 2 classes of operators, from lowest to higest:+, -  (correlating with AS == addition and subtraction)*, @, /, //, %  (correlating with MD, so multiplicaton and division).So // and * are executed first; multiplication and division fall in the same group, not a set order here (MD doesn't mean multiplication comes before division):So 7 // 2 is executed first, followed by the multiplication by 3. You then get the subtraction from ten and adding one at the end.
PEMDAS is better expressed asSo in your expression, the division should be done before the multiplication, since it is to the left of the multiplication. After those are done, then do the subtraction then the addition.
This is documented here (Python Documentation / Expressions / Operator-Precedence):Multiplication and division, including integer division, happen on the same precedence level, so the order is determined by the direction in which operands are grouped:Evaluation order of all the multiplications and divisions is left to right (like for most binary operations, except exponentiation).
