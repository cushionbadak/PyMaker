Natural Text
I have a large text file which have values separated by a header starting with "#". If the condition matches the one in the header I would like to read the file until the next header "#" and SKIP rest of the file. To test that I'm trying to read the following text file named as test234.txt: The code I wrote is:But, the output I'm getting is:Instead I would like the output between two headers separated by "#" which is:How can I do that? Thanks!EDIT: Reading in file block by block using specified delimiter in python talks about reading file in groups separated by headers but I don't want to read all the headers. I only want to read the header where a given condition is met and as soon as the line reaches the next header marked by '#' it stops reading the file.
itertools.groupby can help:note that all of this is lazy. you'd only ever have all the items between two headers in memory.you'd have to replace the with StringIO(text) as file: with; with open('test234.txt', 'r') as file:...the output for your test is:UPDATE as i misunderstood. here is a fresh attempt:where i use itertools.takewhile to get an iterator over the lines until a contition is met (until the first header is found in your case).the deque part is just the consume pattern suggested in the itertools recipes. it just fast-forwards to the point where the given condition does not hold anymore. 
Learn and use regex. It will help you for all document signification processes.
