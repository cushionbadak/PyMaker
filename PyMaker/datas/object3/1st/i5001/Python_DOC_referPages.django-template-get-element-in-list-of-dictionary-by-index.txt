I have the following:In django template I would like to display the price of the elements of each list by index: 15.52, 12.55 then 31.2, 34.1 then 1.2List sizes might not be equal, so I am sending the size of the largest list.Iterating over the max list size:{{i.item|index:forloop.counter0}} gets me {'itemCode': 'AZ001', 'price': 15.52}If I want price, what can I do?Doing {{i.item|index:forloop.counter0.price}} is giving me invalid key price at index 0.In other words, I am sending elements in column order and would like to display them in row order without doing list comprehension using zip on the server.Any solution?
Not sure if I get your question right, but this is the code what you are asking for.views.py:template.html:Results in 15.52If you want to loop over it you can do it like so:After you have updated the question, I would do the following:template.html:Results in:In my opinion, it's nothing wrong with using zip_longest, since it yields the values from a generator.
try using this, reference
