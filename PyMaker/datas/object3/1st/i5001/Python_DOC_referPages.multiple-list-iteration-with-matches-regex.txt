I have a problem trying to automate a data processing activity that I do frequently at work and the current part that I am stuck at is processing the names in the data set from a third party naming system to our own naming system.I have two lists, the third party list:And my own list, comprised of a manually-entered name of every game we have:The third party naming system is:But it can also change to, for example:I've tried using simple string replace and then comparing each indexed element, but the problem with that is, the numbers and some characters that I would like to replace also show up in the actual games name. Is this a problem that is regexable? I've been looking for the past hour or so at regex examples with lists, but I don't know if you can use regex to iterate in one list, using the contents of another list, like:I'll also note that there can only be 17 characters before the first square bracket, so game names will regularly be cut off mid-way through.Let me know if there's anything I haven't been able to explain properly and thanks for the read through.
You can definitely use regex for something like this:Output on this is:For each part of the string you want to match, the pattern has a (?P<tag>...) with its own pattern inside it. The 'cabinet' is not always there so it has a ? after it, to denote 0 or 1 matches. That one is actually a bit more complicated as it's enclosed in () which is not always there, so the entire thing is in an unnamed group: (\((?P<cabinet>[A-Z])\))?. The leading and trailing whitespace on the names can be stripped out later or you could put a \s* before and after the name group.Much more info here
