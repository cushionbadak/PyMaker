I am having two lists list1 and list2 as:I want to create a new list result based on the condition that if my condition num==10 is True, then result should be holding the content from list1 else it should be holding the content from list2. Below is the code I tried: But this is raising SyntaxError. How should I achieve this?Expected output for above code is:
If you only want to create a new list result based on your condition num==10, you may simply do (no need of list comprehension):Above result is based on the fact that Python treats boolean value True and False as 1 and 0 respectively. So, we are fetching the desired list from tuple based on the condition.Other alternatives to perform the same task:If list comprehension is must to use for you (may be to perform some operation on the elements), then you may use list comprehension with any of the above condition as:
You're just missing some parentheses:A list comprehension can have a filtering condition (comp_if in the language reference) as follows:In your current version, list1 is b and num == 10 is c, but your additional else list2 is syntactically invalid. You need to be explicit that your conditional expression is all part of b, which you can do with parentheses.
