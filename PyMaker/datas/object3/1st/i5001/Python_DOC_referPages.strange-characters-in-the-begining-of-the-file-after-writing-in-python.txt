Natural Text
I want to do a lot of boring C# code replacements automatically through a python script. I read all lines of the file, transform them, truncate the whole file, write new strings and close it.All my changes are written. But some strange characters in the beginning of the file appear. I don't know how to avoid them. Even if I open with encoding='utf-8-sig' it doesn't help.I tried truncate whole file besides the 1st line like this:But in this case more than 1st line is writing instead of only first line.EDITI tried this:And the first line has written correct but next one with the same issue. So I think this characters from the end of the file and I try to write after them.
