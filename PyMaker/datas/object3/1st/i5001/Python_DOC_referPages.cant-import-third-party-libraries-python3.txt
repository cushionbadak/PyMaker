I downloaded requests and BeautifulSoup modules using pip and when i try to import using command line it works. But when I code in notepad++ and then run the .py file using cmd it gives an error. This is my code:The error I am getting is:Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?
Quite simply you have named your file string.py.  string is a module that is included in the default library.  There is nothing wrong with any of the modules you imported only that you importing your own script and not the module it actually needs. Rename string.py to anything that is not a name that is not a module in the default library and it will work.
