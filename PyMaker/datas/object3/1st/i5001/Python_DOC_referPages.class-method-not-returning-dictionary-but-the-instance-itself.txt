This question already has an answer here:Bound method error                    6 answers                Fairly new to Python with a question regarding class instances. I have something likeIn my main file I'm importing from headers import Headers and call an instance and assign it to a variable:headers = Headers()But when I want to get the dictionary out it like this:headers.login_headers it does not return the dictionary but the instance itself.The print output I'm getting is: <bound method Headers.login_headers of <headers.Headers instance at 0x10e1d4488>Why is it not returning the dict?
Because is a method.For it to be not callable make it property with @property decorator.For it to be more pythonic, i woud suggest using method and call it appropriateIn instance initialization you would assign default value of login_headers and if you need to inherit you Headers class you can just override your get_login_headers to match your possible changes.
You're missing the parantheses for your method. You're getting the address of the method function instead of the method itself. Try the following:
What you need to do to actually call login_headers is just:login_headers is a function that you've defined as a child of the Headers class, so you just need to call it like any other function.
