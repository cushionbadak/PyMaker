I have the following code that doesn't work the way it should.This returns and empty list "[]".However, if I remove the num=max[arr] line from the code, it works as expected.And the output is a list of all elements without duplicates.I wanted to use the max() value somewhere else in the program, but it seems to break the list formation. Why does this happen? Is there a basic property of the max function that I'm missing?Edit: Why are people downvoting this without any answers? I'm fairly new to python and any help would be appreciated. If I made a silly mistake please point that out.
Fix:In python 2 map behaved differently - for 3 its an iterator. Once consumed, iterators are "empty". You can see for yourself if you print(type(arr)) for the result of your map operation.Read: map()
I'm not sure why you need to use map in this case. Another thing is that you will throw errors on your input if the user does not provide a single int since you are trying to convert it. You can take your input, like a string of '1 4 6 23 5', convert it to a list of ints, and then find the max.
