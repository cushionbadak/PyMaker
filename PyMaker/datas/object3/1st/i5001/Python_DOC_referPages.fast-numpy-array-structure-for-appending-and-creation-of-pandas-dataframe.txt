I am trying for hours to come up with the most efficient approach to structure and append flowing tick data to a shared memory numpy array and later get a pandas DataFrame in a timely fashion.Questions:1) What is the right way to structure my array and (faster) append new tick data to it?2) What would be the most efficient approach to create either a pd.DataFrame of the complete array or a pd.Series for a column?3) Is there a better way to work with shared memory timeseries in python (besides multiprocessing.basemanager)?Many thanks! 
numpy is not a good choice of data type for appending data.The most versatile choice in python is collections.deque, which is optimized for inserting items at the beginning or end of the list.This is how your code might look:Not sure why reshape is required with a numpy array:
