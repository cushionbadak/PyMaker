I have a dictionary where the keys are tuples. I'm looking for a comprehension list to decompose the tuples in a listThe best I came up so far is :Is there a nice and elegant way to achieve that in a single line ?Thanks

You can fetch all keys of your dict, flatten it with itertools.chainto get your desired resultAlternatively you can also use itertools.chain.from_iterable to flatten your nested list of tuples (dict keys)
You can use the reduce function to combine the lists:
