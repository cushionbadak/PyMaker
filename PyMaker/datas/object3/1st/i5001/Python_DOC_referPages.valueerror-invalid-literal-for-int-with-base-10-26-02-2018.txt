So I was bored and decided to do a little bit of coding using Python (I'm a noob), when i got this error: Blockquote ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '26.02.2018'Here is the full script:This script is not complete.
You are trying to cast '26.02.2018' to an int, which is impossible (two decimal points).Parse it to a DateTime object instead, using datetime.strptime:Then compare it with today as DateTime objects instead of converting either to int.
You can't cast '26.02.2018' (a date) into an integer. Python doesn't know what to do with the periods. You can do this insteadTo get an array containing the day in the first entry, the month in the second entry, and the year in the third entry. You could then similarly do the same to birthday (because that is also going to cause the exact same error when you fix this and make it to that line), and then perform your subtraction upon the two arrays by iterating through them in parallel with a for loop. Then, you can convert waht you get back back into what you want by doing this (we will assume you called the result array resultarray)Edit: Erm, I'm sorry for being unclear, but when you split it the way I instructed. The values in the strings will be able to be casted into integers. That's how you will implement this solution.Edit2: I'll just be as clear as I can and type out a full solutionThis will, ofcourse save ages as the amount of days, months, and years they have been alive, separated by periods. If you want another format, it should be easy enough to implement.
