I have a generator function generate which yields 5 random numbers one at a time. I need to be able to generate the numbers in two ways: Single generation, which means a single output of generate functionMultiple generation, which means multiple execution of generate and yielding all the results together as a single (merged) flowFor that I wrote another function get_resource, which calls generate either once or using itertools.chain to run the generators one after another, but transparently to the caller.My goal is to use get_resource function and produce the results in the same format (one list of numbers), regardless of single/multiple generations.It prints:While I need it to print:I use python2.7
you should use itertools.chain.from_iterable
You can specify generator delegation using yield from starting with python-3.3+.Now,
