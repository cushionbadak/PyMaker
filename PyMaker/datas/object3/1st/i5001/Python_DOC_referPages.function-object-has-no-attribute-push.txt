I am trying to push new values to the queues employeeName and employeeSalary()However I am faced with this error. What am I doing wrong?
This is calls of push on methods. What is the idea? You have push/pop methods on your class, start with calling s1.pushBtw, you should probably look into deque
'function' object has no attribute 'push'  ...  What am I doing wrong?employeeName and employeeSalary are not queues, the are instance methods (functions) of your class.  They do not have a (callable) push attribute.  They do not contain anything, they do something, so you cannot add to them.
