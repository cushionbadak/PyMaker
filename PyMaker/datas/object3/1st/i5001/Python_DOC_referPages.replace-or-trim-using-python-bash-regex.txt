I have an XML document that has entries that contains URL, basically a Git / Bitbucket URL:So basically this URL points to the dev branch, and I want to replace it such that it points to master by removing the "&amp;at=dev" string.How do I trim this using regex using the suffix "_config.json?raw" as reference? Can you give both Python and bash script solution? How about when "at=dev" is to be replaced with "at=release"? (Please note that I cannot just replace all occurence of "dev" as the word is too common, so I still need to use "_config.json?raw" as regex reference)
with sednote that you have to escape the question mark.
