I’ve created the main.py and the login.py, then I tried to link the 2 files together. I don’t know how to correctly link these 2 files.I’m using selenium and the program works, but it opens 2 chrome windows (When I want to open just one) then, the second one goes ahead and works perfectly but when it stops to do the login file suddently this error comes:probably I’ve done something wrong with the variablesthe main.pythe login.pyThe weird thing is: before the program was in one unique file and it worked perfectly.
I would suggest you read some material on how import works in python here.to get what you have working properly quickly, you should not import Main in your login function. Try passing the driver as an argument in your login function as so (Note: after passing the browser as an argument and not importing Main, you will no longer need to use Main.browser, just browser):Then when you go to call login from your main, you will want to pass browser as an argument:This should fix the problem you were having with two browsers opening. If the issue is still occurring with the Log in link not found please read this and ask a new question if you have a clear understanding of how it works and require more help.
