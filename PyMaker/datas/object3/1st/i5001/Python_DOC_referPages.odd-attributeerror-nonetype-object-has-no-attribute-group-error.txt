Natural Text
This might be a pretty obvious error since I'm pretty new to coding, but I'm trying to read a file for a certain value which I'll gather by using re.search and splice since I only know the text before and after it.I'm running into a bit of an annoying bug. When I use re.search(r"firstPart(.*?)secondPart", data).group(1) it returnsWhich is a problem with this line:If you read the code, you can see that I've made some unnecessary lines where instead of writing the entire string in the re.search function I'll use only a little bit then add or remove text in another function. This is because if I do it all in the re.search function normally it doesn't work.Possibly the most annoying part and confusing about this is that if I run everything before "englishWord = re.search(r"(.*?)", str(englishWord)).group(1)" then I run it, it works, but if I run all of the code at once I get that error. Any idea why? How can I fix this? Thanks! (I am using python 3.6)My Code vvv
call group only if there is a match.As pointed out in the comments, re.search returns None when no match is found. Link : https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search
