if i do something like this:i can easily see this type hint for x if i do:however, i can't seem to figure out where the annotations live if i do something like this:does anyone know which __annotations__ dict contains where_is_this_vars_annotation_stored's type hint?
i ended up writing something that uses inspect, ast, exec, and eval to solve this for me. https://gist.github.com/sweettuse/f5fa022a0abadf3fc368105fcccc46c1
