I participated in kickstart of google code jam contest and got stuck in problem 1A called  Gbus countMy code is passing the sample test case provided in the problem but when I submit the small input by outputting it to a file it gives me an error, incorrect response.Problem link - https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4374486/dashboard#s=p0My logic: First I took all the test cases in a variable t and for each test case  I inputted the no. of buses and inputted routes of all buses in a list l. Then I created a dictionary named buses and divided the list into n lists with each list for each bus nume=beres from 1 to n in the dictionary.Then I inputted all the cities to be monitored in another dictionary named cities and initialized the value of each city to be monitored to 0.Finally, I calculated the no. of buses travelling through each city by checking if it falls in the route range of each bus and if it does I incremented the value of the corresponding city by 1 and then stored all the values of the dictionary in a list and outputted it for each test case.Output methodology:I used this line to execute my code using cmd in my working directoryMy code works fine for the sample test case provided so there might not be a flaw in my logic. I think that there might be a mistake in my output methodology. 
I see two problems in your code.Python standard dictionary is not ordered! Therefore the cities dictionary will not have the elements (keys) in the order you entered.From Python 3.1 onwards, you can use the OrderedDict for thisIf the same city is repeated twice (or more), there will be only one entry in the final result, because a dictionary can't hold repeated keys.As I see your design has flows. Besides, I think you could have done this much easily without making things too complicated.Note:From Python 3.6 onwards, the standard dictionary maintains the insertion order by default.UPDATEAs requested, following is my attempt to solve the problem.Please note that this might not be the best solution! And for sure, this is not the most readable solution. This is just my solution.
