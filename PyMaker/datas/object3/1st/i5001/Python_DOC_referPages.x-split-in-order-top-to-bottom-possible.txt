Natural Text
Recently I've made a project using python, though I got confused when I tested it out.I use x.split to seperate parts of text and then make it go to the next line. Here's what i'm dealing with:path = variable that gets the directory of the fileinside the file, the format is like this:and more. I found out that it keeps repeating the same line. How do I make it go from top to bottom of the file? ( in order )
Your code should not exhibit the problems that you reported. There might be a trailing empty item in the list, but not duplicates or random lines, and it will be processed in order.Anyway, you don't need to read and split the entire file into lines, and your problem might go away if you simplify the code. You can process the data directly from the file like this:rstrip() removes any whitespace characters at the end of each line, including any terminating new line character(s).Alternatively you could use the csv module and avoid the hassle of splitting the lines yourself:
