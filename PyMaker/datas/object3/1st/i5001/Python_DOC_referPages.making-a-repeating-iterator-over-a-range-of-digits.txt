I'm trying to make an iterator that prints the repeating sequenceI want an iterator so I can use .next(), and I want it to loop around to 0 when .next() is called while the iterator is at 9.But the thing is that I'll probably have a lot of these, so I don't just want to do itertools.cycle([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]). I don't want to have that many repeated lists of the same sequence in memory. I'd rather have the function x + 1 % 10 in each of the iterators and just have the iterator increment x every time next is called. I can't seem to figure out how to do this though with itertools. Is there a pythonic way of doing this?
You can write an generator that uses range
You can use your own custom generator:Assuming you are on Python 2, use:For memory efficiency.
This is one way via itertools:
You can use a custom generator like this:
