I´d like to export data to several columns in csv but I always obtain this kind of file:csvI´d like to obtain two columns one "articulo" and another one "price"My pipelines:Can you help me please?
Here you are:
There is nothing wrong with the output of your code.You are getting the two csv columns you want, but the program you are using to view the data is not interpreting it correctly.By default, CsvItemExporter uses , as the delimiter, and the program seems to expect something else (and possibly even different quoting).There are two possibilities to solve your problem:Change the program's settings so it reads the file correctlyChange the way CsvItemExporter exports data (it will pass any additional keyword arguments to the underlying csv.writer object)
