I am developing small app with few submodules:modules/__ init __.pymyGuiapp.pyEditorGui.pyI would like to have my EditorGui.py to be called from myGuiapp.py but also to be able to run it by itself.How should i setup relative importing in such case ?If in EditorGui.py I will set :but from main appOK !If in EditorGui.py I will set :If in EditorGui.py I will set :OK !How can I make both work and what i am doing wrong here? I would like to avoid setting up ABSOLETE paths to this dev directory.What would be most pythonic and clean way to structure such app ?EDIT:After @Diego Trazzi post, I've decided to move my EditorGui.py up the level:This solves many issues but for curiosity, my question still stands. How can I import module from same level while being imported by code from parent directory? 
To avoid specifying the relative path to the modules You could append to your file the path:You could also specify it in the shell from which you run the command: https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.htmlBetter solutionIdeally your project should be structured in such way so all the So that your executables reside in the top level and when you distribute your project users will not have to dig into sub folders. I have found this answer very helpful: Python Nesting Modules
