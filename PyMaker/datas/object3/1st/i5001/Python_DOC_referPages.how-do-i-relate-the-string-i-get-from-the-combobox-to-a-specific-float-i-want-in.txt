With combo.get() I'll get 'DAP' (If DAP is selected for example) and I want to get 46 instead (as a float).I need to relate each gotten string with the corresponding float.I use it on this formula:
Use a dict ([Python]: Mapping Types â€” dict):and its usage (as current values are ints, convert them to floats):or better (in case the string returned by the combo is not present in combo_dict: [Python]: get(key[, default])):
