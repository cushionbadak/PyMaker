I have a list of listsHow can I collapse based on the first 2 column and using the data from the highest v ?The list was sorted in the first column, but second column is not. My solution was based on assumption that both column were sorted so it does not work and I have no idea where to go from here.
This is one way.
You could use:[Python]: itertools.groupby(iterable, key=None) - to group (outer) list elements based on their 1st 2 values (e.g. ("fruit", "banana"))[Python]: max(iterable, *[, key, default]) - to get the maximum value of one such group, based on their 3rd element (the 1st letter("v") + the number that comes after it (fixed it, to work with numbers with more than one digit))[Python]: Lambda Expressions - to specify the grouping criteriaOr you could go the (old fashioned) manual way (e.g. using a helper dictionary):
Another possible approach:(1) Create a dictionary which maps indices of the first and second columns, and maps the most recent index for each pair. This allows the data to be correctly sorted at the end.(2) Create a collections.defaultdict of all the different groupings of the first and second columns. (3) Find each of the groupings maximum v value from (2) and combine it with the rest of the elements. This gets returned as the collapsed list. (4) Sort the collapsed lists based on (1).Example code:Output:
