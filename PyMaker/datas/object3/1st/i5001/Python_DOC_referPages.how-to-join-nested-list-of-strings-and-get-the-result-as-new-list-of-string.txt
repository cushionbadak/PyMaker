You can use ''.join with map here to achieve this as:OR you may use it with list comprehension to get the desired result as:For getting the results as [['ABC'], ['AB']], you need to wrap the resultant string within another list as:Issue with your code: In your case ''.join(A) didn't worked because A is a nested list, but ''.join(A) tried to join together all the elements present in A treating them as string. And that's the cause for your error "expected str instance, list found". Instead, you need to pass each sublist to your ''.join(..) call. This can be achieved with map and list comprehension as illustrated above.
