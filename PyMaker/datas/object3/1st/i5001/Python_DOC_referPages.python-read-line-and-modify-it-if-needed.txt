Natural Text
let's say I have a file Example.txt like this:Now, I'd like to have a python script which performs these tasks:If the line containing alpha_1 parameter is not commented (% symbol), to rewrite the line adding %, like it is with alpha_2To perform the task in 1. independently of the line orderTo leave untouched the rest of the file Example.txtThe file I wrote is:Up to now the output is the same Example.txt with a further line (%alpha1 =, 10) down the original line alpha1 = 10.Thanks everybody
I found the solution after a while. Everything can be easily done writing everything on another file and substituting it at the end.
