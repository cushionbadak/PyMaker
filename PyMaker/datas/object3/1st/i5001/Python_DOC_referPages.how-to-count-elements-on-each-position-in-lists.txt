I have a lot of lists like:All of them have the same length. I need to count how many times each symbol appears on each position. Example:Here it'll be a5cd
One way is to use zip to associate characters in the same position. We can then send all of the characters from each position to a Counter, then use Counter.most_common to get the most common character
where y is your list.Python 3.4 and up
You could use combination of zip and Counteroutput:
This all depends on where your list is. Is your list coming from another file or is it an actual array? At the end of the day, the best way to do this simply is going to be to use a dictionary and a for loop.Then after that I'm assuming that you'd like to output the four most common element appearances. For that I'd recommend importing statistics and using the mode method...However, your question is quite vague, please elaborate more next time.P.s. I'm a newbie so all you experienced programmers plz don't hate :)
I would use a combination of defaultdict, enumerate, and Counter:Here's how it works:The defaultdict() creates new entries when it sees a new key.The enumerate() function returns both the character and its position in the line.The Counter counts the occurences of individual charactersCombining the three makes a defaultdict whose keys are the column positions and whose values are character counters.  That gives you one character counter per column.The most_common() method returns the highest frequency (character, count) pair for that counter.The [0][0] extracts the character from the list of (character, count) tuples.The str.join() method combines the results back together.
