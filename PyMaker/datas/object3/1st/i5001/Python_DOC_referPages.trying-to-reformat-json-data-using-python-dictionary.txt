I have been trying to format live JSON data coming from an API to be read in Django views. However, data coming is little complicated. I have incoming JSON data in format I need to convert it into 
You can use a list comprehension structure, (the code below has been tested using Python3.6):What happens with (v.update({'Time': k}) or v) ?Given v is a dictionary, v.update(...) will add a new entry to the instance (in other words, it mutates the instance). This method doesn't return the instance though but None, fortunately wrapping the call between parenthesis gives the opportunity to build an expression that will ultimately return the v instance. v being a dict object (given it is not empty) it will be evaluated truthfully in a Boolean context, hence the (â€¦ or v) construct.
Assuming your data is in a proper dict format incoming. You can do thisBasically just adding the key from the original dict as a value to a dict and appending it to the list
As mentioned in comments, indicated output format is a list. In this case you'll just add the new entry for "Time" for each nested dict:Or if you prefer inline:
