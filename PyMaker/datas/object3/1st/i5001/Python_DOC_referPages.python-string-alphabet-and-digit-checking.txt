This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I am writing a simple code that should determine the license plates of the car and say if it is of an old or a new type.The user inputs a string (example: "ABC123" or "1234POW") and the program should return a string with a corresponding value: "New" or "Old"So, the problem is:else:    print("This doesn't look like a valid plate number")Lines 11 and 12: I have no idea why, but instead of printing the "New Type" message I get "Your plate is not valid, check your input+". But if I change the line 12 to "if l[4] and l[5] and l[6] in "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" - everything works fine.Would be grateful for explanation, and I beg my pardon, if I posted something or somehow wrong - I'm new here :DThank you.
l[4:7] is a string of length 3. So suppose l is "1234POW", then l[4:7] is "POW". Your long string "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" does not contain the substring "POW".If you want to check that every one of a sequence of characters are in your long string, you can use the function all.or even justYou got away with l[0:4] in "1234567890" because "1234" is an exact substring of "1234567890". If you had different numbers, it would not have worked, for the same reason as above.Instead you could use:On the other hand, your upper conditionis also wrong. Python understands this asi.e.So your upper condition should also be changed:e.g.
This is typically a regex problem.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlTrye something like this:
khelwood's answer is perfectly fine, but here is an alternative just because when you're learning it's often helpful to see several techniques. You could turn those initial characters in the string into a Python set. The easiest way to build the set is to use a slice as others have said, and then call the set() function. Overall it would look like this:
