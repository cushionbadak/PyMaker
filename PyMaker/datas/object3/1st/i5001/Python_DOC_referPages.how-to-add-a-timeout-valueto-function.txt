I added a self.subprocess.wait(60) for 60 seconds for my commands to run with a timeout value specified. But it is throwing the following error ::self.subprocess.wait(60)TypeError: wait() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)What is the problem with the code? Can anyone point out the issue? 
You have to change the code inside class Command, maybe Command.run(), to do its job without blocking the script execution. There is no good way to do what you ask, without knowing exactly what that class does. The solutions (Threads, Processes, Asynchronous code) all depend on the specifics of your blocking code and can't be generally recommended with certain.EDIT:Now that you added the Command class, we can examine which part is blocking. In your code the part that blocks is this line:Luckly that function has a timeout parameter as you can see in the subprocess module documentation.That will automatically wait for 60 seconds and throw an error if it fails, as you asked.EDIT 2:The error you're now getting means your version of python doesn't have the timeout parameter. Which version of python are you using? As you can see in the documentation linked above, you need at least python 3.3 to use it.
