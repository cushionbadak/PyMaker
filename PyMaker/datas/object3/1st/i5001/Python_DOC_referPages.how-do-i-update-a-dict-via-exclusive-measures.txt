what I'm trying to do is create keys that don't exist in a dict...the best way I can think to do this is with:orthe problem I'm having with this is nothing more than a minor annoyance, but it's the fact I have to specify 'a' twice.I'm trying not to define a function as this operation is trivial...I just want to know, is there a better built-in way to do this??
You could just test if the key is not yet present:This doesn't get around the key repetition (which is easily remedied by using a variable), but at least avoids setting the key if it already is there anyway.If your real goal is to access the current value and set a default if not yet present, use dict.setdefault():This tests for the key, sets a default value, and returns the value for the key, all in one step.Do take into account the default value expression is executed first, dict.setdefault() is not suitable where creating the default is expensive or has side effects.
