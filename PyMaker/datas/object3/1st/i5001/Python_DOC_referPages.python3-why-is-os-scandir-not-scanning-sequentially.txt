Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Does Python have a built in function for string natural sort?                    15 answers                Python analog of PHP's natsort function (sort a list using a “natural order” algorithm) [duplicate]                    3 answers                I have a directory with 1600 photos and I need to save the path to each foto to a list and then to .txt file.  The photos are enumerated according to the position they should have in the list: img(0), img(1)... and I need this position to be kept.  What I obtain is this order, so now in list index 2 I have img(10):  img(0) img(1) img(10) img(100) img(1000) img(1001)...img(2) img(2) img(20) img(200) img(2000) img(2001)...Apparently, I'm the only one having this issue because I didn't find any discussion about this problem. Thank you very much for helping me.   
As mentioned by others, the documentation does not guarantee any particular ordering. In your case it appears to be sorted alphabetically/lexicographically. "10" comes before "2" alphabetically. You'll have to prepend 0s to give every file the same number of digits to get the ordering you want if this behaviour appears to remain consistent on your machine.For example, "002" will come before "010".If you want to be safe (for example need to be able to port your code to other machines/OSes), you'll want to manually sort.
