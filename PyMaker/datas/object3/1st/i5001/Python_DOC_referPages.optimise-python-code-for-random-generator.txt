Could you please help me to optimize my first python program, I am trying to define a random generator, but somehow when I put a big number it hangs...please try with:but when you use a bigger number its a problem, example:
You can use dynamic programming:The reason this is faster is that it only calculates each value once, while your code calculates things exponentially.This algorithm is O(n) (for loop of length x - 3), while your algorithm was O(1.83...^n) (1.83^3=1+1.83+1.83^2).Alternately, as suggested in the comments, you can use functools.lru_cache:This works in almost the same way as the previous code, but uses a decorator to memoize results instead of storing them in a list.
