I'm trying to concatenate multiple files in a directory to a single file. So far I've been trying to use cat with subprocess with poor results.My original code was:I've tried handing it shell=True:And in conjunction with subprocess.Popen instead of call in a number of permutations, but with no joy. As I've understood from other similar questions,  with shell=True the command will need to be provided as a string. How can I go about calling cat on all items in my list whilst executing as a string?
You don't need subprocess here and you must always avoid subprocess when you can (that means: 99.99% of time).As Joel pointed out in comments, maybe I should take a few minutes and bullet points to explain you why:Using subprocess (or similar) assume your code will always run on the exact same environment, that means same OS, version, shell, tools installed, etc.. This is really not fitted for a production grade code.These kind of libraries will prevent you to make "pythonic Python code", you will have to handle errors by parsing string instead of try / except, etc..Tim Peters wrote the Zen of Python and I encourage you to follow it, at least 3 points are relevant here: "Beautiful is better than ugly.", "Readability counts." and "Simple is better than complex.".In other words: subprocess will only make your code less robust, force you to handle non-Python issues, force you to perform tricky computing where you could just write clean and powerful Python code. There are way more good reasons to not use subprocess, but I think you got the point.Just open files with open, here is a basic example you will need to adapt:Implementation example for your specific needs:Be careful, I changed your source and target values (/tmp/)
