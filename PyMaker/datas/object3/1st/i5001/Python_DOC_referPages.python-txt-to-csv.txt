Natural Text
I am new to Python. I am trying to transfer data from a text file to a csv file. I have included a short description of the data of my text file and csv file. Can someone point me to the right direction of what to read up to get this done?Reading up online I've been able to implement this.Beyond this I was planning to start a for loop and read data till # as this would be 1 row, and then use the delimiter to find each '=' and insert the data into the appropriate location in a row list(do this by comparing the column header with the string prior to the delimiter) and populate the row accordingly. Do you think this approach is correct?Thanks for your help!
Check out csv.DictWriter for a nicer approach. You give it a list of headers and then you can give it data dictionaries which it will write for you. The writing portion would look like this:As for reading your input, csv.reader won't be of much help: your input file isn't really anything like a csv file. You'd probably be better off writing your own parsing, although it'll be a bit messy because of the inconsistency of the input format. Here's how I would approach that. First, make a function to interpret each line:Then build the list of data dictionaries from the input file:
