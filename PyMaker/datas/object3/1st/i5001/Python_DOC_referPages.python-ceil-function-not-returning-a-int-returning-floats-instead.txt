Expected outcome is 2, instead the return is the original input of 1.234567. I'm learning Python and this is my fourth assignment, the professor even says in their own textbook to simply put math.ceil(var) so I don't know what I'm doing wrong here.
Shouldn't you be looking at the return value of math.ceil?Output is So change number=math.ceil(number) number=math.ceil(number)
