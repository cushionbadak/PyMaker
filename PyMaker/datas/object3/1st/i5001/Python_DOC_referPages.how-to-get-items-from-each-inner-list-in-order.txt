Natural Text
I'm currently working with Automate the boring stuff with Python and I'm dealing with project where I must display data from tableData in changed order and then justify each element to the right based on length of longest element in each list so it will display something like this:and so on..I know that I must get the first element of each nested list, then the second etc but I'm really struggling to to this and I'm hoping that you can help me with that.PS Don't worry about that strange letters in list items, it's my native language :)
To iterate over the "columns" of a nested list, use the Python idiom zip(*tableData):This way you can get the length of the longest entry for each column:Printing the text actually right-justified is then just an exercise of applying the right widths to the right elements and using str.rjust:

This will have inner elements sorted as per the length. Ascending order assumed.
Another option, not as good as the one using zip, is to transpose the table and then print each list separately:
