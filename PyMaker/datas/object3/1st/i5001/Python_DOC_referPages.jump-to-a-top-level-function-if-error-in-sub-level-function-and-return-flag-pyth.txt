I have a function "main_func" , from which i am calling another function and so on.If you see in sub_sub_sub_func() i have added a line x = len(10) which will cause exception.What i want is, if this happens, i should directly jump to main_func() and return a flag(str) as 'fail'I looked into defining custom exceptions , but it didn't helped me.I want to return after i raise.
len(10) will raise a TypeError you can catch this specific exception in your main_func and do the thing that needs to happen then.Please note that you need to create an instance of your error class when raising. Error()Note: Your custom Error hides a lot of information that can come in handy later. What happened what raised this error. Best is to put the original TypeError as an inner exception to Error.In theory in your code a potential out of memory exception will be converted to your Error without knowing what happened.
