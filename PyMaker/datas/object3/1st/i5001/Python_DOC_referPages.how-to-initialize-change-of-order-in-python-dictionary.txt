I find out that order of dict in python less than 3.6 is unordered. Trying to reproduce it in shell but order is not chaning. So my question when it may happen
A dict is unordered in the sense that Python makes no guarantees that the order will be consistent. That doesn't mean that you won't see a consistent ordering sometimes though.If you need a dict that is ordered you should check out collections.OrderedDict.
