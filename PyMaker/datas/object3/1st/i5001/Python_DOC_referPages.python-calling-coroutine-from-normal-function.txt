This depends on whether your question is a part of a bigger problem imposing additional constraints or not, but I do not see a reason to use threading. Instead, you can use two separate Tasks running in the same event loop, which is one of the main points of asynchronous programming:Output: When using ensure_future, you effectively make a new “execution thread” (see fibers) inside the single OS's thread.
After some digging crafted this workaround. It might not be pretty, but it works:It unfortunately doesn't work for my specific usecase, but I thought it might be useful.
