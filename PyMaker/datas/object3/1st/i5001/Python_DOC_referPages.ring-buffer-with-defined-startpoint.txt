Is there an easy way in python to create a ring-bufferwith "named" elements?With that I mean a ring-buffer in that you can easily jump to any position to start stepping through the ring-buffer in either (!) direction. And the ring-buffershould return different values depending on the direction the buffer is stepped through. The elements should therefore contain the following information:Ideally you should also be able to tell the length of the ring-buffer so you know when you have read every element.I thought about OrderedDict, since you can step into each element quickly and the order stays the same. However, you cannot access the previous element in an OrderedDict. So I would need a mixture of dict and list (and the first and last elements should be fused)...
You can use two collections.deque with a maxlen arg inside a CircularBuffer class as follows:And in your console:Change according to your requirements. Cheers!!
