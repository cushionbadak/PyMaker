I just started learning python a few days ago and have a quick question I can't find an answer to:How would you ask for items to add to a list while keeping their data type?if i do this:Obviously all the list items are string values. Is there a way to ask for input but keep string, integer, float or whatever data type?
You could try casting to each variable type:
You could try with python build in function isnumeric.Here is what it look like:It only check for integer and string/float.
