I would like to create a unittest in Python for a method that has more than one return values. For example let's say I want to test the following method:Is there any way to have a unittest for this method?(I know that I can split the above in 2 different methods, but this is just a naive example)
Capture all the return values, then test them individually.or, as @sleigh_bells points out compare a tuple to the returned tuple:
You could do According to the Python documentation, this will actually run assertListEqual because two lists are being passed in.https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertListEqual
