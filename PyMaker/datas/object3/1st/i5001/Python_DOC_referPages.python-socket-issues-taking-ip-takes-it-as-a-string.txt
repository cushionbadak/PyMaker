Been trying to solve this simple script, without luck. The error I got is the following:python renato_script.pyEnter HOSTNAME ip: 10.0.0.2Enter TCP/UDP port: 443Traceback (most recent call last):File "renato_script.py", line 8, in if s.connect_ex((ip, port)):TypeError: an integer is required (got type str)
According to https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html, the AF_INET address family needs a tuple which contains a string ip address and a integer port. Your code passes a tuple which contains a string ip address and string port. Fixing that is very simple, just cast the port to int, like this:edit: when using python 2, you have to use raw_input() rather than input()
