Python source codeCurrently this script creates control.tar.xz with but I want to add a folder when creating control.tar.xz and then add control file to that folder.Means currently the hierarchy iscontrol.tar.xz ==> control fileI want this hierarchycontrol.tar.xz ==> folder name ==> control fileBasically the tar file contains not just the control file but a directory and the control file inside of that directory.
I modified a stackoverflow answer into tardata.py which looks for control.txt and places it in a data directory and calls the extracted file control.tar.gz.The code uses the optional argument arcname which allows the creation of the directory inside the tar file. The tarfile.Add() documentation says If given, arcname specifies an alternative name for the file in the archive.RunCheck the created tar files heirarchy
