Natural Text
I am trying to see if a sentence is present in the response back from a request. I am getting the following error:I am not quite sure why this occurring and what the solution would be.
r.content is a bytes object but text is str, so you can't do the __contains__ (in) check on another directly.You can easily (re-)define the text object to be a bytestring:Now, you can do if text in r.content:.or you can use r.text to get the str representation directly, and use text as-is (as str).
r.content returns a bytes like object in Python 3.x. To check, do:There are multiple ways to fix your issue. For example:Decode r.content to string: You can decode it to string as:Convert r.content  to utf-8 string as:Define your text to search as a byte-string. For example:Now you may simply use it with r.content as: Use r.text instead of r.content to search for the string, which as the document suggests:The text encoding guessed by Requests is used when you access r.text.Hence you may just do:
Try this instead:r.text is the textual content that is returned. r.content is the binary content that is returned.
Requests returns a bytes object, you need to convert it to a string before performing the inHere's a reference about built in types, one of which is bytes https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.htmlthe line of code you're looking for is something like, by default decode assumes utf-8, you can pass in a different encoding if you need to though.
