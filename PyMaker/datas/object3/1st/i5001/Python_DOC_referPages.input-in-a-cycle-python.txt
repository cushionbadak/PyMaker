I'm learning Python as my first language and now I trying to resolve this problem: I have to make a loop where I ask the user which elements from a list they want to remove and then remove the elements selected. The loop stops only when the user insert a specific number that corresponds to the length of the list increased by 1 (so I won't have any problem).I have another problem related to this:    This will print the list starting with 0:0) a  1) b  2) c  3) dWhat do I have to do if I want the list start with 1? (if I use 1 instead of 0 in the range it doesn't print the first element of the list)
In Python, lists can be iterated directly, and enumerate is used to generate indexes.  Its optional second parameter gives a starting number:If using Python 3.6+, formatting output is even more simple using f-strings:Refs:enumeratestr.formatFormatted string literals
One way would be to add a 1 in the range, then subtract a 1 from the indexEdit: TheoretiCAL's approach is even more straight forward, simply adding 1 to the print statement achieves the same thing.
