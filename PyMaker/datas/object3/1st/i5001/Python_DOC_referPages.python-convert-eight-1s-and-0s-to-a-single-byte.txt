I have a binary string representation of a byte, such asHow can I convert it to a real binary value and write it to a binary file?
Use the int function with a base of 2 to read a binary value as an integer.Python 2 uses strings to handle binary data, so you would use the chr() function to convert the integer to a one-byte string.Python 3 handles binary and text differently, so you need to use the bytes type instead. This doesn't have a direct equivalent to the chr() function, but the bytes constructor can take a list of byte values. We put n in a one element array and convert that to a bytes object.Once you have your binary string, you can open a file in binary mode and write the data to it like this:
