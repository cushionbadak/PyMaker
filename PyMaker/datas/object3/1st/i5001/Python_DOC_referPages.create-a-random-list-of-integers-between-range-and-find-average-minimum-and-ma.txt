I am new to coding and still trying to learn python coding.I am trying to write a program that generates 5 random numbers and stores in a list. My output should end up like this: [2, 34, 23, 5, 22] I am trying to find the average, lowest, and highest number from the list. I tried a few other ways to find the answers but I get the final number in the list as my highest, lowest, and average number. Can anyone help me solve this issue? 
You may use random.randint to get your random list using a list comprehension as:Here, random.randint(range_start, range_end)  will returned a random integer between range_start and range_end, which in this case is 1 and 100 respectively. For example, my list is as:For finding average, do:For finding max value use max on the list:For finding min value use min on the list:
Your problem is in the definition of num. Define num as the following list comprehension and your script works:The reason your definition fails is because num = [(random.randint(1,100))] just creates a list of a single integer. If you wish to perform this in a loop, you can do so as follows:However, a pythonic idiom would be to use the list comprehension as mentioned earlier.
For each n, you're replacing the whole num list with a list containing only random.randint(1,100).
