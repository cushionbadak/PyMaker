Thanks in advance for any help you can give
Very simple and easy to understand Python code is also this step-by-step code:This produces final result:[[206, 397], [207, 397], [208, 397], [209, 397], [210, 397], [211, 399]]
JSON parsing may be appropriate as mentioned in the comments, but this would also work with the data sample you've provided. I wasn't sure if you wanted your results to be a list of lists of strings, or a list of lists of ints. Ignore the second line if the former is what you want.Edit to add: can be condensed to a one-liner if preferred:
You could use ast.literal_evalSo the code for generating the list would be : -Note : Don't forget to import astScreenshot of output:-
