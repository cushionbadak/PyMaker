Natural Text
I was searching for how to define an empty array and fill it using a text file and got stuck at one point and couldn't find the solution.My Script is :The first problem is that when I'm trying to put elements in array newline character is also attached("\n"). Also is append right function for putting elements in array.    Second when I'm trying to print the count of array It's printing number of char.
You can use file.readline()[:-1] this will return all the line except the last character which is \nYou can add [:-1] to avoid the last character which is \n consider this example :so when you read your file line by line the \n is include in each line, so to avoid \n you can read the line from index 0 to index -1to understand more, take a look at this :Understanding Python's slice notationOr like Omar Einea mention in his comment you can use :In case the last line not have a \n
You could also use: str.splitlines() method.You'll end up with something like this:
If your trying to append lines from file to list it always comes with "\n" so to avoid this we need to split the content.Solution 1:array=[ ]with open(rC:\Users\wasim akram\Desktop\was.txt) as fp:    array = fp.read().splitlines()print(array)Solution 2 :myNames=[ ]f = open(r"C:\Users\wasim akram\Desktop\was.txt",'r')for line in f:    myNames.append(line.strip())print(myNames)
