This question already has an answer here:Implement list-like index access in Python                    2 answers                In python, list, string, tuple can be got element by using index (obj[i]), just like C++. In the same way is there any method like override operators to make user-defined class' object be able to get element by using square-bracket []?For example:the way user_class=list or user_class=tuple can't be a solution, because I have to add a series of control code in this this class. And the way that this class work is totally different from list or tuple.Is there anyone know the solution?
You should implement a __getitem__ method in the user_class.Or it can be a subclass of some base type like list:
