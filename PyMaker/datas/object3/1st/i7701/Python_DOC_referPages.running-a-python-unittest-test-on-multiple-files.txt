I want to add unit testing to the assessment of my high school programming class.  If I have twenty submissions of files that look like this:Can I use a test case like this?How do I run this one simple test on twenty modules?FURTHER INFORMATIONFor testing I have created three "submissions" all of which show different ways of calculating x^y.submission1.py:submission2.py:submission3.py:The test code is:if the test code is run the console output shows only submission1 being tested:Interestingly if I don't use unit testing I can correctly import and test using this approach:The console output here is:It may well be that the unittest module is not the best approach here but I'm still interested on how to implement it.
You can use importlib to load Python modules from specific files, then run the test cases on each one.glob may be helpful to create the list of files.
Given that this has been active for a month with no answers I have come the the realisation that it is because I'm asking for the wrong thing.From what I can gather, unittest is for running a suite of tests on a single application.  It is not designed to run a single test on a suite of applications.John's suggestion to investigate importlib helped set me on the path to success.  Thanks John.The code posted in the original post update seems to be the most appropriate solution to my problem.
