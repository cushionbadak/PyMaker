I am working on a Python wrapper to a DLL/SO. I have verified the code works calling the actual DLL and SO. I would like to unit test my wrapper without requiring the underlying DLL/SO be installed though. I am looking at using mock. The problem I am having trouble with is with functions that take byref parameters and return values that way. For example, if the C fundtion looks something like this:and the Python code would look like:I am able to mock the function and set the return value (error_code), but I have not been able to figure out how to set the value that is returned in session_handle.Is this possible  and if so, how?
You can access the object passed to byref through the _obj attribute of the return value:Or at least, you can for now. This is an undocumented API and subject to change.Once you have the object, you can set its value the usual ctypes way, through its value attribute:
