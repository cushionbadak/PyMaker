I'm just starting to learn programming and decided to do some self exercise.I'm having a hard time how I can identify, split the data from a string separated by comma and a space then put each of them to different variables. I had not problem if the specs given is always complete. I just used split then assign the index to variables. The problem is not all strings have complete data. I'm having a hard timeWhat I want to achieve is to have an output like:Specs is user inputCan someone help me how to solve this and also explain it. I will really appreciate it. Thank you in advance!
My advise to use str.rsplit() to break line on comma character. Like this: s1 = specs1.rsplit(', ') Than just use simple print or foreach, according to your goals.
Ordered dictionary retains your order.Initially all specs are preset to undefined, then start setting them based on inputs from user.
Split input using split(str=", "), then pull strings one by one from temp list and compare them with some criteria to put them at the right place in final list.  
thenproduces
