In a json.dump method (python 2.7.1) the output has the default separator as (',' and ': '). I want to remove the comma and the colon so that my outputs are simply separated by white space. I also want to remove the opening and closing braces. Is there any particular attribute of separator or string formatting that allows me to do this or is there any other solution?For example after applying with open(foutput, 'a') as f1:    json.dump(newdict, f1,sort_keys=True,indent=4)I am getting output as :But I want the below type output instead of that:Please note I only want this in python.Thanks in advance!
