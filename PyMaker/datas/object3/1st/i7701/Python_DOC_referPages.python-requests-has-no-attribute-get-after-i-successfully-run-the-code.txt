I have created simple file, fetching url with requests python library, see the code. First time file one.py works just fine and gets the url, but after that i get pycache created in my dir and I am getting the following error, somehow referring to a completely different file from the same dir. Also, in pycache i can see one file email.cpython-36.pycwith the following code:file one.py:Error:
email is a standard library package that requests indirectly depends on.  By having a file named email.py in the same directory as your script, you're preventing requests from using the real email package.  Rename, move, or delete email.py.
