This question already has an answer here:What is the meaning of a single and a double underscore before an object name?                    14 answers                Does Python have “private” variables in classes?                    11 answers                What's the pythonic way to use getters and setters?                    6 answers                This "__height" and "__width" really confuse me. Could someone explain to me why these two variables are prefixed with two underscores? Will it be the same if one underscore is prefixed to these variables?What is the difference?Thanks a lot.
It's just a way to get rid of names collision, if you add two underscore at the beginning, then Python under the hood adds class name before underscore.For example in that class instead of __width it will be Square__width, and if you inherit Square and make your own width variable it won't overwrite Square__width.
