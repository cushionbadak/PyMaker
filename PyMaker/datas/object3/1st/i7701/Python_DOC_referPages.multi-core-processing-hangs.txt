My code looks like the following. It seems to be "hanging" during the proc.join() loop. If I create the dataframe df with 10 records, the whole process completes fast, but starting with 10000 (as shown), then the program seems to just hang. I am using htop to look at the CPU core usages, and I do see all of them spike up to 100%, but then long after they go back down to 0%, the program doesn't seem to continue. Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
It appears Queue.Queue doesn't behave as you want and it wasn't made for sharing between multiple process, instead you must use Manager.Queue()I have added some print to understand your code flow,You can still polish your code to use Pool() instead of num_cpus
