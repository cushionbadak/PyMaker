I am new to python and I am having problem over the following syntax:I saw the syntax on a tutorial, however when I try it, it is giving me error. The goal I am trying to reach is printing 0 to 9 while eliminating new line. In other words, print 0 to 9 in a single line. Can you tell me what's wrong with the syntax if there is any?
To print in Python 2.7 without the line break you just need to add an extra comma to the end. It will also add a space between the numbers.
Are you using python 2? Because print() with end keyword argument is a Python 3 command.
The print function with keyword end of Python 3 can be imported into Python 2 byimporting from __future__ at the very beginning of the script:However, Python 2's print statement allows a syntax form without parentheses. This syntax will break with this import.
