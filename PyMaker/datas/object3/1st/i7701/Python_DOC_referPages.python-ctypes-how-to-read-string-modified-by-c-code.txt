After following this  answer, I wrote a C library which I call from python using ctypes. The C library contains a function which takes a char* and modifies its contents. I would like to read the contents in Python, however, after calling the library function in Python, I get an empty string even though I see the correct output in the terminal if I include a  printf statement in the C code. What am I doing wrong? C code:Python code:Output:b''
Found the problem. Turns out that the code in the /* do something */ part somehow changed the adress of pythonbuffer. I solved it by using a temporary char * and then copying it to pythonbuffer with strcpy.
