I have this code:When I run the that code in Python 3.6.1 on my mac, I get this:But when I run the same script on Windows (but with the du commands substituted to something which works on Windows), also with Python 3.6.1, I get this:This is what I substitute the Unix commands with on Windows:Windows version info:
Different event loops implemented differently. Some of them have restrictions (sometimes OS-related). By default, Windows uses SelectorEventLoop and as you can see in doc:SelectorEventLoop specific limits:SelectSelector is used which only supports sockets and is limited to    512 sockets.add_reader() and add_writer() only accept file descriptors of socketsPipes are not supported (ex: connect_read_pipe(), connect_write_pipe())Subprocesses are not supported (ex: subprocess_exec(), subprocess_shell())To run your code in Windows you can use alternative event loop available by default - ProactorEventLoop. Replace line:with this:Your code will work.
3.7.0 Python documentation handles this here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-platforms.html#asyncio-windows-subprocessSet the event loop policy if you are using Windows - then your code will work.In your startup, change the unix-specific section:to handle Windows & Unix:
