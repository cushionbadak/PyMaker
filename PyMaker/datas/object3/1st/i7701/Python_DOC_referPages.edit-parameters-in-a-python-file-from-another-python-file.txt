I've got a configuration file for an application in the form of a python file containing a dict and I'm running an AWS lambda function to get this conf file from S3, change three variables in it and then push a copy back to S3. Is there any easy way to do this? A coworker said to try Jinja templating, but that seems limited to just HTML files?ThanksAn example of the python config file is below. I need to change the "alpha" and "cycles" variables
Jinja2 can certainly do it. but if it's worth to do is another questionI modify the your file a little to make it renderable by jinja2Here is how to render it using jinja2. suppose the path_1 is path of your config file. path_2 is the path of new config file
I found a solution, it's not pretty and as SRC mentioned, it's a bad solution that shouldn't be used in anything real, but it works.I took advice from milo and converted my reference control.py file into a Jinja template as shown here: Then I amended my lambda function, to get this template, execute it, which prints the now rendered control file to stdio, where in the lambda function I have redirected the stdio for my exec function, where I can catch it and stream it into an S3 Object, which then gets pushed back to S3. Found the idea of redirecting the stdio hereTo extend I'll pass through the stdin to the lambda function as the parameters to the jinja template.
