I have a function that requires parameter to be both Sized and Iterable at the same time.  I thought that I can use standard typing module from python3.5+ and write this: Collection looks like what I need:  class typing.Collection(Sized, Iterable[T_co], Container[T_co])Why it causes warning? What should i do to hint parameter as both Iterable and Sized?
Collection was only introduced in 3.6; odds are, your version of PyCharm doesn't recognize it yet.There is no built-in that describes a sized, iterable container in 3.5, so you can't use this annotation in 3.5, at least, not without writing your own typing type, which PyCharm may or may not recognize.
A dirty fix to make Python 3.5 happy is to use Union[Sized, Iterable[Any]].It is dirty, because using this type annotation says that it should be either sized OR iterable, not sized AND iterable.The current Pycharm (2018.1) accepts this, and it runs.UPDATE:I have found a way to use Collections in Python versions < 3.6.Before 3.6 Sequence is basically what Collection is in 3.6 (See here and here). In 3.6 a Sequence is basically a reversible Collection (see here), and this gave me issues, because a python set is not a sequence (it is not reversible) so I patched it with the following import code:
