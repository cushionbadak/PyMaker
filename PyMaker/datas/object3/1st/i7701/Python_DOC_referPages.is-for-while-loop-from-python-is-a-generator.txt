In an interview , the interviewer asked me for some of generators being  used in Python. I know a generator is like a function which yield values instead of return.so any one tell me is for/while loop is an example of generator.
Short answer: No, but there are other forms of generators.A for/while loop is a loop structure: it does not emit values and thus is not a generator.Nevertheless, there are other ways to construct generators.You example with yield is for instance a generator:But there are also generator expressions, like:Furthermore in python-3.x the range(..), map(..), filter(..) constructs are generators as well.And of course you can make an iterable (by using an iterable pattern):
Neither while nor for are themselves generators or iterators. They are control constructs that perform iteration. Certainly, you can use for or while to iterate over the items yielded by a generator, and you can use for or while to perform iteration inside the code of a generator. But neither of those facts make for or while generators.
The first line in the python wiki for generators:Generators functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, i.e. it can be used in a for loop.So in the context of your interview I'd believe they were looking for you to answer about the creation of an iterable.The wiki for a for loopIn Python this is controlled instead by generating the appropriate sequence.So you could get pedantic but generally, no, a for loop isn't a generator.
for and while are loop structures, and you can use them to iterate over generators. You can take certain elements of a generator by converting it to a list.
