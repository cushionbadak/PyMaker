Natural Text
I have an app structured like so:The content of my app.py:And init.py in the name folder is:How would I import this app into views.py? Currently, I'm using , but then when I run the app it returns a 404 error.
This is what I did to my apps:In __init__.py:In folder1/views.py:The "app_context()" injects the current app object into the current_app proxy. Read this to understand the mechanism.Also it is recommended to explicitly use relative imports (with the extra dots ".").
