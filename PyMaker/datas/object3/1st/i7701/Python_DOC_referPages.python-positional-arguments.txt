I am trying to understand how the parameters to this function are interpreted:It appears this function forces the caller to call f() with exactly 2 params and the second param should always be a named b= param. How do I decipher this from the function signature? Why does it not allow me to specify a middle argument for the *?
How do I decipher this from the function signature?Arguments with no default value must be passed.Arguments after a * must be passed by keyword if they are passed at all.Extra arguments cannot be passed to "fill up" the * unless an argument name accompanies the *.Since b has no default value it must be passed.  Since it is after the * it must be passed by keyword.  Since the * is "bare" (i.e., it is just the * placeholder and not a vararg like *args), no other positional arguments can be passed as "middle" arguments.See PEP 3102 for a description of the keyword-only-argument syntax.
The * alone is a Python3-only way to express that the following parameters are named arguments and can only be passed to the function as such. From the documentation:Parameters after “*” or “*identifier” are keyword-only parameters and may only be passed used keyword arguments.
