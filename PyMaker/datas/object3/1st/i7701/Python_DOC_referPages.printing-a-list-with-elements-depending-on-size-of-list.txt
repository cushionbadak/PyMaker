I have a list of integers and I want to print a list containing, for example, k number of elements in the list depending on the "k" value.For example, if k = 4, this means that the list I will be printing will have exactly 4 elements in the list. For k = 5, 5 elements in the list, etc.Here's my code:The first function defined finds the minimum value in the list and returns the minimum value.The second function has 2 parameters which are the k value and list. The k value is the size of the list to return which I'm having issues on. Whenever a minimum value is obtained and appended into the temp list, it removes it from list A and will then proceed on to obtain the next minimum digit in the list A.An example of output will be when k = 4, hence the list will have four elements in it:The code I wrote gave me 6 elements in the list instead of 4:I'm guessing my mistake would be temp = []*k.

First. You don't need to hand-write function to find minimum in python. There's built-in minSecond. If you expect your program to operate on multiple values inside datastructure, in most cases operating "all at once" is a good idea.According to your code:sort list ascending (with built-in list.sortslice the list up to k valuesSo, you can end up withTo achieve same result by "one-by-one" operations you canfind minimumremove single element by valueadd it to new listdo it k timesWhich can look like
You made the problem much more complex than it should be:
