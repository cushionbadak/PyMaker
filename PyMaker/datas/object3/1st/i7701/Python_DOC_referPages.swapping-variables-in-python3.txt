This question already has an answer here:Is there a standardized method to swap two variables in Python?                    5 answers                How does swapping of members in the python tuples (a,b)=(b,a) work internally?                    1 answer                I have just started learning python3 and I came across the following line of code :How is this line a,b = b,a working? Is Python automatically creating some temp variables? And what are the unseen possibilities? I mean, can I do the same for 3 or more variables in one line?
disassembling with dis:giveswhere ROT_TWO meansSwaps the two top-most stack items.python does not need to create a temporary variable.
You can also do that with multiple variables but it gets tricky: This is useful when you want to update some values. For example, if new value of y needs to be incremented by x, and x takes the value of y:
