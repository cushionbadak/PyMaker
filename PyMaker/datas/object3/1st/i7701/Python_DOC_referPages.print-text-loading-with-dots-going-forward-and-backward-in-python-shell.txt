Natural Text
I want to print Text 'Loading...' But its dots would be moving back and forward (in shell). I am creating a text game and for that it will look better.I know writing slowly a word but dots also have to go back.  I am thinking that I should forget dots to come back.And for that:  What do you think?If you have that dots would be moving back and forward Then please share with me.If you want more information I am ready to Provide to you.Thanks
You can use backtracking via backspace (\b) in your STDOUT to go back and 'erase' written characters before writing them again to simulate animated loading, e.g.:Keep in mind that this is a blocking process so you either have to do your loading checks within the for loop, or run your loading in a separate thread, or run this in a separate thread - it will keep running in a blocking mode as long as its local loading variable is set to True.
