Natural Text
I need to create autocomplete file for custom made editor written in other languages. With the keywords it is simply:But I don't know if there is something similar. If not does Python team maintain any parsable format for their documentation?All I need is name of the function and possibly arguments it takes and description of what it actually does. Other details like package name et al are nice to have too.for example Python have open function and as such it will be:name: open()signature: open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)description: Open file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot be opened, an OSError is raised....I hope am clear enough. Let me know of anything that is still ambiguous.
Based on your question, you want some information to display on a variable. Objects in python contain a couple of builtin attributes you could read to get this information.__name__: Provides the name of the object (beware, if the object does not have this, it will raise an AttributeError.__doc__: Provides useful help text on an object. May or may not contain anything.dir(__builtins__): To retrieve information about all builtins.
In python3 any object has attributes __name__ (and __qualname__, not sure what's the difference), __text_signature__ and __doc__.
