Beautiful Soup can parse HTML and XML, not JavaScript.You can use regular expression to search this code.Using <a [^>]*?(href=\"([^\">]+)\") you can match everything inside this code which:<a - is an a tag[^>]*? - can have any characters that are not > href=" - have href[^\">]+ - have any number of characters other than " and >To extract script code from html you can usescript = soup.find('script', {'type': 'text/javascript'})and then to parse it, usere.search(r"<a [^>]*?(href=\"([^\">]+)\")", script.text)Remember to import re first.Read about regular expression. If you are going to use pattern often, compile it first.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
