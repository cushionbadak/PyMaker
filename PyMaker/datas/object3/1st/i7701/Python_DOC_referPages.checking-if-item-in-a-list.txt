I have a piece of code that is checking if a user is in a table of data.  I can get it to produce a list of the user details but I cannot for the life of me figure out why it won't let me produce a greeting if the user name is valid.The code is:What I get out of this is:I cannot see why as the username is clearly matching what is in the list.  I am a novice user so apologies if it i something really obvious!
Since your username is likely to be unique, change your c.fetchall() to c.fetchone() which should give you the required row instead of a list of rows with only one row in it. Check the sqlite3 documentation related to the fetch methods.As pointed out in a comment, you shouldremove the line reassigning the username variable username = (username,) and directly use (username,) in c.execute().
Beside change fetchall() to fetchone(), the problem is that you assign tuple (username,) to variable username, it changed from Bob to (Bob,), when your code check variable username is in the result, it will use the tuple (Bob,) instead of Bob. That's why the code always print Wrong username. you have to change to a new variable name not username, Change your code to:output:
Solved it!When I changed the username variable for use in the query I added a "," after it.  That was why it was not finding the user in the list. I added a separate variable for the username in the query and all works.Thanks for all the advice.
