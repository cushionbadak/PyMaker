I would like to get the unix file type of a file specified by path (find out whether it is a regular file, a named pipe, a block device, ...)I found in the docs os.stat(path).st_type but in Python 3.6, this seems not to work.Another approach is to use os.DirEntry objects (e. g. by os.listdir(path)), but there are only methods is_dir(), is_file() and is_symlink().Any ideas how to do it?
Python 3.6 has pathlib and its Path objects have methods:is_dir()is_file()is_symlink()is_socket()is_fifo()is_block_device()is_char_device()pathlib takes a bit to get used to (at least for me having come to Python from C/C++ on Unix), but it is a nice library
You use the stat module to interpret the result of os.stat(path).st_mode.You can make a general function to return the determined type. This works for both Python 2 and 3.
