I need to take the average, minimum and maximum from this list, without using built in functions, but it throws an Exception:Here is my code:
You could simply iterate in the second loop too:But in case you're interested using the built-in functions sum and min could make this much easier:In case you have python >= 3.4 you could also use statistics.mean instead of dividing the sum by the length:
This is relatively easy to solve. The code can be changed thus.So here is the explanation of how it worksPoint a: I am not sure why you had defined a low, which would be an integer, and then said lowest was the int of low. I have no idea why that exists. What you actually want is to set it to the first value arbitrarily, which is what I have done.Point b: Each item is the item in the list. It is not the integer of each item, it gives you the value of each itemPoint c: As you have the value of the item, you should directly compare it to lowestPoint d: You should then set the lowest value as the new one
Return the element  and not the index, you then just use for your conditions:If you want to use the index, you can use :or even using enumeration : Also, next time you may want to print the value that made the error to see if it is what you expected
You cannot use the floating point numbers as indices. So try thisIf you do not want to use the len() as well. Try thisAnd finally your question you could convert float to int by typecasting it. int(item) is one way to do that.
