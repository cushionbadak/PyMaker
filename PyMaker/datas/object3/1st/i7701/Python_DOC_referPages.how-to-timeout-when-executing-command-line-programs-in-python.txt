I am executing Maple from Python and would like to stop the program if it exceeds a maximum time. If its a Python function this can be done by using a timeout-decorator. But I am not sure how to do it for command line calls. Here is the pseudocodeJust to time this program, all works fine. However the maple program takes a lot of time so I would like to define a maxtime, check whether t1 < maxtime then let program execute else no. i.e. change the script to something like this:At the moment this is not working. Is there a better way to do this?
You can use subprocess.Popen to spawn a child process. Make sure to handle stdout and stderr properly. Then use Popen.wait(timeout) call and kill the process when TimeoutExpired arrive.
Use subprocess.Popen() to do your bidding, if you're using Python version prior to 3.3 you'll have to do handle the timeout yourself, tho:In Python 3.3+ it's as easy as calling: subprocess.run(["maple", "args", "and", "such"], timeout=10)
I think you can use threading.Timer(TIME, function , args=(,))To execute function after a delay
