Natural Text
I am trying to make a simple text editor using python. I am now trying to make a find function. This is what I've got:This will succesfully highlight words that match the users input with a green background. But the problem is, that it only highlights the first match every line, as you can see here.I want it to highlight all matches.Full code here: https://pastebin.com/BkuXN5pk
Recommend using the text widget's built-in search capability. Shown using python3.
