I am trying to read data from a huge csv file I have. I is showing me this error UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xae in position 13: invalid start byte. Is there any way to just skip through the lines that cause this exception to be thrown? From the millions of lines these are just a handful and I can't manually delete them. I tried adding error_bad_lines=False, but that did not solve the problem. I am using Python 3.6.1 that I got through Anaconda 4.4.0. I am also using a Mac if that helps. Please help me I am new to this. 
Seems to me that there are some non-ascii characters in your file that cannot be decoded. Pandas accepts an encoding as an argument for read_csv (if that helps):The default encoding is None, which is why you might be getting those errors.Here is a link to the standard Python encodings - Try "ISO-8859-1" (aka 'latin1') or maybe 'utf8' to start. Pandas does allow you to specify rows to skip when reading a csv, but you would need to know the index of those rows, which in your case would be very difficult.
