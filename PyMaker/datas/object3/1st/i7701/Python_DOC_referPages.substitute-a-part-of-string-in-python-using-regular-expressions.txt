What I want is :original string : (#1 AND #12) OR #10convert to : (something AND another_something) OR something_another mean to say is, according to #number replace it by a unique string What I did is : Output : The Problem : rather then replacing #1 it replaces #12 and #11 also because #12 also have #1.I tried with count = 1 in re.sub() function but it did not worked because my string can be '(#12 AND #1)' as well.
You may convert the list of tuples into a dictionary and use a re.sub with a pattern capturing the digit part and then a lambda expression in the replacement argument to find the right value by key:The #([0-9]+) pattern matches # and then matches and captures into Group 1 one or more digits. Then, inside the lambda, the numeric value is used to fetch the existing value. If it does not exist, the # + the number will be inserted back into the result.See the Python demo.If you need to further process the match, you may want to use a callback method rather than a lamda in the replacement argument:See another Python demo.
Use word boundary \\b anchor to force an exact number matching:The output:http://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html
