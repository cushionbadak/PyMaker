I made a Python script to compare files (compareRFRegion). I call this script from a Perl script:But I get this error:Here's my Python script:I am able to execute this in standalone in linux terminal by adding if __name__ == "__main__": (commented here). It works fine. But not by calling it from Perl. Maybe there is something I am missing about calling a Python script from Perl ?
instead oftry adding in the commas isn't like the print statement, and doesn't concatenate them. Instead it treats the three strings as 3 different arguments. Adding in the additions signs will concatenate them.
Please, see - https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exitYour call of sys.exit() with 3 args is wrong, expected only one - exit code (optional)
You twice call sys.exit with two many arguments (as the error tells you :) ) change to e.g.
You need to read your exception. It says that you are calling sys.exit() with 3 arguments, but only 1 is allowed.Read the docs on sys.exit([arg])And here is notes on optional argument arg:The optional argument arg can be an integer giving the exit status (defaulting to zero), or another type of object. If it is an integer, zero is considered “successful termination” and any nonzero value is considered “abnormal termination” by shells and the like. Most systems require it to be in the range 0–127, and produce undefined results otherwise. Some systems have a convention for assigning specific meanings to specific exit codes, but these are generally underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use 2 for command line syntax errors and 1 for all other kind of errors. If another type of object is passed, None is equivalent to passing zero, and any other object is printed to stderr and results in an exit code of 1. In particular, sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a program when an error occurs.So you need to refactor your code, for sys.exit to get only one argument.
