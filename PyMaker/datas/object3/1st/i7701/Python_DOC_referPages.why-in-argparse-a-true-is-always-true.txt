This question already has an answer here:Parsing boolean values with argparse                    13 answers                Here is the simplest Python script, named test.py:But when I run this code on the command line:Whereas when my code reads '--bool', default=False, the argparse runs correctly.Why?
You are not passing in the False object. You are passing in the 'False' string, and that's a string of non-zero length.Only a string of length 0 tests as false:Use a store_true or store_false action instead. For default=True, use store_false:Now omitting the switch sets args.bool to True, using --bool (with no further argument) sets args.bool to False:If you must parse a string with True or False in it, you'll have to do so explicitly:and use that as the conversion argument:at which point --bool False will work as you expect it to.
