I have the following codeWhich gives me the following error:The main reason I am finding this difficult to troubleshoot is if I copy the output command  -c user.name=foo -c user.email='foo@bitbacket.org' commit -m 'no comments' group_vars/git_vars.yml to the terminal and add $git at the front of it file group_vars/git_vars.yml gets committed to the local repo fine
you need to split your arguments.your error message would read (added quotes and newlines):and git does not understand that (it takes the whole string as the first argument).you can use shlex to split your arguments:and use that asthat is also what the documentation says:When passing multiple arguments to a command, each argument must be a separate string:tar("cvf", "/tmp/test.tar", "/my/home/directory/")This will not work:tar("cvf /tmp/test.tar /my/home/directory")note: when working with git i prefer gitpython over sh.
