I can print variables in python. These print function returns for example 100 lines. Now I want to print only top 5 values based on filter of "size-used". I am trying to take these values in dictionary and filter out top five values for "size-used" but not sure how to take them in dictionary. Some thing like this {'vserver': (u'rcdn9-c01-sm-prod',), 'usize': u'389120', 'vname': (u'nprd_root_m01',), 'aggr': (u'aggr1_n01',)}Any other options like namedtuples is also appreciated. Thanks

heapq.nlargest is the obvious way to go here:
