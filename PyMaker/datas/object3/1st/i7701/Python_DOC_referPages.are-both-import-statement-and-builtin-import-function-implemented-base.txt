From https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.htmlThe purpose of the importlib package is two-fold. One is to provide  the implementation of the import statement (and thus, by extension,  the __import__() function) in Python source code. This provides an  implementation of import which is portable to any Python interpreter.  This also provides an implementation which is easier to comprehend  than one implemented in a programming language other than Python.Two, the components to implement import are exposed in this package,  making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known  generically as an importer) to participate in the import process.Does it mean that both the import statement and builtin.__import__() function are by default implemented based on importlib.__import() function?But https://stackoverflow.com/a/44655619/156458 implies thatbuiltins.__import__ is not implemented based on importlib.__import__ by default.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import says that buitlins.__import__ function is invoked by the import statement. so if builtins.__import__ is not implemented based on importlib.__import__ by default, the import statement is not implemented based on importlib.__import__ by default either.
No, the actual import code is a port of the Python code. See the implementation of the PyImport_ImportModuleLevelObject() function (which builtins.__import__ is basically a light Python->C wrapper for), which contains the comment:So for performance reasons, import uses C-optimised code, not the Python implementation of importlib. The two implementations are kept in sync, however, if you were to create a pull request touching one, the Python core developers will ask you to update the other too before accepting your changes.Your use of emphasis leads me to believe you are misreading the documentation; importlib is not the implementation of the import statement. This is the implementation of the import statement in Python source code, in contrast to the implementation of the import statement in C code.
