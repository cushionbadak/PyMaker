Implementing __repr__ for a class Foo with member variables x and y, is there a way to automatically populate the string? Example that does not work:And another:Yes I could define the method as but this gets tedious when there are many member variables.
I use this as a mixin when I want something like that:It gives the class name, the (shortened) id, and all of the attributes.
I think you want something like this:This will add repr(self.__dict__) in the string, using !r in a format specifier tells format() to call the item's __repr__().See the "Conversion field" here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntaxBased on Ned Batchelder's answer, you can replace the line above by for a more generic approach.
Nice example!for pretty output better to place simple return "\n{!r}".format(self.__dict__)and in root full print return "Class name: '{}' \n{!r}".format(self.__class__.__name__, self.__dict__)
