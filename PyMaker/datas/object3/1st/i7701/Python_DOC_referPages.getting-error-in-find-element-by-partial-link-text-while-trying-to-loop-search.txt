Natural Text
What I am trying to do is creating a loop for search query and parse data in .csv. However code gives error on this line driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text(query).click() and Selenium stops working. Can't figure it out what's happening.Here is the error:
I find out that csv.reader() return each row, as a list of strings. with square brackets. for example, if a row in CSV file contains.  "jarvis". it will return ["jarvis"] which is totally out of syntax. here is what i have done. is simply strip square brackets......
The issue is that you are trying to use a list in the find_element_by_link_text() method. You see, the  The reader() method that you have used, returns each row read, as a list of strings. Here is the Python documentation that elaborates it.Now, you are passing this list of strings, which is returned in your query to the find_element_by_link_text() method, which only takes a string as an argument - example is shown here. You need to use the strip() method to strip the string and then use the first string as your parameter in the find_element method.
