Natural Text
I am having trouble grasping how to create a save file for this team roster. The issue I run into is when I try to create what to save in the txt file. Im not sure why i cant get self.player etc to be written in the code. Based on how the players information is written how should I write the txt file to be saved and loaded?
First, there are quite a few problems with your code:Do not create useless class-attributes and override them using instance-attributes. Use a constructor like __init__(self, name=None, phone=None, jersay=None) instead.Do not use getters and setters like you would in Java. Python assumes that all attributes can be accessed without side-effects; if you truly need a getter/setter for an attribute, use a @property.You do not want a displayData-method. Instead, define a __str__()-method and just call print() on the instance.Concerning your question: You can use json, toml or just pickle to save your object. Here is a toml library ready for use.An example using json:
