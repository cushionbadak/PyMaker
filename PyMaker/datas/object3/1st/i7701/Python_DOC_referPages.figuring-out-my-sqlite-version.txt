I wanted to check which version of sqlite I had, which has become way more confusing than I expected. To start fresh, I created a new conda environment with:The shell message said it would install sqlite: 3.13.0-1 in the new environment, along with a few other packages.Then, after activating that new conda environment, I immediately ran pip freeze, but the list of packages I see does not include any entry for sqlite.Finally, I just enter python from the terminal (in this conda env) to enter a system python in my shell. The opening message says python version 3.6.1, confirming I'm in that newly created environment. But then outputs '2.6.0'What's going on? Do I have sqlite3 version 3.13 installed or 2.6? If my sqlite3 version is 2.6, how do I get something newer? That would be pretty old.
Yes, you have installed the sqlite: 3.13.0-1 version of sqlite database. If you want to check, run sqlite3 --versionHere you get version for DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite which is 2.6.0
Import sqlite3 into your python script:Add the following lines to your script:Running the script produced the following results for me (your results may differ):This information is documented in The Python Standard Library, "Section 12.6.1. Module functions and constants"https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
