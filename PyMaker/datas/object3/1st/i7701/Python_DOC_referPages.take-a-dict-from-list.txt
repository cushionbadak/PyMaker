I take some lists from my database:now I need to create a dict like this:I will use this in tkinter like json. I need to choose something like that:How can I create a dict? I'm tired of trying different ways. I will be very happy if I can get good advice
What you are showing is not very consistent, but I think you may benefit from using a collections.defaultdict:The defaultdict constructor takes a "factory" function as argument, i.e. a callable which is called without parameters to substitute a missing value. For example, defaultdict(list) will have an empty list for every missing key when you try to access it.In this case I created a nested defaultdict object, which creates another defaultdict for every key. The inner one also creates a defaultdict, which also uses defaultdict as factory. This reflects your data hierarchy and saves you multiple checks or exception handling for missing keys.
You could try a defaultdict as demonstrated by @LevLevitsky, or you could try this workable, albeit convoluted way:
