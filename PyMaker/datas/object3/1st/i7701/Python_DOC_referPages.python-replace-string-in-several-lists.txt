i want to replace a specific string in several lists according to another list.Here is an exampleI am comparing the first data and i want to replace the second string with the first string.Output shall look:  Data1=[['09 2F 59', '500.0', 'FC1', 'S6'], ['09 0A 54', '100.0','FC1'].... But iam failing to replace existing data. I always get the old data.:(
If you use a dictionary instead of a list for your Diag2, the problem becomes much easier :You don't need to iterate on Diag2 for each Data1 element, then.l[:2] + [Diag2.get(l[0], l[2])] + l[3:] means :2 first elements of lthe corresponding value from Diag2 for the key l[0]. If not present, use l[2] insteadelements of l after the 3 first ones, if present
Use zip() to aggregate the elements from the lists, then build a new list for each pair:Note that this usage of the * unpacking operator is supported in Python 3.5+.
