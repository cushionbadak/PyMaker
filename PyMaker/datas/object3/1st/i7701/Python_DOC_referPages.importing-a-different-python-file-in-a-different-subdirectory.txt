Say I have this "running" python file located in:C:\folder\subfolder_first\running.pyAnd I have a "helper" python file located in:C:\folder\subfolder_second\helper.pyI am using Pycharm and I want to run some of the functions/methods of the helper file in the running file. How do I do it?I tried the above line, but it gives me the error message:ImportError: No module named blah blah blah...
For Python 3 onlyIn order to get this to work youll need a file tree like this:And then you would run helper from running.py like this: However, I would suggest structuring it like this instead:Then import my_helper from running.py like:The second way is much much better. Just do it like that.
