To prepend to a list, I use the_list[0:0]. But with slice appending:[-0:-0] doesn't work.  [::-1][0:0] doesn't work.  And obviously [-1:-1] won't work.[len(the_list), len(the_list)] doesn't count -- looking for just numbers hereExample: Thoughts? 
The slice that starts after the last element is len(â€¦):.but why, when there are += and extend?
I think you want list.extend.  This can be used to add the members of one list to the end of another.
