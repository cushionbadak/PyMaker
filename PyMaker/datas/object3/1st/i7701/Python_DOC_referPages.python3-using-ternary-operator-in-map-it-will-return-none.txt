For python 2.7.13For python 3.6.1Two Questions:I want to know why the python2 return the correct result, but python3 return NoneHow should I modify the code with python3 to return the correct result
This is a change to the functionality of the map() function (together with the change to becoming an iterator). Because the inputs are now iterators, map() has been updated to follow the same behaviour as zip(), and not pad shorter inputs with None values.Compare the documentation for map() in Python 2:If one iterable is shorter than another it is assumed to be extended with None items.with the Python 3 version:With multiple iterables, the iterator stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted.You can use itertools.zip_longest() together with itertools.starmap() to get the Python 2 behaviour again:zip_longest() has the added advantage that you can now specify what value to use as a filler; as an example, you can set it to 0:Demo:
