I am just getting into Python and I am a newb to say the very least. I am playing around in PyCharm and I am trying to put together something basic for Employee data entry. I'm sure you can see the gist in my script. Anyway, first I have tried for a bit to figure away to get it to spit out Salary, Bonus and Annual as currency but can't. You know $60,000 instead of 60000.Also, I wanted it to give a bi-weekly pay schedule if you entered in the date of the first paycheck. I'm trying to brain storm. 
You can use local.currencylocale.currency(val, symbol=True, grouping=False, international=False)Formats a number val according to the current LC_MONETARY settings.The returned string includes the currency symbol if symbol is true, which is the default. If grouping is true (which is not the default), grouping is done with the value. If international is true (which is not the default), the international currency symbol is used.Note that this function will not work with the ‘C’ locale, so you have to set a locale via setlocale() first.Ref : Python Documents: Internationalization servicesP.S: For bi-weekly pay schedule, see Generating recurring dates using python?
