I have a list that I'm trying to strip all punctuation and the character "·" from and then returning that list without any of the above. However, when I try to return the list, only the first word of the list appears and I'm not sure where I went wrong with this. Here is the list I'm trying to strip punctuation from: ['in·vis·i·ble', 'in·vis·i·bil·i·ty, ', 'in·vis·i·ble·ness, ', 'in·vis·i·bly, ', 'qua·si-in·vis·i·ble, ', 'qua·si-in·vis·i·bly, ', 'inˌvisiˈbility, ', 'inˈvisibleness, ', 'inˈvisibly, ']Here's what I'm getting: ['invisible']Here is a portion of my code (it's part of a larger function) 
Use a list comprehension where each element of the resulting list is a string with all occurrences of dot substring '·' replaced by the void '':Example
