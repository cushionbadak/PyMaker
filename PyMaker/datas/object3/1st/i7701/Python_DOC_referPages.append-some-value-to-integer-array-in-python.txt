how can I add some value to this integer array "a" using append or any other method?
The reason you are getting an error is that you cannot append to numpy.array. If a was a list, you would have no problem.It looks like this is what you are looking for:If a and c are numpy.arrays, you can:
Lists are much more efficient at item-wise construction than numpy arrays.  If you want to append one-by-one, I would suggest appending to a list and then converting it to a numpy array using np.array(myList).  A faster way to do the same thing your code does is this:If you just want to convert your c list into an int16 array:Which you can then np.concatenate as per @Akavall or use the somewhat more compact np.r_ form (note the square brackets).
Here's some timeit code that compares the speeds of 3 different ways of converting a 2D Python list of small integers to a 1D Numpy array.The straight-forward way is to simply pass the whole list to Numpy's array function, and then flatten the resulting 2D array to 1D via its .flatten method. That's the approach taken by grid_to_array.The other ways that I tested both use the numpy.append function. grid_rows_to_array builds the array row by row, grid_items_to_array builds it item by item. As you might guess, this last approach is very slow. Even for a 10x10 list it's around 50 times slower than grid_to_array. For larger lists, it's speed is truly glacial.outputThese timings were obtained using Python 3.6.0 on a rather ancient 2GHz single core 32 bit machine with 2GB of RAM, running a Debian derivative of Linux. YMMV.
Ok, well according to the docs the numpy arrays do not have the function append.Here is the correction of your code:I guess this was what you wanted to do, according to the docs numpy.append() is a free function that you can use. I hope this helps you.
