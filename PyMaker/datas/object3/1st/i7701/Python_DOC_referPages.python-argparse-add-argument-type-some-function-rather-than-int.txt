In a project I see the following use of add_argument():in which make_arg_instanceis a function defined as:It seems the argument 'somearg' is an class object instead of int and that's why later a method is called as in i = args.somearg.somefunction().In most tutorials that I've seen the type of argument is always int therefore could someone explain a bit about how to add argument of type class or any type other than int? Thanks!
From the documentation for the type argument:By default, ArgumentParser objects read command-line arguments in as simple strings. However, quite often the command-line string should instead be interpreted as another type, like a float or int. The type keyword argument of add_argument() allows any necessary type-checking and type conversions to be performed. [...]type= can take any callable that takes a single string argument and returns the converted valueYou can pass in any callable, provided it takes a single argument to be converted. int() is such a callable, but that doesn't mean you have to use that. If you want some other type or want to apply extra constraints to the allowed values, you can specify your own.
