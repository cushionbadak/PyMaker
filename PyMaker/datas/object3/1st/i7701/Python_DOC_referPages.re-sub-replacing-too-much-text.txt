Natural Text
I have a set of links like:I'm trying to iterate over them to remove everything that comes after html. So I have:Which returns:Confused as to why it's including html in the capture group. Thanks for any help.
html is part of the matched text too, not just the (...) group. re.sub() replaces all of the whole matched text.Include the literal html text in the replacement:or, alternatively, capture that part in a group instead:You may want to consider using a non-greedy match, and a $ end-of-string anchor to prevent cutting off a URL that contains html in the path more than once, and including the . dot to make sure you are really only matching the .html extension:However, if your goal is to remove the query string from a URL, consider parsing the URL using urllib.parse.urlparse(), and re-building it without the query string or fragment identifiers:This won't remove the eroneous HTML chunks however; if you are parsing these URLs from a HTML document, consider using a real HTML parser rather than regex.
Just a complement to Martijn's answer.You could also use a lookbehind assertion to only match the text following html:or use a replacement string to keep the initial part:But as already said by Martin, you'd better use the urllib module to correctly parse URLs
