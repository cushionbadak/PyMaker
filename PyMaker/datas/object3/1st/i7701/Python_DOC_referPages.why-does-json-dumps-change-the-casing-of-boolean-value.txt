I've been using json.dumps() to create some templates but when using it, it changes the casing of my boolean valuesHere's how to replicate:What's the reason for this?
json.dumps() converts a Python dictionary to a JSON object formatted as a string. According to the JSON specification, the two boolean literals in JSON are true and false. So, json.dumps() isn't changing the casing, it's only converting Python's boolean literals, True and False, to JSON's boolean literals, true and false, respectively.If you do wish to get a string representation of the Python dictionary without converting to JSON, you could cast the dictionary to string using str()
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and true is boolean representation in JS. Compare with these docs.
