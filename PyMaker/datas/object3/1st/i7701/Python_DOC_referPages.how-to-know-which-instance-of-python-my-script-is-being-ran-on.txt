This question already has an answer here:How do I check what version of Python is running my script?                    19 answers                Find full path of the Python interpreter?                    4 answers                So I am trying to run a script from task scheduler. It has not been working and in the second that the terminal pops up and disappears, I was able to read it say "ImportError no Module named Pandas" My script imports Pandas fine and runs perfectly, but whenever I double click the script to run or schedule it to run automatically it is saying I do not have Pandas.My theory is that it is using a different instance of Python that is installed on this computer that does not have the Pandas library installed. However, when i try to reinstall pandas on the command line using pip it sends back "requirement already satisfied". I would appreciate any advice or ideas for me to try. Thank you!
sys.version_info and sys.version contain the version of Python that is being run. sys.executable contains the path to the specific interpreter running.Python3:Python2:The problem seems to be that your registry editor has set a different version set to run "on-click" for Python executables. You can fix that by running the Python installer for the version you want, and setting it to repair, or modifying "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Python.File\Shell\open\command" to run the correct python executable (Should be "C:\Windows\py.exe"). See this image for where to find it.If you are already using py.exe, adding a hashbang to the top of the file (#!Python<version>, or to work with Unix executables, #!/usr/bin/env python<version>) should help py.exe pick the correct executable to run.To install using pip for a specific executable, run Path\To\Executable -m pip install <module>.To use modules from a different site-path, add the directory to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Using import <file> will check for modules in directories in the PYTHONPATH.
