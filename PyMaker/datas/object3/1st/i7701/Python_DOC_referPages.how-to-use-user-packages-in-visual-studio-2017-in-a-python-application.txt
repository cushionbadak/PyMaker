I have this python application structure in Visual Studio 2017.I created a tests folder using the Solution explorer and there's a test.py file in it.I want to use the test module which is stored in tests directory. But when I try to use import tests.test it says test not defined.I have just started learning python. I looked up to this but I dont understand why isnt it working. Am I doing something wrong? I looked it up here 
You are trying to import from from package. Each package must have an __init__.py file. You just have to add a blank file __init__.py to your tests folder and then it should be fine.
