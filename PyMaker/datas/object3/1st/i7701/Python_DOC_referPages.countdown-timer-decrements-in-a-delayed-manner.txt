This question is an exact duplicate of:Countdown timer is delayed on pygame screen?I've been working on a game; in which one of the main components is a countdown timer- however this timer is delayed and I am not able to deduce why. I would like it to decrement once per second, however it seems to be decrementing at once every 6 seconds.Here is how I have the timer set up:I print it on the screen with the code below:    Any help is greatly appreciated!
It might be caused by the fact that you rely on going trough this Timer Calculation exactly 60 times / second. If you update it 10 times / second it will add 1 second for every 6 seconds of real time. You should probably use something like time module to time it more precisely.  Since it's named tuple, you can use index:or names:https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time
