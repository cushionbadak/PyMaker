How do I chunk/paginate this list with constraint ? lets say my page size is 3 and per page I want only numbers divisible by two. Changes:Since it is pagination how do we produce one page/chunk per invocation. or in other words lets say I have a function called paginate which takes Where page_number is the page that you are requesting for, e.g: page_number=2. special case: If you want to get all the pages, then set page_number = 0this function can be invoked like below:
Create a generator for the even  numbers, then chunk afterward:You could avoid iterating over the entire to filter out None by doing the check and replacement only on the last chunk, the only possible location for a None:In Python 3, map(None, ...) can be replaced with itertools.zip_longest which ensures the shortest chunk is appended with Nones as opposed to zip that simply stops at the length of the shortest iterable:
Lets use a 3rd party library called more-itertoolsHere is a link for more-itertools
