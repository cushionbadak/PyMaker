I'm trying to write lists of information onto a .csv file in python. So far, I've only been able to get the header to print. I want to grab 2 columns from an existing .csv file to write into the new .csv file with my data. so far, I have my new data is inSo my question would be: How can I assign poemid, poemsize, cli, and ari to a csv file? I'm very new to python and I can't figure out the syntax to do so
Pandas is not required but it will simplify your life. You could do the following (removing the function get_id_size() altogether):
Well, I'm not a pandas guru, but you don't really need it here:That reads from the input file (ignoring all fields past the first two; if the fields are actually index 1 and 3, you could use for (_, poemid, _, size, *_), c, a in zip(...): instead), pairs them up with your computed values, then writes them out. I'm sure there is a nicer way in pandas, but this doesn't require third party modules at all, so it may be preferable in some cases.To split this up into functions, you'd need to either open the file outside the function or listify the results (so the with block doesn't cut off access to the file before you're done. For example:Note: This is Py3 code; changes would be needed for the Py2 csv module.
