I wanted to load a module named mymodule in a directory up two, and down one directory in my file system. Elsewhere I have usedin order to go up one, then down one directory (in a package) to grab a module, so I expected this to work:However, I get a ModuleNotFoundError: "No module named 'mymodule'". I'm confused because I ran this in a directory down one from the directory where I had the previous (working) program. (I tried adding __init__.py but it didn't help.) Does anyone know why this doesn't work? Any advice?
this is my go-to-method for just that:using __file__ i do not rely on the current working directory as starting point for relative paths - HERE is the directory the current file is in.of course you do not have to use the pathlib module.
