Life will be easier for you, as a programmer, if you use google. And I mean no offence. In this case, just query for python round.In this particular case, if you want to round a float called BMD to two decimal places then you would use the following expression,You might also be interested in how to use formatting to achieve a similar result. First I deliberately set BMD to a value that has only two decimal places. I can print it as-is but I have no control. In the second case, I set BMD to a value for quite a few decimal places but this time I limit the number of output decimal places. In my opinion, it's safer to use round and then use the first formatting option because the second option could stumble with a value such as 345.22 (which occupies more than four columns overall).
