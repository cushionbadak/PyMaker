This is an unusual situation - most Django users want Django's test runner to find all of their tests.I'm working on a python library with several test suites that are run with different configurations, so I don't want the discovery to find and run tests from the wrong configuration.  How do I disable discovery entirely and rely on the pre-1.6 behavior of only running the tests for apps explicitly declared in INSTALLED_APPS?My library structure:The problem is that this command, which should only run tests for the 'contrib' test suite, is also finding and running tests for 'core':./manage_contrib.py test contrib.tests
It's missing from the Django docs, but the command-line has an option, found via ./manage.py help test:Confusingly, specifying the module to test doesn't appear to prevent test discovery, but specifying a sub-directory does, like this:./manage_contrib.py test contrib.tests -t ./contrib/That appears to prevent the discovery of tests located outside of contrib.
Hmm I'm unfortunately not aware of a settings parameter that might let you tell unittest to only run from individual apps (a-la "settings.TEST_DIRECTORIES=settings.INSTALLED_APPS") but if you're able to give your tests a unique naming convention, you could use the --pattern= option when running the test suite.For example, if you haveYou could only run a with ./manage.py test --pattern='*_a_*' and then run b with ./manage.py test --pattern='*_b_*'Definitely not ideal, but might get the job done depending on how much flexibility you have with the test naming conventions in your own app.
