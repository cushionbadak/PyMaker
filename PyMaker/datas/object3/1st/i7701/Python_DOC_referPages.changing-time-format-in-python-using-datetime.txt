I am having trouble trying to change my date format.mydate is for example: 2017-06-20T12:54:57.000ZHere what I am trying to do: datetime.strptime('mytime', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%m:%sZ')I also tried dateutil.parser.parse('mydate').strptime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%m:%sZ')For both I have this error:
%m stands for months; the second time you should've used %M for minutes. Also, %S for seconds.
Use the following format string:In yours, you have %m instead of %M for the minute, %s instead of %S for the second, and you were missing the %f for the microsecond.Check the docs for a full explanation of datetime string formatting.
I finally split my string because I don't need the microseconds, and I use timedelta to correct the timezone
