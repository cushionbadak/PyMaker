I am using Ubuntu 16.04. Here is tensorflow info:The cuda info:When I import tensorflow in Python from Ubuntu terminal I get no loading information as below.If I run the python program in terminal, I get different information. How do I know if tensorflow is using cuda and cudnn or not? What other information do I need to provide?
You can check with nvidia-smi if the GPU is used by the python/tensorflow process. If there is no process using the GPU, tensorflow doesn't use cuda and cudnn.
Had a similar question on Windows - wanted to see the GPU being utilised and can't figure out how to install the smi utility.The most convincing way I found check whether it was using the CPU was to run the tutorial:https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layersMain change required is the following:The logging shows where it's putting the operations - GPU:0 (you should see this in the console)allow_growth stops CUDA falling over on my machine by allocating all the memory straight away.  It took quite a while to find how to apply this to the estimator - docs could be improved a little here for new users I feel!Once I got it up and running, not only was it lightening fast in comparison to the CPU only version, but I could see GPU usage in the 70s-80s on task manager!
