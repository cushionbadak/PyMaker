Would the correct way to type hint FuncA be:def FuncA(arg: CustomClass):Or would it be:def FuncA(Arg:Type[CustomClass]):?
The former is correct, if arg accepts an instance of CustomClass:In case you want the class CustomClass itself (or a subtype), then you should write:Like it is written in the documentation about Typing:A variable annotated with C may accept a value of type C. In  contrast, a variable annotated with Type[C] may accept values that  are classes themselves - specifically, it will accept the class  object of C.The documentation includes an example with the int class:
