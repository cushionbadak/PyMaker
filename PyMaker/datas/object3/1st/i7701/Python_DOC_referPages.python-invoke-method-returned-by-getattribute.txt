If this question has a duplicate, sorry, I didn't find it, I will erese the question if someone does.I have this simple python class:And trying to get the method with different ways I did:The question is, if I do:$hi!Is return, but when I do:TypeError: 'classmethod' object is not callableHow can I execute the a method?
You are bypassing the descriptor protocol, and you have an unbound class method.The solution is to invoke the protocol, if there is a __get__ method present:Now the classmethod is bound to the class and it works again:Alternatively, use the correct __getattribute__, one that actually knows how to apply the descriptor protocol to class attributes; classes do not use object.__getattribute__, but type.__getattribute__:You'd actually want to access type(NothingSpecial).__getattribute__ to allow metaclasses to override the implementation of __getattribute__ here.
