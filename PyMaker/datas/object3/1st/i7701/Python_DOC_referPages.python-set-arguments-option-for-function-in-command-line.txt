Natural Text
I have written simple function to cut lines in txt file, takes 3 arguments :cut(inicial_line, final_line, file)now how do i put inicial_line and final_line to -c option to execute it for example:$ python cut.py -c 5 8 f.txtand it print file text from 5th to 8th line
i found solutionmain problem was args=pars.parse_args(sys.argv[1:4])i didnt know that args=pars.parse_args() is the same as args=pars.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])
