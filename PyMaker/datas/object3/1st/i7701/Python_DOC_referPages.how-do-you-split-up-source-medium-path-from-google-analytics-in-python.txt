I have a year worth of data from Google Analytics Multi-Attribute Funnel API. Example below. The Source Medium comes in with varying lengths and I am looking for ways to create a new column for each channel as ">" the delimiter. An example is below of what format I would like the data. How would this be done in Python?
You could do it using Pandas and apply() functions.http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/generated/pandas.Series.apply.htmlMy code that takes the source mediums from csv but could just as easily use for API results.
