I loop over files and for each of these files, I compute a list of 4000+ (fixed number) features on it. These features are computed by a function and returned as numpy.arrayI want to write a CSV file with one line per file (each line is one numpy.arraywith 4000+ elements).I'm currently using the csvlibrary of Python and even if my array is rounded (thanks to np.around), the CSV file contains numbers with a lot of digits, e.g. 0,302499999999999instead of 0,3025I know this may come from floating points limitations in Python, but i wanted to know if there is any way to avoid this (by writing it as a string?) in the output file.Sample of code below to reproduce the issue :
You can use numpy.savetxt() like this:
