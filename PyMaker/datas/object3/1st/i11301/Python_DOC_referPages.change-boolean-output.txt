I'm trying to change the output of Boolean values.For example if I've got something like:I don't want it to return True, but to return something that I specify like CorrectHow can I do this?Thanks
Then you can call this function.If you actually want to change what == actually does, you would have to override the operator class __eq__. But this can quickly become out-of-hand if you are just starting out with programming.Edit to address OP's comment:What I wrote can be replaced to anything. You can do something as simple as:The general format is:You don't even need a function to do this. You can use if-statements on their own like what I did above.Second edit:Okay now I see what you want. Here's what you can do. It might be a little complex but bear with me.Create a function such as this. You can name it whatever you want as long as you're consistent: Now, wherever you have a conditional statement where you are trying to print "correct" or "incorrect", just wrap the conditional statement in booleanizer as follows:Say you have 2+3<5-7 and you want to "booleanize" it.Or you could apply this to any conditionaletc...
The shorties way to do it is:There is no good way to change behaivour of print(True) output.
