I'm looking through python built in library modules, and for example in socket.py I see the line:I understand that the socket module acts as a wrapper for _socket.  I want to read through some of the source code files within _socket to see how certain tasks are accomplished. Where can I find _socket or any of these other shared files on a Linux box?
_socket is a C extension. The socket.py module wraps this with some additional information that doesn't need the speed boost or access to OS-level C APIs.If you are versed in C, you can read the socketmodule.c source code. There is no one-on-one mapping between the final .so or .dll file and the original source file however. You can grep the setup.py file for the names instead:Take into account however that some modules are built-in, compiled as part of the python binary; these are all listed in the sys.builtin_module_names tuple.
You can use the __file__ attribute:In python packages you can also use the __path__ attribute (for the directory):
