This question already has an answer here:Calling an external command in Python                    56 answers                I am having problem with logic and syntax in Python for opening program and executing program.For an example, I have figured out how to open a program with python code by doing so:With this example code I am opening an sqlite3 (I know there is an sqlite3 library in Python - I am trying to understand OS right now.)How could execute following command with this open file?I would appreciate if you would explain a logic to me in brief. Thank you.
First, os.system is no longer recommended. Use the subprocess module instead.To open a programm with subprocess use:With Popen you can also use PIPE to communicate with the process via stdin. E.g.:Documentation about Popen, subprocess module and communicate.
