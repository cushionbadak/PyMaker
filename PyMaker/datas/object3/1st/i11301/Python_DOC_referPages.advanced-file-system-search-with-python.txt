Natural Text
I'd like to create a Python script that will make some file searches recursively based on extension and file date. The most simple way (to me) to specify the requirements is this SQL like statement:Any ideas on what is the simpliest solution?
You will have to piece a solution together from Python's various facilities.I like to use os.walk for traversing a file system recursively.os.path.getctime() can get the creation time (as epoch time) of a given file. You can use the time module to get the date from there. I would use a dictionary to link dates to lists of files.
