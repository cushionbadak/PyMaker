I have stored the output of my curl command into a string variable using Python. and now after this I want to transfer this to a file. Can you please help me in this?My string variable is as belowI want to store this content in a file andextract only logstash-xxx-2016.05.18 from each line and write only this to another file.
This will write the result to a file called 'write_file.txt' and the stings matching 'logstash-xxx-xxxx.xx.xx' line-by-line to a file called 'write_logs.txt':
