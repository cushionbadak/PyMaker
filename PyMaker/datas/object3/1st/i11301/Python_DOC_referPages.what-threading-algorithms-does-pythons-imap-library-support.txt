The documentation for IMAP4.thread() in the imaplib library saysThe thread command is a variant of search with threading semantics for the results. Returned data contains a space separated list of thread members.Thread members consist of zero or more messages numbers, delimited by spaces, indicating successive parent and child.Thread has two arguments before the search_criterion argument(s); a threading_algorithm, and the searching charset.It's not clear to me what to use for the threading_algorithm argument. The documentation doesn't indicate a default value, and the source code for the IMAP4.thread() functiondoesn't give me any ideas either, even after digging into the _simple_command helper function.What should I use for this argument? Is there documentation elsewhere for this?
This depends on the server; the CAPABILITIES response should tell you what threading algorithms the server supports, under the THREAD= keys.For example:This server supports the ORDEREDSUBJECT and REFERENCES algorithms.The description of the baseline algorithms is indicated in the IMAP SORT and THREAD RFC.imaplib is a very low level library, you will need to parse the responses yourself.
