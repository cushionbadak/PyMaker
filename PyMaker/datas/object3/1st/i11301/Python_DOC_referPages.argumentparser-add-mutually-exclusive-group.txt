Natural Text
I came across this method in Python:In the description, it mentioned:What does a mutually exclusive group mean in this context? Is there a simple example that clarifies this?Thanks.
The documentation has an explanation (emphasis mine):Create a mutually exclusive group. argparse will make sure that only one of the arguments in the mutually exclusive group was present on the command line.
