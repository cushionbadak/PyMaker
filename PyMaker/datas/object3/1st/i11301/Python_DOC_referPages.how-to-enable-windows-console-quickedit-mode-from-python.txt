I'd like to force QuickEdit Mode in the console when running a python script and then disable it right before terminating. Is there a way to do that?
You can use ctypes to call GetConsoleMode and SetConsoleMode. ctypes definitions:The following wraps the underlying WinAPI functions as get_console_mode and set_console_mode. I've limited the wrappers to operating on just the console's active input buffer or active output buffer, i.e. \\.\CONIN$ and \\.\CONOUT$. I think this is simpler than having to worry about file descriptors and handles. Notably sys.stdin and sys.stdout may be redirected elsewhere, as may also be the case for the C runtime's standard I/O FILE streams, file descriptors, and the Windows standard handles that you can get from GetStdHandle. In these cases you can still open CONIN$ and CONOUT$, as long as the process is attached to a console.update_console_mode combines the latter functions to let you pass in the flags you want to set and the mask of flags to modify. This includes flags to clear. It also allows restoring the previous mode by registering an atexit function.Example:
