I am implementing a class in which I want an attribute to never be deleted i.e. del myClass.immortal_attr. What Exception is acceptable to raise for when the user attempts to do this?None of the builtin exceptions seemed obvious to me, it doesn't feel like I should need to implement a custom Exception class. Something like DeleteError seems like a fairly universal need.
Raise an AttributeError, just like the types that come with Python do:Incidentally, implementing your attribute with a property might be a good way to achieve what you're trying to do.
I believe AttributeError might work for what you are trying to do, but you could also create your own custom exception if that doesn't quite suit what you want to do.This site might be able to help you figure out how to create a custom exception. https://www.codementor.io/python/tutorial/how-to-write-python-custom-exceptions
