This question already has an answer here:Splitting a string using space delimiters and a maximum length                    3 answers                Im looking for a way to "cut" a string that comes from an html input into 4 variables, depending on the length of the original string. I need to do this because i want to show the string on the RaspberryPi LCD-Display. Because the LCD can only show 20 Letters per row, i thought about putting the rest of the string into another variable.Right now my Pythoncode looks like this.The Part with espeak works perfect. The display output only works if the string contains less than 20 letters.So basically i just want to split TextA into TextA1 TextA2 TextA3 and TextA4.I thought about doing it with but i dont really know how to get further with this.Thank you very much in advance.

If you don't need proper word wrapping, try a comprehension like this:output:
