I have been attempting to upgrade argparse on Ubuntu 16.04 to the latest version, but pip keeps saying that it is part of the standard library.How can this package be upgraded?Thanks.
Argparse is maintained as a separate package here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparseWhich is where pip is going to collect it.ButAs of Python >= 2.7 and >= 3.2, the argparse module is maintained  within the Python standard library. For users who still need to  support Python < 2.7 or < 3.2, it is also provided as a separate  package....So, you are getting the error because it is part of the standard library, but also available to install via pip if you are using a version of Python for which it isn't.If you really need to install 1.4.0 try this: (worked for me on my Windows 2.7.11 install)Download the gzip file, not the wheel, from the pypi downloads pageUncompress the archive and open a terminal in the argparse-1.4.01 folderRun python setup.py install (See the 'Install' section of first link)And check you now have the correct version (hopefully):Note:This still leaves the original argparse.py (in ...Python27\Lib for me) intact, and places the 1.4.0 egg in site-packages, with an easy-install.pth file which I presume ensures that this version gets used in preference to the standard library one.
