I am trying to use os.path.basename(path) on a string. I thought that was how it was used. In the doc for version 3 it clearly says that is the case but I am using 2.7. How do I use the method if all I have is a string (which clearly don't have a path attribute?)
You probably have overridden os with your own variable.Something like this:Make sure you don't shadow imported libraries.
