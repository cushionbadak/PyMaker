Is there an inbuilt module to search for a file in the current directory, as well as all the super-directories?Without the module, I'll have to list all the files in the current directory, search for the file in question, and recursively move up if the file isn't present. Is there an easier way to do this?
Well this is not so well implemented, but will workuse listdir to get list of files/folders in current directory and then in the list search for you file. If it exists loop breaks but if it doesn't it goes to parent directory using os.path.dirname and listdir.if cur_dir == '/' the parent dir for "/" is returned as "/" so if cur_dir == parent_dir it breaks the loop
import glob and use glob.glob('your_pattern_or_name_of_file')You can see documentation on glob herehttps://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html
Here is an example that will find all the .csv files in a specified directory "path" and all its root directories and print them:If you want to start at one directory and work your way through the parents then this would work for finding all the .csv files (for example):
I would say you could use glob.glob() to find for all the files you are looking for.The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order. From the docs -glob.glob(pathname, *, recursive=False) Return a possibly-empty list  of path names that match pathname, which must be a string containing a  path specification. pathname can be either absolute (like  /usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile) or relative (like ../../Tools/*/*.gif),  and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken symlinks are included in  the results (as in the shell).Say, our objective is to find all text files from a directory, its sub -directories and its parent directory.Use os.walk() or os.chdir() to get to the directory you want to work with. So I went to my current working directory and from there could access ALL text files with  this code snippet - I get all text files(54) from all the subdirectories. This output just shows a few - To get text files from parent directory(and its immediate sub directories) simply change this to arr=glob.glob('..\*\*.txt')
Just wrote this to find the "images" directory, note '/' is Linux style
The parent question was to walk parent directories (not descend into children like the find command):Here's a version that uses shell globbing to match multiple files:
