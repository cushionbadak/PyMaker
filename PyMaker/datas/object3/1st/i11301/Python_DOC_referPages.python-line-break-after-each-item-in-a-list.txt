Natural Text
I have an empty list and a loop. The loop's results append to the empty list. The list is then emailed to me but it comes in the form of ['item1', 'item2] I would like this list to be formatted like so:My code looks something like this:check_broken_links()When I remove str and do msg = '\n'.join(list) I get an error because I am combining int and str as seen in this line results = r.status_code, r.url leaving str returns every iterable in one line, so that's no good either.psstill working on my mail function, it's a bit sloppy, but it sends.
To resolve the str.join on a list of numbers, run a list comprehension to convert:
When you build the text for the email, convert the list to a string with newlines like thisIf you're sending an html email, you may have to do this
