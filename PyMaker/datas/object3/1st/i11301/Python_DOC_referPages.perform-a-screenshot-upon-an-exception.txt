Hey is there a way to capture a screenshot upon a an Exception, any Exception. My 'failed' solution which is placed in the BaseTestCase, unittest.TestCase subclass:Originally it was AssertionError instead of the Exception but it would only catch assertion errors and I'm more interested in other kinds of errors
To take a screenshot when an error or failure occurs, check if there is an exception currently being handled in the tearDown method:You could also override the methods TestResult.addError and TestResult.addFailure:
You can use decorators to catch if your test case functions raise an exception.To do this you would first need to create a decorator function that returns the function that you want your test cases to be wrapped in like the example below.Then for the test cases you want to get screenshots for you would just need to add the decorator above your test cases.
It's better to save log from your exception into the file than taking a screenshot. For practice check this code:As you can see, it's possible to catch (and print) error message. Try using open() instead of print() to simply save error message into the file. Here's an example:This is the most simple solution to your problem.Also, it's not wise to catch any exceptions that may occur. Better try to catch 2, 3 that are most likely to occur.
You're looking for a try/except statement:
