I am following TreeHouse tuple tutorials for Python 3 and I got this error for the following code:How should I fix it and why is my solution wrong?I have used zip and it didn't pass the challenge:
You do not need nested cycles. Try this code:Or another the shortest variant, I guess: zip(iter1, iter2)[(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)]
Youcan use zip to get the answer.
You just need to zip those iterables together:This function returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The returned list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument sequence.Since, your iterables has same length, this should work as expected for you.UPDATE: for python 3Just for completeness sake, It is not mentioned in the question which python version is being used. if you are using python3, then zip will return an iterable, so you need to convert it to list explicitly:
The following works too (the other answers were missing to convert it to a list):
