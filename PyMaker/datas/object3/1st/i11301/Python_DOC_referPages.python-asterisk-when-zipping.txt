I'm a newbie with python and I don't understand why doesn't the following work:since I'm getting while I should add an asterisk liketo obtain the result I want, i.e.I thought * was meant to convert the list to a tuple, what am I getting wrong?
If you have time you can read this post, it's good resource to understand how * works in Python.The asterisk in Python unpacks augment to function, please refer to herewill be same as:** in dictionary does similar work as * in list.
zip expects multiple arguments, like this:If you want to use only one argument, then use the * because it has the effect of breaking it up into multiple arguments:The * does not convert lists to tuples. It unpacks lists (documentation).
