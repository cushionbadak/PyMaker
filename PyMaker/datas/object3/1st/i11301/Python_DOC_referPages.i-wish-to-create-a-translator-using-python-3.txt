I am looking to create a translator with Python that converts English into Morse Code.  I was able to get it working but would like to improve it.Here is what I have:print (morse['G'])Now this works fine, but I would like for it to prompt me with a question such as "What would you like to translate?" and then have someone type (as a example) "This will will be converted to Morse Code".  and have whatever is typed converted.  Does anyone know a way to do this? it seems like such a hassle to type  "print (morse['G'])" for each letter.
You can prompt users for input using the raw_input (python 2) or input (python 3) functions.The input to these functions is the prompt that is displayed, and the function returns what is entered. This function will return to you a string. I'll leave it up to you to learn how to break the string into its characters. Also, what if an input is not a capital letter or a number (e.g. a lower case number, or a '\')? Be sure to utilize google to figure out the rest, this question has been asked many, many times.
