is there a way of passing a field of an array of collections into a function so that it can still be used to access a element in the collection in python?. i am attempting to search through an array of collections to locate a particular item by comparing it with an identifier. this identifier and field being compared will change as the function is called in different stages of the program. is there a way of passing up the field to the function, to access the required element for comparison? this is the code that i have tried thus far:code ...
In your code, M_work is a list. Lists are accessed using an index and this syntax: myList[index]. So that would translate to M_work[place] in your case. Then you say that M_work stores objects which have fields, and you want to access one of these fields by name. To do that, use getattr like this: getattr(M_work[place], field). You can compare the return value to identifier.Other mistakes in the code you show:place is misspelled pace at one point.True is misspelled true at one point.The body of your loop always returns at the first iteration: there is a return in both the if found == True and else branches. I don't think this is what you want.You could improve your code by:noticing that if found == True is equivalent to if found.finding how you don't actually need the found variable.looking at Python's for...in loop.
