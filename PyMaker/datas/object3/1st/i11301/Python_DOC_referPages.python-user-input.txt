I'm trying to come up with a simple calculator that takes a user's input and does a calculation but it keeps throwing out errors. Output:Any help would be appreciated.Thanks
Thrustmaster's answer is correct:You are taking an input, which is a string, no matter what is entered as input, then you are trying to perform a math operation with a string and an integer. you need to convert your strings to ints or call them as ints when you are performing your math functions. example one:Example 2You will also need to check to make sure that what you are getting back will evaluate to integer, less you want more errors.. first thing you should do is strip spaces from you inputthen you should ensure that your input(string values) are numbers.Alternatively, there are more pythonic ways to perform the answer I have given, but I think the answer is appropriate for you currentlyyou should be able to work with that..read the docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/
You are comparing a string against an integer.You should do (with all the variables):and then compare the way you are doing currently.
