If I have an array a, I understand how to slice it in various ways. Specifically, to slice from an arbitrary first index to the end of the array I would do a[2:].But how would I create a slice object to achieve the same thing? The two ways to create slice objects that are documented are slice(start, stop, step) and slice(stop). So if I pass a single argument like I would in a[2:] the slice object would interpret it as the stopping index rather than the starting index.Question: How do I pass an index to the slice object with a starting index and get a slice object that slices all the way to the end? I don't know the total size of the list. 
Use None everywhere the syntax-based slice uses a blank value:is equivalent to:Similarly, someseq[:10:2] can use a preconstructed slice defined with slice(None, 10, 2), etc.
