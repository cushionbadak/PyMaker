I wrote a python(3.5) script that creates backup of my files in zip archive and it works well. I use windows and I installed zip command from GnuWin32 for this project. But I want to use Python's Zipfile library instead. How can I modify my code?
This might be a good start:
Change zip_command = "zip -r {0} {1}".format(target,''.join(source))to the python zip file. Something like zip_command = "zip.py -r {0} {1}".format(target,''.join(source))
