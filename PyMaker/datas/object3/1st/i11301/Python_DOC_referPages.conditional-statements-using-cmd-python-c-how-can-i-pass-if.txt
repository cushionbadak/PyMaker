I have written a batch script that prompts the user for an input and displays the help for a specific library ExternalLibrary. However, I receive the error below the code sample.A working version can be achieved by replacing the if statement with:Error in the column that starts with ifFootnotes1. I am note sure whether I should pass &, \n, or ; as newline2. These related answers are not satisfying as they use workarounds.
Only simple statements can be written on single line separated by semicolonsThis was more interesting than it seemed. For the sake of unambiguity you can't write conditional or any other compound statement on semicolon separated single line.Simple statementsCompound statementsYour optionsRewrite it all to PythonThis should not be so hard. Use sys.argv for arguments andinstead of yoursys.argvgetattrUse linefeedsWrite multiline Python script on one cmd line. You can do it using !LF! special.
