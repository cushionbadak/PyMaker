I try to initialize class usingtsf = TimeSeriesFeature(cut_avg, interval)but I got TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'namespace'. The init code of TimeSeriesFeature is below:and BasicFeature init code:and I'm using python3.5. Is there any mistake?
The error you're getting is from the fact that instantiation of metaclass does not use it's __init__ method, but rather it's __new__ method which (excluding self) expects 3 arguments, last being said namespace.As it stands now your class inherits from ABCMeta (which is a metaclass), therefore it is also a metaclass:but I think you'd rather set ABCMeta as a metaclass of your class:That way your class becomes an ordinary class, with ABCMeta as it's metaclass.If you'd like BasicFeature to be a abstract (in other words impossible to initialize) class, add an abstract method to it, like this:and overload it in subclass without the @abstractmethod decorator:Then, users who attempt to instantiate BasicFeature will get an error about get_avg() being abstract, but users who instantiate TimeSeriesFeature will not. More details available in the documentation
