I generate bits of (C++) code using format strings such asFormat strings are nice for this, but is there a way to make them keep the indentation level for {doc} here?  It's typically multiline.I know I can just indent the string corresponding to doc by two spaces, I know there are plenty of functions to this end, but that's not what I'm asking: I'm looking for something that would work without tweaking the strings I pass.
Now that you've posted your own answer and clarified at little more about what you want. I think it would be slightly better to implement it by defining your own str subclass that extends the way strings can be formatted by supporting a new conversion type, 'i', which must be followed by a decimal number representing the level of indentation desired.Here's an implementation that works in both Python 2 & 3:Output:
The issue is this:The backslash will ignore all whitespaces up to the next character. Remove the backslash.
I'm looking for something which is light-weight on the caller site.  I can live with the following compromise: I use the fact that format strings are allowed to query for attributes (0.foo) or items (0['foo']) to pass the indentation level in the format string.that gives:I'd be happy to read opinions about that.
