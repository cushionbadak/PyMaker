Using Python 3.5, why does all tests below pass when run? Since, an Exception is not raised when div is called, how come that assertRaises() doesn't complain? According to the documentation for assertRaises(): "or fails if no exception is raised".Can someone help me out?
Because you have called div with wrong signature and exceptions was raised prior calling div (actual body of  div wasn't executed, exception was raised prior execution).To get more clear picture of what's going on try to raise ZeroDivisionError from div and replace assertRaises(Exception, ... to assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError, ... within your test cases.
An exception is raised when you call self.div() because you've defined the div method outside of the MyTest class.   That's why it's a good idea to also verify the exception message in your test:
You can also use:self.assertRaises(Exception, lambda: div(2, 0))
