Im trying to write a program that will determine the average of a number tests. The number of tests will vary, but I do not want it to be initially set by user input. I'm want to use a while loop and a sentinel value of zero to stop the input. I would like the average to display to three decimal places, with the % symbol immediately following the final digit as shown below...SAMPLE RUN:Enter test score 80Enter test score 70Enter test score 90Enter test score 88Enter test score 0The average is 82.000%
total += entry should be inside while loop, because you want to add it for every entry received.hope that helped :)
While needs to be all lowercase.if entry == 0 is missing a colon.total += entry and counter += 1 need to be inside the loop since they must happen with every iteration.Did you try running the code you had before posting here?
I see at least these two options:1. store the values in an array and then, after the loop, calculate the average.2. compute the average iteratively on each loopIf you are expecting a significant number of inputs I would go for option (2).Regarding the formatting, this may be helpful: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings
It doesn't look like you even tried, because your code as is in not able to run at all. However, here is the answer.  You'll want to store the results in a list, then get the average by the sum of the list over the length of the list (number of scores).  the .format method allows you to specify 3 decimal places.
The following should work.The average is computed by taking the sum of the list of scores and dividing it by the total number of elements in scores. The rest is just logic to ensure that the user inputs numeric scores and exit when the user enters nothing (just presses Return with no text).
