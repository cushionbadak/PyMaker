I'm not quite understand what this code mean:This code is inside a member function of a class, please refer to https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/engine/topology.py line 341.When I step into the self(x), it jumps to another member function __call__ of this class. Why does this happen? Thanks.
__call__() is one of the special methods in Python. It allows classes to emulate function types.self is probably --as by convention-- the first argument to your member function, i.e. the instance of the object the method is called on.self() thus uses the current instance object as a function. By definition, this means that the __call__() method on the object will be invoked, which is exactly what happens.
