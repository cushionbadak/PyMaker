I am really new to python and pandas, I am trying to execute a python script using arguments in the command line but I got an error, here is my scriptAnd I got the following error: KeyError: u'no item named file.out', any help would be apreciatedMy command line statement is: merge_files.py file1.out file2.out col1 col3 test 
sys.argv[0] is the name of the script, i.e. merge_files.py. You can see this by inserting print(sys.argv) at the beginning of your script. Try increasing all your indices by 1.
The first argument sys.argv[0] is the name of the script. sys.argv:  The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script.  argv[0] is the script name (it is operating system dependent whether  this is a full pathname or not).Please look here for more details.This should work.
increase all your indexes by 1, because sys.argv[0] - is a name of the python script.I.e.and so on
