Natural Text
With a url such as https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Fetty+Wap&amp;fr=fp-tts&I am using as a search pattern.I want to pick any url like the yahoo url above, but I want to capture the url up to the literal ? in the actual url.In other words I want to extract the url up to ?, knowing that all the urls I'm parsing don't have the ? character. In such a case I need to capture all of the url.The above regex works and extracts the url but goes to the end of the url. How can I get it to stop at the first ? it encounters, and keep going to the end if it doesn't encounter a ?
Regex is really the wrong tool for the job. Doing a basic string split will get you exactly what you want.If you really wanted wanted to use regex I suppose you could fo the following:
Bobble bubbles solution above worked very well for me; "You can try like this by use of negated class: ]*?href="(http[^"?]+)"<- bobbles answer. url looks like this https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Justin+Bieber&fr=fp-tts&fr2=p:fp,m:tn,ct:all......or it could be something like this https://www.yahoo.com/style/5-joyful-bob-ross-tees-202237009.htmlobjective was to extract full url if there was no literal ? in it, but if it did to stop just before the literal ?.was Bobble Bubbles answer and works very cleanly, does what I wanted done, Again thank you for everyone in participating in this discussion, really appreciate it.
I agree with other answer, that using regexp here is not a solution, especially because there my be any number of parameters before opening of the <a> tag and href parameter, there can be a new line in between too.but, answering to the initial question:'*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy - they match as much text as possiblethat's why there are non-greedy versions of them:'*?', '+?' and '??'
