My existing code (a section) is loacted at the bottom of this post.What I would like to do is extract all of the files from a directory inside of a zip file. Not the whole contents of a zip file, just the files in a directory (/theme_files/) that's inside of a zip. I have already imported the neccesary libraries.Extract the files from [filename].tpk/theme_files into ./workspace/[output]/(.tpk = .zip)

Search the file names in the specific subfolders with regex. + Extract them file by file:
