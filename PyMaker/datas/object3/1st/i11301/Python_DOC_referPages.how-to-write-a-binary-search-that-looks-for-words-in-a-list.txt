I was wondering how to write a binary search that looks for the most popular baby names from 2009 - 2014, the names are stored in a list and then I when I receive a prompt asking for what i would like to search for then i would type in the name and it would give how many times it iterated over to find the certain name, and also the names are in JSON format and alphabetical so i can compare characters.I'm planning to write this in python 3. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Why do you need to use a binary search? What if you used collections.Counter?Just pass your list (doesn't matter if it's sorted or not) of baby names to Counter and then lookup whatever name you're interested in:If you want the most popular name, you can use Counter.most_common():
