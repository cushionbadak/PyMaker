I would like to know if there is an easy way to do some identical edits on several methods of a class. An example :I know that I can also overwrite each method but in a situation with tens of methods, that will be a little boring...So I tried this :That almost works but setName is not anymore a method. It's an attribute which contains a function. I completely understand why but I'm trying to get a cleaner result. With that result, I risk of having problems later. For example I can't use the library pickle with that object (got the error _pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <function TalkingDog.__init__.<locals>._newMethod at 0x00000000003DCBF8>: attribute lookup _newMethod on __main__ failed).
The Pythonic way to do this is probably to use the descriptor protocol, which is also what properties use:Output:Note that this only gives feedback when the new value is different to the old one - you can tweak the behaviour as needed in __set__. It also means you can directly read from and assign to foo.bar, rather than needing to call getters and setters (what is this, Java?)
since decorator could explicit called here a way to use it:
