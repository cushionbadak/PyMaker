Natural Text
I have a stringline = "haha (as jfeoiwf) avsrv arv (as qwefo) afneoifew"From this I want to remove all instances of "(as...)" using some regular expression. I want the output to look likeline = "haha avsrv arv afneoifew"I tried:But this yields:line = "haha  afneoifew"
To get non-greedy behaviour, you have to use *? instead of *, ie re.sub(r'\(+as .*?\) ','',line). To get the desired string, you also have to add a space, ie re.sub(r'\(+as .*?\) ','',line).
The problem is that your regexp matches this whole group : (as jfeoiwf) avsrv arv (as qwefo), hence your result.You can use :Hope it'll be helpful.
You were very close. You need to use lazy quantifier '?' after .*. In default it will try to capture biggest group it possibly can. With lazy quantifier it'll actually try to match smallest possible groups.
