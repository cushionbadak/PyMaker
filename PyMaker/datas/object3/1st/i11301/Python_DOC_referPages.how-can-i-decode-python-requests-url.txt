This question already has an answer here:Python-Requests, extract url parameters from a string                    2 answers                I know if I want to send an HTTP request, I can form it as a dictionary before sending it:Does it do the opposite as well? If my request happens to redirect me to another URL, I can see where I was redirected with:But if that URL happens to be something like:and I happen to want to pull out the vartwo from that URL (the string 3451), does the requests module provide any easy way to do this just by specifying that I want the value of "vartwo"? Another dictionary, or mapping object of some sort perhaps? Or is my only option to use urllib.unquote to decode the url, and parse it as a string?
Use urlparse module (Python 2.x; in Python 3.x, it was renamed to urllib.parse).
