I'm confused with HttpRequest object in Django. I know that the AuthenticationMiddleware will add a user to request which is an instance of HttpRequest. And the code is here, but what I want to show is as follow:request.user = SimpleLazyObject(lambda: get_user(request))I have read the code of HttpRequest object and can not find a user attribute and its code don't have a __setattr__ method. So I'm curious about why the code do not raise an AtrributeError when access to a no existing attribute.Thanks for giving help.
HttpRequest is a class which inherits from object. In Python attributes can be set on objects at any time.HttpRequest describes a HTTP request, which in its normal state does not include any data about the user. That is why the AuthenticationMiddleware adds user to the request.__setitem__ is the method for setting indexed items on an object.__setattr__ is the method for setting an attribute on an object, and is one of the methods implemented in object.UPDATEAs @sayse said that is getting.
