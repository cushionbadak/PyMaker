I have a list of strings and i would like to pick a specific number of characters from each string (list entry). I found a bit about slicing strings but I have no idea how to make it work with lists. Also i have no idea if this is the method to go with at all.Example:I have a list and i would like to extract the first two characters of each string ('ab', 'ef', 'ij', 'mn') and put them in another list.Any help is appreciated.edit:It works now but I have trouble printing the list before slicing. Here's the complete code (the random part doesn't seem to work as well):It prints S just fine but tells me that L is not defined. The weird thing is that it shows S as undefined as well but it still works.Also i can't seem to to get the portion where i pick random entries to work. D doesn't show up at all.
