I have looked around the site and I can't find out how to get an output I just keep on getting the same error:I can't figure out why I keep on getting this error any help will be a appreciated!If needed, here is the full error:EDIT:Code is now as followsThis Code now has the same exact error but the last line is now:
You only pass positional arguments to the Request constructor:Given the init signature of Request (documentation):you are passing a URL string as url  (good!)the integer '518' as data  (bad: should be a dict!)last but not least - the list '[2]' as headers (bad: should be a dict!)Well, you guessed it: headers must be a dict of header-name, header-value pairs. In the __init__, the header dict's .items() method is called, which fails appropriately for the list that you pass in.
