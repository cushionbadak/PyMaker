I have python script, which has code.When I run bandit it gives error.Then I do some google, and found that, I have to sanitized my input and with shlex.split and shlex.quote I can sanitize it.I changed my code to.But still I get same error, is there any way to remove this error when run bandit -r mypackage/myfile.py 
So, user enter command which he want to runIf the user already may run any command including bash then the bandit 's warning about shell=True is not applicable.The warning would make sense if the user were allowed only to choose some parameters for a fixed command e.g.,  a search query for a grep command:whatever user-specified query is; it won't make it to run some other command (only grep is run).Compare it with shell=True:A user could pass query = "a' /dev/null; rm -rf '" that would produce  grep -e 'a' /dev/null; rm -rf '' 'path' command. shell=True allows a user to run an arbitrary command in this case even if it is not intended. It is called a shell injection.You could call pipes.quote(query), to avoid naive attacks but it may fail in the general case that is why shell=True should be avoided if the input is not from a trusted source.
