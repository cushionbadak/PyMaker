I have a DataFrame that looks like this:I want to get the top 3 rows (according to value) preferably per date. I'm expecting something like this:but I'm ok also with this:I tried df.nlargest(3, 'value') but I get this weird result:I tried running it day by day:[df.ix[day].nlargest(3, 'value') for day in df.index.unique()]but I got the same problem (each name is duplicated 3 times) 
To start, this will get the job done:
Use [:n] slice of sort_values() resultUse sort_values() in descending mode and take the first n results in a slice, then use sort_index() to keep the days monotonically increasing.
