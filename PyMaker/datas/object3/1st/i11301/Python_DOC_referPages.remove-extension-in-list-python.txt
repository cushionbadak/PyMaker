I have the following code whereby I would like to find all files in a certain folder (this folder contains .TIF files), then store these names in a .txt file which works so far. However, I don't want the extensions, of anything that would be in the folder.After comments, especially thanks to ShadowRanger, I changed it to the following which produced the same effect. Thank you everyone!:
Remove the extension in a generator expression when you get the filenames with os.path.splitext. Change:to:Update: It looks like you're abusing os.walk to do file from directory separation (since you break in the first loop, so you're not actually walking a tree at all), when there are more direct ways to do this. You can replace all of this:on Python 3.5+ (or any version of Python after installing the third party scandir package using scandir.scandir instead of os.scandir), with the more succinct and somewhat faster:which describes what you really want, and by using os.scandir, guarantees you don't have to individually stat each entry in the directory listing to check if it's a file.If you're on older Python, and can't use the scandir package, at the cost of a stat (which os.walk would pay anyway on older Python), you can do:
Replace this line:with something like this:or even simpler: More info on what os.path.splitext but it essentially splits the filename into 2 pieces. The first is the root, which is what you want.
