I just started python today..  Spent hours on codeacademy and learnt quite a bit so I thought I'd make my own program to square the ages of a person and their sibling. Very basic just a starter. Pretty useless actually just wanted to see what I can do.  I keep getting this TypeError mentioned in the title. Here's my code :Please helpThanks!! 
First and foremost, if you're just starting, you really should be learning Python 3, not 2. The code you posted has many issues. Here's a line-by-line breakdown, with corrections in Python 3:You need to use either single quotes ' or double quotes ", but not two single quotes to define strings. Try:There is no raw_input() in Python 3, it's just input(). This function also returns a string, so if you want to do math on it you need to call int() to turn the result into an integer.As long as a and b are ints, the first two parts of the expression are fine, but you need to remember that all operations in Python are explicit, so you'll need to fix the last part like so:Now for the last part:Python is case-sensitive. Since you used Square above, you'll need to use the same capitalization down here. Likewise, builtin keywords and functions are all in lowercase (if, else, print(), etc.). Finally, in Python 3 print is a function, not a statement, so you'll need parentheses ( ) around your arguments:So, here's your complete Python 3 code:
