So I've never been really good with multi threading and today I'm bumping into a problem I've been trying to dodge for quite some time.I want to pass a variable to a function that I execute in multiple threads but I have no clue how to do that in a functional manner.Here is what I made : And this is the class : And this is the error I'm getting : I'd be glad if someone couldn't enlighten me on what I'm doing wrong. Thanks in advance guys!
You should read more about the Classes in python.You forgot to define the payload parameter in the constructor of your Thread implementation.It's just simple as this:And if you do not need some extra stuff in your own Thread implementation you could simply do this:
TryToSolveItSimple's answer is correct, but it's worth noting that this is a very common pattern for which there is already a primitive:This will print the numbers 0 to 3 in parallel. The with closing part isn't strictly necessary for this to work, but like a file, a pool should be closed when you're done with it.
