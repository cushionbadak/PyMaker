Typing python -i file.py at the command line runs file.py and then drops into the python terminal preserving the run environment.https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.htmlIs there an equivalent in R?
I may be misinterpreting what python -i file.py does, but try:From inside R, at the terminal, you can do:and it will run file.R, with the global environment reflecting what was done in file.RIf you're trying to run from the command line, review this post
