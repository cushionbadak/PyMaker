My input file would look like this:I would like to get something like in java would be nested maps with the list of strings in the inner map structure.something like this:
The Python equivalent of a Java Map is a dict, and parsing such a simple input can be easily done with split.The simplest way I can think of is:You could omit the if statements using a defaultdict to make it a bit nicer.A remark: in these example even numeric keys are stored as strings. It might be desirable, but if not, you can simply convert them to integers using int when assigning the dict value.UpdateTo iterate over the "leafs" of yous nested dictionary, you can use the values method of dicts, which returns an iterator over the dictionary values:In python 2.7 and below using the itervalues method is recommended over values, as it returns an iterator instead of a list.Also, you can write a simple generator that loops over the values.Then you can doAnd you get some built-in functions for free, for example you can do
