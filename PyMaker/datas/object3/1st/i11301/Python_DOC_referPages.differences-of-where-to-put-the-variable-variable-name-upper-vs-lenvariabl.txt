Why in the methods len( ), the placement of variables different from the others, for example theupper( )Things may be trivial , it makes me uncomfortable if do not know it ... thanks.
variable_name.upper() is calling a method of the variable_name class or an inherited class.len(variable_name) is calling Python's built-in len function on a variable_name object for which the len function determines the length depending on the type of object, be it a str or list for example.So the placement of the variable_name tells you if you are calling a class attribute (variable_name in front) OR you are passing a variable into a method which is not an attribute of the variable_name class (variable_name in the brackets).
