Natural Text
Here is a simple client which connects and sends a text message:And here is the server which has to receive the message and echo it back:The problem is that server isn't reading anything. When I print self.buffer the output is:b''What am I doing wrong?
First of all, you need two handlers: One for the server socket (where you expect only accept), and one for the actual communication sockets. In addition, you can only call read once in handle_read; if you call it twice, the second call may block, and that's not allowed in asyncore programming. Don't worry though; if your read did not get everything, you'll immediately be notified again once your read handler returns.
