Natural Text
i am currently trying to do a regex on python that should match multiline.is my regular expression, this is my python callHowever when I use the Regex for example in Notepad++ it provides me with the proper matches whereas in python it does not match anything at all (here is an example string that is matched in npp but not in python)19.04.2016 01:59:18  ASDF---- FG 319.04.2016 01:59:21  ASDF---- FG 419.04.2016 01:59:22  ASDF---- FG 4I am also sure that there in fact is a \r\n since npp provides me with matches.Since I am using the multiline flag I have absolutely no idea why my regex won't work.
Note that in the corrected input shown, the part FG\s{3,}?4of the pattern avoids a match as a single space does not match between FGand the 4.gives me (unmodified with python 2.7.11 and 3.5.1):Edit: Here a version for the updated amended input samples as transcribed by @poke:Gives (as to be expected):
If your input contains a line break with \r\n and you correct the spacing after the 'FG' part, this should work:([0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{2}\.[0-9]{4}\s[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}).*?\r\n-{1,}\sFG\s+?4Tested here (with \n only for the line break):https://regex101.com/r/iT1rF2/2
Works for me:Note that I had to add explicit \r at the end of each line. You say that your text contains actual \r\n but please make sure thatâ€™s the case.If you are reading the content from a file, note that Python performs a newline normalization when you open a file. So you likely end up with only \n although the file originally contained \r\n.
Note that you could re-write your regex with shortcuts so that your pattern:becomes (shortcut and corrections):
