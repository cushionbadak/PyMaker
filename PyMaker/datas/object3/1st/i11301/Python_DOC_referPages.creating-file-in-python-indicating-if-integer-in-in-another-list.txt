I have a list of integers, say [2, 4, 9], then I need to create a csv file like this:Basically, for each integer, I need to check if the integer is in the list, if it is I write 1, otherwise 0.I could create a double list, do a for loop, check if the integer is in the list, and then append the (i,0) or (i,1) depending on whether i is in the list, but I am sure there is a far more efficient way to do this. These lists are big, a billion integers or so.I looked if there was something in numpy to help me, but could not find anything.
Use list comprehensions to create your data and use the module csv to write to a csv file.Since your data size is quite big, it is better to write to a file while creating, as shown below.
A linear time solution would be to simply check if the current number is literally "in" a list of integers.example:Output:
Assuming the list is sorted, you can use a generator function, which might be quite efficient.output: You should also be able to pass in another generator, as long as the output is incremental. So you can do bitstream(range(0, 10**8, 9**3)) or something like that.To write to a file, just loop over the bitstream:Using a generator could potentially save a lot of memory compared to some alternative implementations.
