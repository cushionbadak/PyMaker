I've created two modules in the same directory:There is no __init__.py, I don't want to create this as a package, I'm just creating a simple script which I have modularized by breaking into different modules.My intention is to run mod1.py using python mod1.pyAlthough I know that directly using import mod1 will work, but I'm deliberately not using it so that my module name doesn't clash with built in modules (which I felt is a good practice)I'm getting the following errors with python2 and python3Most of the questions like this on StackOverflow deal with packages, but I'm not using packages. I just want to run it as a simple script.My question is not about how to do it, but I want to know the reason behind the above not working. 
You shouldn't use relative, but absolute import:The documentation is pretty good, and this SO answers gives an alternative using importlib.If a handmade module clash with a builtin module, the proper way to go is probably to rename it, eventually through addition of a {pre,suf}fix.Another is to use importlib.The motivation underlying these limitation can be found in the PEP 328, and comes mainly from BDFL preferences, over all other solutions.
