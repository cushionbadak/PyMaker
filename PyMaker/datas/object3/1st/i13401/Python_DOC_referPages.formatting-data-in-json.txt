You're using Python 3, I presume.In Python 3, there are two string formats: str (sequences of Unicode code points) and bytes (sequences of bytes). For some reason (like having read the file in binary mode), you ended up with bytes instead of strings in your data object. These can neither be used as arguments to ','.join nor passed to json.dumps:You must first convert your bytes to unicode strings. If you already know the encoding (it's usually UTF-8), you can write e.g.:And then use either string joining or (preferably) the JSON library to convert them to a JSON string.EDIT: One reason why the data read from a file might be kept in bytes instead of Unicode is when you read from a file with the binary flag set, i.e. open(filename, 'rb') instead of open(filename 'r'). See the open function reference for more information on how to change the default encoding when reading the file.So, in the optimal case, the data is read from a text file into Unicode strings:And then converted to json:
