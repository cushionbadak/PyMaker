I'm totally new to Python, and I'm trying to run my server but I'm getting this syntax error from the project I'm working on.To be clear, I didn't write the code, I'm just supposed to style the project but I don't know how else to see the app without running it in the server.
This code appears to be using function annotations which are only available in Python 3.X. What version of Python are you using?
