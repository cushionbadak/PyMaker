This code kind of works but it keeps on giving me a pyramid instead of right aligned triangle.For example:I'm trying for something like this:Heres my code
The pyramid problem comes from two aspects:(1) You don't print anything at all in the first print; tryThis will give you a triangle, but with inserted spaces:To get rid of the intervening spaces, switch to a formatted print.  The simple print automatically gives a space between output fields.
To use no string addition or multiplication:However, I'd recommend using one of the following in order to avoid multiple nested loops.The following will print, for each row, height-row-1 spaces (which will start at 4 for the first row and go to 0 for the last) followed by row+1 asterisks (which will start at 1 for the first row and go to 5 for the last row):You can also use string methods. The rjust() method will right-justify the given string (in this case, the appropriate number of asterisks for the given row) in a fixed width field of height characters.Or string formatting, which works similarly to the method above only it uses the string formatting minilanguage:
