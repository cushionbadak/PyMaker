This question already has an answer here:Why does 1+++2 = 3?                    6 answers                I am new to python and I read that there is no ++ operator in Python but I am not able to understand the below code.
+ and - act as unary as well as binary operators. So,a ++ b is same as a + (+b)a -+ b is same as a - (+b)a -- b is same as a - (-b)a +- b is same as a + (-b)As can be seen below
This is not the ++ operator. Your code is interpreted as follows:Now since +3 is 3, the final result is 5. For fun, try the following:2++++++++++++++32+++++++++++++++++++++-8See Expressions for details.
