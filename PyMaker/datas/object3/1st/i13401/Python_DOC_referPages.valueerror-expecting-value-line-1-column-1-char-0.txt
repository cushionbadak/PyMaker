Checked the other answers for similar problems, but couldn't find anything that solved this particular problem.  I can't figure out why I'm getting error, because I don't believe I'm missing any values.  Also, I think it's odd that it says line 1 column 1 (char 0) - any of you wonderful people have any ideas?
you are trying to parse the response JSON. but you didn't event sent the request.you should send your Request and then parse the response JSON:
From what I've seen in both the docs (or v. 2) and at the URL above, the issue is that you are trying to parse JSON which is not JSON. I suggest wrapping your call to json.loads in a try... except block and handle bad JSON. This is generally good practice anyway.For good measure I looked up the source code for the json module. It looks like all errors from Py2k point to value errors, thought I could not find the specific error you mention.Based on my read of the JSON module, you'll also be able to get more information if you use try...except and print the properties of the error module as well.
