does python 3.5 provide functions that allow to test whether a givenargument would fit the type hints given in the function declaration?if i have e.g. this function:is there a python method that can check whetherfit the type hints?i know that 'no type checking happens at runtime' but can i still check thevalidity of these arguments by hand in python?or if python does not provide that functionality itself: what is the tool i'dneed to use?
Python itself doesn't provide such functions, you can read more about it here:I wrote a decorator for that. This is the code of my decorator:You can use it like that:Though it's not very pythonic to restrict your function to accept only one type. Though you can use abc (abstract base classes) like number (or custom abc) as type-hints and restrict your functions to accept not only one type, but whatever combination of types you want.Added a github repo for it, if anybody wants to use it.
This is an old question, but there is a tool I've written for doing run time type checking based on type hints: https://pypi.org/project/typeguard/
