Natural Text
I want to take create a dictionary from arg_list:E.g:This isn't working and gives me:I don't understand why.
You should use the standard argparse libraryHowever, if you don't want to, read on.Your main problem is that you iterate over every character in the string:We can split the string based on whitespace:Then for each argument strip the '--', and split on '=' to get the key value pairs:Then pass them to a dictionary constructor:You might want to clean up some of the values as the numbers will be strings, and the agency_id will be a string with the quotes included: "'FH'"
