I have Directory structure like thisnow I'm giving script.py a path as commandline argument of a file which is there in So basically I want to be able to give path in this way Here problem is that I might be given full path or relative path so I should be able to decide and based on that I should be able to create absolute path.I already have knowledge of functions related to path. Question 1Question 2Reference questions are giving partial answer but I don't know how to build full path using the functions provided in them. 
Use os.path.isabs to judge if input path is absolute or relative, if it is relative, then use os.path.join to convert it to absolute
try  os.path.abspath, it should do what you want ;)Basically it converts any given path to an absolute path you can work with, so you do not need to distinguish between relative and absolute paths, just normalize any of them with this function.Example:It will output the absolute path to your file.EDIT:If you are using Python 3.4 or newer you may also use the resolve() method of pathlib.Path. Be aware that this will return a Path object and not a string. If you need a string you can still use str() to convert it to a string.Example:
For Python3, you can use pathlib's resolve functionality to resolve symlinks and .. components.You need to have a Path object however it is very simple to do convert between str and Path.I recommend for anyone using Python3 to drop os.path and its messy long function names and stick to pathlib Path objects.
A practical example:sys.argv[0] gives you the name of the current scriptos.path.dirname() gives you the relative directory namethus, the next line, gives you the absolute working directory of the current executing file. cwd = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0]))Personally, I always use this instead of os.getcwd() since it gives me the script absolute path, independent of the directory from where the script was called.
