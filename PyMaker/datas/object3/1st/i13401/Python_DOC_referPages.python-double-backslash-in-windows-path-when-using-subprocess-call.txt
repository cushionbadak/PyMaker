I can't get this code to work.wherewhich, given my (probably wrong) use of normpath, dirname, and realpath, expand to the following paths:I suspect that passing those double backslashes to Windows is a problem. It certainly chokes on Note that appending .replace('\\\\', '\\') did not help.
Appending .__str__() to string paths that contain delimited backslashes should do the trick.For example:args.mscInputFilePath.__str__()Intuitively, that method gives you what you see when you call print() on something, and is the answer to the occasional desire on Windows where you may wish you could store the result of printing a string object.  There are good posts on the difference between __str__ and __repr__ for more context.
