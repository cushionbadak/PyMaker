RestrictedPython module has a restricted compiler in which you can compile code and customize some python features. For example, you can replace the builtin print function.That's what I need to do. I need to compile some code but defining my own print function. I can't use this restricted compiler because it has a lot of restrictions I don't need at now.Do you know any other compiler in which I can define my own print function?
Just use regular Python then; in Python 2 use:or use Python 3, and print() is then a function. You can redefine that function:Like any other built-in function you can define your own function using the same name. In the above example I used the __builtin__ / builtins module to access the original.If you are using exec(), you can pass in the print() function you defined as an extra name in the namespace you pass in:For Python 2, you do need to compile the code first to switch off the print statement and enable the print() function; use the compile() function to produce a code object to pass to the exec statement:I used the __future__ module to obtain the right compiler flag.
