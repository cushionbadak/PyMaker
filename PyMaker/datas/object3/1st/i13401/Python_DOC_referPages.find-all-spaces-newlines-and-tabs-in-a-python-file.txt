I'm trying to write a function which takes a filename as a parameter and returns the total number of all spaces, newlines and also tab characters in the file. I want to try use a basic for loop and if statement but I'm struggling at the moment :/ any help would be great thanks. 

Your current code doesn't work because you're combining loop syntax (for x in y) with a conditional  test (x == y) in a single muddled statement. You need to separate those.You also need to use just a single return statement, as otherwise the first one you reach will stop the function from running and the other values will never be returned.Try:The code in Joran Beasley's answer is a more Pythonic approach to the problem. Rather than having separate conditions for each kind of character, you can use the collections.Counter class to count the occurrences of all characters in the file, and just extract the counts of the whitespace characters at the end. A Counter works much like a dictionary.
To support large files, you could read a fixed number of bytes at a time:Outputmmap allows you to treat a file as a bytestring without actually loading the whole file into memory e.g., you could search for a regex pattern in it:Output
