Given a minimum and a maximum number, I would like to obtain a tuple of length n, with each element between minimum and maximum. For instance, if min is 10 and max is 20 and if n is 2, I would like to obtain [(10, 10), (10, 11), ..., (19, 19)]. I'm only interested in the combinations of numbers so if I already had (18, 19), I wouldn't need (19, 18).I can solve this with a tuple of length 2, but I'm not very sure how to extend this to tuples of length > 2. I'm thinking one method would be to convert each number to a string, then call the iterations.combinations function on it, and then convert it back to an integer. But that seems unnecessarily complex, and wondering if there is a more pythonic way to do it?
You are looking for combinations with replacement here:The with replacement part means that the values from the range are allowed to be used in more than one position in the output, so (10, 10) is valid output.Demo:
