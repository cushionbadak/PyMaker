How do I make an array of complex numbers in Python?In C++ STL we can write the following code:but in Python?
Extremely simple: Python's has both a native list and a native complex type, so:or justdoes the trick of creating one;creates thousand complex values in a list complexes.You might want to have a look at numpy:
Python has built-in support for complex numbers. You can just enter them like that:As for the container, in Python you can start with a list:Or you can use numpy.array, which would be more suited for numerical applications.
You just create the list of values:
You can use the built-in complex class.Or just use a complex literal: Python uses j for the imaginary unit.outputThe complex constructor also takes keyword arguments, so you can dowith the args in either order. And that also means that you can even pass the args in a dict, if you want:There's also a built-in cmath module for mathematical functions of complex arguments.
Actually, I want to sort numbers complex according to their module. This is my turn.
