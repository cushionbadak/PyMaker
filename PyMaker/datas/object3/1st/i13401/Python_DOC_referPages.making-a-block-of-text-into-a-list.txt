Natural Text
I am writing a Python script that enumerates all processes running on the computer. My current code does this but prints this out in a large block of text that is hard to read. How can I improve my script to have the output text in a vertical list for each process and all?*Edit: Here is the output text from the above script
set should already print with newlines, so if they're not showing up, something is more wrong than you're telling us. You could always double up the newlines if you want to split the settings apart, e.g.:If the problem is that you're running on Python 3 and the bytes object is a big blob, you can make subprocess decode it to a friendly printable string for you:For the general case of line wrapping nicely (though it does nothing for paragraphs of text that are just "too big"), you might want to look at the textwrap module; it splits a block of text up into a list of lines wrapped nicely at word boundaries so you don't have words split across lines.
set is an internal command that displays cmd.exe environment variables in your case.To get environment variables in Python, use os.environ instead.If you want to get the output of set command as a list of strings (not tested):
Disclaimer: I have not done what you are doing before but this might work.
