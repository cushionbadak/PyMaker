Natural Text
Say I have a text file that has the following data:if the name of the file is text.txt, I've tried doing this but it won't work:the first value should stay the same as 9.079... because there was nothing before it, but the next one should be 3.whatver because 12.974... - 9.079... = 3.whatever. It should keep doing that the whole way through. When I run the program, it just returns the exact same numbers that are in the text file. If someone could please help me with this I would really appreciate it. Thanks!
Change the previous_val in every iteration. Look at this:Output:
You never change the value of previous_val after assigning it a value of zero, so current_val = float(values - previous_val) is equivalent to current_val = float(values)You want:This assigns current_val to the difference and previous_val to the preceding current_val.

In python3 you can use itertools.accumulate to do want you want:It is pretty easy to implement accumulate, and a reference implementation is provided in the documentation
