I'm having problem using super commandwhenever i make an object it gives the following error
The super function will Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type so  when you want to use it you need to pass the parent name to it,and since here your w class inherit from s you might want to pass s to super:Also don't forget to pass the object to your parent class to make it a new style class :Read about new style and classic classes it in python documentation https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#new-style-and-classic-classes
Because you are using super on an old-style classIn Python 2.x (>= 2.2), there are two type of classes. Old style classes and new-style classes. In python 3.x, old-style classes are removed and all classes are new-style class. Python's build-in function super works properly on new-style classes.Simply, new-style classes extends object while old style classes not. Old Sytle ClassNew Style ClassSo, your classes which is not inherited from another class should be inherited from object to be a new style class.You can either use new-style or use old-skool inheritance __init__This is an example of old-style solution, but I do not flag this question as a duplicate because new-style class usage is encouraged and you should avoid using old-style classes.
