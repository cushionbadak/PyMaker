I am trying to write a simple command line program in Windows, but it doesn't look very nice. Is there a library to generate CLIs that look closer to something like GUIs?For example:I wasn't able to find a solution on the internet, yet. I don't want to make a real graphic window, I want to use the command line.
You cannot achieve the goal of placing graphical elements on the command line. Whether or not you are programming for Windows or Linux, command line (CLI) applications can only make use of very broad elements, like escape sequences that create bold, blink, and so on and crude areas on the screen where data can be entered. You can map control keys provided you have the right CLI library or toolkit, and you can prompt your users for something like "Do you want to run this program again (y/n) ?"and then if the answer is 'n', the program exits.I would search the links given to you in various comments on your OP and one of the answers to see how to program in curses. 
You can use curses to place text anywhere: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/curses.htmlFor a Windows variant, you can use unicursesKeep in mind this only lets you position the cursor on your window, it does not provide higher level modules to create buttons or widgets.
Finally i found an own solution. (No buttons sadly :(   )Take a look at this code based on termcolor module and colorama (colorama must be installed via pip)You can try it. Thanks to Filip Dupanovic who supported me with my question.
