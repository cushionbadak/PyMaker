You can use collections.Counter for this:From the docs:
https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/collections.html#counterfrom collections import CounterCounter(a).most_common(1)
Here is another one not using counter
There's two standard library ways to do this:statistics.mode:collections.Counter.most_common:Both are identical in terms of performance, but the first raises an exception when there is no unique most common element and the second returns the frequency as well.
