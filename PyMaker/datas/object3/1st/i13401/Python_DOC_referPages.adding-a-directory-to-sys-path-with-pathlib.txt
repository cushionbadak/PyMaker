I'm trying to add a directory to PATH wit code like this:It doesn't work. If I do print sys.path I see something like this:How should I fix this code? Is it normal to write str(PROJECT_DIR / 'apps')?
you need to append the path as a string to sys.path:PROJECT_DIR is instance of PosixPath which has all the goodies like / and parents etc. but you need to convert it to a regular string if you want to use is somewhere a string is expected - like sys.path.
why are you using this weird pathlib library instead of pythons perfectly good path utils?
