I couldn't make this dead simple example to run:
Running coroutines requires an event loop. Use the asyncio() library to create one:orAlso see the Tasks and Coroutines chapter of the asyncio documentation. If you already have a loop running, you'd want to run additional coroutines concurrently by creating a task (asyncio.create_task(...) in Python 3.7+, asyncio.ensure_future(...) in older versions).Note however that time.sleep() is not an awaitable object. It returns None so you get an exception after 1 second:In this case you should use the asyncio.sleep() coroutine instead:which is cooperates with the loop to enable other tasks to run. For blocking code from third-party libraries that do not have asyncio equivalents, you could run that code in an executor pool. See Running Blocking Code in the asyncio development guide.
If you already have a loop running (with some other tasks), you can add new tasks with:otherwise you might geterror.
