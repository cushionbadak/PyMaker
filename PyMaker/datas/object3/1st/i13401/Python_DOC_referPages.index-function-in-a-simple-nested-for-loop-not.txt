So here is the pretty basic code i am working with, it is a function that takes a grid in the form of a tuple of tuples. In the loop I have tried to make i the rows and q the columns for the grid. Here is what I get:and so on.I expecting and want to get 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, ... for i.index(q), am I not using this function correctly? This seems odd as grid.index(i) is working fine and when I printed q in the for q in i: loop I got the right values.     Any help appreciated!
tuple.index returns index of first occurrence of the given element:In order to iterate over elements along with their indices, you should use enumerate function:
You're using them perfectly. But they're not what you want to use.
