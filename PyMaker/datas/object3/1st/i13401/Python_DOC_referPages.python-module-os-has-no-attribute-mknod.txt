I want to create a new file in Python for that I am using mknod command, but getting error as:I am using windows and attributes other than 'mknod' are working.
os offers functionality that is closely related to the OS you're using. If most other attributes can be accessed from os (meaning you haven't got a os.py file in the current dir masking the standard module) an AttributeError will 99% signal an unsupported function on your Operating System.This is what the case is with os.mknod on Windows. Creating named pipes in Windows has, as far as I can understand, very different semantics.Either way, if you are trying to use mknod to create named pipes you'd probably be better using mkfifo() (again, only Unix supported) . If you're using it to create ordinary files, don't, use open() which is portable.
