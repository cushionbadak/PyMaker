The following example is very simple. I want to execute map() with a function which can raise Exception. It will be more clearly with an example : When I execute this code I get : It's due to the 0 in my list. I don't want remove this 0 (because in real case I can't know first if I will get Exception).Do you know how to continue mapping after the exception ?
you could catch the exception in your function (instead of in the for loop) and return None (or whatever you choose) if ZeroDivisionError is raised: if you choose to return None you need to adapt your format string; None can not be formatted with %f.other values you could return (and that would be compatible with your string formatting) are float('inf') (or float('-inf') depending  on the sign of your numerator) or float('nan') - "infinity" or "not a number".here you will find some of the caveats of using float('inf').
You can move the try/except block inside the function. Example -And then call this normally, without a try/except block -
