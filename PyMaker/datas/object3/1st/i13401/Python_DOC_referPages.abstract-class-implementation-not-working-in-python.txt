I am trying to implement an abstract class in python. Following is my code:This executes perfectly without giving any error. Is the main() not supposed to throw an error that I Can't instantiate abstract class Base with abstract methods value? What am I doing wrong? I am using python 3.4
You are using the Python 2.x method of defining metaclass , For Python 3.x you need to do the following -This was introduced through PEP 3115 - Metaclasses in Python 3000The issue occurs because for using @abstractmethod decorator it is required that the class’s metaclass be ABCMeta or be derived from it. As given in the documentation -@abc.abstractmethodA decorator indicating abstract methods.Using this decorator requires that the class’s metaclass is ABCMeta or is derived from it.(Emphasis mine)
U  include a raise exception in init method to use in Python2.xThis will not allow the abstract class to be instantiated.
