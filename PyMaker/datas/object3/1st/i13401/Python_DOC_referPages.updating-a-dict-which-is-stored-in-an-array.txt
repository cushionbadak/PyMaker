So I have an array of words, stored as key value pairs. Now I am trying to count the frequency of words in an array of strings, tokens. I have tried the following but this doesnt find the index of x as it is only a string. I do not have the corresponding value, if any, of x in tokens array. Is there any way to directly access it rather than adding one more loop to find it first? 
To count the frequency of words in an array of strings, you can use Counter from collections:EDIT:To count words manually when you have an outer loop. Tokens is changing with each iteration, what @Alexander suggested is a good way. Also, Counter supports + operator, which makes accumulative counting easier:
You definitely want to use Counter as suggested by @zhangzaochen.However, here is a more efficient way to write your code:You can also use a list comprehension:
