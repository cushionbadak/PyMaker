There are three conditions:1st when user doesnot provide port number and zookeeper instance.command : /home/user/solr-5.3.0/bin/solr startThis one works.2nd when user provides only port number.command : /home/user/solr-5.3.0/bin/solr start -p 8898This does not executes.ERROR: Port number is required when using the -p option!3rd when user provides both port number and zookeeper instance.command :/home/user/solr-5.3.0/bin/solr start -p 8898 -z localhost:2181This also does not executes.ERROR: Port number is required when using the -p option!I am new to python scripting. I just need to write scripts for deploying it on servers. Is this the right way of doing it ? Are there any better ways to do it ?Code
