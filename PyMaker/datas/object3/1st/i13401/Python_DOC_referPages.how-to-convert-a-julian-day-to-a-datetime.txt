I want to get date and time format in python from Julian day. I have an hdf file t1.15008.0239.mod07.hdf and I have tried to convert Julian day '15008' to datetime like this:and the result is 2015-08-20.But I also need the time. If I try julday = '150080239' and changethe to code to: file_date = file_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'), thenI get an error.So how can I convert Julian day '150080239' into pythondatetime in format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'?
You already showed you can handle the date; this lets you construct a Python time -- and datetime -- from the pieces of the input string.Is that what you need?
