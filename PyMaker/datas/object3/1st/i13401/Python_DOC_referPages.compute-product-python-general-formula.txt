Trying to get this to post the following 3 lines as a result.  Nothing more, nothing less.The product of the numbers 1 through 10 is: 3628800The product of the first 3 numbers divisible by 3 is: 162The product of the numbers 0 through -100 is: 0Start is where the sequence starts, number is where it ends, and space is the space between the numbers (1 is every number, 2 is even numbers only, etc).I am a beginner to this, and need some assistanceThis is what I have s far, but I'm not sure what to define findproduct as.  I was thinking something along the lines of making a loop and setting n = to n+1 but I still have no idea where to take this:
range gets you the numbers you need given the start, stop and step. Your stops appear to be inclusive (where range is exclusive on stop) so you'd need to adjust, but that's not too hard:That gets you the set of numbers you want the product of. You can do this the obvious way with an accumulator loop:or get clever with built-ins to one-line it (ignoring imports at the top of the file):The spelled out loop has some mild advantages; you could add a test to it for prod == 0 and break out of the loop early should that occur; if a zero appears anywhere in the input, you're not going to end up with a non-zero product anyway. Of course, in Python 3, where range is a more powerful object, you could pre-check for 0 in the range and avoid the work even more efficiently:
