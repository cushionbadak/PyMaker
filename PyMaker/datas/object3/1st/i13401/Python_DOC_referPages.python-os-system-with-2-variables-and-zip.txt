Sry, my english skills are very low.My problem :I want start a EXE with the "os.system" function.It works...So...now. This Code starts the Python EXE and starts my TEST GUI.But what is to do...when the "TEST GUI.py" is in a ZIP File ?I want to start the Python.exe with the "TESTGUI.py".I dont wanna extract the zip file before.
You can import Python modules from a zip file as if it was a directory.For example, if you have TEST_GUI.py inside TEST_GUI.zip (just one file, no folders - a simplest case):you can call it with single shell call as follows:Let me explain it line by line:python -c - call Python with a piece of code as an argumentimport sys;import os; - import necessary packagessys.path.append(os.path.abspath('TEST_GUI.zip')) - this is where magic happens. ZIP file can be added to PATH just like an ordinary folder!import TEST_GUI - since Python now sees TEST_GUI.py via PATH environment variable, we can import it.TEST_GUI.main() - we call the main() function, and it does whatever we want.Using os.system for the same script is straightforward:However, I recommend you to get rid of os.system and use subprocess module instead.
This can be done by including a file in the zip archive which acts as the entry point to your program.  For example given that creatfile.py contains:and contains:Then, after putting them in writefile.zip, running causes test1.txt to be created in the current working directory with 'hello world' written to it.Showing this in IPython:
