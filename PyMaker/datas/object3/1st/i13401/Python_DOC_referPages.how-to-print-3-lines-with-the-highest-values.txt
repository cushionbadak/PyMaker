I have an input file,I need to group and iterate inside each line[0],and print the 3 lines choosing the ones that have highest values in line[3] and line[2] so that my output file looks like this:This is my try, but it prints me only one best line, how to modify it to print me 3 best hits?
using sorted method  to your code Input:Code:Output:
You could use heapq.nlargest() to get the lines with highest values:Example:Outputnlargest() allows to avoid loading the input groups into memory. If number of rows is always small then you could also use sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n].
You can try this:The sorted function acts like the max and orders items by a key you provide to it.
#you need use if to identfy the 3 best hits, for example:print number1, number2, number3
