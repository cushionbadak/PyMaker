As I am using Python 2.6 I am trying to create custom Enum class. What I need is to store string with the enum object. Something like:The problem is that my 'Parameters' class is not iterable...From another file I need to be able to iterate among PARAMs:Unfortunately, for my solution I have error: for param in Parameters:TypeError: 'type' object is not iterable.
Above will not work because Parameters is class and it is not iterable.PARAM1 and PARAM2 are class variables in above case.We have to do something like this:[Edit 1]:Create number of objects by for loop with range function code:[Edit 2]:Get values from the User by raw_input function and type conversion from the string to integerDemo: Note:use raw_input() in Python 2.xuse input() in Python 3.x[Edit 3]: Hardcode values by Instance variables method.Define class in hardcoded_values.py file Import Hardcodes class in test.py fileOutput:
Use the backported enum module (documentation):which prints:Parameters.PARAM1 = (0, 'some msg 1')Parameters.PARAM2 = (1, 'some msg 2')
