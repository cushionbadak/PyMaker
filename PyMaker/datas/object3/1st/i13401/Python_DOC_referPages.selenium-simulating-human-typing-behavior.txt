Natural Text
I want to simulate human typing using Selenium and I've wrote a code for that, but I don't know how to continue it.I want to make my code enter the 'thing1' element of lst into the variable elem webelement, and the second element of the list into the variable elem2 webelement. Now, I don't know how do I do that. I've tried many ways but the code didn't work as it was supposed to. Any ideas would be highly appreciated.
Currently, you are entering both texts into elem element. You may instead have pairs of element+text defined:You can also make that pairs list using zip():
