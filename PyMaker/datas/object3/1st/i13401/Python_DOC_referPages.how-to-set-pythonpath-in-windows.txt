I tried to run a .py file by typing python twitterstream.py > output.txt in the command prompt of windows 10. It then saidFrom what I saw through a google search, the solution may be to change the PYTHONPATH env variable. However, I had PYTHONPATH set to C:\Python27 for both the user and system variables, but I still get the same error in the command promptI also read http://bugs.python.org/issue11288, and tried to change all PYTHONPATH system variable which originally pointed to C:\Python27 and changed it to C:\Python34 but that didn't solve the problemI then followed https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows, but when I type py it says Python 2.7.9 .., but for py -3 I get a popup saying python.exe has stopped working and also, py hello.py says from python 2.7.9 ..., but changing #! python to #! python3 gives the same error I said beforeEven if I set PATH AND PYTHONPATH user variables to C:\Python34;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;C:\Python34\Scripts, along with the PythonPath system variable to C:\Python34;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;C:\Python34\Scripts, but the error was the same as before
For some reason by typing only the "py" file name in the command prompt it worked for me. So I typed myScript.py  and it ran correctly. Before this I typed "python myScript.py" and it produced the same error that you experienced. I have the environment variables set PYTHONPATH=c:\python27 and PYTHONHOME=c:\python27. I hope this helps.
At the start of your program include the lineWindows will use this to run your code in Python 3.4 rather than 2.7
