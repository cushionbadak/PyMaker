I have a bytestring. It's guaranteed that it's a representation of a zip file in bytes. How can I create a zip file object in Python, knowing this bytestring?
Use io.BytesIO to construct a file-like object, and then pass that object to the ZipFile constructor.
You could convert your byte string to a byte array, write that byte array to a file and treat that as the zip file. See this thread:Python write string of bytes to file
