I want to expose a buffer protocol for a object, just like in this example of the Cython documentation, however I need to do this using CFFI and I wasn't able to find any examples to expose a buffer protocol.
My reading of the question is that you have some data you've got from a CFFI interface and want to expose it using the standard Python buffer protocol (which lots of C extensions use for quick access to array data).The good news ffi.buffer() command (which, in fairness, I didn't know about until OP mentioned it!) exposes both a Python interface and the C-API side buffer protocol. It is restricted to viewing the data as an unsigned char/byte array though. Fortunately, using other Python objects (e.g. a memoryview it's possible to view it as other types).Remainder of the post is an illustrative example:... and the Python file using cffi
