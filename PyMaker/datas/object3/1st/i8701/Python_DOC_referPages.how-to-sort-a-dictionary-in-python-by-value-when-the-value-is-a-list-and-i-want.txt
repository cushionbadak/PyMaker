is it possible to sort a python dictionary by value if the value is a list, and I want it to be sorted by the first value of that list. E.G:I would like it to be like: Where 'i' is the keyMany thanks.
You cannot sort a dict in place, because Python dicts are unordered. You have at least 2 alternatives :Create a sorted list of tuplesYou can use sorted with a key= argument. In this case, it would be the first element of the dict value :It returns a sorted list of tuples, which you can use to iterate and print the result :Create an OrderedDictIf you want to sort data and keep the functionality of a dict, you can create an OrderedDict :Note : For both examples, key=lambda x: x[1] would also be enough.
You can use itemgetter, this should sort the entries by the list (you can sort lists of lists and it will by default sort by the first element). This will give back a list of tuples, with the first element being the key, which you can loop through and print.Output:Note: The reason sorted_data is a list of tuples instead of a dictionary is that python dictionaries are inherently unordered. See answers to this for an explanation: Why is python ordering my dictionary like so?
