Here is the code so farNotes regarding the variables:'ports' - there could be any number of ports in the 'ports' list'nodes_u' this will contain any number of server names and IP address pairs'serv_name_u' could be anything but is static once defined'port_qty' is equal to the number of ports listed in 'ports'   Here is an example of the outputMy question or what I am trying to figure out is how I can get the port number displayed after the server name in the pool section only! so the output is like this e.g.Every time I try something I just end up with both ports listed or the iteration jumps past the index range for the 'ports' list. Also if there is a better way to capture the input or generate the output I am all ears! 
Remove the nested for-loop and just include both print statements in the outer for-loop, with the port number inserted at index :{1}:Output:Attempt #2:Using different incrementer names (i and j) in the nested for-loops to differentiate between the two lists may get the desired output:Output:As for a better way to capture the input or generate the output, consider using a different data structure for your inputs, like a dictionary with the keys as name, and port, and values as their respective values.
