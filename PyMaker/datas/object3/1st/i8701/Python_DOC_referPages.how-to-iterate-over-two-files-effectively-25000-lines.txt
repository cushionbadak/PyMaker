So, I am trying to make a combined list inside of Python for matching data of about 25,000 lines.The first list data came from file mac.uid and looks like thisThe second list data came serial.uid and looks like this:Mac from list 1 must equal the Mac from list 2 before it's joined.This is what I am currently doing, I believe there is too much repetition going on.The final list is supposed to look like this:So that I can import it into an excel sheet.Thanks for any and all help!
Instead of your nested loops (which cause quadratic complexity) you should use dictionaries which will give you roughly O(n log(n)) complexity. To do so, first read serial.uid once and store the mapping of MAC addresses to serial numbers in a dict.Then you can close the file again and process mac.uid looking up the serial number for each MAC address in the dictionary you've just created.Note that I've changed combined from a list of strings to a list of tuples. I've also factored the splitting logic out into a separate function. (You'll have to put its definition before its use, of course.)Finally, I recommend that you start using more descriptive names for your variables.For files of 25k lines, you should have no issues storing everything in memory. If your data sets become too large for that, you might want to start looking into using a database. Note that the Python standard library ships with an SQLite module.
