You should decode your file before passing then to the extractall method.Reading the documentation in the module, they are explicit on this:There is no official file name encoding for ZIP files. If you have unicode file names, you must convert them to byte strings in your desired encoding before passing them to '(). WinZip interprets all file names as encoded in CP437, also known as DOS Latin.
