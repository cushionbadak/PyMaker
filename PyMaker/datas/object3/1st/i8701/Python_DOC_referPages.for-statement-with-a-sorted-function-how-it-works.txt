I’m a beginner in Python and in programming in general. With the input “good” the output “o” was found 2 time(s). The code works fine, however the last block of code confuses me. The variable k produces the letter o and the variable v produces the number 2. This is the key set from the dictionary. How is the code interpreted to produce this output?
The sorted() function produces a sorted list from it's input. That input here is the found.items() object, which itself is an iterable of tuples containing (key, value) pairs from the dictionary. Since tuples are ordered lexicographically (comparing first their first elements, then if equal, the second elements, etc.) you end up with a list of (key, value) pairs sorted in alphabetical order.You can try this out yourself in the interactive interpreter:Of course, since good only contains one unique vowel, o, there is little to sort by.  A sorted list with just one (key, value) pair won't show any change in order.If you tried with a more complex word, like ultrarevolutionaries, you'd get a much more interesting result:The items are out of order first, u, a, e, o, i is not in alphabetical order. a, e, i, o, u on the other hand is.
