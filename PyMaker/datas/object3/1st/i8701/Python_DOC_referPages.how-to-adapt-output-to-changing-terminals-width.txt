I'm trying to write a function that would produce a simple widget when run in Python's console. This widget should be terminal-size-aware. After displaying the widget I will wait for user's keyboard input and adjust the content according to what the types. The difficulty that I have right now is how to make that widget adjust its display when the user resizes the terminal. Here's a simplified version of the code that I have right now:This works fine if the user expands the terminal, or if he shrinks the terminal but very slowly (1 character at a time). However reducing the terminal width quickly will cause long lines to wrap, corrupting the output. Is there a way to address this problem?
The question refers to something like blessed 1.9.1, which asserts that it is a simplified wrapper to curses.   Since Python curses provides support for repainting on SIGWINCH, the assertion would carry forward to this package.  Actually the features described are for terminfo.  curses does a lot more than that page shows.To handle SIGWINCH using blessed, you'll have to catch that in your script and trigger a repaint of the screen.  The example shown in Height and Width should be enough to get started.Or you could use curses, where you'd do the repaint after reading a KEY_RESIZE from getch.
