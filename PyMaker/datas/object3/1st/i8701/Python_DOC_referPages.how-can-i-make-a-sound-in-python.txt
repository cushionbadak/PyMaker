I tried to make a sound with the winsound libry and my system doesnt recognize it...Can I write a code in python that makes a sound without installing a new libraries?I searched some solutions but all I found doesnt work. I need a library that included in the python package.
You can try cross-platform way to do this is to print '\a'. This will send the ASCII Bell character to stdout, and will hopefully generate a beep (a for 'alert').Even Windows has its own Beep API, which allows you to send beeps of arbitrary length and pitch. Note that this is a Windows-only solution, so you should probably prefer print '\a' unless you really care about Hertz and milliseconds.The Beep API is accessed through the winsound module:Link to Python Winsound Library
First: What is your OS? According to the documentation winsound "access to the basic sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms". So winsound only workson Windows, so if you're a LINUX or UNIX you have to find another way.Seconds: What to you mean by "make a sound" if you just want a "beep" you can use beep and call it with os.system from os module (or subprocess) like this:You have to install beep (it's an "advanced" pc-speaker beeper), the installation depend on your system Mac/OSX, Linux(Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Archlinux), BSD?on Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install beepUpdate #2@shahar Well according to the doc you did the right thing.You can catch error that python raise to you to figure it out what's wrongThe code above work on python2.7 and python3 but in case, what's your python version?I used python3.5.3 on windows and the code work like a charm.
You can play back an mp3...but this will require a librarya good example is here:-Playing mp3 song on python
