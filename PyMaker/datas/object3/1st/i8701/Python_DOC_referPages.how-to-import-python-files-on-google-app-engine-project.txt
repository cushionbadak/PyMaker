I recently started playing with Google app engine (GAE) and I'm failing to do something very simple.The GAE provides a main.py file which is where I'm trying to import a file I created util.py.I saw some examples saying that you need to create a module for that in order to be able to include it.So I did In main.py I imported import utilities.util, I still can't call the functions inside of util.py.Any ideas where I could learn more about these things?
