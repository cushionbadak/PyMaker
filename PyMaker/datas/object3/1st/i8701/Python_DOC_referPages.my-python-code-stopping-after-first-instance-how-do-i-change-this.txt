I'm new to python and I wanted my code to read a csv line by line (large file) and then if the experiment ID is a specific number write that line to a csv. Only problem is it only writes the first instance then stops. Any suggestions? Thanks. 
You can just remove the line = line.strip('\n') and it works fine.If you remove the newline, you just append all of the matching lines onto a single line which in your eyes looked like it had only matched once.You should also check the csv module.It's a great module for everything related to csv files.
