When using the Enum class introduced in Python 3 programmatically , how should a programmer check for Enum membership of a given integer?Obviously, you could just ask for forgiveness but is there a membership check function that I have otherwise missed? Put more explicitly, I would like to take an integer value and check to see if its value corresponds to a valid enumeration. Output:
Enum does has a __contains__ method, but it checks for member names rather than member values:Internally(in CPython) they do have a private attribute that maps values to names(will only work for hashable values though):But it's not a good idea to rely on private attributes as they can be changed anytime, hence you can add your own method that loops over __members__.values():
Do you mean:Or Output:b 2
