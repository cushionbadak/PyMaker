I have recently started learning more about Python Packages and Modules. I'm currently busy updating my existing modules so that that can be run as script or imported as a module into my other code. I'm not sure how to construct my input arguments within my module and pass them to the main() function within my module.I've have written my my main() function and called it under if __name__ == '__main__' passing the input arguments. The inputs are currently hard coded to show what I'm trying to achieve. Any help in how to correctly construct my input arguments that the user will pass, which will then be passed onto the main function will be appreciated.As mentioned I'm trying to be able to use the following as a script when used directly or imported as a module into my other code and run from there. If I import it as a module would I call the main() function when importing it? Is the following structure correct in how I have written the following? Any advice is appreciated.Updated: 17/03/13The following is my updated Python module based on Jonathan's suggestions:
This looks correct for me, and yes if you're looking to use this as a module you would import main. Though, it would probably be better to name it in a more descriptive way. To clarify how __main__ and the function main() works. When you execute a module it will have a name which is stored in __name__. If you execute the module stand alone as a script it will have the name __main__. If you execute it as part of a module ie import it into another module it will have the name of the module. The function main() can be named anything you would like, and that wouldn't affect your program. It's commonly named main in small scripts but it's not a particularly good name if it's part of a larger body of code. In terms letting a user to input arguments when running as a script I would look into either using argparse or clickAn example of how argparse would work.
