I am creating a number of slices [-WINDOW-i:-i] of a list, where i ranges between 32 and 0:When i == 0, this returns a slice of length 0:I don't want to have to do this to solve it:… because if I have many lists to append to vals, it gets messy.Is there a clean way to do this?
One workaround for this quirk in Python slicing is to take advantage of these facts:false_ish_value or other_value always evaluates to other_value0 is the only integer that is false-ish in a boolean contexts[n:None] is equivalent to s[n:]With those in mind, you can write your slice as:… and the slice will be interpreted as [-WINDOW-i:None] (which is the same as [-WINDOW-i:]) only when i (and therefore -i) is 0.
