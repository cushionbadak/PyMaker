So I'm trying to write a function that can check the squares a piece on a chess board can successfully move to,So far I've written so much of the code but realized I will encounter IndexErrorsI would like to ignore the if-blocks that encounter an IndexError but continue the rest of the statements in the while loop till it exits. How do I do that?
While in Python it's typically EAFP, this is one case where LBYL is probably appropriate. Though you really don't have to even do that. You know that a queen and a rook are only going to be able to move in a straight line - either on the X or the Y, so you just have to hold one steady and then move across the other options:(Though that is actually ignoring some of the rules of chess)If you were in a position where you had potential moves and you wanted to try EAFP you could do something like this:But that's probably not appropriate for chess :)
put the execution in try block and a continue in except blockTry it in your code and paste any error your get
If you want to continue the rest of the statements you have to pass the IndexError.See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions
