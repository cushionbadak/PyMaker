This question already has an answer here:What's the difference between assertEqual and assertIs (assertIs was introduced in Python 2.7)?                    1 answer                What is the best way to do assertEqual with unittest in Python, but instead of testing == it tests is? I want to ensure I have the same object, not just objects that compare equal. This is important, because some of the objects I'm working with are heap types with wacky compare operators.
Use assertIs which does exactly what you want.https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertIs
That would be the assertIs method.
