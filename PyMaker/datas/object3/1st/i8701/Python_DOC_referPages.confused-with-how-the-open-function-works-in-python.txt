Say i had the code:This is fine and just prints the entire text file, yet with this:So it will run the for loop just fine and print line, yet the last line wont do anything. With the second code, it should print the entire file twice, yet it only prints it once. Could someone explain why?
When you finished up reading file in your for loop, your cursor is set to the end of the file.Try this for example:It is going to print the whole file twice this time since we set cursor to beginning of the file.
With the second code, it should print the entire file twice, yet it  only prints it onceIt only prints the file once because the for loop will read through the entire file. file essentially references a position in the file which will change as you go through the file.Â So, when you have iterated through all of the contents, file references the end of the file. If you try to read all of the contents (using file.read()) after having iterated through the file, you receive nothing because you're already at the end.You'll have the same behavior if you doYou can navigate to the beginning of the file using file.seek(0, 0).See: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects.
