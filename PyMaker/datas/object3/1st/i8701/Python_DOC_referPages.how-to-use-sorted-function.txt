The code I write like this:when I try to run it under python3.6, the error comes:But  I'm just coding under the way the python document shows me:Is there anyone who can please tell me what's wrong with it?
As mentioned in the sorted docs, you need to pass your comparison function as a cmp argument not a key argument. So However, using cmp is much less efficient than key, and so cmp has been deprecated for some time in Python 2, and it has been removed from Python 3.A key function only gets called once for each unique item in the list (or other iterable) that you're sorting. In contrast, a cmp function must be called every time a comparison is made between two items.It's possible to transform a cmp function into a key function with functools.cmp_to_key, but this is only provided for convenience: it doesn't prevent the inefficiency, it only hides it. So it should only be used as a temporary fix for old code that uses cmp, or in those rare cases where it's not possible to use a key function.For further details, please see the Sorting HOW TO.
It's right in the documentation you show :The key function should only accept one argument : it is called for every single string automatically by sorted. Your function expects 2 arguments, and sorted doesn't know what s2 should be.So your code should be :The confusion could come from the fast that in some other languages (e.g. Java), the method expects 2 arguments (see Comparator)
In order to use a custom comparator function for Python 3's sorted, you must use functools.cmp_to_key, like so:For further information, please refer to the documentation for functools.cmp_to_key: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key
