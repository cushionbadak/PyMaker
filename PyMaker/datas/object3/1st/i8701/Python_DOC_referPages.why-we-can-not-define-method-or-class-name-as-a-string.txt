Why we can not define method or class name as a string ?I was trying to use & in a method name, in normal name it was throwing error, So i tried to use method name in a string like as:But it again showing another error(SyntaxError: invalid syntax).So Why i can not define method or class name as a string ?
Function names need to follow the same syntax as identifiers do. Identifiers in Python follow a certain rule which does not allow an identifier to start with a symbol such as '. The accepted form of identifiers is clearly defined in the corresponding section of the reference manual.You can't because the grammar rule defined for identifiers just doesn't allow it, simple as that. Identifiers are meant to be readable, that's why characters such as & are not allowed. 
The python grammar is not defined this wayTake a look at this lecture about grammar (in CS) to get an idea about how a grammar is defined and why it must always be respected although it allows quite a bit of flexibility https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall2000/cs126/lectures/T3-4up.pdf
