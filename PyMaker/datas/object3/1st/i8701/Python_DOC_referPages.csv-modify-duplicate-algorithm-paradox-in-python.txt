I'm a beginner with python (2.7).So here is my file :I want to check duplicate (only in column 2) and increment +1 one of the duplicate, like that :I did something like this but it's write only lines where duplicates are :I dont see how do this. But I asking myself about an other question : if the incremented number is now a duplicate, how I can check that ? It will not create an infinite loop ?
As you iterate through your file, store values of column 2 in a set, and when you encounter a repeat value, increment by 1 using while until the value becomes unique. Store the new value, and write the entire line to file using a csv.writer:Note: in Python2.7, we open the filehandles buffer mode (i.e. rb instead of r, but this is unnecessary in Python3.
It won't create an infinite loop, unless you have infinite data. :) Your code is close - you can handle the incremented number colliding with an existing number by using while with an else clause instead of if ... else. You also need to update the row with the new key.Here's a version that reads the data from a string, to make it easier to test.outputTo run this code on Python 2 add this at the start of the script:
