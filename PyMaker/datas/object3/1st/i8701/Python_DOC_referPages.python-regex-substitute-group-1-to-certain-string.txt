I wonder how to substitute group 1 with certain string by regex in python.Question1:Use regex to match str, matched "aaa bbb", and replace group1 "bbb" with "111 bbb 222", and get the result "aaa 111 bbb 222 ccc"Thanks for @RomanPerekhrest and @janos 's lookbehind method.And I wonder how to solve a more general scenario:Question2:target:Ignore the case for substring except of s1 when matching in original string.Question3:target:Ignore the case for substring except of s1 when matching & substituting in original string.Question4:If there is a way to substitute group 1 on original string by regex on python?
To replace sequence bbb which should be preceded by sequence aaa use the following approach:The output:(?<=aaa ) - lookbehind positive assertion, ensures that "bbb" is preceded by "aaa "http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html
You can use the re package, and positive look-behind:This will produce:Notice the changes I did there:The aaa prefix in the regex is wrapped in (?<=...). This means, match bbb if it follows aaa, without including aaa in the pattern to replace. This is called positive lookbehind. Without this change to your regex, the aaa would disappear together with bbbRegular expression strings should be written as r"...", to make them raw strings, in order to avoid problems with escape sequencesI renamed the str variable to s, because str is a reserved word in Python, as @elena also pointed out.
First of all, don't use str as a variable name. It's a reserved keyword in Python.
