For some reason I'm having real trouble wrapping my head around recursive algorithms ...I was wondering if someone could help me come up with a recursive version of the following:I have a list of lists of numbers and I want to get all possible lists of permutations of all the elements.For example, given [[1], [2,3], [4,5]], I want the output to be:[[1,2,3,4,5], [1,2,3,5,4], [1,3,2,4,5], [1,3,2,5,4]]The way I did it is kind ugly:I don't like it ... I feel like recursion might be more elegant.Any thoughts?
You code can be simplified without recursion:For product(*perms), see Unpacking Argument Lists - Python tutorial.
You can simplify things a bunch. Just pass all the permutation iterators to itertools.product and flatten the lists of lists you get out:
