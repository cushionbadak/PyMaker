Natural Text
I'm trying iterate through multiple tuples in a list and return the items in each tuple in a particular order into a string.For example, if I input:I would expect it to return:Thank you in advance for you help!
You need zip:
Or:(Thanks to juanpa.arrivillaga and PM_2Ring for helpful comments.)
Just one additional option (the other answers are fine too):For the given input, hemflit's chain.from_iterable solution is faster, but for a larger number of input strings (even increasing from 3 to 6), this approach wins.Also, as a side-note, you can also handle inputs with mismatched len without dropping data using itertools.zip_longest, passing fillvalue=''.
