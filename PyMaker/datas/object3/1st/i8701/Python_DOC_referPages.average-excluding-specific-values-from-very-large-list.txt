I am working with a very large list (~1GB) of travel times and am trying to average them, but there is a quirk where if the trip is not possible the value is set to the highest possible integer value, which destroys the entire calculation.  The travel times are stored in a list, and the lists are in a dictionary.From point A to B and B to C would look like:The average between AB should be 6 and BC should be 5 (not 429496733.4).How can I exclude rogue values from the average calculation?
The statistics module provides a mean() function which can take an iterator as input, so you don't have to make a copy of the list to filter out the values you want to discard.Here's a mocked up example of your data, where 90% of the 1 million elements are in the range 1 to 9 inclusive, and 10% are your rogue value:Here's how to use statistics.mean() to get the mean including rogue values:â€¦ and here's how to do so iterating over it excluding rogue values:Wrapping that up in a dictionary comprehension:
