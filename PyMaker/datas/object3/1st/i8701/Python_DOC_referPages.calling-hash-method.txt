I define class MyClass() I know, that __init__ is called automatically after I declare x = MyClass(). But what about __hash__? Does it work without being explicitly called by x.__hash__() ?Is every method that starts with __ called automatically or program decides when to call them?I went through many documentation to find the answer but unsuccesssfuly. Thank you for answers!
From Python docs:Called by built-in function hash() and for operations on members of hashed collections including set, frozenset, and dict. __hash__() should return an integer. The only required property is that objects which compare equal have the same hash value;Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__Also, please, don't return random numbers from __hash__().
No, __hash__ is not automatically called. Have a look at the documentation for this method:Called by built-in function hash() and for operations on members of  hashed collections including set, frozenset, and dict.So this method will be called in case someone does hash(x).Btw. returning a random number is a bad idea:The only required property is that objects which compare equal have  the same hash value
