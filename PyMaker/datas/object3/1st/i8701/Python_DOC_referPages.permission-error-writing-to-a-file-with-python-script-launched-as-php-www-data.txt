I have an index.php file that runs a python script as follows:The test.py file tries to write to a file (which by default does not exist in the directory) as follows:Now, if I run this file directly as root in Ubuntu, it works fine. The file is created and has "Hello!" inside.If I run it through the php script (by visiting my index.php page), I get the following error in  /var/log/apache2/error.lognow...I tried another python file that just prints something and I was able to get that to run fine. So here's where I'm getting confused.The permissions of the folder and the test.py file is the same and as follows:I can't figure out why this won't let me write to the file. I even tried to create the file first (touch) and then give it permissions...but it didn't work.Does anyone know how I can get this to work?
When you call that script from php it tries to create file in the same folder as python file itself (in /usr/custom/), not php file. To solve that problem, you will need to write absolute path for the file:If you need that file to be created in the same place as your php file, then you will need to pass path as an argument in shell_exec call. Read this documentation for argument parsing. You can use getcwd in php to get path for current directory.
