I'm looking for a way, in Python, to get the HTTP message from the status code. Is there a way that is better than building the dictionary yourself?Something like:
In Python 2.7, the httplib module has what you need:Constants are also available:Update@shao.lo added a useful comment bellow. The http.client module can be used:
This problem solved in Python 3.5 onward. Now Python http library has built-in module called HTTPStatus. You can easily get the http status details such as status code, description, etc. These are the example code for HTTPStatus.
Python 3:You could use HTTPStatus().phrase to obtain the description for a given code value.  E.g. like this:Would give for example:Which answers the question. However a much more direct solution can be obtained from HTTPError.reason:
A 404 error indicates that the page may have been moved or taken offline. It differs from a 400 error which would indicate pointing at a page that never existed.
