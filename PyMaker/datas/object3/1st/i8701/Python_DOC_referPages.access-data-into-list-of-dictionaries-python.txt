The output now is:So it's skipping the second view of the first property. I tried nesting a sub for loop but I can't get it to work, the final output should be:Any ideas on how to get that?
You need to iterate through the profiles list for each single_property:It would probably help if you read a little in the python docs about lists and how to iterate through them
Just another proposition with oneline loops:The point is that you will have to loop inside the lists. You could also make objects, if you think your Data would be more manageable.
If you're getting really confused, don't be afraid to just make variable.Look at how much more readable this is:Data is defined as the information you gave us:
