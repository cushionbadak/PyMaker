I am trying to find a pattern. I have written the below code:The code above returns ('000,001,1', '', '', '1') where as it misses the match with groups ('', '0', '', '1,100,001')I am trying to workout if the characters before and after the '00' on consecutive lines are the same. The code i wrote matches '000,001,100,001'. How to match '000,001,100,001'.How the obtain match groups for the later?
Comments: for the string '2295051,2238451,2235301,1950522,2238451,3530333'  ... You see that the groups have the same number of digits before the occur which is 2 digits and after they occur which is 1 digit  Read about the meaning of '+'  in the Docs re.html#module-re.Comment: ...what i don't understand is how it does it and how i can make use of it...  The pattern = '((\d\d)\d+(\d))' search for a substring, starting with 2 Digits \d\d, followed by any number of Digits, at least one, and one Digit \d at the End. This pattern is generalized, matches any substring, at least with len=4, of Digits.Try this pattern:Output:('000', '0', None)  ('001', None, '1')  ('100', '1', None)  ('001', None, '1')  The first item 000 have both, before and after.  Tested with Python:3.4.2 - re:2.2.1Come back and Flag your Question as answered if this is working for you or comment why not.
