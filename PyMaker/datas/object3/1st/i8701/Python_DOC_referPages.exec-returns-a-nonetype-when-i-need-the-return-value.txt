Natural Text
I asked a question earlier, but ran into a second problem.I am writing a program that reads in a text file, and executes all code within the file. This is for class, and we have to use exec() I get this error upon running the code, and countless searching has not led me to a solution.Code isthis is the file I read in.I can not find out how to get the value of the statement for exec. Can someone explain to me how to use this properly in the way listed below
exec will always return None. From the documentation:exec(object[, globals[, locals]]) This function supports dynamic  execution of Python code. object must be either a string or a code  object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python  statements which is then executed (unless a syntax error occurs). [1]  If it is a code object, it is simply executed. In all cases, the code  that’s executed is expected to be valid as file input (see the section  “File input” in the Reference Manual). Be aware that the return and  yield statements may not be used outside of function definitions even  within the context of code passed to the exec() function. The return  value is None.This is a rather strange request. But you can capture the output like this:Now, you have to redirect output to some stream which you can manipulate later:And now, you can get the values that were printed:Although, I think an easier way is to pass a namespace to the dict:The namespace will get loaded with the normal __builtins__ unless you provide one yourself. So to get every name created in your executed code, you can find the difference between the namspace.keys dictview and a set contiaining the string "__builtins__"Although, if you are on python 3.4 >= it's a lot easier to redirect stdout to some stream:
