I am exploring the  possibility of replacing very large numbers of small dictionaries with namedtuples instead.Because dict keys (strings) have been mapped onto the field names of the namedtuples, I have to make use of the dundered getattribute method of the namedtuple to access the values.This not only makes the code look kind of odd but I wonder also whether this is bad practice?
Because dict keys (strings) have been mapped onto the field names of the namedtuples, I have to make use of the dundered getattribute method of the namedtuple to access the values.That's the wrong tool. You should be using the getattr built-in function, not the __getattribute__ method:That said, if you want to primarily access your data by name instead of index, calling getattr all the time is going to be awkward. You could subclass your namedtuple class and change how __getitem__ works so you can still use indexing notation:
