I am totally new to Python. I would like to generate a CSV file like the attachement:attachementFor the moment I am trying to make it work with Numpy and Pandas package, but it isn't working out.It would be great if anyone could help me out to realize this little projectKind Regards,William
Welcome to the SO community. For writing to .csv files with Python, as others have said you'll want to use the csv module (link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) by importing it. For example, to help get you started:results in a .csv file like this: Without more information on what kind of data object you're working with, it's difficult to give exact details on how to proceed, but you should be able to find what information you need by reviewing the CSV module API in the link.
I would map your Pandas table by row to the fields presented by your CSV header as a dictionary, so each label in the header is a key and the corresponding entry is the value. You should end up with a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row of your table. Without knowing how your data is instantiated with Pandas I cannot elaborate further, as I'm not familiar with Pandas or your code at all, but this idiom should help you out if you can iterate over the rows of your table;I would then use the DictWriter class from the csv module to write the CSV file. An example of this can be found in the Python documentation. Writing the CSV file will then be as simple as iterating over the dictionary list.If memory is a concern you may wish to convert each row in your table into a dictionary and write the row to the CSV file iteratively instead of instantiating your entire table in memory as a dictionary list before writing it to a file.
