I'm a beginner in Machine Learning and want to play around with some image classification code from github with the data I have. I am having problem loading the image data in python. Problem being - I don't know how. How would I load the data and format it? 
The word "read" is vague, but here is an example which reads a jpeg file using the Image class, and prints information about it.
