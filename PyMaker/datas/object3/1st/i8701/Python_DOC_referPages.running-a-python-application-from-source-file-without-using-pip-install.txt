There is an application where I downloaded the source code and would like to modify it. https://github.com/ownaginatious/fbchat-archive-parserIs there a way to run this program by entered a command such as "python3 main.py" rather than installing the program. When the program is installed, I would simply run the command fbcap. 
This project has a setup.py file. The "standard" way to run such a thing is to install it (preferably inside a virtualenv) and then run it. Virtualenvs are cheap and lightweight so it's easy to do. First, create a virtualenv. This might be slightly different depending on your platform. I presume you're using Python 3 so these instructions should work for you. Let's assume you created it in /tmp/venv1Activate it using . /tmp/venv1/bin/activate (don't forget the initial .). This also might be different if you're on Windows. Now install your program using python setup.py install.Run it using fbcap.This will allow you to run the program in a clean fresh python environment and when you're done experimenting, you can simply delete the virtualenv directory.
