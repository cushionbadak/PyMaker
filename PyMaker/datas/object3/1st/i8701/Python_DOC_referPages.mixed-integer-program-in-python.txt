I have a MIP Problem that I need to output in Python. See the following attempt so far. I just need few suggestions that would point me in the right direction.CURRENT OUTPUT:My code is not producing what I want. Here is the output I want it to produce.Any help would be appreciated. Any modules that I need to use to make it simpler to code would be helpful as well. There are many more lines of codes that I have with different combinations of order of those digits within, but if I can get decent knowledge then I should be able to do it.I also want to be able to print this output to a text file. What would be the easiest way to do so? Any suggestions? Thanks
DD1, you are on the right track here. All you need here is not that difficult. Use the code below as a starting point. This is a fix to your code. It gives the output you need. Other responses are also helpful.I suggest that you look at the three topics: join method, list comprehension, and list slicing. These are good for the type of code you are looking to have. For saving your code as text file. You can use this:If you like, post any updates of your code if this helps.
Here is a working version of your code, you had most of the right stuff there you just missed a few steps here and there, but here you go:You just needed to implement your count variable, after that in the second section you needed to put in the for v1 in range(var_1-1): so that it would actually get the first 001, although you could have just manually threw that in there but I don't know what you need this for so, yeah.
This is the direct way to get what you want, but without knowing why you want it that way, there may be another way to go about it:On Python 3.6, it is even simpler with f-strings:See Format Specification Mini-Language.
