This question already has an answer here:How can I identify buttons, created in a loop?                    4 answers                So I want to print an item's text when item's button is pressed.Whichever of the three buttons I press I get 3333. If I remove lambda I get 1111 2222 3333 right at start of the program, but then buttons have no effect.
An easy change you can do is to use functools.partial instead of lambda. Since lambda evaluates the statement after the button is pressed, the last item would be 3333. partial saves the args and act the same as lambda(evaluate the statement after the button is pressed)For more information on how to use partial see https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial
