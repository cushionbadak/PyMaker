This question already has an answer here:Python shorthand for multiple conditionals in an if statement [duplicate]                    1 answer                -3<-2<-1 returns True.However I would expect it interpreted as How is that possible ?
This is a chained comparison. Instead of being left-associative like (-3 < -2) < -1 or right-associative like -3 < (-2 < -1), it's actually treated asexcept that -2 is evaluated at most once.
From the docs:Unlike C, expressions like a < b < c have the interpretation that is conventional in mathematicsComparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent  to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both  cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).Therefore is equivalent to 
It's stated in the documentation that it is part of the language
