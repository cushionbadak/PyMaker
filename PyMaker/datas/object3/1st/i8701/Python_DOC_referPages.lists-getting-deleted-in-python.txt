Objects in Python are stored by reference,which means you didn't assign the value of ListA to ListB, but a pointer to the object.You can use is operator to test if two objects have the same address in memory. Sequences can be copied by slicing so you can use this to copy a list:Also you can use b = list(a)Or you can use copy() module:See more details from How do I copy an object in Python?
