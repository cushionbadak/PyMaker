So I have a list with names:Now I would like to only print the second letter of each name, so end up with( each letter underneath each other):Also, I had a second question. I would like to replace a regular 'l' with a capital 'L' and print the names as (also each name underneath each other):I hope someone knows how to do this :) Thank you in advance!
There is a very simple solution to your problem(s):Now, you can use it anywhere in the program, taking a list as a parameter.ExplanationI declared two functions, capitalizeLetterL() and getSecondLetter(), which helps us achieve the desired goalInside getSecondLetter() I used a for-in loop to get each string from the list and return the second character, by subscripting it with string[1], which returns the second character, because the indexes in a string start from 0I used the replace() function of string, to replace l with LEditAs per the OP's request, I've added a version which only uses while-loops:
You could also use list comprehensionsOutput
print (fruits)print (fruits[1][1])
