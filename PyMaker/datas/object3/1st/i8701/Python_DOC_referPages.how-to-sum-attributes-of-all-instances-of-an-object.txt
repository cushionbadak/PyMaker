I want to sum the costsum attribute for all the instances of an object.So far I've tried using sum() with comprehension as follows, referring to this solution:But I am having trouble overcoming the TypeError that I'm missing 4 required positional arguments.
To utilize sum built-in function in Python for member variables of objects, you need to make a sequence (e.g, tuple or list) of the member variables of the objects. The following snippet shows how to make a list of objects' member variables. The code you posted omits the comprehension expression. I hope it will be helpful :)
