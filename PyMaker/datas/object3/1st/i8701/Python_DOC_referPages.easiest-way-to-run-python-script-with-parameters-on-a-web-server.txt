Thought this would be straightforward, but it's giving me a lot of trouble.  What's the simplest way to run a python script with params on a web server?  I've tried Node, but had a lot of trouble with spawning child processes, tried PHP but ran into a similar problem and just couldn't get exec to work for even the simplest script.  Just spent a while trying Django, but that turned out to be far too involved.  How can I do this without re-inventing the wheel?For example, take the following request:And render the output from a script run with those params:
Try bottle, a micro web framework:someprogram.py:server.py:To run:Use subprocess.check_output() to spawn a process if you don't want to import someprogram.py.
