Natural Text
I have a CSV with 13 million lines. The data is not quote encapsulated and it contains newlines, which is causing a row of data to have line breaks. The data does not have multiple breaks per line, only one.How would I take data like this?And turn it into this:I've tested this by storing the line in a variable and processing the next one, looking for the first character to be anything but 'L', and appending it. I've also tried using f.tell() and f.seek() to move around in the file, but I haven't been able to get it to work.
Assuming every time a line starts with a space it should be concatenated with the preceding line, this should work:
Here's a cheap, reasonably efficient continuation line joiner for you.Use like this:It only uses as much memory as the longest set of continuation lines in your file.
I was able to work out something.I'm open to feedback on this method.
