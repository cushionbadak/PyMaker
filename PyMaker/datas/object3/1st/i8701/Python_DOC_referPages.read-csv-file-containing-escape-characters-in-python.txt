Natural Text
Hi and many thanks in advance!I'm working on a Python script handling utf-8 strings and replacing specific characters. Therefore I use msgText.replace(thePair[0], thePair[1]) while looping trough a list which defines unicode characters and their desired replacement, as shown below.Up to here everything works fine. But now consider a csv file which contains the characters to be replaced, as shown below.I miserably failed in reading the csv data into the list due to the escape characters. I read the data using the csv module like this:This results in pairs like ('\\U0001F601', '1f601.png') which evade the escape characters (note the double backslash). I tried several methods of modifying the string or other methods of reading the csv data, but I was not able to solve my problem.How could I accomplish my goal to read csv data into pairs which contain escape characters?
I'm adding the solution for reading csv data containing escape characters for the sake of completeness. Consider a file Data.csv defining the replacement pattern:Short version (using list comprehensions):Prolonged version (probably easier to understand):
