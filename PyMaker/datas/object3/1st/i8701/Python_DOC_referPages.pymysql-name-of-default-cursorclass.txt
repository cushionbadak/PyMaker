This is probably a stupid question but I cannot find the information in the documentation for pymysql. What is the pymysql default cursorclass? When I do not specify a cursor class on connection to the database my queries return a list for each row in the response. When I specify pymysql.cursors.DictCursor I get a dictionary response. I would like to be able to change between them for different connections within a script. I've written a little function with a context manager to yield the cursor but it requires me to specify the name of the cursorclass each time. I know I can get around this, but knowing the name of the default cursorclass would be nice.  I could probably write this as:and let it default to whatever the default cursorclass is, but I would prefer to be explicit.  
Of course as soon as I post this I find the answer in via:pymysql.cursors.Cursor is the answer. Documentation...
