Python supports a built-in mechanism to work with lists, you could easily do something like this:See the official documentation for more examples https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html.Anyway if you want to program a double linked list by your self I have made some changes to your code:I have put an arrow (# <--) where I made the changes. There were a couples of mistakes on working with pointers and others inaccuracies. Please try this and let me know!
