I have an ordered dictionary and I am trying to go through it in reverse order, basically starting from the last (key, value) inserted.The above code works fine when I use PyCharm with Python 3.5.1, but when I place it on codefights, using their Python 3 interpreter (not sure what exact version), I get the error below for the for loop implementation:Why is this error happening and how can I fix it?
As per the docs, OrderedDict.items() only supported reversed from 3.5, so I expect it's an older version.One way you could fix it is convert to a list first:NB: as per the comments, dicts.items() should be memory efficient but list(dicts.items()) will definitely create a new list with length the number of items in dicts. Most of the time this should be fine, but for very large dicts this will see a O(N) memory usage hit which may be significant.
