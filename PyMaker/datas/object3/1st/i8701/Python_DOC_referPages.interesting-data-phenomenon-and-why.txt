This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                I've run a simple python command and it derives the following result. Can anyone tell me why?and I got the following result:
This is simple representation "error".  Binary numbers do not represent decimal values with prefect accuracy, any more than a terminating decimal can accurately represent, say, 1/7.0.66 is a decimal whose binary representation is just a hair high (actually, they're all going to be a little "off", but this is the only one that shows at a factor of only 10).  You can "fix" this by switching to a decimal data type.
