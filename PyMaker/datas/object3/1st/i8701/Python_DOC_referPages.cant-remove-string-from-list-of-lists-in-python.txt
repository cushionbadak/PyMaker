Struggling big time with this. The user makes a guess and i'm trying to match to the list of lists with a HIT or a MISS.  I also am trying to remove the string from the list if there is a HIT.  If i enter a valid value from the list for a guess --example: a1--i'm getting a traceback error to the ship.remove(guess) line with a "ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list error"  Any help is appreciated. 
Python list is a Mutable Sequence Type, and its remove method is documented there. See footnote 3, which states: "remove raises ValueError when x is not found in s."You want to remove the guess from the ship-list that contains the guess. You can either ask permission by first checking for containment (not recommended):Or, you can beg forgiveness by catching the exception. Unlike many other languages, Python's exceptions are considered cheap, and therefore you are encouraged to rely on trying something, catching the exception, and moving on:
You can't remove an element from a list if it's not there. Otherwise Python will throw an exception, as you see.Say guess = "a1".Your code iterates over player_ships.The first element of which is ['a1','b1','c1']. You can remove a1 from this without an error because it's there.But the second element in the loop is ['a2','a3']. This does not contain a1 and so you get the error.
You are getting this error because in the case of "HIT", you are trying to remove guess from the all the sub-lists of player_ships. But it is present in only one of the sub-list.You should make a if check to verify guess is within the ship before you remove it.Easier way to achieve this is to flatten player_ships. Even better to store it as a set. For example:Then, rest of your code logic could be written as:
