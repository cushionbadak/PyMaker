There're two lists like andHow to delete list 2 from 1 with result [[C, C], [D, D]] and make it without loop, because both lists are very big and loops works slow?thankslist examplesform ask to write what I already tried, OK, it's belowAttempt one: (doesn't work, moreover has a loop inside)Attempt two (looks better but doesn't work too)
If the order is not very important to you,sets are significantly faster. So you can try this,it will be faster than list.And try to use difference method:return new set with elements in a but not in bAverage case O(len(a))That is becaus set uses a hash function to map to a bucket. Since Python implementations automatically resize that hash table, the speed can be constant O(1).Sets are significantly faster when it comes to determining if an object in a set , but slower than lists when it comes to iterating over their contents.Hope this helps.

Just convert the items you want to remove to set of tuples and then use list comprehension to create a new list:Above has O(n) time complexity since checking membership in set is O(1) where as using only lists has O(n^2) time complexity since membership testing in list is O(n). Note that it works only if items on the lists are hashable.
