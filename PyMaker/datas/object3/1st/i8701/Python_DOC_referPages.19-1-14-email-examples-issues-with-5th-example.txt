I am trying to extract attachments from .msg files.  The solutions on github are too detailed for me to understand properly, and the answers here are not as complete as I'd like.  This example was pointed out in another question similar to mine, but I have not been able to figure out how the function works.I believe I am close but cannot figure out what it is I shoud be opening with - with open(msgFile) as fp:  Here is my code so far:I am stuck on line 20. Here is my input and error message.  Any input or clues as to the type of input I need to give the function would be a huge help.  Thanks
What's the purpose of that string: '--    C:\\Users\\MikeS\\Documents\\ImproveBKFS\\Python\\msg_extract'?Use something simple, like --dirAfter you parse args, print it so you understand what the parser has discovered:Then if you need this 'directory', use something like args.directory.Change this as well:to and use:I suspect you are confusing the dest (or long option name) of an argument with the value, either a default or one you'll get from the command line.'C:\Users\MikeS\Documents\ImproveBKFS\Python\msg_extract' and 'TestFile.msg' look like a directory and file names.  But they are being used in the dest slot of add_argument.  You may need to spend some time reading the argparse docs, and practice with some simpler examples.
