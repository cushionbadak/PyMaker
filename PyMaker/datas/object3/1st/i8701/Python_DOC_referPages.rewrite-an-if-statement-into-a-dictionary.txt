So I currently wrote an if/elif statement but I can't seem to get how to rewrite into a dictionary.I have this currently.I currently have:but I'm not exactly sure where to go from here.
Your function body would look like this:Note that this does not check the input for errors; if you feed it a 0 or 5, you'll get an access error.  I'll leave the checking as an exercise for the student.  :-)
Your dictionary is backwards, and it should be a list or tuple.You can avoid having to create a new list or tuple on each call by binding it on definition as a default argument:You can avoid the extraneous None by using modulo arithmetic:Note that your original code handles bad input more gracefully (but still incorrectly) by returning 'Senior' for the 4th year and all other inputs, while the snippets above have various behaviors for incorrect inputs (like 20 or 'hello').
You can use a defaultdict.
