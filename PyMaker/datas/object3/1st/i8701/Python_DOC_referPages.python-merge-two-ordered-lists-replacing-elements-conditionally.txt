Beginner's question.I have two ordered lists with the same order, so the n-th element of list_1 corresponds to the n-th element of list_2. I want to merge the two lists while perserving their order. Moreover, the list resulting from the merge should consist entirely out of numbers, i.e. Preferably, I merge by position in the list conditionally on string or numeric values. I have the same issue with other ordered lists, but with those lists I want to replace numeric values with string values. I.a. to solve my troubles with all the ordered lists I have I'd like to do something like:where z is either a numeric value or a string value, dependent on the nature of the list.
You can use zip to aggregates two list items:, and str.isdigit to check if the given string is a number:By combining with conditional expression and list comprehension, you will get what you want:
