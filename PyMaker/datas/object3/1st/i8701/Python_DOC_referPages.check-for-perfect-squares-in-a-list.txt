I want to identify numbers which are perfect squares in a list of numbers, for example:
Once approach is to build a predicate (a function returning true or false) and apply it with filter():Or for those who prefer list comprehensions over filter():The perfect square test works by taking the square root of a number and rounding it to the nearest integer, re-squaring it and comparing it to a the original number.  The square root step can suffer a little round-off error, but the re-squaring of the rounded integer will be exact.  This should be somewhat robust except for very large inputs.
You can combine math.sqrt() and is_integer() to filter the list, like the following:
You can try:
Using this test for perfect squares:... you can find those that appear in a with a simple list comprehension:
