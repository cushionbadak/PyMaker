Natural Text
I have folders with a mix of files and only want a count of the image type files.  The following is returning the total files in the directory, not just the images. What did I do wrong?If I have one jpg, one png, and two txt files. todays_files should be returning a 2, but it is returning a 4.
You can use set to avoid duplicated items:UPDATE To get the number of matched file counts for each directory:os.path.splitext(f)[-1] in extensions will check whether a file has the wanted extension, and returns True (= 1) / False (= 0). Summing them will give you want.
Iterating over original_file is looping each character in the file name. Since non-empty strings evaluate to True the any function is always returning True. So you're counting each file. I miss read the contents of the loop.Instead you can get the extension for each file, then check if it's in your list of file types you care about.
