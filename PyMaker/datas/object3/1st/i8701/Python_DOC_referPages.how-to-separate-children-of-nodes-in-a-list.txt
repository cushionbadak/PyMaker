I'm working on a trie data structure where each node is a list with entries containing a value and a reference to the child node corresponding to that value, but it appears that the references in the list are not being separated from each other-So for example if "the" and "sin" are both in the trie my CONTAINS() function will return true for "she" because 's' is on the first level, 'h' is on the second level, and 'e' is on the third level even though those characters should be in different branches. I've read about python references and can't figure out why this is happening.
Lol, this took me a while to debug, but I found it.Change this:To this:Firstly, __int__ isn't a thing, but that's only part of the issue.Without knowing the full Pythonic details of exactly why, the root nodespace was getting re-used.So when you create a new one in APPEND(), it doesn't actually happen,  and you get the same nodespace in the new "child".Resultingly, everything is flat. All of the value -> trienode pairs are at the same level, and the trienode reference is always to the same thing.Anyway, with the above change you ensure that you start with a new empty nodespace, and thus APPEND() and .NEXT().CONTAINS() etc., will work more like you'd expect them to.
