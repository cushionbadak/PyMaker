We know about the min() function in python.What I want to do is I want the user to input any number.If the input is 2, the output must be the string 'min(int, int)'.If input is 4, the output must be 'min(int, min(int, min(int, int)))'.Note that I am not trying to compute the value of the min function, but rather to just assemble the strings.
The code can go like this:It prints min (int, min (int, min (int, int))) as required.Note that the actual min function in Python, unlike some other languages, can take more than two arguments: min (x, z, y) is a valid call in Python.
