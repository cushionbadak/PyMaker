I am trying to get a hold of the multiprocessing (2 CPUs on my Mac). My code is roughly the following:I get the following error:num_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count(2)TypeError: cpu_count() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were givenAny ideas what is the problem?
cpu_count does not take any arguments.  The one positional argument is the self instance multiprocessing.https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.cpu_count
