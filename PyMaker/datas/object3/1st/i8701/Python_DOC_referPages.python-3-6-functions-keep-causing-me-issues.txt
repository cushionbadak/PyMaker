What I am trying to do is more complicated but I did a simple example to make my problem clear. I am trying to call a function after I have already defined it. My traceback is : NameError: name 'self' is not definedand I am sure that if it got to the height then height would "not be defined" too.All help is appreciated, thanks.
There are several issues.  First get_avg_height is defined on a class.  That means you must have an instance of a class to invoke it on.  it would look like b.get_avg_height(heights).  Second when you have a function defined on a class and you call a function self is implicitly set to the instance, not explicit.  So it should only have one parameter when you call it.  In b.get_avg_height(heights) self would equal b in the body of the function.  Third since height is immediately assigned to inside the function anything passed in as the height parameter is discarded before use.  Fourth at the call site there is no variable named height defined, so you aren't actually passing anything in. After you remove self at the call site you will get the same name error about height. Sixth your indentation is messed up the call site should be at the outermost level.
