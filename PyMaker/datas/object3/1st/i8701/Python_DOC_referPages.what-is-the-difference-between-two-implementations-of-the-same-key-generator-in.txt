What is the difference between this implementation of auth key generator in PHP:and this one in python:If the timestamp generation works in PHP in another way than my implementation in Python? Because I check it during the auth on the service which uses this timestamp in pair with hash calculated from password and timestamp concatenated together and in case with PHP I can pass, but in case with Python I cannot.Thanks!
If you are using Python 2, note that round() returns a floating point value. When you str() it, it will be formatted like a float: (Python will start to print numbers in scientific notation when the value is ≥ 1011 (year 1973), but even if it is < 1011 there will be an extra .0 at the end. PHP will print in scientific notation when ≥ 1014 (year 5138).)Consider explicitly format instead:Since you wrote print(str(int(timestamp))) probably it is just an oversight? You could also use str(int(timestamp)) here but in Python 2 if timestamp is ≥ 262 (year 292278994) there will be an extra L at the end.
