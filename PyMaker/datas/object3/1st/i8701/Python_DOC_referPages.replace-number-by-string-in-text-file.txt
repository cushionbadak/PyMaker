Natural Text
Given a string as input, I want to find and convert the integer elements of the line with the string num. Here is an example:input: output:How can I do it?
Use a regular expression:The regular expression string r"\b\d+\b" matches a character string that consists of at least one numeral character (\d+) enclosed by word boundaries (\b). The \b part also matches the beginning and the end of a string.The call to re.sub() replaces all occurrences of a matching character string in the third argument s  by the second argument (">num<").
That is how.I took the liberty to assume that you can read the text from a file and can also write the new text to a file so I am skipping those parts.It all boils down to the use of isnumeric().
