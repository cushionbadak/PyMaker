I would like to convert argument in prent method to filter list result with filter of an local instance object. That is what I would like approximatively for the conceptThis is what i do actualy
We can use operator.attrgetter to create a suitable filtering function from the keyword arg name and the associated value.To demonstrate this code I created a simple Test object, and a fields function.outputHere's a new version that handles multiple keywords. Only items that pass all of the filter tests are returned. I've changed the test object names slightly and added a print call to get_fields to make it easier to see what's going on. This code works on both Python 2 and Python 3. outputNote that this code can handle any number of keywords, not just two.I've also included an experimental function get_fields_any which returns the objects that pass any of the filters. It uses a set result to accumulate the matching objects, so it doesn't preserve order. Also, putting objects that don't define __eq__ and __hash__ methods into sets (or using them as dict keys) is risky. See the __hash__ docs for details.
