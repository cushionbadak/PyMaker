I want to check the pprint package in python. And call the dir() function:It is puzzling than the different of dir(pprint) and pprint.__all__. There is an additional warnings in dir(pprint). I open the source of pprint.py, and find there is no function named warnings. There is only import warnings:
This shouldn't puzzle you. imported names are visible in the dir output since dir(module) lists it's attributes. warnings is an attribute of the module pprint since importing it brings it in the pprint module namespace (dictionary).  Looking at dir's documentation tells you this:The default dir() mechanism behaves differently with different types of objects, as it attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than complete, information:If the object is a module object, the list contains the names of the module’s attributes.(emphasis mine)module.__all__ is just an explicit list of names exported when import * is used, it can be viewed as the "public API" of a given module. These two can sometimes be similar but more often than not they differ.
The results from dir() and __all__ are naturally different – they provide different functionality.If you call help(dir), you get:You are calling dir on a module, so it returns the module's attributes. Those attributes are anything available in the module (which includes the warnings module that it imports).On the other hand, __all__ is set by the package/designer to dictate what is imported by default when importing everything from the module (i.e. from module import *).
