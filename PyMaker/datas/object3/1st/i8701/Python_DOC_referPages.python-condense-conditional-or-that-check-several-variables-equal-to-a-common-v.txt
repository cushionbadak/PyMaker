Say I want to condense the following line of code:Is there a way to condense all of these ors to point to a single value? Something like:
Flip it around if 10 in {a, b, sum, diff} should workTo generalize for more values use this:if {val1, val2, val3} & {a, b, sum, diff}
However, note that this works only for a single common value.  If you have two values to compare against four different variables, you don't get the "distributive law" so easily implemented.
It's not much shorter, but I'd use the built-in any():In your case:Hope this helps!
