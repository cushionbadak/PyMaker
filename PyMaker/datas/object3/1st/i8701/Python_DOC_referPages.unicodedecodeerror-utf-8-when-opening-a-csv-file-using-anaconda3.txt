I have some challenges loading olympicmedal.csv file into Jupiter notebook (Using Anaconda3). I do not know what is the  problem because  I was able to load others csv files.This the error I have while try to upload CSV file into Jupyter notebook. Code:Error:â€‹
You're getting an UnicodeError, this means Python Interpreter can't translate the sequence of bits passed to it using it's default encoding. This happens because there is some non-ascii character in the file and it can't be encoded/decodedAccording to read_csv() docs, you can specify the encoding type of your file. For example:If utf-8 don't work, you can try to specify other encoding types. A few files that I've worked with were encoded with cp1252, but I've already worked with latin_1 and iso8859, for example.Take a look at Python Standard Encodings.Setting the correct encoding type will allow Python Interpreter to fetch the correct translation of each set of bits in your file.
You are getting a UnicodeError which means your file encoding is different than unicode. Pandas use utf-8 as default encoding.In case you want to detect encoding of a file in Python you can try the below code:This also shows the confidence with which the detector predicted your file encoding.Once you know the encoding you can try this:You can find standard encodings in Python here.In Windows if you open your file with Notepad++ you will find these invalid characters highlighted (in case file is utf-8). It also determines what encoding your file has.
