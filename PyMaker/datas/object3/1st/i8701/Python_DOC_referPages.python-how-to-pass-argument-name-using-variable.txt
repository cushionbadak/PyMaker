A module I'm using has many functions defined with different argument names more or less serving the same purpose:and they appear all in different positions of the argument list (in the above simplified case they're all in position 1, but in reality that's not the case).I want to write a wrapper that can pass the actual start_date to any of these functions via a dictionary from function name to argument name:Then the actual wrapper:Clearly this doesn't work. Essentially the f2a[func_name] is not being recognized as a legit keyword. Does any one know how to do this, i.e. pass the argument name using a variable? Note func1 to func4 are externally defined and cannot be changed.
Make a dict with the argument name as the key, and pass it using unpack operator:See Unpacking argument lists in the Python tutorial.
