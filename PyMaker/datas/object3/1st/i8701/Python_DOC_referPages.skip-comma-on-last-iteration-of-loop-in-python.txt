I am trying to iterate over a dictionary in Python. The output has to resemble a certain format so it can be used as input for something else. The input looks like this: The output should look like this:I am really close to getting it with a for loop but I read that this can be done very easily with .join() in Python. Here is my code right now:Can I do this using .join? I read that join will allow me to skip the comma on the last iteration. I'm just not sure how to prepend my "operation," string to it all if I do it this way.
You can indeed use a str.join function here to join the different elements together:Or putting it in a one-liner (and even make it shorter):How does this work? As is specified in the documentation, str.join takes an iterable of strings and joins them together with the separator (here ','). So ','.join(['foo','bar','qux']) generates 'foo,bar,qux'.Now here we use a generator. For key,value pair in events.items(), we construct a string with '{0}={1}'.format(key,val). So if key='ok' and val='1', then {0}={1}'.format(key,val) will generate ok=1. Now we join all these together.Since str.join does not add a tailing separator, thus it meets the specifications of your question. join will usually also outperform string concatenation (in a loop).
the function you are looking for is str.rstrip()it takes a list of characters to remove so you can dobut the solution suggested by Willem Van Onsem is better, as it avoids the issue to begin with.
