If I have a binary string, let say str = "010100011010101001001101100101100110101" which is an encoded by base64 version of some other string how can I decode this string?
It would have been great if your example string is actually something meaningful rather than something made up which makes this question rather unclear, but I will try my best here to figure out what you might have meant in the most verbose manner possible.Assuming your actual input is a str that looks like this:You can get the hexadecimal form of this by casting it to int using the base keyword argumentThen turn it back into a string by formatting it like so:Then use the binascii.a2b_hex function on the hexadecimal string to get the raw bytes:If it is some valid base 64 encoded stream of bytes, you may then use base64.b64decode on that to get the actual bytesTo turn that into a string, apply the correct codec to it (i.e. use bytes.encode).Finally, if you cared to know how I generated that input, this is all the above, reversed into a single one-line function:
