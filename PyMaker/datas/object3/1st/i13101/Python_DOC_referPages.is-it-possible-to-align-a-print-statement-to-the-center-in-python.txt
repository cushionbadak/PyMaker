I was wondering if it was possible to align a print statement in Python (newest version). For example:would appear on the user's screen on the left side, so can i make it centre-aligned instead?Thank you so much for your help!= 80 (column) x 30 ( width)
First, use os.get_terminal_size() function to get the console's width(so you don't need to know your console before):Then, we can use str.center():So the clear code looks like:
Knowing the console width, you can also print centered using format:will print 'foo' in the middle of a 50-column console.
