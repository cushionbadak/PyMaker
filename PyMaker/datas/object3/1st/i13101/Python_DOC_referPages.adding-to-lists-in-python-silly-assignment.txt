I am to create a program that fills 3 lists with the following numbers:A - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10B - 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20C - 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100This is what I have so far:Is there a better or more efficient way to do this? My professor insists that this is "THE" way to do this. 
Yes, assuming python2:for python3 you would have to change the xrange to range and the first two to (these will work in python2 as well):However reading the "fine print" of the question may require you to insert these numbers to an existing list or append them to the list (as the title actually says). Then you could use the extend method:
The idiomatic way to do it in Python 3:How ever your teacher may want you to learn the basics of the for loop and the methods of lists, and in that case, the examples he gave you are spot on.In Python 2, range() returns a list, so you don't need to call list() on it. I do advise you to learn Python 3 though, as the version 2 is going to disappear in 5 years.
Firstly, I'd recommend you check PEP 0008 -- Style Guide for Python Code.More specifically: Naming Conventions.Now to the lists, Python has a really cool thing called: List Comprehensions. Which for your case I would write them as follows.
