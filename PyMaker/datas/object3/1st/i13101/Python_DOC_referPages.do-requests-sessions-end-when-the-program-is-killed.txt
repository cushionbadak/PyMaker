Is there anyway to pickup on a previous session when starting a python program?I've set session as a global variable so that it can be accessed across any method that needs it. However, I'm guessing when I start the program again the session variable is reset. Is there a way to come back to a previous session when starting the program?When I load up my program a second time I will only want to use check_data method, I'd prefer to not require an auth every time I start the program, or perhaps I'm just curious to see if it can be done ;)EDIT I've updated my solution with the accepted answer.Code obviously don't show proper accessor for other methods, but the idea works fine. Would be interested to know if this is the only way to remain authed. 
The sessions are tracked in http via cookies. You can save them between program restart by storing in a http.cookiejar.LWPCookieJarAt the beginning of your program you have to set the cookieJar to this FileCookieJar and load the existing cookies if any before closing your program you have to to save them to the fileNote that by default it has the same behavior than browser that it doesn't save session cookies which are not set to persistent to your browser across restart if you want a different behavior, just precise it to save() method by setting ignore_discard argument to False like this
It's not clear what kind of session you try to establish. Django? Flask? Something different?Be aware also that there seems to be a misspelling of call_data(sessions) where only session (without s) is defined.
