I have a date with events that happened on the date. I want to enumerate the list of events on the date when i show the calendar. Also I need to be able to delete an event from the list.I thought that this would let me access the secondary list under the date and enumerate it but I get an error.Example out:
Just change your command_show() function to this, if you don't use dict.items() then you will only get the keys(not both keys and values):Output:About why am I doing this:As you can see, I'm using enumerate() function here. From the document:Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence, an iterator, or some other object which supports iteration.  The __next__() method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable.So it will return something like [(0, 'Python class'), (1, 'Eye doctor'), (2, 'lunch with sid')] if the evernt is ['Python class', 'Eye doctor', 'lunch with sid']. Now we have [(0, 'Python class'), (1, 'Eye doctor'), (2, 'lunch with sid')], when we use for loop on it like for i in enumerate(event), i will be (0, 'Python class') at the first loop, and (1, 'Eye doctor') at the second loop, etc.And then, if you want to print something like 0: Python class(there is some spaces in front of the sting), we need manually put the spaces like '    '+(+ can join strings here, for example, 'foo'+'bar' is foobar). Then, because i is a tuple, I'm using slice. i[0] can get the first element in that tuple, i[1] can get the second, etc.Because i[0] is a integer, and we can't just do something like 0 + 'foobar'(will raise TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'). So we need use str() function to covert it to string. And then...maybe you'll understand.Also you can do something like:More clear? for num, event in enumerate(event) will give something like num = 0, evert = 'Python class' at the first loop, and...as I said.About sep, you could check the document for more details.
for ... in calendar: will only loop over the keys in the dictionary. You need to call .items() to get both keys and values:You can also simplify command_add by using .setdefault() method:
You can use a defaultdict which which take care of that if check for you; and loop through the calendar.iteritems() so that you get a tuple of key,value on each iteration.
