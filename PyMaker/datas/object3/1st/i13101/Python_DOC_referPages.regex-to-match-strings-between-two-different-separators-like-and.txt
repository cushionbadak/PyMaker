Natural Text
I want to split my text into contexts and captures where I have rules like:Here I want to create rules that only affect strings inside of the markers <>and example would be the output:using line.split('')[i] doesn't cut it because I have two different separators
You can use re.sub to replace the parts within <...>, using a replacement callback function:This will duplicate the chars in each of the tags, but you can extend the function any way you want to perform more complex substitutions.
