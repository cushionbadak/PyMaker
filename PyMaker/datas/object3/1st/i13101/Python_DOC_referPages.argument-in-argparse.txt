I am trying to pass 2 arguments, condition is if the 1st argument is not null, then it should store the 2nd argument. code is shown belowBut i am getting the following error:can anyone tell me whats exactly happening
Yu can use default and parser: 
I think you have glossed over the distinction between long options and short optionshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#destadd_argument creates an Action object.  Your example produces (as shown in an interactive session):Note that the dest is 'two', taken from your '--two'.  '-one' is in the list of option_strings, but does not set the dest.  This statement creates one Action, not two.When testing, it is a good idea to print the args object.  This gives you a better idea of what your parser produced.  Don't just straight to testing for attributes that might not even be there.'prog.py -one value' and 'prog.py --two value' will both produce an args that looks likeandIf you use both, it's the last value that will appear in the namespace (regardless of order)If instead you define 2 arguments:You can then test/use both after parsing
