I'm trying to make a calculator for something, but the formulas use a sigma, I have no idea how to do a sigma in python, is there an operator for it?Ill put a link here with a page that has the formulas on it for illustration:http://fromthedepths.gamepedia.com/User:Evil4Zerggin/Advanced_cannon
A sigma (âˆ‘) is a Summation operator. It evaluates a certain expression many times, with slightly different variables, and returns the sum of all those expressions.For example, in the Ballistic coefficient formulaThe Python implementation would look something like this:You may want to look at the enumerate function, and beware precision problems.
