I'm using a C++ server and a few Python clients with zmq ( ZeroMQ ) lib. I would like to send a float and an integer to the clients.I have read through the manual for zmq, but I have a problem sending anything else than a char array from the C++ code, which can not be interpreted by the python client as integer or float.My C++ code looks like this:And the python client is something like this:Output for python:Received reply [b'M3:155\x00\xcc']Command is: b'M3:155'Motor: b'M3'Target Angle: b'155'How can I parse the b'155' as an int or float?Thank you in advance!
Erm...
