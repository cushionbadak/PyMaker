I am new to Python and trying things out with psutil.After I get the IO counters from the function , it says that it returns a tuple but then why the returned result looks more like a dictionary ?I can get the data extracted as tuples but whats with the "Keys " listed for each value in this tuple ? How do I extract them ?for example what if I want to extract the string "bytes_sent" from the tuple?Also is this really a Tuple? I can see data enclosed in ( ).
This will be a collections.namedtuple.  You can interact with it either as tuple, or by using its attributes.  Best of both worlds and all that.
