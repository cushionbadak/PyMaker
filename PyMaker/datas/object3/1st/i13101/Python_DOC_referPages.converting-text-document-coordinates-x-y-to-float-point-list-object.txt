Natural Text
I have a text file containing coordinates I want to put into a python-based graph (graph is from kivy.garden.graph module, which I have working).The text file, when I use open().read(), looks like this:And is string type. And I need it to go into the graph module as:Note, the text file will be updated in real-time, which the graph module can handle. Or at best, pick the last 10 x,y points created. Also, I can manipulate the text file as I have output it myself from another function outside.Apologies for the simplicity of this, but I have been scratching my head over converting this now for the last 24 hours. I have only managed to get this:(space after the comma at the end)Note the extra comma and space, and it's only through string manipulation using replace(), rather than what I need is float type.
Use the strip and split methods to break each line into the appropriate coordinates.The whole thing can be done more efficiently with a list comprehension; the above is more readable.
Based on the input provided and the output you are trying to achieve, you can make use of literal_eval from ast. Furthermore, for this particular case, it might make it easier to manage the data if you use readlines() instead of read(). readlines will give you a list. Take a look at this: Input:Output: (type will be a list)
In my experience it will be easier if the data were saved just as:number1 \t number2 \nAnyway, one option to do what you want will be:This should work. If the file if updated i think you should open it again at it will work
