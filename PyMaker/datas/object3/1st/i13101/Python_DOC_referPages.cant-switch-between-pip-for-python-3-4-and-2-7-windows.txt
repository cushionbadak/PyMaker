I have python 3.4 installed on my windows for a while but now I need to get 2.7 to work another project. I downloaded the 2.7.10 package from the official python and installed it. Everything was fine until I tried to install packages using pip.What I have read in different places is that pip-2.7 should work but the command is not recognized. If I get get-pip.py to try to install pip using py get-pip.py it tells me it's already installed.So is there anyway to get this working?
Taken from the docspy -2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2py -2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7py -3   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 3py -3.4 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 3.4So in your case you'll need either of the two:
