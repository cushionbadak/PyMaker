I need to write a function where, for any list, each element in the list is added together and to see if it equals a constant. For example:The sum of each element added together is 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7.And then to test each of these results to a constant eg if the output = C where C = 3, and append the two numbers that were summed to equal the constant to a new list to be printed.I am not allowed to use indexing here.So far I am able to add the numbers in pairs along the list:But for some reason this misses out the last 2 elements in the list when iterating over it.
I couldn't quite follow your code or explanation quite well, but I believe this does what you want. This is done without the itertools module. Using it would produce a more compact code. This is done as an alternative to itertoolsif you wish to use itertools then you would use
