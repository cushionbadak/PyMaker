Natural Text
I want to prompt the user to input specific data from a text file(keys) so my dictionary can give the value for each of them.It works like this:but it prints 'try again' if I input a random key from my list. (which is the following: D1,TyrannasaurousD2,ApatasaurosD3,VelociraptorD4,TricerotopsD5,PterodactylT1,Diesel-ElectricT2,Steam EngineT3,Box CarT4,Tanker CarT5,CabooseB1,BaseballB2,BasketballB3,FootballB4,SoftballB5,Tennis BallB6,VollyeballB7,Rugby BallB8,Cricket BallB9,Medicine Ballbut if I do it in order it works. How can I fix this program so I can input any key at any time and it will still print its corresponding value?
You need to read in the whole file before prompting for your search term. So you'll need two loops -- one to get the whole data in, and a second loop to search through he data.Here's what your updated code will look like. I replaced the file input with an array so that I could run it using a web tool:Output here: https://repl.it/BVxh
To read the file into dictionary:To print values corresponding to the input keys provided by a user from a command-line interactively until quit key is received:It uses two-argument iter(func, sentinel).
