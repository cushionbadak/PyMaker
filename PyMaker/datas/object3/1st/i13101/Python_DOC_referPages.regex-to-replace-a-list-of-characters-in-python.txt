I have a list of characters that I want to find in a string and replace its multiple occurances together into just one occurance.But I am facing 2 problems - when i loop over them, the re.sub function does not replace the multiple occurances and when i have a smiley like :) it replaces ':' with ':)' which I dont want.Here is the code that I tried.If I take a single character and try it works as shown below.But looping over a list of characters gives error.How to solve these 2 problems? Thanks for the help.
