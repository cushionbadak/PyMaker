I am using sqlite3 for db access in a python module. I frequently use enums in my python objects. Currently I have to convert my enums into strings before inserting them into the sqlite db. My following attempt to register a generic adapter to make this conversion implicit fails. The above implementation results in the following error.Registering an adapter for each enum, as shown below works fine howeverThe adapter for MyEnum works as expected. But going this way I have to register an adapter for all my enums separately. Is there a way to remove this redundancy?P.S. I am using python 2.7
Looks like the easier way is to build the adaptation into the Enum itself:and then use SqliteEnum as the base for your other Enum classes.
