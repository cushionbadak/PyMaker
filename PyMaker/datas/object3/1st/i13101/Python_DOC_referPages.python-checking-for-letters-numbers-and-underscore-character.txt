I have to write a program that checks if a user's variable name is valid. These are the rules I am checking for: Only letters, numbers, and the underscore character are allowed. The first character cannot be a number.I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Every time I run the program, it tells me that it's a valid variable, even for invalid inputs.Here is my program: Here is a sample output (if done right): Thank you in advance!
