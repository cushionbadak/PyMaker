This question already has an answer here:How to remove items from a list while iterating?                    23 answers                isdigit() doesn't work here:
isdigit does not pass the check for floats represented as a string.The help of isdigit specifies: So, with that, your work around will be to find some other way to determine whether something does in fact pass the "number" check. What you can do is wrap an attempt to convert each item to a float in a try/except and then append to a new list for every item that falls in to the except:an alternative can be to modify the function to simply return True or False based on the float test, and make use of filter to "filter" the list based on the result of the remove_numbers method. (Thanks @Pynchia)In terms of performance, there is no real advantage between the two, probably because the gain in the implementation of filter is spent by the extra frame setup in the call to not_a_float
Isdigit doesnt work if the number have decimals. Return False in this case.
See https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.htmlstr.isdigit()Return True if all characters in the string are digits and  there is at least one character, False otherwise.Your string contains also the decimal dot and that's why the function returns False.
