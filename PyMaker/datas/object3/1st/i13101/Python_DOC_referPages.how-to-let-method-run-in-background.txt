I am calling python method from robot keyword. But I do not want robot framework to wait until test is finished because I want to run that method continuously. How to continue running next test case?e.g. I am calling start logs (python method) from robot keyword After starting logs I want to run other test cases. But robot framework keeps waiting for above.
You can do:using subprocess.Popen as Colonel Thirty Two mentioned in the comments.
There is a Keyword for that! Start Process will call any keyword but will not wait for it to return. Don't forget to add the Process library to your project.
