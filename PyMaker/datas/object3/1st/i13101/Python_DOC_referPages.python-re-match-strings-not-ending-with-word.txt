I'm trying to match all strings not ending with a specific word. For some reason the following doesn't work:Can you please explain why it's not working and how to fix it?
That's exactly what str.endswith() is for.And if you are dealing with file names you can use fnmatch module which provides support for Unix shell-style wildcards:And if you want to check that your string stats with a specific pattern you can use str.startswith() method alongside the str.endswith() :
I think you want to use a negative lookbehind, not lookahead.See demo at regex101 if this is what you needed.(?!ico)$ or $(?!ico) would look if there is not ico after the end which is impossible.
You should use:(?!.*ico$) asserts that string doesn't end with ico
