This loop keeps looping even if I enter "no" and when I type "jdlfjap", for example, it continues to loop without a "?".Does anyone know why this is?
The statement if continueMaking == "Yes" or "yes" or "YES": is equivalent to (continueMaking == "Yes") or "yes" or "YES": which, regardless of the value of continueMaking returns the string "YES", which is truthy and thus the makeContact call always executes. Case-insensitive string comparisons can be accomplished by continueMaking.lower() == "yes".
Overwriting the function continueMaking with the variable continueMaking adds confusion. Choose a different variable name. Readability counts.
