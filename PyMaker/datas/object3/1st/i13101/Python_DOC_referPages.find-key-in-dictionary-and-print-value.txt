Hello everyone I am stuck on a class assignment and not sure where to go at this point as my college does not offer tutors for the programming field as this is the first semester that this has been offered. Assignment is:Write a program that:Prints out the toy name for that code in a useful message such as, ‘The toy for that code is a Baseball’The program exits when instead of a toy code, the user enters ‘quit’below is a sample of the text file that the dict is suppose to populate fromD1,TyrannasaurousD2,ApatasaurosD3,VelociraptorD4,TricerotopsD5,PterodactylT1,Diesel-ElectricT2,Steam EngineT3,Box Carand what I have gotten so far is:****and to be honest I am not even sure I am right with what I have. any help at all would be greatly appreciate thank you.
There are two issues.Your dictionary isn't getting populated; however there currently isn't enough info in your question to help with that problem. Need to know what the file looks like, etc.Your lookup loop won't display the values for keys that match. Below is the solution for that.Try iterating over key:value pairs like this:Take a look at the docs for dict.items():items():Return a new view of the dictionary’s items ((key, value) pairs).
You should make yourself familiar with basic python programming. In order to solve such tasks you need to know about basic data structures and loops.
