I need to enable/disable fullscreen and maximized window (--zoomed) in Python 3.x using Tkinter.This is my codeIt shows the image, but i can't zoom/enable fullscreen. 
You are defining callbacks not binding them to anything in your application.  To get a callback to react it needs to be bound  to an event (e.g. tk.bind ("<Key>", callback) )Please have a look on the documentation of event / event-binding.  You can bind the event like shown in this SO question.What is it you want to do using repr.event.F11 / repr.event.Escape? print something?Please make sure to fix your indentation.You can also bind F11 and Escape to your callbacks using tk.bind("<F11>", fullscreen_on)tk.bind("<Escape>", fullscreen_off)
