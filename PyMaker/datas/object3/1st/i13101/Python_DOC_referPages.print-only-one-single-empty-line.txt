I am reading files in a folder in a python. I want print the each file content separate by a single empty line.So, after the for loop I am adding print("\n") which adding two empty lines of each file content. How can I resolve this problem?
will print a single new line in Python 3 (no parens needed in Python 2).The docs for print() describe this behavior (notice the end parameter), and this question discusses disabling it.
Because print automatically adds a new line, you don't have to do that manually, just call it with an empty string:
From help(print) (I think you're using Python 3):print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.     Optional keyword arguments:file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.     sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.     end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.     flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.So print()'s default end argument is \n. That means you don't need add a \n like print('\n'). This will print two newlines, just use print().By the way, if you're using Python 2,  use print.
print has a \n embedded in it....so you don't need to add \n by yourself
Or, if you want to be really explicit, useWrite method doesn't append line break by default. It's probably a bit more intuitive than an empty print.
