I have a folder where I have around 20000 JSON files. I want to find out all the unique keys of each JSON and I want take an union of all the keys. However, I got stuck in the initial step only. I am able to find the keys of a single JSON file.I have wrote the following code till now:It is giving me an error as follows:My JSON is a nested json. Please suggest me how can I get all the keys.
Instead of for key, value in jdata:, use for key, value in jdata.items(): like this:Take a look at the docs for dict:items():Return a new view of the dictionaryâ€™s items ((key, value) pairs).EDIT: If you want to get all of the nested keys and not just the top level ones, you could take an approach like those suggested in another answer like so:
You should use either dict.items() or dict.iteritems() in for key, value in jdataSo, it should be eitherORfor python3 and python2 respectively.See answers on this question to know the difference between the two: What is the difference between dict.items() and dict.iteritems()?If you only need to iterate over keys of the dictionary, you can even try dict.keys() or dict.iterkeys()
