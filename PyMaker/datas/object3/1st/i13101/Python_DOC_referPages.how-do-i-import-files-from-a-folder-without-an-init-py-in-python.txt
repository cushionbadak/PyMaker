I saw some code of this format:However there is no __init__.py in b and I do not undersand how it succeeds.The directory structure looks like this:Is it possible to from b.c import * in a.py even if there is no __init__.py in folder b?
This is not possible in Python 2.7 due to how the PYTHONPATH is constructed. See this question for an excellent explanation.However nothing is impossible in python...Thanks to PEP 420: Implicit Namespace Packages: this is indeed possible in Python 3.3 and up.__init__.py files are now optional for namespace packages:Using Python 3.5 on Windowsb/c.pya.pyThen:More information about the caveats of namespace packages versus regular packages can be found in the PEP and in David Beazley's excellent talkModules and Packages: Live and Let Die!
