I want to implement an exception displayer and it doesn't work, but I have something different:How can be raised an OSError when I specified IOError?
IOError is only an alias for OSError in Python3, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#concrete-exceptions:Changed in version 3.3: EnvironmentError, IOError, WindowsError,  VMSError, socket.error, select.error and mmap.error have been  merged into OSError, and the constructor may return a subclass.
