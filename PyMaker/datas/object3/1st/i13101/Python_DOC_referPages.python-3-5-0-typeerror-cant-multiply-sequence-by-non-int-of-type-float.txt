I can't make this to work.I've tried:Tried to seek other solutions, but still can't solve this.
Floating point is the devil, just divide:If you need to convert from a non-fixed float to a rough int divisor, one approach would be to divide 1 by the float to get the inverse, then convert to int (with int constructor, or round or whatever you like), e.g.:
In your tenth line you only specify the type of the expression (len(namesList)) as float but the output you want to be converted to a float is (len(namesList))*0.25, so I guees it doesn't give you the right output.In my opinion it would be : float(len(namesList)*0.25)
