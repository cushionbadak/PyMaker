Natural Text
I'm learning subprocess, but I have a little confusion with this code:Output:As you can see, the output is formated. But I dont know why there is the character b'' and the \n at the end.If I run this command in my terminal, there aren't these char.Normal output:How could I remove them?
You're probably using python3 - python changed up the way certain objects read/write data, and now there's a real bytes() object. To get the string you want, you just need:You may also need to strip the newline (\n) from your output; I can't remember how stdout does the buffering/reporting:
b'' is a text representation for bytes objects in Python 3.To print bytes as is, use a binary stream -- sys.stdout.buffer:To get the output as text (Unicode string), you could use universal_newlines=True parameter:locale.getpreferredencoding(False) character encoding is used to decode the output.If the child process uses a different encoding, then you could specify it explicitly using io.TextIOWrapper():For Python 2 code and links to possible issues, see Python: read streaming input from subprocess.communicate()
I think you use python 3:b is for Bytes, and  it indicates that it is a byte sequence which is equivilent to a normal string in Python 2.6+see https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#literals
