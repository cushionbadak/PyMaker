To CLARIFY: this question is not a duplicate of this one, I have already tried all the hints there and didn't get the answer. I have a txt file with unicode data in, and am want to open the file as an string. I tried but there is an error saying:UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\ufeff' at  position Y: character maps to undefinedNow my question is, I don't care about my UTF-8 characters at all, is there anyway to put an exception that whenever python is encountering utf-8 character just remove it or pass it?   Also to clarify, I have tried the encoding with, utf-8, utf-8-sig, utf-16 and etc. I tried this as well but no luck.I also tried importing codecs and the code below:but still same error is popping out. 
Correcting my answer for encoding in print statement:Avoid printing to stdout Windows, because Python assumes that CMD terminal can only handle Windows-1252 (MS copy of ISO of latin-1). This is easily sidestepped by always printing to stderr instead:On Linux there should be no issue with printing Unicode correctly.P.S.: for Python 2.x:P.P.S.:Original answer:For python 3.x:See https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#error-handlers for a detailed list of your options
