In Python, whenever I try to use .sort() or a random.shuffle() on a list like such:The a and b will be None as both methods return None. Of course, I am aware that there is a sorted() function for .sort(). However, the random.shuffle() does not. So the fix for this is to do:or from another post:Is there a general and elegant way to store literals, edited by methods that return None, into a variable?
This will shuffle a, and point b to a copy of it.or - used to chain, returns first truth value (or last false)a[:] - copies aNote: the original a will change. random.shuffle modifies any list it is given (from the docs):Shuffle the sequence x in place...My advice is just write your own shuffle method.
