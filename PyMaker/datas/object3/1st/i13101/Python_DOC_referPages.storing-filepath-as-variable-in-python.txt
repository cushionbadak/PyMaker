I'm sure this is an easy question but I have searched for a while to no avail. I want to define a file path as a variable and use that variable elsewhere in my python code on Ubuntu. What I have so far is:and I call on it later in the code as:When I do this, I get an error saying that a float was expected and not a string. How can I get this to work?Thanks in advance!
use file = open('%s/EventLog.txt' % (filefolder), "a") with %s instead of %fBut you are much better off using os.path.join(filefolder, 'EventLog.txt')
You passed a formatter that expected a float (%f) not a string (%s). You can either replace this with %s/Event log.txt or just concatenate it directly like so, filefolder + '/Event log.txt.Do note that you're  better off working with os module directly for essentially anything to do with paths :-) Will edit answer if you require further explanation as II sent this from phone.
