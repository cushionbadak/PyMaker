I'm defining a methodI wonder, how can I use type hinting feature to specify that class should be passed in the first argument.Basically, what should I put instead of ??? mark up there? Thanks.UPD: Here is some more code to be more specific on what I am trying to achieve.
You just use the class itself.From the PEP (emphasis mine):Type hints may be built-in classes (including those defined in standard library or third-party extension modules), abstract base classes, types available in the types module, and user-defined classes (including those defined in the standard library or third-party modules).
I could be wrong, as I haven't been getting down and dirty in Python 3.5 as yet, but looking at the documentation you should be able to do it with typing.Optional. A brief example.Hope that helps.
