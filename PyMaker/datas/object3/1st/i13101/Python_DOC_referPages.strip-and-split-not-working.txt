Task of program: Delete all punctuation marks and split string2 to wordsThen each word put in list2Put each word of string1 in list1Print listsCode:Result:list2 should not have any spaces or punctuation. Why is it returning the same values as the unstripped, unsplit list?
You are making two mistakes:You are ignoring the return values of str.strip() and str.split(). Strings are immutable, these methods return new objects.You are stripping, then splitting, leaving punctuation between words in place, because stripping only removes characters from the start and end.Split first, then strip, and store the results:I used a list comprehension to process each result from the str2.split() call in turn:
Delete all punctuation marks and split string2 to wordsThen each word put in list2then, you can:Put each word of string1 in list1I don't understand this one.by the way, remember assign the result, or you'll loss them.str2.strip(string.punctuation)str2.split()the reason why list1 == list2 is you just add each element in str1 and str2 to list1 and list2, str1 equals to str2, so list1 equals to list2
