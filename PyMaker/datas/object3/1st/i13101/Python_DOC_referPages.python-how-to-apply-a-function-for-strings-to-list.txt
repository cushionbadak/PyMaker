This question already has an answer here:Call int() function on every list element?                    7 answers                Suppose I have a function that cleans a string (ex. make the string all uppercase letters and etc).How do I apply this function to strings in a list and return a cleaned list?I think this uses for loops but I just can't get around it.
List comprehensions are the modern way to do this:
That's exactly what map() function is for:Note:In python 3.X map returns an iterator which is more optimized in terms of memory use, but if you want to get a list you can use list() function to convert the result to list, or better you can use a list comprehension But if you are dealing with large data and you just want to loop over the result you better to use map() in in python 3.X or a generator expression in python 2.X.
