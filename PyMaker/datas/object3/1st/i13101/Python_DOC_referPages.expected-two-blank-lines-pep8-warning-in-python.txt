I'm using vim editor as python IDE. Below is a simple python program to calculate square root of a number:And the warnings are :Can you please tell why these warnings are coming?
The previous will fix your PEP8 problems. After your import you need to have 2 new lines before starting your code. Also, between each def foo() you need to have 2 as well.In your case you had 0 after import, and you had 1 newline between each function. Part of PEP8 you need to have a newline after the end of your code. Unfortunately I don't know how to show it when I paste your code in here.Pay attention to the naming, it's part of PEP8 as well. I changed complex to complex_num to prevent confusion with builtin complex.In the end, they're only warning, they can be ignored if needed.
Here is the link to the documentation:PEP8 Style Guide for PythonYou should add two spaces between the functions, as shown below:
You need to give two blank lines between meaningful code blocks.These include (for example):The import blockEach function
Here if you see the two lines space after import statement for second code snippet which will not give any warnings.Again if you are writing two methods definition you have two give two lines as space between your code block. 
All answers seem to be correct. To avoid doing this by hand, you can also use the autopep8 package (pip install autopep8). The result of calling autopep8 filename.py is the same:PS: have a look at if __name__ == "__main__":
