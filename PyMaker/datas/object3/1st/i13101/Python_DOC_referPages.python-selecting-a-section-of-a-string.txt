Natural Text
I have a list of strings that I pulled from a text file. I need to read each line and "select" two specific parts. Here is an example line from the text file (firewall report):I need to save the IP address that comes after "Workstations:" and know that they are the "workstation IPs" and I need to save the server IPs as such as well.I imagine the best technique would be to create two lists, one for workstation IPs and one for server IPs, and read each line and write the IPs to their respective lists.But in order to do that I need to select them, which I might do like this:With 'a' being the start of the workstation IP and 'b' being the end (and 'c' and 'd' relating to server IPs).However, not all the lines are the same length, so that method of selection won't work. Does anyone have any ideas on how to extract those two strings from the line?PS: this is my first question, so please let me know of errors and I can resubmit it. Thanks!)
You can use str.partition to split the string up and get the parts you want:To avoid repetition, make a function:
use regex!example:
If the number of spaces is consistent, you could try this, which splits on whitespace, removes the astrisks, and takes the content after the first colon
This is one way you could do it, using split and list comp:Or with regex and list comp:Both yield:
