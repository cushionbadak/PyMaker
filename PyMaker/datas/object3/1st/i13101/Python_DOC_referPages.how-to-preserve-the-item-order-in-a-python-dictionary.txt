I am writing a script in which the computer will play a game of war with itself. I need the script to only return the value of the first entry in the list:        Note: This is only an exampleI would like this script to only return the value of the first entry.
Since dictionaries are unordered, and if you are dependent on using a dictionary, but order matters to you, you should consider using an OrderedDict from collections. This will preserve the order of your dictionary based on insertion. So, if you enter a, v, b, it will be in that order.Demo: To get the first value based on requirements to get only the first entry: 
The built-in Dictionaries are not ordered collections in the sense that you don't access the values by indexed positions (i.e. 1st, 2nd, etc).Instead, you access them by keys (e.g. test['hey'], test['hi'], etc.). For example:You should look at the Python docs on using dictionaries.If you want to access elements by position (i.e. an index), then you should consider using a list or a tuple instead.You might want to look at the OrderedDict class docs instead if you wish to preserve order while still using a dictionary. Quoting from the docs:An OrderedDict is a dict that remembers the order that keys  were first inserted. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the  original insertion position is left unchanged. Deleting an entry and  reinserting it will move it to the end.See idjaw's post for a good example on using the OrderedDict.
