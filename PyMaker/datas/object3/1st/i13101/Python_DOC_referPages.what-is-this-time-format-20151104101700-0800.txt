I am parsing an xml file exported from iOS Health App. The records of start time has this format:I am just wondering what does the part '15170-0800' stand for. Can anyone help?
20151002151700-0800 would be the format CCYYMMDDHHMMSS-TZ.So, the 151700 portion of your question is the time, in Hours Minutes Seconds.What follows after would be a + or -, and how many hours and minutes you're offset from UTC, so the -0800 would be UTC-8 timezone.
It doesn't look like a standard time format (such as rfc 3339) or a default time format for a Date Formatter but it is easy to parse anyway.The time format is %Y%m%d%H%M%S%z:Note: it differs from @Christian Witts's answer (- is a part of the numerical utc offset).Don't use the label UTC-8 in the programming context; it may be ambiguous. If you don't know the timezone name such as America/Los_Angeles; just numeric offset (-0800) is less ambiguous.
