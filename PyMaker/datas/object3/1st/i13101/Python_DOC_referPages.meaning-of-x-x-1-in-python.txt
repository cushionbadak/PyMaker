I am studying this snippet of python code. What does X = X[:, 1] mean in last line?
So what that line did is sliced the array, taking all rows (:) but keeping the second column (1)
it is simply like you are specifying the axis. Consider the starting column as 0 then as you go through 1,2 and so on.The syntax is x[row_index,column_index]you can also specify a range of row values as per need in row_index also eg:1:13 extracts first 13 rows along with whatever specified in column
