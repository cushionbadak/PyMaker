To make an instance of a random class:
Take a look at random.choice, it lets you choose a random element from a sequence.
Classes are first-class objects in Python, which means that you can store them in variables and pass them around. So for instance, you could make a list/tuple of all your possible classes and then pick random ones:This uses random.choice() to generate a 5x5 set of randomly chosen instances.
