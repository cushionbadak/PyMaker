I am new to python so a simplified explanation would be appreciated  :)I have been assigned a task which requires me to take a csv file, with two columns, the first for a name and the second for a score. With this data i would like to create a single list containing this data for every row in the csv file. so it should look something like this:I have managed to get that far however the task then requires me to group names and scores together and put them into a new list. This is what it should look like:Essentially it is taking all of the scores from elements that have the same name and grouping them together in a new list.As i am new to python i am finding this a little difficult to comprehend would someone be able to point me in the direction to the solution for my problem?
You can use a dictionary https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) to create a  mapping from names to a list of values. For example:Prints
I'm not sure how you're reading this file in from CSV, but you could do something like this:The following result for print list2: 
I would do this with a single function:Open your documentRead each line, storing them as a listStore each of these [name,number] lists in a meta-listdissect and sort the meta-list into a dictionaryIf you want to test this code, just do the following:copy/paste this code into a fileAdd "print(names)" to the end of the filerun sort('yourFile.csv').
