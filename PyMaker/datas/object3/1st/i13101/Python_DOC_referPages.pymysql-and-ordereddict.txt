I've been using PyMySQL for a while now and created my own wrapper that I'm used to to shorthand writing queries.  Nonetheless I've been creating CSV files with OrderedDict because I need to keep the order the same but I realize that if I use PyMySQL for querying the database, I will not get the order the database is giving back.  This is a little annoying for spot checking CSV files if I wanted to just dump stuff rather than hand write the orders.My question is, how do I use PyMySQL with OrderedDict? Currently my code is as follows:So whenever I query, I'll be getting a dictionary back:What I want is that when I roll through cursor I'm actually retrieving an OrderedDict of the columns in the order they come in from the database.Something like:
You could use cursors.DictCursorMixin and change its dict_type to collections.OrderedDict (the default is dict):Then you can use the new cursor class as shown below
