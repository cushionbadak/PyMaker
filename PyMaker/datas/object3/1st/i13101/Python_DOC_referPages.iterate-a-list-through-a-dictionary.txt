I have a list with the same values as the keys of a dictionary. I want to write a code that does something to the values of the dictionary (e.g. increases them by one) as many times as their key appears in the list.So e.g. I tried this code:But it raises this error:Could you tell me why it doesn't work and how I can make it?
dict.__iter__ will by default refer to dict.keys().Because you want both the key and its value it should bewhich will yield a list of tuples:iteritems is also available, but yields from a  generator instead of a list:However, you should take into consideration directly indexing by key, otherwise your assignment v=v+1 will not be persisted to the dict:
You're missing the point of having a dictionary, which is that you can index it directly by key instead of iterating over it:
It looks like you're trying to use a dictionary as a counter. If that's the case, why not use the built-in Python Counter?
I suggest you use collections.Counter, which is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects.
You can iterate a dictionary like this:
dictx.items() instead of dictx. When trying to iterate over dictx you are receiving only keys.
