Here is a simple Python (version 3.4) code I've written to get a 32bit sized integer (int type I would assume) from an array of 4 bytes:However, none of the attempts (tempint2/tempint3/tempint4) gives the value I expected (4-byte size integer). Somehow, the size is all 18 bytes (sys.getsizeof() function result). Can you tell me how to get the expected answer (4-byte or 32bit size integer)?
First of all, due to Python's... ahem... "magic", sys.getsizeof() won't return the length of a list, but the sizeof the whole datastructure as represented internally by the Python interpreter.Now, the answer (for integers) is simply... (for all combinations of Python 2.x/Python 3.x and 32-bit/64-bit):Note: It appears that log(x, 2) breaks for x >= pow(2, 48) - 1, and so does the whole algorithm. This is probably an issue from the C library/the stupid floating-point accurracy errors, because log(n, x) in Python is translated into log(n) / log(x) in C.Edit: This one is an optimized version for Python 3.x that is independent of bot floating-point and logarithmic operations, and thus is accurate on all situations...The other functions are the same.I hope this has led some light on you!
