I am using "import re and sys"On the terminal, when I type "1.py a.txt"I want it to read "a.txt", which has these content:then use regex, to remove everything but the ip addresses and the length(total), and print it out as:but if there are duplicates, then it will read as follows, where it will add the total amounts of the duplicates:Furthermore, if i type "-s" in the terminal like so:orit should sort, for the first -s, it will sort and print the content, and if -s ip, then sort the ips.currently this is what I have for each item, I want to know how to use them all together.That is what I have so far, I do not know how to use the "-s" or how to sort, as well as how to remove the duplicates, and add the totals when duplicates are removed.
what you need is ArgumentParser for your -s parameter, so something like:now you can use the script like:orapart from that, on how to put all together, looks like a homework, so you should read more about python to figure it out.
To read the -s you probably want a library to parse the arguments, like the standard argparse. It allows you to specify which arguments your script requires, and their descriptions, and it parses them and ensure their format.To sort a list there's the sorted(my_list) function.Finally, to ensure there are no duplicates you can use a set. This loses the list ordering, but since you are sorting it later it shouldn't be a problem.Alternatively, there's the Counter collection made specifically to add grouped values and sort them.
ArgumentParser to be added- By the way below code works fine for input file path-It prints-
