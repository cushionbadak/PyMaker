Natural Text
I want to implement below logic in c++ using python.python version is like this, which is not completed yet, since I haven't found a way to convert text to unsigned char. So, please help!Take text=u'连衣裙女韩范' for example, c++ version returns 18 for text.size() and sum is 2422173716, while, in python, I don't know how to make it 18.The equality of text size is essential, as a start at least.
Because you are using unicode, for an exact reproduction you will need to turn text in a series of bytes (chars in c++).You should use more pythonic idioms for iterating over a pair of sequencesWhat if bytes_ is longer than primes? Use itertools.cycleAll together:
