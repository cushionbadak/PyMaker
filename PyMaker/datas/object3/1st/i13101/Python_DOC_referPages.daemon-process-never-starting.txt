I am having a problem understanding why the deamon process never produces the "Starting/Exiting" output. It seems the process is killed the moment I am calling n.start()
Daemon processes usually disconnected from stdin/stdout/stderr descriptors, because they don't need any interaction with the user. So, I think you need to assign some custom stream (maybe some logger which writes to file) to sys.stdout if you want to log somethingUPD:You can test your code using a pipe connected to the parent process. Using this pipe, you can transfer your messages to the parent process, instead of STDOUT.
