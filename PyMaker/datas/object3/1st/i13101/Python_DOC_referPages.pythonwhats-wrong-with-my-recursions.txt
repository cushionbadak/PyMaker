I want to performe to find out the P(nth)termI have this for nowWhen I enter 1 for n, the result is 0.7071067811865476, which is only equal to the part " sqrt(1/2) ". Why?
In case you want to make it recursive dowhich works out asAs @JoshRomRock points out, python generally limits the maximum depth of the recursion (the default max depth is platform-dependent).In case of CPython, the default limit is 1000.In case you want to alter such limit do:Note: in this case, the precision offered by the floating point representation may well be the biggest hurdle to the calculation. Please see the official docs for further info on what to expect using floats.Second note: in case the P function is going to be used several times and/or in multiple points of the code of a program, as a library function, it would make sense to implement it using Memoization.Please see here for a few examples in python.
Could it be what you're looking for ?
