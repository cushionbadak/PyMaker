currently I need to install some package using apt or rpm, according the OS.I saw the lib "apt" to update or upgrade the system, but it is possible use it to install a single package?I was trying to use too "subprocess":But this command shows all process in the shell, I cannot hide it.Thank you for your help.
You can use check_call from the subprocess library. Dump the stdout to /dev/null, or os.devnull in this case.os.devnull is platform independent, and will return /dev/null on POSIX and nul on Windows (which is not relevant since you're using apt-get but, still good to know :) )
Thank guys ! I use part of each solution. My code:Added: stdout and .wait Thank you one more time from Argentina !
For this particular task, as an alternative to subprocess you might consider using Fabric, a python deployment tool to automate builds.
Use this to redirect the output to /dev/null:The call to .wait() will block until the apt-get is complete.
