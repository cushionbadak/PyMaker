Possible Duplicate:How do you split a list into evenly sized chunks in Python? I am surprised I could not find a "batch" function that would take as input an iterable and return an iterable of iterables.For example:or:Now, I wrote what I thought was a pretty simple generator:But the above does not give me what I would have expected:So, I have missed something and this probably shows my complete lack of understanding of python generators. Anyone would care to point me in the right direction ?[Edit: I eventually realized that the above behavior happens only when I run this within ipython rather than python itself]
This is probably more efficient (faster)It avoids building new lists.
FWIW, the recipes in the itertools module provides this example:It works like this:
As others have noted, the code you have given does exactly what you want.  For another approach using itertools.islice you could see an example of following recipe:
Weird, seems to work fine for me in Python 2.x
This is what I use in my project. It handles iterables or lists as efficiently as possible.
This would work for any iterable. It would work like this:PS: It would not work if iterable has None values.
Here is an approach using reduce function.Oneliner:Or more readable version:Test:
