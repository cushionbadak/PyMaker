I am at a scenario where I call api and based on the results from api I call database for each record that I in api. My api call return strings and when I make the database call for the items return by api, for some elements I get the following error. The segment of my code the above error is referring is:After doing some google search I tried the following on my command line to understand whats going on...But I am not sure what would be the solution to overcome this issue. Also I don't know what is the theory behind encode('cp1252') it would be great if I can get some explanation on what I tried above. 
If you need Latin-1 encoding, you have several options to get rid of the en-dash or other code points above 255 (characters not included in Latin-1):Or do your own custom replacements:If you aren't required to output Latin-1, then UTF-8 is a common and preferred choice.  It is recommended by the W3C and nicely encodes all Unicode code points:
The unicode character u'\02013' is the "en dash". It is contained in the Windows-1252 (cp1252) character set (with the encoding x96), but not in the Latin-1 (iso-8859-1) character set. The Windows-1252 character set has some more characters defined in the are x80 - x9f, among them the en dash.The solution would be for you to choose a different target character set than Latin-1, such as Windows-1252 or UTF-8, or to replace the en dash with a simple "-".
u.encode('utf-8') converts it to bytes which can then be printed on stdout using sys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes)checkout the displayhook on https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
