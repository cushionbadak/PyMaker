I wanted to know what is the pythonic function for this : I want to remove everything before the wa path.For instance, I want '/book/html/wa/foo/bar/' to become '/wa/foo/bar/'.
A better answer would be to use os.path.relpath:http://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.relpath

For Python 3.4+, you should use pathlib.PurePath.relative_to.From the documentation:Also see this StackOverflow question for more answers to your question.
