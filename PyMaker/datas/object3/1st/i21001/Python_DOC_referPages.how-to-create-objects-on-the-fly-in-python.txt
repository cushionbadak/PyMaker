How do I create objects on the fly in Python? I often want to pass information to my Django templates which is formatted like this:which makes the template look untidy. so I think it's better to just create an object which is like:so I can do:instead of calling the dictionary.Since I just need that object once, is it possible to create it without writing a class first? Is there any short-hand code? Is it ok to do it like that or is it bad Python?
You can use built-in type function:But in this specific case (data object for Django templates), you should use @Xion's solution.
In Django templates, the dot notation (testobj.test) can resolve to the Python's [] operator. This means that all you need is an ordinary dict:Pass it as testobj variable to your template and you can freely use {{ testobj.test }} and similar expressions inside your template. They will be translated to testobj['test']. No dedicated class is needed here.
Use collections.namedtuple.
There is another solution in Python 3.3+ types.SimpleNamespace
use building function type: documentfirst and second X are identical
The code below also require a class to be created however it is shorter:
