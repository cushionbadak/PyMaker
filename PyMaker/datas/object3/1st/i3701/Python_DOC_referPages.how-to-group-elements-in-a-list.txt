I have a python list: I want the output to be a list:I tried sort() but that also rearranges the order. I don't want that. I want the output to be in the same order as the input list.
You can create a dict that stores the index of the first occurrence of each value, and use the dict to perform the sort:Edit: @emsimposon92 provides a 2-pass linear-time solution implementable as follows:
You could create a list for each unique number and then just concatenate them based on the original input order.
Following Yakym Pirozhenko's answer, to get the appropriate order you need to reverse-enumerate lst when building the index dict:
Here's a solution using collections.Counter, itertools and toolz.unique. Note the last uses a 3rd party library, but the source code is just an itertools unique_everseen recipe.
