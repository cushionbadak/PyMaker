I have implemented a Python script and I need to use 4 nested loops. I have realized it makes the solution very slow. I have also noticed that a similar loop in Matlab is much faster than in Python.1) Why is the same loop in Matlab faster than in Python? 2) How can I improve my Python code (e.g. vectorization)? I have tried the functions of itertools (combinations, product), but they don't make the calculation faster.I created a class of points - each point has coordinates and velocities and I calculate the distance between them and other quantitiesCan someone help me?many thanks!
In regards to the performance of Python vs Matlab I recommend looking athttp://wiki.scipy.org/PerformancePython. Obviously speed is related to the problem needed to be solved, but I'd imagine for purely mathematical / physical calculations and simulations Matlab will have the upper hand (being, of course, designed for those purposes).With respect to your code, Python does have a variety of tools available to increase the performance, for example using generators, or, for mathematical applications, Numpy's (backended in C) ndarrays. If you are serious about high performance python you might also want to check out PyPy or Cython.Also I remember reading somewhere (will update if I find the link) that just by using function calls and python classes, code execution speeds up drastically since the bytecode can be more effectively interpreted.I'd also point you in the direction of this reply https://stackoverflow.com/a/16752469/9889462 as a starter for speeding up your code using generators. Hope this helps
