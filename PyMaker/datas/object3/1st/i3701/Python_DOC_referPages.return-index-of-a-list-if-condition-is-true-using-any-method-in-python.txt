The code above is indicative of what I want to do.Is it possible to get the index of the i of lst that returned true in the any() method, without using an explicit for loop over lst, and if so how?
You're merely confusing the scope of your subscript variable.  Try a more direct approach with the index method:Output:
Now that you've altered your problem description (note that sample output really helps), try this list comprehension:Output:which indicates that a[0] is the only element that contains an empty string.If I extend the input test toThe output is
