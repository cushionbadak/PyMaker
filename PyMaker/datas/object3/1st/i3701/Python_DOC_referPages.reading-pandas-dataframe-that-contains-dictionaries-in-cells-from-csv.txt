I saved a pandas dataframe that looks like the following as a csv file.When I attempt to read the dataframe as shown below, I receive the following error.The heart of my question is how do I read the csv file to recover the dataframe in the same form as when it was created.

Pandas works best with contiguous memory blocks, e.g. separate numeric data into numeric series.
You may also use the plain and simple python eval as follows:
