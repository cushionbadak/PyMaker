I need to pass an instance method as an argument to a function:is there a better way than the lambda?It appears that f([x], C.m) works too, but is this an accident or an official feature?
operator.methodcallermethodcaller returns a callable that will call a method on a given instance passed to it.
You can do this:Here, C.m is the method without an instance.  It does the same thing as your lambda.  It is definitely an official and supported feature.
