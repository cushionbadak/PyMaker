Natural Text
I am trying to get the number of the files in a certain directory, but I want it to count only text file because I have another directory in the accounts and DS. Store file. What should I modify to only get the number of text files?
From Count number of files with certain extension in Python,Solution 1.Solution 2.Read about glob here here
Assuming your text files end in ".txt", you could use something like:Using os.isfile() to ignore directories and string.endswith() to determine text file-ness.
An alternative module that may work for you is glob.It will allow you to use wildcards so you can capture just the files you are interested in.
str.endswith() returns True or FalseTrue and False have numeric values of one and zero, respectively.sum() will consume the generator expression.
