I'm trying to build a set from the values of a dictionary. Each dictionary value is a list of strings.I am trying to use .update(x) to concatenate a set containing values from the dictionary. I already have success with a standard for-loop:What I would like to do, if possible, is to do this in a set comprehension. So far I have this:but my IDE is giving me an error that "ingredientSet" is referenced before its assignment. Is it possible to use .update(x) in the comprehension, or is there another way to concatenate the items into the set in a comprehension?
If you want a comprehension you can do that with two fors like:Code:Test Code:Result:
Here's a functional way to achieve this using itertools.chain.from_iterable(...):Also, adding here the jonsharpe's amswer from the comment using set().union(...): Performance ComparisonBelow is the timeit comparison of all the answers on Python3:Using itertools.chain.from_iterable - 0.558 usec per loopUsing set comprehension - 0.585 usec per loopUsing set().union(...) - 0.614 usec per loop
