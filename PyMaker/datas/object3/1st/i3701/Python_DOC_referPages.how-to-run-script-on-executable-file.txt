maybe my question is stupid but I would be very happy if someone could help, I have some executable file that I got from my teacher, this executable file ask for the answer of some math problem and if you run it on CMD it's look like:I'm run this exe file on my linux machine using wine, I want to write some of script in bash or python to insert the answer automatically, my question is how can I do so? this exe file doesn't get args so I don't now where to begin...Any help would be appreciated.
You can use the subprocess module to run external programs from within a Python script.For example,
Checkout xdotool: https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotoolIt allows you to create fake keyboard and mouse input in linux.
