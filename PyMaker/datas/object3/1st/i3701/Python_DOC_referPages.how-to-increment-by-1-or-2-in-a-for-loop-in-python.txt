I have created this code that works, but I need it to be more versatile. Have a look:As you can see, I have a lot of if conditions, and I feel like it can be easily more efficient if I put a for loop, but I am really not sure how to do it in Python.Just a note, the length of the array "card_task_e" can change from being as low as 0 or as being as high as 50.If someone could help me out on how to make it better with for loops, I would greatly appreciate it.
Untested, but some variation of this will work ;-)
You're going to want nested loops for this.
Haha, it is supposed to check if the first value of the array is larger than the rest of the even indexes in the array. â€“ A. BhatnagarWhy not simply test it using a list-slice?a[2::2] starts with the 2nd element of a and takes every 2nd till its end. max(..) calculates the biggest one in it and a[0] > max(..) checks if the fist element of a is bigger then all other even values in that list.
This will work for any length of card_task_e.First, we loop through the odd integers, from 1 to the length. Inside that we loop between the even integers starting at the current odd index. The trailing 2 in each for loop tells the loop to increment by 2 in each iteration of the loop.
You can reference a specific list element by using a counter that increments by 2 in each pass of the for loop.You can also add if statements inside the loop to dictate how the counter is incremented.
