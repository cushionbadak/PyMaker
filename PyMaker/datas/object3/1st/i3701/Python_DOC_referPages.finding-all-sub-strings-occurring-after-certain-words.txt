I am working with strings like:I need to get all the values after AAAA, BBBB, CCCC and DDDD, please note that AAAA, BBBB, CCCC and DDDD can be in any order and can be repeated multiple times.or sometimes we may have some of them (not all), e.g., "BBBB 14 x"The output I am looking for should be in the following format:how can I do this efficiently in python?
Here's one way using collections.defaultdict for an O(n) solution. Since we use str.split, it's necessary to keep track of counts so that we join multiple values which appear after a key.There is an edge case, where your string does not begin with a key, unaccounted for. I leave that as an exercise.
I think you can do this with a regular expression match (using a lookahead to tell us where to stop) and a defaultdict to store the data in:Output:
You can use itertools.groupby:Output:
Here is my pretty basic way to do this:result:I'm simply chopping up the string sort of using any A-Z as the delimiters as given in the sample data.  Then assign those as keys and values for a dictionary.  There are lots of clever ways to do this, I'm just trying to keep it simple and easy to read.
