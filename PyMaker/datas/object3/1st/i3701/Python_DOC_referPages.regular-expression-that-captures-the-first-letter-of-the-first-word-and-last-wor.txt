I'm new to regular expressions, and I'm trying to figure out how to generate a new column in a dataframe that captures the first initial of a name and the last name.example df:This is the code I tried so far, but can't seem to get it to work. I don't know how to get it to just replace the middle part only.
I think you don't even need to use regex:
this should work, please tweak it according to you need.
You may useSee the regex demo.Pattern details^ - start of string([a-z]) - Group 1 (referred to with the \1 placeholer from the replacement pattern): one lowercase ASCII letter.*\s - any 0+ chars up to the last whitespace ([a-z]+) - Group 2 (referred to with the \2 placeholer from the replacement pattern): 1+ lowercase ASCII letters at...$ - the end of the string.Python demo:
Try to use re.sub. Here ^(\w) first letter, (\b\w+\b$) last word.
