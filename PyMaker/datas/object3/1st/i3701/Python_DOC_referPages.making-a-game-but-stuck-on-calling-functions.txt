Natural Text
I am making a text based game where a player moves around from room to room. Each room is a Class with 4 positions in each room. I am using a Function for each position and Functions to take an input on where in the room to go. The problem is I want to Call a position Function then have that Function call an input Function again but because my Functions are all defined above the input Functions it doesn't workHere is the code from the Class. The input Functions are at the bottom.class Room2:
Representing rooms as functions is unlikely to be a viable approach. As you've discovered, you end up repeating a lot of code.This sort of application is a classic use case for Python objects and classes. (It looks as though you may still be learning Python, so you may not have encountered these yet.) Modelling rooms, minions, and items each as a class will allow you to express your game in a much simpler and more straightforward way.
