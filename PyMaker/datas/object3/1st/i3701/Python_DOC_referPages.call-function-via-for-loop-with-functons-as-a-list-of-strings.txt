I am trying to write a PyQt5 application. All the list items in list variables are LineEdit objects of a form. On calling a reset function, I wish to set them to specific values for which I am trying to write a for loop instead of hard coding.However, I cant use the list items in variables as objects as they are object attributes in other file and doing does't work, since eval is not an attribute of self.However, if I run it works.
