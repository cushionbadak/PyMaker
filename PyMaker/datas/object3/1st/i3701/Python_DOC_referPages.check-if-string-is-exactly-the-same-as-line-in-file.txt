Natural Text
I've been writing a Countdown program in Python, and in it. I've written this:I have 26 text files called a.txt, b.txt, c.txt... to make the search quicker(Sorry it's not very neat - I haven't finished it yet)However, instead of returning what I expect (pan), it returns all words with pan in it (pan, pancake, pans, pandemic...)Is there any way in Python you can only return the line if it's EXACTLY the same as the string? Do I have to .read() the file first?Thanks
Your post is strangely written so excuse me if I missmatchIs there any way in Python you can only return the line if it's EXACTLY the same as the string? Do I have to .read() the file first?Yes, there is!!!This is a bit hacky since we avoid getting pancake for pan (for instance) but using spaces (and then, what about cases like ".....,pan "?). You should have a look at tokenization function. As pythonists, we hve one of the best library for this: nltk(because, basically, you are reinventing the wheel)
