You don't need to use regex, you can just do the below codeOutput:
Assuming month is always three letters (Jan, Feb...Dec), and day is always two digist (01,02...31)Or make it a one liner...
To answer your original question about using regular expressions: the issue is that you're trying to match groups, but findall returns a list of overall matches.  It's probably better to use re.search, and access the groups, as one commenter said.  Also don't forget to escape the * in your regular expression.  Here's a working example using re.search:This outputs May 31
