I am a bit stuck on this:I want to compare the two lists and generate a list with the same items as a, but with any items that don't occur in b set to 0. Valid outputs would be these:I would not know the number elements in either list beforehand.I tried for loops butIt removes all instances of 2. Which I only want to remove once(it occurs once in b for the moment). I need to add a condition in the above loop to keep elements which match.
The following would work:or for a one-liner, using the fact that b.remove(x) returns None:
If the elements in b are unique, this is best done with a set, because sets allow very efficient membership testing:If b can contain duplicates, you can replace the set with a Counter, which represents a multiset:
Here's one way using set. Downside is the list copy operation and initial set conversion. Upside is O(1) removal and lookup operations.
