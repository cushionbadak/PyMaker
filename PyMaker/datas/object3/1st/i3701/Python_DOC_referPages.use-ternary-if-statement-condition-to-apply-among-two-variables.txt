I'm trying to apply a one line if else statement but using the condition to determine which variable to apply the assignment to. Is that possible?This example is obviously incorrect, but hopefully helps having an idea of what I want to do:
with tuple unpacking:edit: i answered for the fun but the good answer is Mel's (regular if)
You can write a normal if statementThe python ternary operator does not work with assignments.
sounds like a XY problem. If var1 and var2 can hold the same content, then they could be stored in a list of variables. In that case, use the result of the test to compute the index:
What you ask is possible to do using globals dictionary in python. Even if var1 nor var2 are defined.e.g:But, I don't think it is a good practice, if you need to access var1 or var2 latter on in the code, one of the two it will causes an errore.g given the codewill cause:To avoid this, it is best to define the variable beforehand.If you prefer one-liner you can have 2 one-liners:
Its horrendous and shouldn't be done, but should work.
