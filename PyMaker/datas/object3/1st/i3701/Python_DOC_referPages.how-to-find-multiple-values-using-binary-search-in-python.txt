I am using a standard binary search algorithm that takes an integer value as an argument, and searches through a list for the integer. However, I want to be able to find the indexes of the location of each integer in the list that matches the search value. What I have so far is:Any help in making this binary search able to find two values would be appreciated!
Adding in this code at the end of the binary search will provide the user with the index of the first and last occurrence of the value that is being searched for (x in this case). The user can then use the indexes to find the range of indexes that matches the searched item, since they know the indexes of the first and last occurrence of the searched item.
