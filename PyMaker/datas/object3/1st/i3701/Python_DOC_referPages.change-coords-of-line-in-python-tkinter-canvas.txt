I've drawn a line in tkinter.Canvas and now I want to move one end. Is this possible, e.g. with itemconfig?Now I want to change the end of the line to 75, 25. Is there a better way as to delete the line and create a new one? 
Once you've created some item on canvas you can use the following methods to edit the item:coords( )itemconfig( )move( )For example:For learning more about Canvas, you may refer:Tkinter Canvas WidgetGUI with Tk(Python3.6.5)
canvas.coords(line, 0, 0, 75, 25) is the solution
