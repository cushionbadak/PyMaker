I am running a program which runs terminal codes based on the input recieved by the user on my Raspberry Pi. I want the process to run on a different terminal which is opened by my python code. For this on my Ubuntu machine I didBut this is not an option on raspbian stretch. I want to know how I can perform similar functions on my raspberry piI had asked a similar question here. Refer to it to get a better understanding of what I am askingI have Python 3.5.3 on the Raspberry Pi model 2 B running Raspbian Stretch
It sounds you do not necessarily want to spawn a new terminal emulator to run a process from, but just want that the process runs side-by-side with your Python code. You can spawn new processes in a more flexible way than os.system with the subprocess module.The stdout and stderr arguments state that the output should be discarded (i.e. redirected to /dev/null).Note that by default Popen does not use the shell to run your command. If you want to emulate the behaviour of os.system more closely, use shell=True as an argument to Popen. As with os.system this can have security implications!
