I've written a parse_area function which parses the string '1,500 sqft' into the number 1500, like so:I was wondering whether it might be possible to write this function more concisely, by not capturing the , elements in the [\d,] character set in the first place. I thought of using a non-capturing group, but according to https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html the parentheses, etc. have no special meaning inside a character set.Is this the most concise the function can be?
I considered that it might be better to do the parsing in two steps anyways in order to cover the case that no match can be found, in which case I'd like the parse_area function to return None instead of throwing an error. So I finally wrote it like this:and both tests pass. (Note that with the original implementation, the second test would throw a 'NoneType' not subscriptable error).
