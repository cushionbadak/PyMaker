I want to change the directory of my .csv files. Like, now the .csv files are created in the same directory where my python script is present. I need to transfer all the .csv files to another directory. I actually am working with a dataset from which the dataframe object came and I have not included the dataframe code snippet since I felt that would not be required. I just need these .csv files to be moved to another directory.
In case of linux this might do the trick
You can use os.path.join to build cross-platform paths. For example:
You can use absolute path in df2.to_csv(...) call, e.g.On a related note, os is the module normally used to working with file system paths, e.g. os.getcwd() returns your current working directory and os.listdir(dir) returns the list of files in dir.
