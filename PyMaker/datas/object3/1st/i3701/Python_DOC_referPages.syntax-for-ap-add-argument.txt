I am new to OpenCV. I am using anaconda spyder console to write Python code. I took code form here (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/25/4-point-opencv-getperspective-transform-example/)The code was that I am struck at is:At line no. 13 - 17 can someone tell exactly what is happening. I know that I need to get image, get coordinates of paper (and these lines are for this purpose) but I can't get image file.
In the link provided, the arguments are parsed using optional arguments, i.e. arguments must be preceded with the string mentioned in add_argument().So in your case you have:Notice "--image" and "--coords". These are optional arguments and these strings must be mentioned before you execute the code in the terminal.So type this on the terminal:See THIS PAGE for more details on argument parsing and their various ways.
