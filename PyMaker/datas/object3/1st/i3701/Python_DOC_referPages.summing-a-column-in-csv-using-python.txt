I work with large csv files and wanted to test if we can sum a numeric column using Python. I generated a random data set:On line 3 you will notice that value is missing(i removed that data on purpose   to test.)I wrote the code :I got the error :As i am new to Python, my plan was to convert the empty cells with zero but I think i am missing something here. Also my script is based on comma separated files but i'm sure it wont work for other delimited files.  Can you help me improve this code?
The original exception, now lost in the edit history,is the result of str.replace() expecting string arguments, but you're passing an integer zero. Instead of replace you could simply check for empty string before conversion:Another option is to catch the potential ValueError:This might hide the fact that the column contains "invalid" values other than just missing values.Note that had you passed string arguments the end result would probably not have been what you expected:As you can see an empty string as the "needle" ends up replacing around each and every character in the string.The latest exception in the question, after fixing the other errors, is the result of the float(value) conversion working andbeing equal to:and as the exception states, strings and floats don't mix.
Problem with your code is you're calling replace() without checking if its row[5] is empty or not.Fixed code:output:
