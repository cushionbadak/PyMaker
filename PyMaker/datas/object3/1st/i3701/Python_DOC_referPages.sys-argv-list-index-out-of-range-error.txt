I am trying to run this script that grabs rss feeds on the environment "Thonny" but I just keep receiving this error of "IndexError: List index out of range"How do I resolve this to keep from getting this error over and over again. Im not sure how to solve this as I am a beginner. Do I need to define it, if so how? or could I take it out and go a different direction? Here is the code. 
sys.argv is a list in Python, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. sys.argv[0] contains the name of the script, sys.argv[1] contains the first argument and so on.To prevent this error, you need to give command line arguments when starting the script. For example, you can start this script without any errors by You can also modify the script so that it works using the default arguments if you don't provide any command line arguments.You can learn more about handling errors here.Although it is much more convenient to use argparse library.
