I have the following class. It has two instance variables represented as arrays. They will not necessarily have the same length:Both self.input and self.other_information will contain objects from other classes. In my __str__ method, I will need to iterate over them both. Defining an __iter__ method to handle an object with an instance variable with a single array is no problem. If the two arrays had the same length, this wouldn't be an issue, but can I do a single __iter__ method to iterate over two instance variables in my __str__ method that have different lengths? I've seen the non- OOP posts on here, but what of something like this?
You can use itertools.chain() to iterate on your two arrays sequentiallyYou can also use "yield from". The result will be the same.
