I have a .csv file, containing a lot of data in this format: I need to create a 2D array from this csv file, so that collumn 3 (Agricultural emissions) are spatially represented by their long/lat in a 2D array.I'm very very new to Python so any help will be massively appreciated!Thank you
try with pandasyou will get a dataframe out of the file, and then you can manipulate it as you please into an array
