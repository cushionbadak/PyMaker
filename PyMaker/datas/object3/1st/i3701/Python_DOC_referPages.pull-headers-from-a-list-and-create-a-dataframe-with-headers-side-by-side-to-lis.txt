After scraping a website, I ended up with a list which looks like this:and so on.I want to create a panda dataframe with the data I scraped that looks like this:So, basically, I want to show in the next column the header which is above a group of elements of the initial list. How can it be done, considering the special character in front of the headers makes it easy to look them up in the list?
itertools groupby + repeat + chainThis is one solution using the itertools module. In essence these are the only operations we need to undertake:Group items according to whether they start with \xa0.Repeat headers for each list within your list of lists after grouping.Chain results for series A and B to remove nested lists.Crucially, these operations are already implemented lazily and efficiently in the standard library, so there's no need to reproduce in pure Python (although this, in itself, is a good learning exercise).Complete solution:
An alternative solution is to use collections.defaultdict to create a dictionary mapping headers to elements. Potentially more intuitive than itertools.groupby and requires only one pass.
