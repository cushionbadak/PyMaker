I made this calculator to try and calculate trigonometry in python. I've only just started learning how to use this program and I haven't been able to find anything so far that makes sense to me. The problem with this is that I keep getting different answers to those that come up on my scientific calculator.
All trigonometric function from the math module require their argument to be in radians, not in degrees. You can use math.radians to do the conversion.
Python's trig functions assume that the input is in radians, and you're entering degrees.  First convert your degrees to radians by multiplying degrees by math.pi/180.0 and see if those match better.
