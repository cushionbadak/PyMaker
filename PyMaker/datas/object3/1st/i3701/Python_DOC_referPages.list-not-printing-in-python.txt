I'm writing a code to understand inheritance and here is what I did so far.When the last print statement excutes, instead of getting the details of stud_1, I get [<__main__.student object at 0x7f362206a908>]What is going wrong?
You need to add an __str__() method to your student class to indicate how it should be printed:
You are printing the object itself, not the attributes.To print those you have to either go through the list with a for loop and call the attributes in this way:Or you could implement the __str__ dunder method:(Or however you want the output to look like.)
There are a number of ways that you could print the attributes of an object in Python. Here's one other way. This will print the attributes of the object:You could also wrap this in a dump function and then call dump(obj) to print out the attributes.
