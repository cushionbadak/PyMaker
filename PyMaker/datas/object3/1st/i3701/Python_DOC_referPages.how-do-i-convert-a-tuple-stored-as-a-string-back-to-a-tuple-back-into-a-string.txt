Natural Text
If I store the tuple (1, 2, 3) in a txt file as a string, how could I extract it from the txt file and convert it back to the original tuple?
Maybe you could useRemove the '(' and ')' and then use tuple().Thanks to @bla for pointing out that s.strip('()') can be used instead of s.replace('(').replace(')').

If your file only contains the tuple, you could simply use eval.Note that eval should not be used with untrusted input! That means don't use eval on some random data that a user can enter or that your program has downloaded from the internet. Creating tuple.txt is not very hard, assuming t references the tuple:In general though, I would advise you to use the json module whenever possible. It is a pretty general data format that is also easy for people to read. The latter is a good thing for generating test data and catching bugs.If you have tabular data, then sqlite3 could be a good choice.
Let suppose your tuple is in MyTuple.txt then you can try below code written in ReadTuple.py to read tuple from a file. » ReadTuple.py» MyTuple.txtFinally, if you will run above code using python ReadTuple.py then you will be able to see the read tuple and its type on your screen.» Output
