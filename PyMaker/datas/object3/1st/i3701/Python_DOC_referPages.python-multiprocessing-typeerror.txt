I am new to multiprocessing and I need your help. I have four variables that each of them can take up to 4 values (integers or floats) and I stored all of them in a list called par=[A, B, C, D]. (see below)I have created a list of possible combinations with par = itertools.product(*par) .Then, I call a function func1, that takes these arguments and some more and calculates stuff. With the results of the func1, I call another function that calculates stuff and then writes to a file.I want to run these as a whole in parallel with multiprocessing.Pool I thought to embed func1 and func2 in another function, called func_run, and map this with the list par I created above. To summarize, my code looks like:Then, I call the func_run with multiprocessing.As a result, I get a, TypeError with traceback:Unfortunately, it is impossible to add the whole functions and what are they doing because they are hundreds of lines. I hope that you can get the feeling though even though you cannot really reproduce it by yourselfs. Is it possible to run something like this with multiprocessing or I need a different approach?It would be great if anyone can help me understand the error and make it run. Cheers!`
The result ofis a list of tuples of floats (and ints). Pool.map() takes an iterable as the 2nd argument and maps over its items, passing them individually to given func. In other words in the function func_run(param) param is not a list of tuples of numbers, but a tuple of numbers, and sois trying to access the ith float object's 0th item, which of course makes no sense, and so the exception. You probably should remove the for-loop in func_run():
