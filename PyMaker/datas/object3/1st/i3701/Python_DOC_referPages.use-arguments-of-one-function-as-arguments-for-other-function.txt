Natural Text
Suppose I have the following functionwhich takes two arguments and an optional keyword argument. I now want to get a function g that works just as f but for which the value of z is predetermined. Hence, I could do the followingBut what can I do if I do not know the number of non-keyword arguments that f takes. I can get the list of these arguments byBut, if I now define g asthis of course does not work as only one mandatory argument is passed to f. How do I get around this? That is, if I have a function that takes keyword arguments, how do I define a second function exactly the same expect that the keyword arguments take predeterminde values?
You have a few options here:Define g with varargs:Or, if you need keyword arguments as well:Use functools.partial:See also this related question: Python Argument Binders.
You can use functools.partial to achieve this
