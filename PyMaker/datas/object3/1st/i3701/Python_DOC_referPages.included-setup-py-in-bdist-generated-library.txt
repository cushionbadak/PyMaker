I am trying to generate a simple Python library using the following command:```python setup.py bdist_dumb  ```So it will generate a tar.gz file with the contents specified in the setup.py script.Once it is generated, I try to install ot using pip install command, but I am getting an error referrinf to the missing file setup.py.I have specified to include such file in a MANIFEST.in file. But when I attempt to build the file, it is not included in my package.As a reference I am checking pyspark package, but I can't find the place where the setup.py file is specified to be included.Can anyone give me a hint for including this file in order to install the tar.gz library?Kind regards,
You're asking a wrong question for a wrong problem. You don't need to include setup.py because you don't need to build bdist_dumb. Dumb distributions cannot be installed with pip.If you want a pip-installable distribution build a source distribution, an egg or a wheel:
