This question already has an answer here:Python - Using regex to find multiple matches and print them out                    3 answers                I want to extract all emails from a string. In this, I would expect a tupleHowever, I am only getting back the first email from my functionWhat's going on?
re.search() is not the function you want in this case. Instead, you should use re.findall():Try it online!I've replaced [A-Za-z] with [\w], since it makes the regex easier to read.I've also removed the flags, since they aren't going to be necessary for this particular regex. Most importantly, I've removed the {0,} quantifier from the regex, since you only want one email per iterable item, not consecutive emails or empty items.It currently returns a list; if you want it to be a tuple, you can change the return statement to be return tuple(re.findall(regex, str, re.M|re.I))I will also note in closing that email address validation can be complicated.
@jchi2241, you can also use re.finditer() to solve your problem.Here is the code (with a little change in your code):Try it online at: http://rextester.com/BST18087Output Â»
