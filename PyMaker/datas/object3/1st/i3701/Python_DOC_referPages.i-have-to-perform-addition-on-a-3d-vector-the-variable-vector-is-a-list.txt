I know this is a wrong method but I have no clue how to work with a list. I just want to know how to work with a list in a class. Also, the following statement should work:I don't want the answer to all the operations just the add is enough. I just don't understand how to output lists in classes without the statement "a.vector" which clearly was not used the commands given above when creating objects for classes.Also please specify if any clarification is required.Any help is appreciated!I am new to programming and just learnt classes in Python.Thanks a lot on advance 
The result of adding two vectors of length 3 should be a vector with 3 elements, where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the original two vectors.This uses zip to iterate through both the starting vectors together, and constructs the new list using a list comprehension.More:If you want to support scalar multiplication, as indicated by your comments, then your other operand is not another vector, but a number. So you need to multiply each element individually by that number.This should allow you to perform both v*5 and 5*v where v is a Vector object.MoreHere is an example of how you might write a dot-product between two vectors:
