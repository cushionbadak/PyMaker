I'm trying to use ast.literal_eval on a string, but am getting a memory error. Is the list too nested or what is the problem? Is there an alternative?
Apparently the interpreter has some limit when parsing nested lists (in our example, but most likely applies to other containers as well). It breaks both ast.literal_eval and eval (unsafe), and the fact that both of them have the same limit, tells me that they both use some common code (which could also affect other areas). In my case it's 92 (93 breaks it), but since a quick Python source code search didn't reveal anything relevant (like a constant, #define, or smth similar), this value might be related to my environment (machine, stack, OS, Python version, etc.). Note that nested lists can have a much higher nesting level (limited by [Python]: sys.getrecursionlimit() - for me attempting to create 999 (or higher) level nested lists, raised RecursionError).Anyway, as an alternative, I used [Python]: json - JSON encoder and decoder, which worked (with a bit of processing). Note that although this method works for your scenario, it's not at all robust; e.g.: if one of the strings contains quotes (simple or double) it will no longer work.code.py:Output:
