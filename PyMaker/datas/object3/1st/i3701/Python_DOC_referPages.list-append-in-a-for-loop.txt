I am trying to get a list of elements using a for loop to index my previous list. Here's the code: I already have a list named "list" and t is an other list.To be more specific I want to make my list like this.I get this error TypeError: 'float' object is not iterable.
You should be using list.append since list.extend works on iterables; i.e. you can do stuff like lst=[1,2,3];lst.extend([4,5]) which would give you [1,2,3,4,5]see this link if you want to read more
The other answers suggesting you use append fix your issue, but appending is very inefficient. You should use a list comprehension. Also, "list" is a keyword, so you should use another name.
