I have a numpy array that is split by each row:I was hoping to merge said splitArray every 4 rows, and the last subarray not necessarily having to be 4, but just the remainder of what's left. Below is the array I hope to have:
As a pure Numpythonic approach you can find all the desired indexes for splitting your array by creating a range from chunking number to number of rows with the chunking number as thestep arg of the range. Then use np.split() to split your array:Demo:If you want the chunked arrays to be concatenated you can use @jpp's answer with np.concatenate() and map or slightly different in a list comprehension.
Using a list-comp:
That can be done using the infamous grouper recipe.
You can use np.concatenate with np.split. If required, you can adjust the below example to output a list of lists instead of a list of arrays.As mentioned, a single jagged numpy array is not a good idea.
