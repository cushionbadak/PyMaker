This question already has an answer here:How to get the PATH environment-variable separator in Python?                    4 answers                Is there a proper platform-dependent (or independent?) path separator character somewhere in the Python standard library?I am not asking about the directory separator / and \, but rather about the PATH separator: : and ;.Java has java.io.File.pathSeparatorChar and java.io.File.pathSeparator to fulfill this need. Does Python have something similar? A fairly exhaustive search in os.path and pathlib docs yielded nothing, so I am beginning to lose hope.I am not particularly hung up on the character itself. A function that behaves like os.path.join but for entire paths instead of path elements would be perfectly acceptable, preferable even.
Maybe this is what you're looking for:os.pathsep is : or ; while os.path.sep is \ or /.
