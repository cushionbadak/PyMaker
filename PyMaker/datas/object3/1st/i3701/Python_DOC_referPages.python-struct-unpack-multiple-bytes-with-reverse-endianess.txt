So I have a buffer with N bytes and i read them with this, which works but has the reverse endianness from the one i need.buffer=struct.unpack_from( 'h'*(N/2), databuff)I noticed that endianness is reverse so I wanna experiment with endianess and I use thisbuffer=struct.unpack_from( '<h'*(N/2), databuff)However I get this error:How do I reverse endianness on multiple bytes?  
You specify endianness at most once in a format, so writewhere the // is PythonÂ 3 futureproofing.
