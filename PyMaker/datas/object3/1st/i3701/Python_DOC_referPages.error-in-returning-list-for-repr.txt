I have a class 'mn_board()' that creates a m x n matrix as follows:However, it shows the following error:I am aware that the above should code displays only the list form and not the board form, that's not the problem I am facing as the list can easily be then converted into a matrix format.Are lists not returnable in a repr() function? Any clarification?
Repr is basically to return the value of type string in a printable representation. From your code it is returning of type list so got the error. Now try to convert using str() by return str(rows)You can find more description at **https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr or **https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.reprChange the code to :
From the documentation (emphasis mine):object.__repr__(self)Called by the repr() built-in function and by  string conversions (reverse quotes) to compute the “official” string  representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like  a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object  with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not  possible, a string of the form <...some useful description...> should  be returned. The return value must be a string object. If a class  defines __repr__() but not __str__(), then __repr__() is also used  when an “informal” string representation of instances of that class is  required.
