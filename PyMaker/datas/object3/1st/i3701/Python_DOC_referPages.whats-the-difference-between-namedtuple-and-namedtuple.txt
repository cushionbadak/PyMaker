Natural Text
The typing module documentation says that the two code snippets below are equivalent.andAre they the exact same thing or, if not, what are the differences between the two implementations?
The type generated by subclassing typing.NamedTuple is equivalent to a collections.namedtuple, but with __annotations__, _field_types and _field_defaults attributes added. The generated code will behave the same, for all practical purposes, since nothing in Python currently acts on those typing related attributes (your IDE might use them, though).As a developer, using the typing module for your namedtuples allows a more natural declarative interface:You can easily specify default values for the fields (edit: in Python 3.7, collections.namedtuple got a new defaults keyword so this is no longer an advantage
