I know that we can use the set in python to find if there is any duplicate in a list. I was just wondering, if we can find a duplicate in a list without using set.Say, my list is then how to find a duplicate?

OutputThis solution runs in O(N). This will be a huge advantage if the list used has a lot of elements.If you just want to find if the list has duplicates, you can simply doAs @gnibbler suggested, this would be the practically fastest solution
use list.count:
Using list.count:
sort the list and check that the next value is not equal to the last one..This should be O(n log n) which is slower for big n than the Counter solution (but counter uses a dict under the hood.. which is not too dissimilar from a set really).An alternative is to insert the elements and keep the list sorted.. see the bisect module.  It makes your inserts slower but your check for duplicates fast.
If this is homework, your teacher is probably asking for the hideously inefficient .count() style answer.In practice using a dict is your next best bet if set is disallowed.Here is a version using groupby which is still much better that the .count() method
thanks all for working on this problem. I also got to learn a lot from different answers. This is how I have answered:
