This question already has an answer here:How can I get around declaring an unused variable in a for loop?                    6 answers                In Python 3.x, I'm calling a function rand_foo() which returns some random stuff each time being called. I wish to store the sequence of random results into a list. I'm using the following construct:Now my PyCharm 3.0 IDE keeps warning: Local variable 'i' value is not used.Is there an elegant way of removing the unnecessary variable? Indeed, in some cases, I could use itertools.repeat() or something like 10*[value], which, however, cannot be applied to my example above.
The convention when a variable is unused is to use an underscore instead:See for example: Underscore _ as variable name in PythonI believe this will suppress your PyCharm warning
