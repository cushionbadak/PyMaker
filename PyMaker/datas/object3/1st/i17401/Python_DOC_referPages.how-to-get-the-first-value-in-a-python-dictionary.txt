Try this way:Offtop:I think you shouldn't use camelcase, it isn't python wayUPD:inspectorG4dget notes, that result won't be same. It's right.  You should use collections.OrderedDict to implement this correctly.
one lines...the result:

If you want ordered dictionary, use:The output order will be exactly as your input order.
Try this.Type the dictionary and the position you want to print in the function
