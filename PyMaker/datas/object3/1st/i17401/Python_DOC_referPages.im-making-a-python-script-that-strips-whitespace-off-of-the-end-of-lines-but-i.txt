Like I said in the title, my script only seems to work on the first line.Here is my script:  I'm not too experienced when it comes to loops.
The following script do the same thing as your program, more compactly:Here str.rstrip() removes all whitespace from the end of a line (newlines, spaces and tabs).The fileinput module takes care of handling sys.argv for you, opening files one by one if you name more than one file.Using print() will add the newline back on to the end of the stripped lines.
Just use rstrip:
rstrip() is probably what you want to use to achieve this.A more compact way to iterate backwards over stings is[::-1] is slice notation. SLice notaion can be represented as  [start:stop:step]. In my example a -1 for the step means it will step form the back by one index. [x:y:z] will start at index x stop at y-1 and go forward by z places each step.
