I am trying to format the output of the logging to have the levelname on the right side of the terminal always.  I currently have a script that looks like:The output looks like:I would like the output to look something like this instead and can't quite figure it out:
As @Carpetsmoker said, to do what I truly desired required creating a new formatter class overwriting the default.The following class worked well for this process:It relies on getting the terminal size in some function called getTerminalSize.  I used Harco Kuppens' Method that I will not repost here.An example driver program is as follows, where MyFormatter and getTerminalSize are located in Colorer:Where the output is (commented for readability):
I modified the last lines to look like:Your error was using a newline (\n) and tab (\t) character.Or, if you must keep the newline (which seems rather odd to me), you could manually add the spaces, like so:Other notesYou should create a Minimal, Complete, Tested and Readable. Your code wasn't working, I needed to modify a few things just to get the example running. See your messages edit history for what I had to edit.Since Python 3.3, there's os.get_terminal_size. If that isn't available, then doing subprocess.call(['tput cols'], shell=True) seems a whole lot simpler to me...
