I have to define a function named introduce(). It asks for the name of a person twice, and then introduce each of the two people to the other. The function introduce() takes one string parameterfor instance it would say:What is your name?JohnAnd What is your name? Mikeit would then return: John meet Mike,Mike meet John the code I have so far is I would like to know what I am doing wrong, I am new to Python so I am not too familiar with some of the elements in it
Among other things, variable names in Python (and most other languages) can't start with digits, so use first and second. You're also doing some weird syntactical stuff in your print call, which definitely doesn't work. Once you assign the two variables, just print them out--there's no need to refer to the input function again. Just pass first, second, and anything else as comma-separated arguments to the print function:I highly recommend you work through some of the Python tutorials. This is all really basic syntactical stuff; doing the examples there will likely help you out a lot.
First, in Python, variable names cannot start with numerals, so try naming them first and secondSecond, the (input) after the variables is unnecessary (and wrong). The variable name speaks for itself.Third, separate your variables and 'meet' with a comma, so they're printed with a space between them and automatically joined together. There are other ways, but this is the simplest
first of all, you need to not start variable names with numbers.the input is saved in the variable 1st. You don't need to use 1st(input). Instead, you just `print(first)Also, there is a problem with the way you join the strings. It can be done in two ways:orthe difference is: a comma will add the space, whereas a space is required when using + (at least, they are the only differences you need to be aware of.)
