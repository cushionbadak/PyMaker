This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                I am very new to regex and learning by practice. I wrote the following regex for finding a number inside a string of characters, however, it returns nothing. Why is that? Regards
re.match must match from the beginning of the string.Use re.search instead.
re.match matches from the start of the string. Use re.searchP.S semicolons are not necessary.
