I would like to find if last character of a string is .. I know that it is easier to find using $ in re. However, is there a easy way to find . without re? Also is re faster than other string manipulation modules?The string always contain . at the last only.
Use str.endswith:According to Regular expression HOWTO - Python documentation:Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes  which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For  advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the  engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in  order to produce bytecode that runs faster.
