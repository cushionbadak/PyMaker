This question already has an answer here:extract information from excel into python 2d array                    2 answers                I have two columns in excel. Date and temp. They look like this:when I extract them into python using numpy, i get 2 arrays like this:How do I convert this into 1 array of arrays by combining 1 date with all corresponding temps for that date.
To get the exact format that you specify (a list of lists), I'd use itertools.groupby and then a couple of list comprehensions to unpack the group generators:I'm assuming, based on your example, that your data is available in sorted order. If not, the groupby function won't do what you need it to do, and you'd be better off with a dictionary (see below).But my guess is, if you want to actually do anything with this data after you've unpacked it, it'll be more convenient to have it in a dictionary by date, in which case you'll want to go with the defaultdict strategy in Joran's answer.
you could use defaultdict to improve it slightly
Try a dictionary where the key is the date and the result is an array that you append to. So you'd simply parse through the pairs and calling dataArray[date[i]].append(temp[i]) or the like. Don't forget to create the array if the key is currently null though.
If you really want to have the array format, here is Joran's answer edited to give you the dataarray:
