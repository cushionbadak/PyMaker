In Python 3.3 I need to convert an integer into the middle of three bytes to send it over a serial connection. That is, I need to have a value of: b'\x4c\x00\x46', except that the \x00 byte will need to take the single-byte value of an integer variable that may vary from 0 to 255. I thought chr(value) would work, but that gives a string rather than a byte. For example, if value is 255, I want to get b'\x4c\xff\x46'.
Using bytearray:You can also use list in place of bytearray. But using list does not work in Python 2.x.
