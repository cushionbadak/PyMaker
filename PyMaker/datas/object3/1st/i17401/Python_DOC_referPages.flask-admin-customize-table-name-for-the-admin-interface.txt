I like to change the name display at the top level menu of Flask-Admin. By default it seems he uses the calass model name. I like to change that for a more Human readable Name.I've seen that in the "layout.htlm" template, there is a variable called {{ item.name }}. This is used to display the name of the menu. Is there a way to change that for another name or to surcharge the name in the model definition ?Using __tablename__ doesn't work and will break internal flask-admin. Is there an equivalent to __repr__ but for table name instead of column.Regards
BaseModelView accepts an argument named name. If you provide a value, it will be used for display on the menu.If you are using SQLAlchemy:Here I've used positional arguments, but I could have just as easily done name='Menu Text' instead.
