I understand how multiplying by strings work fundamentally, but I just stumbled on this strange fact that multiplying by negative numbers yields an empty string and thought it was interesting. I wanted to know the deeper why beneath the surface. Anyone have a good explanation for this? 
The docs on s * n say:Values of n less than 0 are treated as 0 (which yields an empty  sequence of the same type as s).
What would you expect multiplying a string by a negative integer?On the other handwithout being worried than keyword? be longer than 60 is very handy.
This behavior is probably defined to be consistent with range(-5) being []. In fact, the latter may be exactly what underlies the behavior you observe.
That's literally part of the definition of the operation:The * (multiplication) operator yields the product of its arguments. The arguments must either both be numbers, or one argument must be an integer and the other must be a sequence. In the former case, the numbers are converted to a common type and then multiplied together. In the latter case, sequence repetition is performed; a negative repetition factor yields an empty sequence.
