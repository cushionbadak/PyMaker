This question already has an answer here:is_alpha coding that works like isalpha() in python                    4 answers                This was my original code and it is still not returning False in cases like "". When the real isalpha() returns False in the case of '' or "". How to exclude all these cases?
Empty strings will not trigger any code in the for loop, since for ch in '' is essentially a no-op here (there's nothing to iterate), so your is_alpha returns True for empty strings. You should add something liketo the beginning of your function.(As a side note, your break statement is unnecessary since return False will exit the function.
Your loopWill never run if len(x) == 0, you go straight toAlso, if youYou can use string.ascii_uppercase and string.ascii_lowercase.
