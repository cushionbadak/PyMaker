I have a dictionary of a list of dictionaries. something like below:x = {'a':[{'p':1, 'q':2}, {'p':4, 'q':5}], 'b':[{'p':6, 'q':1}, {'p':10, 'q':12}]}The length of the lists (values) is the same for all keys of dict x.I want to get the length of any one value i.e. a list without having to go through the obvious method -> get the keys, use len(x[keys[0]]) to get the length.my code for this as of now:i am not happy with this, can be made more 'pythonic' i believe. 
What about this:or alternatively:and then your answer isSome of the other solutions (posted by thefourtheye and gnibbler) are better because they are not creating an intermediate list. I added this response merely as an easy to remember and obvious option, not a solution for time-efficient usage.
This is most efficient way, since we don't create any intermediate lists.Note: For this method to work, the dictionary should have atleast one key in it.
Works ok in Python2 or Python3This is better for Python2 as it avoids making a list of the values. Works well in Python3 too
Using next and iter:
Here, x.values gives you a list of all values then you can get length of any one value from it.
