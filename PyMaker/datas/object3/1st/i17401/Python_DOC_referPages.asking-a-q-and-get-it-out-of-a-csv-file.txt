Q = questionI want to access information from a csv file, for example if the file included:How would I ask a question, example:(pseudo code)what is the name of the person you are looking for? : And for python to get the information and display it?
Without writing all your code for you...Break your problem down into the different components you need to implement:Read a .CSV fileOrganize the data for retrieval (one or more dicts, keyed by each field you might want to use to look up records, is probably the simplest solution)Get user input ("ask a question")Retrieve the requested dataDisplay the requested data to the userFigure out (i.e. research) how to implement each of these individually, and then you can write your program to do that. If you then have a specific problem with a specific piece, come back to SO with the code you've written and explain the trouble you're having.
