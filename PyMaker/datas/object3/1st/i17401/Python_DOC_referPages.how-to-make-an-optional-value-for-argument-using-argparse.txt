I am creating a python script where I want to have an argument that manipulates how many search results you get as output. I've currently named the argument --head. This is the functionality I'd like it to have:When --head is not passed at the command line I'd like it to default to one value. In this case, a rather big one, like 80When --head is passed without any value, I'd like it to default to another value. In this case, something limited, like 10 When --head is passed with a value, I'd like it to store the value it was passed.Here is some code describing the problem:I know I probably can write a custom action for this, but I first want to see if there is any default behaviour that does this.
After a little more reading in the documentation I found what I needed: nargs='?'.This is used with the store action, and does exactly what I want.Here is an example:Source: http://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs
