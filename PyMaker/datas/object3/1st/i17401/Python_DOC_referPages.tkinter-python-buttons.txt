When I want to add a button likeis it possible to use function with a parameter likeI had tried But l_total already as 1111 when the program run ( 1000+100+10+1) like I had pressed the four buttons and also the buttons doesnt add values to l_total . I just want to know why it doesnt work as I know a solution . 
What you've written:â€¦ isn't passing a function as the command, it's calling a function, then passing its result as the command.What you need to do is to define a new function that, when called with no arguments, calls any_function(7). Like this:Or, using the shorter lambda syntax for defining functions:Wrapping an expression up in a function like this, then passing the function around, is a way of deferring the function until later. It can be hard to get your head around, but once you do, it's incredibly useful all over the place.Another way to look at it is partially applying the function, which gives you a thing that you can finish applying later on. There's a partial function in the standard library that does this for you:But you can also do it yourself:And then you can see how this is really just the same trick as using def or lambda, plus another trick on top of it: it's a function that returns a function. So, while you may be calling make_any_function_partial and passing its result to command, just as in your original attempt, the difference is that the result is itself a function.
