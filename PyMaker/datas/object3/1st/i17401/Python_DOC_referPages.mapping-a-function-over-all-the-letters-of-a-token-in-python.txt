The purpose of this program is to read in an array of tokens, remove the punctuation, turn all the letters lower case, and then print the resulting array. the readTokens and depunctuateTokens functions both work correctly. My problem is with the decapitalizeTokens function. When I run the program I receive this error:My question is what formal parameters I should put into the decapitalizeTokens function in order to return the array resulting from the depunctuateTokens function, but with all the letters lowercase. This is my program:
Your decapitalizeTokens function works on a single character. You're passing it a list of strings. If you want to call it on every character of every string in that list, you need to loop over the list, and then loop over each string, somewhere.You can do this with explicit loop statements, like this:… or by using comprehensions:However, I think it would make far more sense to move the loops into the decapitalizeTokens function—both based on its plural name, and on the fact that you have exactly the same loops in the similarly-named depunctuateTokens function. If you build decapitalizeTokens the same way you built depunctuateTokens, then your existing call works fine:As a side note, the built-in lower method on strings already does what you want, so you could replace this whole mess with:… which would also fix a nasty bug in your attempt. Consider what, say, decapitalizeTokens would do with a digit or a space.And, likewise, depunctuateTokens can be similarly replaced by a call to the translate method. For example (slightly different for Python 2.x, but you can read the docs and figure it out):
cleanTokens = depunctuateTokens(...) #returns an array into cleantokens.words = decapitalizeTokens(cleanTokens) #takes an array and returns... whatever.the fact is that inresult is an array (cleanTokens), and ord(result) fails since it expects a string, and not an array.perhaps doing words = map(decapitalizeTokens, cleanTokens) can help you
