I'm trying to sort this dict based on the key "order". Kindly, find below sample dict :-Tried using this code, but I got an errorTypeError: list indices must be integers, not strAny hint?
You can't sort the dictionary itself. Dictionary in python does not have an order.Trying to sort dictionary will pass keys of the dictionary to the key function. sub_links[x] => sub_links['about-us']; sub_links[x]['order'] fails because sub_links[x] returns a  list.You can sort the list inside the dictionary: d['about-us']Also the usage of the sorted function should be changed: sorted passes each item to the key function, not the index of the item.If you need to sort all the dictionary values in place, loop over the values.
falsetru showed what you probably meant to do, but here's an explanation of the error you are seeing:The key lambda function receives the dictionary's keys as its argument x when called--in this case, the call looks something like this when performed on the one and only key in the dictionary:When this executes, sub_links["about-us"] returns the value of that key, which is a list. When the next part of the statement executes (<the list that got returned>["order"]), the TypeError gets thrown because lists require integer indices.There's a bigger problem here--it seems you called sorted on the whole dictionary, which only contains 1 value. It doesn't make sense to sort something with only 1 entry, and it should not be used to sort what you seem to want to sort, which is the inner list of dictionaries.If you want to sort the inner list of dictionaries (the corresponding dict value for the "about-us" key), you'll need something like this (as falsetru also suggested):
