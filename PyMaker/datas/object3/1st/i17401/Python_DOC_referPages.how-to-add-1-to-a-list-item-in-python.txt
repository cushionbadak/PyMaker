I've got a list like so:I'd like to perform an operation to each of the inner values - say concatenation, converting to an int and incrementing, etc.How can I do this for all of the list items; given that this is a multi-dimensional list?
You can use list comprehension (nested list comprehension):BTW, why do you use lists of strings?I'd rather use a list of numbers (No need to convert to int, back to str).

We can use eval function here. About eval()  What does Python's eval() do? 
If list comprehension scares you, you can use sub-indexing. For example,counters is a list of lists, therefore you need to access the subindex of 0 (the first item) before you add to it. counters[0][0], for example, is the first item in the first sublist. Moreover, each of your subitems is a string, not an integer or float. The eval function makes the proper conversion so that we can add 1, and the outer str function converts the final answer back to a string.
