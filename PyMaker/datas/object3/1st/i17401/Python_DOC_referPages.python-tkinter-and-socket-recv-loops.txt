I'm trying to send data to a client, as part of a development process for a chat server in Python. Currently the client has a GUI, however the server is run from command line. I've included the full code to them both below.ClientSERVERThe issue I'm having is that the receive_msg() loop for always being ready to take in new messages stops the mainloop keeping the GUI updatated. I've commented that line about recalling app.mainloop(), however that means I only receive one message before the mainloop recalls infinitely inside the receive_msg loop. Can anyone help me with a fix?
You can use multiprocessing.connection Listener and Client. Like this. ServerClient
