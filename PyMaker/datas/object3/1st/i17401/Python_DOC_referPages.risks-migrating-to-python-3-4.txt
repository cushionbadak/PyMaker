I am planning to migrate a large python 2.7 codebase to python 3.4 (nearly released). I have taken a look at the migration suggestions, and seems a lot of work. And there is one risk that worries me, difficult for  me to evaluate: I am depending on lots of third-party libraries. Could happen that I port my application to python 3 and suddenly I realize that an important library is only working with python 2.7? I there any way to verify beforehand which libraries are working and which are not, starting from a requirements.txt file (pip freeze)?
I there any way to verify beforehand which libraries are working and which are not, starting from a requirements.txt file (pip freeze)?Sure. Just create an empty 3.4 project with that same requirements file, and try to use pip 3.4 to build and install it.Or, even more simply, just pip3.4 each requirement and see if it works. You can do this manually, or with a trivial bash or Python script.
