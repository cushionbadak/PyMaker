I'm calling a function and trying to capture the output it prints out, but in 3.3 I don't have access to StringIO.   Is there another method around this?
In Python 3, StringIO lives in the io package. So you can still use it to capture the output:
How about setting up basic logging:http://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.htmlHere is the basic tutorial link:http://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial
StringIO has moved in Python 3. Try from io import StringIO. You also need to decide whether you want a StringIO or a BytesIO.However, it sounds as though you're trying to monkey-patch over sys.stdout in (something like) a unit test. I wouldn't recommend doing this in your tests unless you're sure you need to; it'll make for hard-to-maintain tests. I'd suggest that your code needs refactoring - consider changing your function to return a string, which clients can print (or write to a file, or display on a GUI, or...) at their leisure.
