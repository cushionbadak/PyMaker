I am looking for a simple python process that starts to run in the background that with a loop counts up the minutes. I want to send a signal (from outside the script) to the process to break the loop. There may be a number of these scripts opening and running simultaneously.
You can use a signalWhich will output something like:You can then use kill(1) to send the signal:As far as I can find, there's no obvious way to send the signal from Python, but you could use just start kill with the subprocess module (bit ugly, but works).You can use the same technique in PHP by the way. See pcntl_signal() (You will need the pcntl module installed).Also see:Introduction to UNIX Signals and System CallsAll about Linux signalsOther methods of Inter process communication (IPC) you could use might be:File with statusShared memoryFIFOSending data over network (also works well when two programs are on the same machine)I'm not going to provide examples for all of these, IMHO using a signal is the most obvious choice here.
