I am trying to define a class within a class. I am not trying to solve a real world problem with this. I am simply trying to learn Python with this code.When I try to execute this code, I get this error:What went wrong? When we can define and use functions defined within a function, why not the same for classes? Am I making a mistake in using Bar class?
Use Foo.Bar() instead, because Bar is not a global name.
You need to access Bar through Foo (Bar is not defined in module level)Replace following line:with:orAccording to Class definition:The  class’s suite is then executed in a new execution frame (see section  Naming and binding), using a newly created local namespace and the  original global namespace. (Usually, the suite contains only function  definitions.) When the class’s suite finishes execution, its execution  frame is discarded but its local namespace is saved. A class  object is then created using the inheritance list for the base classes  and the saved local namespace for the attribute dictionary. The class  name is bound to this class object in the original local namespace.
