Natural Text
I have two CSV's, openable in Numbers or Excel, structured:| word | num1 | and| word | num2 |if the two words are equal (like they're both 'hi' and 'hi') I want it to become:| word | num1 | num2 |here are some pictures: So like for row 1, since both the words are the same, 'TRUE', I want it to become something like| TRUE | 5.371748 | 4.48957 |Either through some small script, or if there's some feature/ function I'm overlooking.Thanks!
Use a dict:(untested)
For csv, I always reach for the data analysis library pandas. http://pandas.pydata.org/
I think what you're looking for is zip, to let you iterate the two CSVs in lock-step:I'm not sure what you wanted to happen if they're not equal. Maybe insert both rows, like this?
