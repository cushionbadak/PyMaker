I'm still trying to learn programming so please help me simplify this.  I'm trying to run something that looks through the indices in my list and if it finds a 1 returns "yay" (just for debugging purposes).  Here's what I have so far:However, I get a syntax error whenever I run this, which underlines the 1.  Please help!Thanks!
Apart from incorrect indentation(fixed below), you are using = when you should be using ==, and you left out a colon from your if statement.= is used to assign values==  evaluates equality(returning a boolean i.e True or False)You left out a : in your if statement.Corrected code:If you don't understand exactly how Python uses whitespace/indentation as an integral part of it's syntax/structure and other syntax basics, then you need to get on that i.e tutorials.. A quick google should turn up many. I recommend Udacity or Codeacademy
There are three syntax errors that I see.First, you're using the = sign (assignment) when you need == (comparison).Second, you're missing a colon at the end of your if statement.Finally, you must* have an indented block after your if statement.All together, it should read like this:You should really go have a look at the tutorials; this is all stuff that's laid out very well there, and it's all critical to doing pretty much anything in Python.*Technically, you can also follow an if statement with an expression on the same line (e.g. if 1: pass). However, I personally think this is hideous in almost every case.
= is an assignment statement.  Example:name = "tyler"You should use == to check for equality of primitives (you're comparing integers, which are primitives). Switch :if indexList[i] = 1to:if indexList[i] == 1
Try it like this:
