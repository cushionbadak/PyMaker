Natural Text
I have a need to print the contents of a folder to a user, who then picks one of the files. The program then takes that choice and uses it elsewhere.My code to achieve this:Overall, this works ok. But, is there a better way to do it?I'm new to python, so any pointers are greatly received.The program in which i use this is pySignareThanks.
The only improvement I can offer is to use the enumerate() function:I started the count for you at 1 to match your output; users find counting from 1 more natural anyway. This also makes use of string formatting, a much more readable and concise method of building strings. 
I'll take a closer look at this shortly, but the thing that jumped out at me was this:You're using list.index to get do a lookup of a key while you're iterating through it. Don't do that.The old better way of doing that was this:The REAL way you should do this is:enumerate(iterable) runs through iterable and returns a tuple for each item, representing (index, value). You're unpacking those with keynum, key. In order to fit what you did originally, you add one to keynum before displaying it, then you'll subtract one again from the user input.I would also make a function that defines integer input. Something like:This will let you do something like:
The two main things you do here that are worth avoiding are the while True loop and the lack of functions. In general as well, I think you can accomplish what you are looking for much easier:Then I'd wrap the function call so I had something like:This way you avoid a while true loop, and your getChoice function is independently testable of anything else. Note: I didn't test this code, but it looks good.
