I want to read all .csv files in a directory using Python. So when I googled it, I got this solution Find all files in a directory with extension .txt in PythonBut when I enteredI am getting the following errorI am really confused where am I wrong? Thank you in advance.
You need to expand ~ to actual home directory using os.path.expanduserOtherwise, ~ mean the directory ~ (literally ~).
os.chdir doesn't do tilde expansion. You needto go to ~/Desktop.
