I couldn't find the right search terms for this question, so please apologize if this question has already been asked before.Basically, I want to create a python function that allows you to name the columns (as a function parameter) that you will do certain kinds of analyses on.For instance see below.

You can use getattr here:getattr allows you to access an attribute via a string representation of its name.Below is a demonstration:
