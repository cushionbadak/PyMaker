Currently, there will only be 3 cols.  Desired result:I guess I have two major questions:1. Can this be done2. How to account for the diff sizes of each array - not in terms of formatting, but looping through elements where there might not be one.Thanks very much.p.s. I'm currently experimenting with zip() as that looks like it could work, but still have a mis-matched number of elements in each array.
You're on the right track with zip.  To fill in something where there's nothing, use itertools.zip_longest (in python 2, izip_longest):
I'm currently experimenting with zip() as that looks like it could work, but still have a mis-matched number of elements in each array.Yes, as the docs say, zip stops as soon as any of the arrays stops.But the itertools module has a function called zip_longest (or izip_longest, in 2.x) that solves this problem.You just need specify what you want as the fill valueâ€”in this case, probably '':
