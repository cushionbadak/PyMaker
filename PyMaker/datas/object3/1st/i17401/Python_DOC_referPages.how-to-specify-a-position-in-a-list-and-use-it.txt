Is there a way so that I could give a position in a list, e.g. 2 for the third value, and then directly use that position, e.g list.remove[2]? For example:Say my list was,Is there a way so that if the user wanted to remove the 5th value, which is the middle 2, then you could just give  a position and use it directly. In this case, if I was to use test.remove(2) it would remove the first 2 that appeared in the list, so is there a way that I could say the middle 2's position and then remove it without touching the rest of the list?Something like test.remove[2] would be a good idea to implement, the value in the [] being the position.
You can use list.pop:or del:
Sometime early on in my use of this resource someone suggested I learn how to use Python's introspection ability as that would often help answer my questions.  In your caseTo learn about the methods that test has I can doThe results areIgnoring the items that begin with an underscore and using some language skills I want to understand whether pop or remove will help me soNote this is not a criticism of your question rather I hope this helps you understand that Python has some tools to help you understand features very efficiently.
The remove method exists specifically for searching by value. When you already know the index, you don't need it; just index the list directly.To get the value by index, you don't use find, or otherwise search the list looking for a value that matches, you just do this:To replace a value by index, you don't use replace, or otherwise search the list, you just do this:And to delete a value by index, you don't use remove, or otherwise search the list, you just do this:This is explained in the tutorial section on The del statement, but you really probably want to read that entire chapter on lists.
