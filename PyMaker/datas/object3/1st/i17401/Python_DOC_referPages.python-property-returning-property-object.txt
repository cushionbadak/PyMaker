I have a class like this:I've seen How do Python properties work?, How to set a python property in __init__, but they all use the decorator method, which i don't because i want a different name. And I need access to selfHow do i get the property to behave?
You need to make a minor change:The property needs to be an attribute of the class, not the instance; that's how the descriptor protocol works.
You can do it like this
You can also do it like shown here:which is equivalent to:BUT without polluting the class namespace with get and set methods for each attribute.You retain external direct access to the variable by using ._bar instead of .bar.
The object is not instantiated.
