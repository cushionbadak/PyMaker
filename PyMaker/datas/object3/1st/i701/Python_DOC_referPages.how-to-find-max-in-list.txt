I write the following code but it shows error.TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)       in         1 a = [9,89,65,87]      ----> 2 print(max(a))TypeError: 'int' object is not callableHow do I fix this or are there any documentation I need to read to get better understanding?
It seems like that your max is not a function but an int object.Can you just run the print(max) and check what exactly it is?
Apparently you used max or print as an integer variable name before, and the max() or print() function has been overwritten. Use another name for the variable that you called max or print previously and it should work.
This code is working properly, so please check your code and run it again
run: And it should return like: built-in function maxIn this way you can identify whether you've overwritten max() method or not. If so, change the name print wherever you've used.Here are some links for your reference:https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/functions/max.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/
