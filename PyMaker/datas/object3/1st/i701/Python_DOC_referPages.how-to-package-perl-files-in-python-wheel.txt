We have created a pip wheel file for a package which has a collection of python and perl scripts. Since python packaging will only add the python files to the wheel file what is the best way to package the perl files as well.This is my project structure
If you are currently using setuptools in the setup.py for your project, and making use of python setup.py bdist_wheel as the method to generate the .whl file, add the following line to the MANIFEST.in file which is already present at the root of your project.Naturally, replace myproject for the actual top level directory that will include the target .pl scripts (or any other file).As a demo, if your setup.py is written approximately like so:Running python setup.py bdist_wheel will show output that looks like:The files are packaged inside the .whl:Installing the resulting .whl file in a new environment:Also note that if the MANIFEST.in method is unwanted, include package_data={'': ['*']}, argument for the setup call should also make it work with the recent versions of setuptools.Further addendum: The setuptools package actually has a MANIFEST.in that include this particular syntax, though restricted to specific filename extensions for the files they want to include.  This is clearly a supported option despite some guides/documentation that might suggest otherwise.  In fact, this is a feature provided by the core distutils module that is shipped with Python by default.
