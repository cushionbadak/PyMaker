I am trying to use the deck list from Deck class in Hand class, I am getting the error "NameError: name 'deck' is not defined" in line "deckCopy=deck"I expect to return a list of 4 Card objects, not sure if the counter should be 4 or 5, but that is not important.
Here is a modified version of my answer, I misinterpreted your code earlier which made my answer kind of irrelevant.Please note I have made one of the methods as static since you are not using you are not doing anything specific to instance in this method. It is just creating a deck of cards whenever you call it
Question: I am trying to use the deck list from Deck class in Hand classWrong approach, a Hand should not access the whole Deck.To get a Hand ask  the Deck give me a random Hand, e.g:Question:  I am getting the error NameError: name 'deck' is not defined" in line "deckCopy=deckThis means your Questions code is different from the code you are running.You are getting: TypeError: get_cards() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self',on line deck=Deck.get_cards()You are calling .get_cards() using this notation Deck.get_cards() and it sould be Deck.get_cards(self). As you inherited from Desk you could simple use deck=self.get_cards()Rethink your whole approach, you don't need inheritance at all.  A Card is a Card, a Suit is a Suit and a Desk is a Desk:Note: This example does not take attention to already handed cards!!Usage:Output:Tested with Python: 3.4.2
