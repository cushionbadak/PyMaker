Can I find the index of the changed value by comparing two arrays? For exaple;I want to find the index of the changing value by comparing these two arrays. For this example this should be 2.I am using numpy to compare two arrays. But I can't find the index of changed value(s).
This is a non-numpy solution. You can use enumerate() with zip():
Since you are using NumPy, you can compare using the != operator and use np.flatnonzero:
You can use numpy's where function to do this
To find index of n changing elements between two lists we can use
list(set(a1)-set(a2)) gives the list of all the elements which are not present in the set a2
