Natural Text
I have something dumb that is annoying me. Using flake8 linter, they like the lines short obviously, if I run a string like below to continue on the next line:This is what prints:What is the proper way to continue a line of code without the large space between a printout?
This works:You don't need any continuation. Just put two string together with nothing in between, the Python parser will know it mean to concat themThis is called string literal concatenation
I would suggest putting the long string into a variable and printing the variable.Python handles the string continuation automatically because it is wrapped in the parentheses.
