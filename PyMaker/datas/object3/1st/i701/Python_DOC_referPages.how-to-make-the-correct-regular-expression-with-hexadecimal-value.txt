Natural Text
I am focusing on data with a regular expression. I am using python and I implement this function:But it does not work correctly:I expect to have  this result:Then I want to convert the hexadecimal value to decimal by using this function: As finalresult I want to have:
Hexadecimal values use the digits 0-9 and the letters A through to F (upper or lowercase), only, and in your case are of a fixed length, so [0-9a-fA-F]{32} suffices to match those values. You don't need to match trailing zeros, when you have a fixed-length value.You really don't want to use \w here, you wouldn't want to match underscores, the rest of the English alphabet, or any other letter-like symbol in the Unicode standard (there are thousands).Next, you are looking for ASN_Received, but your input string uses the text Nbr_Received = with whitespace around the = character. Account for that:I broke the expression across multiple lines to be easier to follow. Note that I used {4,} for the last hexadecimal value, matching 4 or more digits. You can't use + and {n,m} patterns together, choose one or the other.You then get:Also see this online demo at regex101, which explains each part of the pattern on the right-hand side.I'd convert the last hexadecimal number via bytes.fromhex() and int.from_bytes() to an integer:
Try this:
