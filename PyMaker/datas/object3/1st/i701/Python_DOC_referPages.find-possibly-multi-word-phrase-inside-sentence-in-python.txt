Natural Text
I'm trying to find keywords within a sentence, where the keywords are usually single words, but can be multi-word combos (like "cost in euros"). So if I have a sentence like cost in euros of bacon it would find cost in euros in that sentence and return true.For this, I was using this code:where line is the input and aliases is an array of phrases that match a keyword (like for cost in euros, it's ['cost in euros', 'euros', 'euro cost']). However, I noticed that it was also triggering on word parts. For example, I had a match phrase of y and a sentence of trippy cake. I'd not expect this to return true, but it does, since it apparently finds the y in trippy. How do I get this to only check whole words? Originally I was doing this keyword search with a list of words (essentially doing line.split() and checking those), but that doesn't work for multi-word keyword aliases.
This should accomplish what you're looking for:Output:Basically, we're grabbing all matches, using pythons re module as our test, including cases where multiple phrases occur in a given alias, using a compound list comprehension, then using set() to trim duplicates from the list, then using list() to coerce the set back into a list.Refs:Lists:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-listsList comprehensions:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionsSets:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#setsre (or regex):https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re
