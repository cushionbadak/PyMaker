I am currently trying to generate numerical features in a dataset by converting the dates to timestamps. If run on Mac, it works flawlessly, on windows it throws an which is probably due to windows not supporting unix timestamps from before 1970-01-01. I have dates from 1955 upwards. Here is my code:I somewhere saw suggested to maybe use datetime.timedelta(), but I couldn't figure out how to integrate it.
You could do it by (implicitly) using datetime.timedelta to calculate a "Gregorian" timestamp that would be valid for dates from 1582-Oct-15 to the present (or some other "epoch" you would like to use).
