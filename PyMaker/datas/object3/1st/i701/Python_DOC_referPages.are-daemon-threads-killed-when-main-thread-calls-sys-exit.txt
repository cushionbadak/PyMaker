According to the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.htmlA thread can be flagged as a “daemon thread”. The significance of this flag is that the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left. The initial value is inherited from the creating thread. The flag can be set through the daemon property or the daemon constructor argument.Sample code:Refering to many other StackOverflow answers, it is not clear to me if daemon threads are forced to close when the main thread calls sys.exit()
Referring to the comment posted by zwer,When a program exits, all of its children threads are killed with it. Threads that are not daemonic will prevent the program from exiting, hence preventing their own destruction. - zwerIn short, yes daemon threads will not stop the program from exiting thus they will be killed on exit.
