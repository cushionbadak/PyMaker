I have a parent folder (PF) with child folders (CF1, CF2, CF3...) and files both in the parent folder (PFf1.csv, PFf2.csv,...) and children folders (CF1f1.csv, CF1f2.csv, CF2f1.csv, CF2f2.csv,...)I want to find only the files in the children folders (CF1f1.csv, CF1f2.csv, CF2f1.csv, CF2f2.csv,...) and ignore the files in the parent folder.All the examples I have seen in stackoverflow and the internet are of the form:which finds the files in the parent folder also.  I have tried a to modify this to: loop through the subfolderson the walk, test when the new parent folder is in the original list of subfolders, then branch into an if statementbut without success.  I feel this should be easy, but I am new to python and cannot figure it out.  Any help would be much appreciated.
your loop gives you the path to the current folder, you can check if it is different than the rootDir (provided rootDir is a full path ofcourse):
Walk is too much if all you want is the files in the directories in a given directory. For that I would write:Sure, there is some redundant os.path.join.
You can first get all of the sub directories in the root directory using os.listdir and putting a check with os.path.isdir:And then iterate over all the sub-directories again using os.listdir to get files in them. You can use os.path.isfile to check for only files:
