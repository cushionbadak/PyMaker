If I pass the string ${varName} to the built in keyword Log to Console, the console outputs the literal string ${varName}. If there is a variable named varName with a value of test123, how do I get the keyword Log to Console to output the variable value of test123 when I pass in ${varName}?I'm making a data-driven script from an Excel spreadsheet. In the string values I'm passing in, there are variables names within it that I want replaced with the variable's value.I've tried to run the string through the Evaluate keyword, but it just changes all of the variable names like ${varName} to RF_VAR_varName, so it's recognizing something here?Open Excel ${ExcelFile}${varName} Read Cell Data By Coordinates ${Sheet_Name} 0 ${RowNum}set global variable ${varName}log varName: ${varName} console=yesWould output to the console:'38773461|${TMS_ConfNo}|substr:RDSJUMHV FIRSTNAME|${globalLastName} FIRSTNAME|fullline:JEYCTINY, FIRSTNAME|${globalLastName1}, FIRSTNAME|fullline:RDSJUMHV, FIRSTNAME|${globalLastName}, FIRSTNAME|fullline'I would like this string:'38773461|${TMS_ConfNo}|substr:RDSJUMHV FIRSTNAME|${globalLastName} FIRSTNAME|fullline:JEYCTINY, FIRSTNAME|${globalLastName1}, FIRSTNAME|fullline:RDSJUMHV, FIRSTNAME|${globalLastName}, FIRSTNAME|fullline'To evaluate into this:'38773461|12345678|substr:RDSJUMHV FIRSTNAME|LASTNAME FIRSTNAME|fullline:JEYCTINY, FIRSTNAME|LASTNAME1, FIRSTNAME|fullline:RDSJUMHV, FIRSTNAME|LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME|fullline'I would like all variables in the string to translate to their respective value.
Robot has a built-in keyword named Replace variables which will replace variables with their values in a string.
