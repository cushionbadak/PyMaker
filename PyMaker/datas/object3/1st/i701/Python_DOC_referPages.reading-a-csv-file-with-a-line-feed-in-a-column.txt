I've a csv file with a line feed ('\n') in a column.The rows are separated by a carriage return + line feed (\r\n)The separator is ';' and quoted all.   I want to replace the line feed ('\n') in the column by a space.   I already tried to read the whole file and used split('\r\n') to get the rows but that doesn't work. Is it possible to read the file line by line and using '\r\n' as a new line indicator?   Any help is much appreciated!
Your code contains weird ’ and ‘ .. you also try to use .replace() on a row given to you by for row in csv_reader:. That row is a list of columns - nothing you can directly call replace() on.  You need to replace the newline inside each column of this row.-- You try to read the file yourself - with quoting this is difficult. Using the  module csv to read and store the csv again is much easier:Write demo file:Filecontent: Read demo file, manipulate data and store in listOutput:Write modified data back to a new file:Modified filecontent:
