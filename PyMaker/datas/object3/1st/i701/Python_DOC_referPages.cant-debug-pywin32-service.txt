I'm trying to debug my service with PythonService.exe and I get a strange error:Project structureAnd if I move whole code from service.py into serviceapp.py I can debug it without issues. EDIT:And it perfectly works as *.py or .*exe
Python interpreter doesn't know where to look for w32service module (package). One way would be to add its path to [Python 3]: The Module Search Path (before importing it):To make things clearer, use print(sys.path) before importing anything (well, except sys) to see where is the Python searching for modules.
