Working with this argument:I need to perform logic that will read which choice was made and go down a path of if statements based on that choice.Here is basically what I'm trying to do:I want this CLI script to know what the user is trying to add (for now, a user or a database).The end goal is that the user will enter ./myscript.py --add user USERNAME to add a user.
Just compare the value stored in your argument to check what had the user entered:For the USERNAME or MYDB partA solution that came right now in my mind is to add one more argument. It could be a positional or optional too.Positional:Script call: ./myscript.py USERNAME --add user or ./myscript.py MYDB --add databaseOptional:Script call: ./myscript.py --add user --name USERNAME or ./myscript.py --add database --name MYDB
In addition to Hemerson's answer you could also create a subparser with a mutually exclusive group containing the arguments --database and --user.Here is an example:Now you can call:./myscript.py add --database MYDB./myscript.py add --user MYUSERBut not:./myscript.py add./myscript.py add --database MYDB --user MYUSER
