I need to run a Custom Django Management Command (module named populate_db.py) included in a management/commands directory. It populates a database. I want the command to take a mandatory argument as a dictionary. The mentioned dictionary can be obtained from the execution of another program named formDict.py So I want a one-line command which will run formDict.py and consecutively take its result as an argument for my Custom Django Management Command python manage.py populate_db.Is it possible to form such a command at all? If not, how to implement the idea alternatively?
If fromDict.py prints to terminal (STDOUT), you can use a pipe (|) to get the parameter from STDIN in your management command, you can use sys.stdin for that. As you may want to execute the command by itself, it is a good idea to accept a string by parameter too.Your management command would look line:You can execute that command with either:Getting the dict from STDINorPassing the dict by parameterNote: Take care with literal_eval if the dict comes from an untrusted source, as someone could exploit it (with very large values, for exemple) to break the python interpreter. 
Wrap the logic of formDict in a function. Call it inside the handle function of populate_db.py to access the result returned from form_dict.or move formDict.py to management/commands/ and use call_command inside formDict to call populate_db.https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/#running-management-commands-from-your-code.
