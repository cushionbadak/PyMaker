Natural Text
I'm trying to make a function so that it can check to see if the first letter in each string in a list is uppercase.If I have a list, it's only checking the first word. How do I check if the first letter of each word in the list is uppercase or not?

Return False immediately when you stumble upon a non-uppercase letter and return True only after you've checked each element:You may also consider a more compact solution using all:
Instead of returning True if you find a word that starts with upper case, you need to return False when one word doesn't start with upper case. After completing the loop just return True because now all your word starts with upper case.
More pythonic way:
You might find python's builtin any() and all() functions useful: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all
As i mentioned in my comment on your question, the reason for your function to only check for the first word in the list is due to the return statement, ie. as soon as a function gets its return statement executed, the execution of the function finishes.Another way to do what you want to accomplish is via map and a lambda function, which can easily be customised in case you want to do something else later on.Output
