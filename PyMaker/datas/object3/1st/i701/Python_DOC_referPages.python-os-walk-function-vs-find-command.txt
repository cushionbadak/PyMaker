I am writing a program to walk the filesystem to collect file information to put into a database.  I am trying to learn python after a lifetime of shell scripting, and am seeing an issue between what find returns and what os.walk returnsThe issue I have is that the "OS" find returns symlinks to directories, but the python find does not, and I have no idea how to make it do that.  Now I don't want it to follow them (i.e. followlinks=True) and that would create a different result from find as well.  But I want to be able to print the entries that are symlinks to directories.thanksc
If you want to get same output (sorting may vary), you need to print both directories and files for given path. find returns directories as well as links (to anything). Minimal change to you code would be:This may be a bit easier to do with pathlib:For instance I've created the following tree:Running find will yield (note directories and links to directories appear the same way):And running the first snippet with THIS_PATH='.' yields the same items (in slightly different order, find would default to depth first, os.walk does breadth first). For that pathlib example just be ware if THIS_PATH is '.', as is it would chomp the leading ./ off.
