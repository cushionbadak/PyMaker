This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I'm creating a function that receives a number between 1 and 5 (likert scale), from a question. When the user inputs a wrong INT my loop is ok, the question repeats. But i want the question to repeat if the user inputs a string too. But in that case the program crashes "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10" 
int() always returns an integer, so type(L) == int will always be true. If the user types something that isn't a valid integer, int() will signal an error.Use try/except to handle the error if the user enters something that isn't an integer.You don't need elif, since the condition is just the opposite of the if condition; use else. You also don't need continue, since it's at the end of the loop and it's just going to continue anyway.
Instead of trying to abstract the input as int right off the bat, do this instead:
You cast L to int before checking its type. So when L is a string, your program tries to cast it to int and it crashes. You should do numerical operations only when you are sure that L is not a string. The solution is either to use try and catch or to handle it with an if statement.
