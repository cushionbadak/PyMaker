Python 2.7.1I am trying to use python regular expression to extract words inside of a patternI have some string that looks like thisI want to extract the word "my_user_name". I do something likeHow do I extract my_user_name now?
You need to capture from regex. search for the pattern, if found, retrieve the string using group(index). Assuming valid checks are performed:
You can use matching groups:e.g.Here I use re.findall rather than re.search to get all instances of my_user_name.  Using re.search, you'd need to get the data from the group on the match object:As mentioned in the comments, you might want to make your regex non-greedy:to only pick up the stuff between 'name ' and the next ' is valid' (rather than allowing your regex to pick up other ' is valid' in your group.
You could use something like this:
You want a capture group.
Maybe that's a bit shorter and easier to understand:
In Python 3.6+ you can index into a match object instead of using group(), e.g.:
Here's a way to do it without using groups (Python 3.6 or above):
