Natural Text
I'm trying to rename all the files in a director with this code (so far) however, I am not sure how to tell python not to replace the last instance of "."I realize this is probably very simple but I am new to programming any help would be appreciated !the "-1" isn't working and I am not sure what will
Try this :
Use os.splitext to separate the name and the extension, and join them after replacing the dots in the name:
str.replace takes the old substring, the new substring, and the count of how many times to perform the replacement. -1 is not a suitable value for the number of replacements. Count the number of times the old substring appears in the string, and then subtract one from that value and perform that number of replacements.
