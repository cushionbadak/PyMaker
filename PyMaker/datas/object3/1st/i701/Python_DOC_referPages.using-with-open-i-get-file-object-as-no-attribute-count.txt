i wrote the following code which looks ok to me, but when i run it, i get an error:Error I get:What am i doing wrong? i feel it's something small but I cant seem to figure it out.  I suspect its because I'm using with open.  When I scan the file without with, i get no errors:
.count() is a method of list objects.list.count(x)Return the number of times x appears in the list.(Source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)It is not a method of file objects. So you can't use it there. In your second example you are reading the file using the .readlines() method of file objects:readlines(hint=-1)Read and return a list of lines from the stream. hint can be specified to control the number of lines read: no more lines will be  read if the total size (in bytes/characters) of all lines so far  exceeds hint.(Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readlines)Since the .readlines() method returns a list, you can call your .count() method there.
Did you note that the first code does not have a readlines() statement?The following would be an equivalent of the second code:
You could also use it like this:
