It took me a while to understand but it is quite easy the reason, the character table is read in many ways, in your case the problem is that you want to print in utf8 but the table utf-8 is related to the system language, you have to print in utf-16I'll give you some examples:in javascript:in python 3in python 2doc python 2.Xdoc python 3.X
