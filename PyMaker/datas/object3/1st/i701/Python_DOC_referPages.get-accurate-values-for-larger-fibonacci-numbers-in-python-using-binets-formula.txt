I was learning itertools and was trying out to test the accuracy of Binet's formula implemented in python. Reason for using itertools was my assumption that this would take a lot of iterations and a discrepancy would occur only after a lot of iterations.  Outputs:Before using int() i used round() in fib1(), and the result was So by changing that i was able to improve the iteration count by one. My guess is that the math.sqrt() has some limitations and this can be swapped by "something else" to make it more accurate. My question is what all can be done to improve the accuracy of my binet's formula's implementation. I read through decimal but was not able to make it work for me. I read many questions on SO regarding Fibonacci  implementation in python and all of them uses math.sqrt().
decimal is the way to go. By the way, at the end, there's no point isliceing by 1 when you can just do next(r):With a precision of 100, a result ofwas achieved. Pretty impressive! I used a precision of 1000, and gotthough the code did take a while to run (~30 sec).
