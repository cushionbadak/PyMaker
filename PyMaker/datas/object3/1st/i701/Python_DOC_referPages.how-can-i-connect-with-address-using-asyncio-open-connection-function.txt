I would like to connect with several address using asyncio library, like '127.0.0.1:8000/hello'But where can I put '/hello' part ? and how can I call this part? (endpoint? static url? )
But where can I put /hello part ?asyncio.open_connection opens a raw TCP connection to the given remote endpoint. The address of the form 127.0.0.1:8000/hello strongly indicates an HTTP connection. HTTP is a protocol built on top of TCP, where you connect to the given host and port (127.0.0.1 and port 8000 in your case) using TCP and send a request in a specified format, and to which the server answers with a response.HTTP communication is a complex topic and is not something you want to implement from scratch. Fortunately there are mature asyncio-aware libraries that handle it for you, such as aiohttp. Using that library connecting to a server might look like this:and how can I call this part? (endpoint? static url? )That part is typically called the path of the URL, see e.g. section 3.3 of the RFC for more details.
