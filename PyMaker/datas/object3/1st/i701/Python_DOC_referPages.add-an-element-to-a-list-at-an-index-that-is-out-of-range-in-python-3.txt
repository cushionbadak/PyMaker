In other languages, such as javascript, when you add a value to an array that is outside of the range of indexes you "extend" the array with undefined values until the specified index.Example: When I try to do this in Python, I get a list assignment index out of range error.Is there a way to do the same thing in Python?
You can subclass list and override the __setitem__ method so that it will extend the list as required by the given index, which could also be a slice object, in which case the larger of the start and stop attributes of the slice should be used:so that:outputs:Note that the expected output in your question in incorrect because an index of 5 actually refers to the 6th, rather than the 5th, item of the list.
Do you mean something like Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, None, 5]???I may be misunderstanding the problem, but
