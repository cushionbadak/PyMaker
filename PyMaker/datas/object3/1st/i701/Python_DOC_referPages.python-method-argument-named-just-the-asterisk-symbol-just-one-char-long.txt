What does a bare asterisk in the arguments of a function do?When I looked at the pickle module, I see this: (http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/pickle.html#pickle.dump)I know about a single and double asterisks preceding arguments (for variable number of arguments), but this precedes nothing. And I'm pretty sure this has nothing to do with pickle. That's probably just an example of this happening. I only learned its name when I sent this to the interpreter:If it matters, I'm on python 3.3.0.
Bare * is used to force the caller to use named arguments - so you cannot define a function with * as an argument when you have no following keyword arguments.See this answer or Python 3 documentation for more details.
While the original answer answers the question completely, just adding a bit of related information. The behaviour for the single asterisk derives from PEP-3102. Quoting the related section:In simple english, it means that to pass the value for key, you will need to explicitly pass it as key="value".
the above example with **kwargs
