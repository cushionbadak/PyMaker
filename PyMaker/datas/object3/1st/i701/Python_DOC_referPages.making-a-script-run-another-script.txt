This question already has an answer here:Calling an external command in Python                    56 answers                I am trying to make a game, I have made a basic launcher. This is just another version of it. I made it in python 3.I have tried watching YouTube videos on how to do it but they are all using python 2. I still tried it, it didn't work.SCRIPT_TWO.pyI still want it to launch the other script but also transfer the variables. I want it to be as simple as possible.
If you're sure you don't want to import the first file from the second then the below answer is for you.os.system(args) is a relatively simple function and does not allow passing of arguments. I suggest you take a look at subprocess.run(...). It allows you to pass arguments as a list which you can then access through the second script as normal command line arguments.For example:script1.pyscript2.pyIn this way the subprocess module is very helpful, I suggest you take a look at its documentation here.
