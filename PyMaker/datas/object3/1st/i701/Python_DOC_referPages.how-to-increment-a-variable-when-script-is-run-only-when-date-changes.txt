I borrowed some code from this site to increment a number when a python script is run. This works great. What I am trying to do is if the script is run numerous times in one day the variable should not change. When the script is run on a different day the number increments one time for that day. This is the code I borrowed.
You should write the current date into the file along with the current value of the variable.  This way next time your script is run it can derive not only the variable value but also the date of the day it was last increased.  If this matches the current date, do not increase the variable value.  If it doesn't match, increase the value and write it, together with the current date, back into the file.
If you do not want to save the current date in the file, you may use os.stat('filename'), here the docs.os.stat() will give you something similar to this: os.stat_result(st_mode=33188, st_ino=1585598, st_dev=2058, st_nlink=1, st_uid=1000, st_gid=1000, st_size=364, st_atime=1548854761, st_mtime=1548854758, st_ctime=1548854758)You cat get the st_mtime vaule with os.stat('filename').st_mtime. This is the time when the file was modified last time.This answer explains how to convert it to a datetime. You can then compare the datetime of last modification with current datetime, and check if a reasonable amount of time is passed or not to increment the counter.
