I want to know if there are any build-in class of python3 that can represent the number in all hex, binary, integer. type.So I do not need to implment lots of methods to convert from one form to the another.For example
class str(object=''). In particular you can use str.format()Just simply call .format() function and pass in the value. For example:output:bin: 1010100111011   hex: 153b   int: 5435oroutput:bin: 0b1010100111011   hex: 0x153b   int: 5435
This can be achieved with the built-in integers and functions:If you want to obtain a string representation of i, you can use str(i).To obtain the number itself from other bases: i = int("ff", 16).
