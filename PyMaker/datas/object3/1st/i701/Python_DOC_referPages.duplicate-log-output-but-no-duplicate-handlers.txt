I am getting duplicate log output from a logger that only has 1 handler attached.How can I debug this?Code (should be copy-and-paste-able):
Loggers propagate log events to their ancestors' handlers by default. a_logger may only have one handler, but its parent, the root logger, also has a handler (actually the same handler). a_logger.info('hi') is handled by both handlers (actually the same handler twice).You don't need to attach the same handler to every logger. Attaching it to the root logger is enough.
