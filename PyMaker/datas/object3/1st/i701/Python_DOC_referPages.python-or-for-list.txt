In Python you can do which will printCan you do the same with a list? I.e. is there a Python function foo so that the following will also print hello?Note that bar is not printed.
You can use next(filter(None, ...)) or next(filter(bool, ...)) to find the first truthy value from a list:The filter() function takes both a filter function, and an iterable, and returns an iterator that of the values from the iterable that pass the filter.But when you set the filter function to None, then it is essentially the same thing as using bool as the filter function, so only values that are true are allowed through. The next() function then gives you the first such value.Demo:You may want to add the last value in l as a default for the next() call, in case there are only falsey values; v1 or v2 or v3 or v4 would at least produce v4 if none of the values are truthy, so the following does too:Using filter(None, ...) is a fraction faster than filter(bool, ...) because the filter.__next__ implementation tests for None before it tests for bool; this speed difference is very small and barely measurable (within a margin of error):
You can use the function reduce() with the operator or in the lambda function:
