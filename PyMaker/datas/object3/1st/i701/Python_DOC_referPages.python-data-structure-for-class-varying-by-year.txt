I have a class like this...And am loading data like this...But the data varies by year, e.g. 2019, 2020 etc and I'm struggling to visualise an appropriate way to represent that in the data structure.  I know I could in theory do this...But it feels super clumsy so I'm hoping there's a way to point to a 2019 version of the carData object.  For example, a data model that supports something like...I know that's not valid but am a bit lost on how to achieve the scenario in python.  
You mean:and then:?
You can use @property https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property
You can create a method that does the filtering for you:You'll have to get some data structure in the car_data and house_data objects, perhaps a dictionary to store the year or date values.
