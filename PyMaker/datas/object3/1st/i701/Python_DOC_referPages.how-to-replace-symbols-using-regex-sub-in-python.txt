I'm a bit confused what you exactly want to achieve. But if you want to replace ABC in every match of pattern <<<ABC\w+=\[0]>>>, then you can use backreferences to groups.For example, modify pattern so that you can reference the groups (<<<)ABC(\w+=\[0]>>>). Now group#1 refers to the part before ABC and group#2 refers to part after ABC. So the replacement string looks like this - \1DEF\2 - where \1 is group#1 and \2 is group#2.The output: id=,value=<<<,RMOrigin=[0]>>>BasicData:id=ABCvalue=<<<DEFRMGrade=[0]>>>BasicData:id=ABCvalue=You also can use function to define replacement. For more check in documentation.
