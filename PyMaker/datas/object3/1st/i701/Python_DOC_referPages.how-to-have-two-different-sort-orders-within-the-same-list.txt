This question already has an answer here:Sort a list by multiple attributes?                    4 answers                I have a sorted list such as which is the output of my_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0]). However, if there is a tie with the 0th element of each sub-list, as is the case with the middle two elements, then I need the sort to have the lists with end come first. So the desired output would be
You can do it sorting by another element, a boolean, indicating whether or not the second element is end:This will be using the following list of tuples in order to sort the list:Where the second element will be False if it is not end in my_list. Now sorting this array will yield the expected result, given that False i.e. (0) will come before True (1) when the first elements match:As @jpp points out you could simply sort by the second element lexicographically in this case:
