I am a beginner in python and working on a starter programming project where I want to:Estimate the number of calories in one cubic mile of chocolate ice cream.Note: There are 5,280 feet in a mile and one cubic foot of chocolate ice cream contains about 48,600 calories.My code:Output: Why does this happen? Is there an issue with the way I am framing the equation?
As noted, the problem is the line calories = 48,600.The problem is that due to the , on the right side, this is the same as calories = (48, 600), which is a tuple. And for tuples, multiplication means "repeat the tuple n times". So e.g. 2 * (48, 600) == (48, 600, 48, 600).But since you do 5280**3 * calories, this is trying to allocate a tuple with 2 * 5280**3 = 294395904000 elements, which seems to be too big to fit into your memory (assuming 64bits per value, this would be 2.14 TiB, which is larger than most peoples memory).Note that in Python 3.6+ you can use _ as a separator for thousands:
You are trying to print the tuple (48, 600) (that's what you get when you write calories = 48,600) 147197952000 times.Your output would be:Your pc simply cannot handle the approx. 1324781568000 characters that you want to dump at once.Instead of using , as a thousand separator, you should just write 48600.Output:Edit:Actually, it's not the printing or the creating of such a large string that fails, because it seems - at least for me - that Python will run out of memory when attempting to create 147197952000 pointers to the tuple, which you can test by running only (48,600) * 147197952000.
