I've installed a user module with the command pip --ignore-installed --user requests[security] and realized that the python interpreter, which is embedded in a tool, is ignoring that and is loading first the System wide installed Module i: So went ahead and inserted manually my user path and tried to reload every module in OpenSSL like this:However, I've realized that that OpenSSL comes with so files. Is reload reloading so files as well?Let me know if more info is needed.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html?highlight=reload#imp.reloadThere are a number of other caveats:It is legal though generally not very useful to reload built-in or dynamically loaded modules, except for sys, __main__ and builtins. In many cases, however, extension modules are not designed to be initialized more than once, and may fail in arbitrary ways when reloaded.(Emphasize mine â€” phd.)
