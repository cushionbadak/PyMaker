In TypeScript, you would do something likeHow can I do the same in Python? I tried the following:And got this traceback:So Coroutine expects 3 types. But why? And what should they be in this case?This is also specified in the docs, but I still don't understand
The example in the docs shows what the three types are: what you'd get back if you sent a value; what value you can send; and what you'd get it you awaited it. It also links to the Generator definition with more examples, and a slightly clearer definition:In your case I'd guess [None, None, str], as you only care about the awaitable value.
