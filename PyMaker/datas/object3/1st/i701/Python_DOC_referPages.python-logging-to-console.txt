The problem comes from the call to basicConfig which sets up a log handler for stderr and also accepts a format string, not a formatter. Because you are doing this work yourself later, you don't need to use the basicConfig function. More information can be found in the python documentation.Removing the call to basicConfig, and adding a self.log.setLevel(self.log_level) will fix the issue you are seeing.Working code:
Looking through a similar issue on the Python bug tracker (https://bugs.python.org/issue16368), you can see that the formatter argument is expected to be a string (hence the attempt to invoke find):
