Natural Text
I have a space seperated txt file like following:I want to calculate the mean of  both Tmax and Tmin seperately. But, I am having hard time reading txt file. I tried this link like.But, it is giving me error : IndexError: list index out of rangewhat is wrong here?
A simple way to solve that is to use split() function.Of course, you need to drop the first two lines:You get:Quoting the documentation:If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.
I have added my answer with some comments in the code itself.You were getting the Index out of range error because your list_line was having only a single element(i.e. 2004 in the first line of file) and you were trying to access the 1st and 3rd index of the list_line.

As stated here, re.findall lists all matches of your regular expression. the expression you define does not match anything in your file and you therefore get an empty array, leading to the error when you try to access list_line[1].the expression you want to match base on that file would be r"\d+\.\d+", matching any decimal number with at least one digit before the decimal point, that decimal point and at least one digit after iteven this expression will not match anything in the first two lines, so you will want to check for empty arraysthe result does not know of any columns, just matches of the pattern, and there will be two matches for each data line - you will want indizes 0 and 1so:    import re    list_b = []    list_d = []
Simplify your life and avoid 're' for this problem.Perhaps you are reading the header row mistakenly?  If the format of the file is fixed, I usually "burn" the header row with a line read before starting the loop like:Then you have a list of tokens, which will be strings that you'll need to convert to int or float or whatever and go from there!Put in a couple print statements to see what you are picking up...
Is it possible that your file is tab delimited?For Tab Delimited:
