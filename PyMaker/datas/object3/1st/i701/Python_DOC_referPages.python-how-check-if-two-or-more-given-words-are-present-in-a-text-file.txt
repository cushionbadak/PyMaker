Natural Text
I have a text file consider questions.txt, I wanted to check if all the 5 questions numbers are present or not For example, if the file contains Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 But not Q5  it should output as "Q5 not found"or atleast as "not all questions found"Basically I wanted to search if all the given words(question numbers)are present in the txt file or not 
Here is one way to do that:You could also use re.search() for more complicated patterns.
Considering the variable text as the text you'd like to search, I'd use:oc_Q will contain all occurrences of the Q[1-5]s.
