I am trying to create a list that holds dictionaries of randomly generated colors. So for instance, the first dictionary of the list would be color 0 with values of 255, 255, 255. I am getting a syntax error with the "color{x}" where python is saying that it should be an integer or a splice, but not a string. Removing the color part gives me another error where python is saying the set object has no format attribute. This is using pygame 1.9.4 and python 3.7 and I am rather new to python programming in general. I have tried messing with the "color{x}" part, but this previous thread had something similar that work for them, so I just copied the syntax to see if I could get it to work.I am trying to get the list colors to hold 3 dictionaries (at the moment, plan on expanding the list when I get it working), that hold a randomly generated color.
If I understand correctly you actually want a dictionary of tuples. Something like this:
You are confusing list with dictionary - a list is simply that ... a list - an indexable collection  of things . What you need is a dictionary - something that stores a value under a key . Dictionarys are created by:  colors = {}.The other error you get is from using str.format() with a named parameter -you can omit the x or fix it like this:if you just use format will replace positionally .. the 1st {}placeholder is replaced with the 1st value in format( 1st, 2nd, ...) etc.                         Readup:listsmore on listsdictionariesstr.format()Fixed code:Output:Doku:random.choices(iterable, k= number)If you really need tuples, you can use tuple( random.choices(range(0,256), k =3) )
