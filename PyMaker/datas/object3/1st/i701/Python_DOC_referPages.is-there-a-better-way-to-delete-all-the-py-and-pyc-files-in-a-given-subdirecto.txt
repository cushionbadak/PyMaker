Natural Text
I wrote a script to delete all the .py and .pyc files in a given sub-directory called "migrations". The end goal is to remove all migration files from my django project, so there are multiple sub-folders called "migrations" and I would like to remove all .py and .pyc (except init.py) from these folders. The script I wrote below works but I am new to python and figure there has to be a better way then all the nested loops. Any suggestions? This is a windows system which complicates things for me.
You are doing double work with calling os.walk() for subdirectories that will already be handled by the outer os.walk() loop.All you need to test for is if migrations is an element in the current root path to the directory being handled:You could also just use a recursive glob pattern, with the glob module:
One os.walk should do most of the work for you; the only other loop you should need is to go trhough the files in each directory it gets you to.  You certainly don't need a nested os.walk.
