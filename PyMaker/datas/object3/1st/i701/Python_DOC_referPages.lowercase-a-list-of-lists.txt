I have a list of lists: How can I iterate through the list and lowercase all the content using python? 
Using a list comprehension:Or functionally:From the docs:Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it  is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string.
Iterate over each of the inner lists:
You could map() all sub lists of data to map() that will make all of its elements lower().Output
For an arbitrary number of levels, you can try this recursion 
data = [map(str.lower, sublist) for sublist in data]
