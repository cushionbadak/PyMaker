This question already has an answer here:How do I execute a string containing Python code in Python?                    13 answers                I want to be able to take a string which describes a Python function and turn it into a function object which I can then call. For example,  My desire to be able to do this arose from a problem posed in my theoretical foundations of computing class, which operates under an assumption of SISO (String in, String out). In particular, we are examining the uncomputable problem yesOnString(P,I), which returns "yes" if P(I) = "yes" and "no" otherwise. Thus I want to be able to have a function P passed in String form as a parameter, and then have the function convert the string into a function which it then calls. 
This is possible with the Python built-in exec() function.If you want to keep the same naming patternIn terms of safety: exec() executes the given string, any given string.So be really careful how it's used.  Certainly not on any sort of user's input.
