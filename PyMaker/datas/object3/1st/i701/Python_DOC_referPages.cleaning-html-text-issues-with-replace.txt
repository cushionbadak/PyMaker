Natural Text
I have an editor that ads:I use:The problem is that sometimes remove everything, an in all cases for the first paragraph I always get: p>ï»¿(removes the first chracter in tag).
Your error is in how you use the strip method, which removes any leading or trailing  sequence of the '<br>' characters. So <b>hello</b> would be stripped to hello</, for example.If you want to remove any <br> in the beginning and in the end of the value string, you can do it like so:
Base on you solution, why not just do ?Shouldn't that be enough ?All <p> and </p> would get replaced and the rest of string will remain untouched.For value = "<p><br></p>" you will get "<br>".For value = "<p></p>" you will get ''.For value = "<p></p>oueo<p>54<br>65</p>eoue<p></p>" you will get "'oueo54<br>65eoue'".
