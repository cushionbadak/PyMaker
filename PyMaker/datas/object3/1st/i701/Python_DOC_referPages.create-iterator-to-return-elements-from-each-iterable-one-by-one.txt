I was learning the itertools module and I am trying to make an iterator to return each element from the iterables provided as input.with one more rider that if say the lists are not of the same length then next(it) should return elements from the longer list when the shorter one runs out.Attempt at solutionWhich kind of solves my problemOutputs:Is there an easier or better way to do this? I searched for a solution on SO and was not able to get one.
You can use itertools.chain.from_iterable() to flatten the sequence, and use a generator expression to filter out the None values:Rather than use None as the sentinel value, you may want to use a dedicated sentinel so you can use None in the input list:If you want to filter out falsey values, then you can also use filter(None, ...):Demo:and with a local sentinel:The itertools recipes section also has:
If you want a modified version of your code, building a generator from the start (no storing list l):Though I advise for using the builtin solutions above.
