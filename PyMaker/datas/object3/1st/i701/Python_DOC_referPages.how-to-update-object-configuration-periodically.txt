I`m writing a connector to our CRM system. CRM has its own configurations I want to be aware of. CRM is the only source of trust for these configurations and provides them via an API. Now I have my connector in python package as a python class. CRM configurations are updated on init, but as soon as they can be changed from CRM I want them to be periodically updated. Is there any good way to create some kind of task on object instance creation to perform configuration updates?Now I update configurations one time, but I need to update them periodically.
It appears the best way is not to use a different thread or task with periodic updates, but save last time the configuration was updated and if this time exits some timeout update the configuration before actually performing the request.Or if your API has the luxury of good exceptions for the "Configuration was changed" it is even better to perform the configuration update on response handler before the request retry.I`m using a request wrapper for these purposes.
