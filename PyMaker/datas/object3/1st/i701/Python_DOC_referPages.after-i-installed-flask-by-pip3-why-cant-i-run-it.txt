After I installed flask by pip3, why can't I run it? How can I run it then? Thanks.
Try as a modulepython -m flask run
Your command does not run, because python3 expects a file as its argument, and there's not one there (or a directory, check out the documentation linked below).The option -m module-name will search the sys.path for the module you pass on, and execute its contents as the __main__ module. Check out the official docs. You might have seen that as an example, where people run python3 -m http.server to serve files from their current directory.
