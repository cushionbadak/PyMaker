In python 3.3 and later, when we override __new__(), we don't have to pass arguments and keyword arguments to super().__new__() or object.__new__(). But this call to super().__new__() returns an instance of a class.  How does python pass the rest of the arguments to __init__ then?Can someone please explain whats happening here?  
You passed cls as an argument to object.__new__, so the interpreter can check whether instance is an instance of cls.The initializer (__init__) is  automatically called by the allocator (__new__) as [Python 3]: object.__new__(cls[, ...]) (emphases are mine) states:If __new__() returns an instance of cls, then the new instance’s __init__() method will be invoked like __init__(self[, ...]), where self is the new instance and the remaining arguments are the same as were passed to __new__().If __new__() does not return an instance of cls, then the new instance’s __init__() method will not be invoked.code.py:Output:Note that this isn't specific  to Python 3
What matters here is the initial call, say spam = Spam('x', 1).Internally, Python calls __new__ as a class method on class Spam with the passed parameters. What Spam.__new__ actually does is not really important, it is just supposed to return an object.It does use object.__new__ to build a Spam object. As the created object has the correct class, Python calls __init__ on it with the initial parameters.
