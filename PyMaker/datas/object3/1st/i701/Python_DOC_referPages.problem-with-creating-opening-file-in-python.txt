What is the best way to represent a Windows directory, for example "C:\meshes\as"? I have been trying to modify a script but it never works because I can't seem to get the directory right, I assume because of the '\' acting as escape character?
you can use always:this works both in linux and windows.Other posibility isif you have problems with some names you can also try raw string literals:however best practice is to use the os.path module functions that always select the correct configuration for your OS:From python 3.4 you can also use the pathlib module. This is equivelent to the above:or
Use the os.path module.Or use raw strings
Yes, \ in Python string literals denotes the start of an escape sequence. In your path you have a valid two-character escape sequence \a, which is collapsed into one character that is ASCII Bell:Other common escape sequences include \t (tab), \n (line feed), \r (carriage return):As you can see, in all these examples the backslash and the next character in the literal were grouped together to form a single character in the final string. The full list of Python's escape sequences is here.There are a variety of ways to deal with that:Python will not process escape sequences in string literals prefixed with r or R:Python on Windows should handle forward slashes, too.You could use os.path.join ...... or the newer pathlib module
