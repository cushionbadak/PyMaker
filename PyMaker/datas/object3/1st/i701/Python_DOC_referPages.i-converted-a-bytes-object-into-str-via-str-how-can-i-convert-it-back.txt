I converted some Chinese characters into UTF-8 in a string object for some operations.  I now have a problem when I try to convert the string object back into a bytes object.I tried using bytes():I want to convert it back to a bytes object, so I can use decode('utf-8') to convert it back to the original Chinese characters.
You should not convert bytes objects to strings with str(bytes_value). You created a printable representation of the object.The proper way to convert from bytes to str is to decode the bytes to Unicode. If you have UTF-8 bytes, decode with that codec with the bytes.decode() method:You can also specify the encoding if you want to use the str() function, see the  str(bytes_value, encoding) form in the documentation:If you accidentally used str(bytes_value) and can't now get the original value by fixing that error and re-running your code, you can recover the original value by using ast.literal_eval():This should only be used to recover data, not as a production-level serialisation mechanism. ast.literal_eval() is quite slow, and not safe from denial-of-service attacks when used on user-supplied input (it is possible to crash Python or significantly slow it down with bad input).If you are using an API that should really work on bytes but for some reason is only accepting strings (usually a warning sign of a incorrectly designed and implemented API), then either use a binary-to-ASCII encoding (including base64 / base16 / base32 / base85) or decode the binary data as Latin-1.This is even more important if you are doing this to encrypt data. The printable representation of a bytes() object only ever uses ASCII characters, always starts with b' or b", and always ends in ' or ". Any non-printable bytes (more than half of all 256 possible byte values) are represented with a limited range of \x{hh} and \{l} escape sequences. All this makes it much easier for a determined attacker to break your encryption. A best-practices encryption library will let you encrypt bytes directly. In fact, it is usually preferred to encrypt bytes.
