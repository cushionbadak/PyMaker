I'm trying to replicate Perl Fathom in Python. This step corrects the syllable count for some word combinations. Is =~ equivalent to re.match in Python? re.match only looks for the first instance. Thank you!  
=~ is the binding operator. It can bind a match, substitution, or transliteration. I guess only the first one could be equivalent to matching in Python, but it seems you need re.search instead, as matching with // is not anchored at the beginning of the string.
Certainly not re.match(). It's a bit of a gotcha, but re.match matches pattern only starting at the beginning of the string.If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.re.search() is more likely what you are looking for (unless you regex patter happens to always match beginning of the string).
