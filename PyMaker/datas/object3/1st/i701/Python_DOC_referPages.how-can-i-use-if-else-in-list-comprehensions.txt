This question already has an answer here:How to write inline if statement for print?                    13 answers                Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?                    28 answers                I'm trying to create a list with even numbers showing as they are and odd numbers showing as "odd".Here is the code I am trying. I expected to get something like this But I keep getting SyntaxError exception:What am I doing wrong?
You are missing the x before if:The Python conditional expression syntax has to have both the 'true' and the 'false' expressions present, so true_expr if condition else false_expr, where one of true_expr or false_expr will be evaluated based on the truth value of the condition expression.Demo:Note that using a conditional expression doesn't filter, it always produces output. That's great for the per-iteration expression side of the list comprehenion syntax, but if you wanted to filter the input list and remove odd values altogether, then use a if condition test after the for ... in ... loop:
Is this what you wanted?If that is the case you where simply missing something to return in the list comprehension, in this case you want to return x if the condition is satisfied.
