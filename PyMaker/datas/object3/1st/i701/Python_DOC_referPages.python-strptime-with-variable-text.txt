Natural Text
I have a list of dates as strings. It looks like this:I need to parse these dates to datetime format.Is there any way I can tell strptime, in the format specifier, to ignore the text in [something] since it can be variable? Is there a format specifier for variable text?
You can override the _strptime.TimeRE object with an additional directive that lazily matches any sequence of characters:This outputs:
There is no wildcard directive for strptime. You can see a list of the directives here https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftimeA sensible way to solve your problem would be to combine a regex with the strptime. I.e. filter out the text with the regex and put the remaining, restricted text into the strptime, or by just passing the matched groups directly into datetime.Note that you also have the April/May 30-1 complication in there, I'm not addressing that, since you are not asking about that.As a bonus though:Also, note the interesting, if a bit hacky solution offered by @blhsing below, involving _strptime.TimeRE. I would not recommend doing anything like that, but it is interesting to know you could actually change the behaviour of strptime itself that way.
