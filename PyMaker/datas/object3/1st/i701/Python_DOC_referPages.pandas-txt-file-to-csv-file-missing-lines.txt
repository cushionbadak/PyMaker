Natural Text
I want to convert a .txt file into a .csv file. The .txt file consists of a list of words along with their POS tags in the form of:Sophie_NNP listens_VBZ to_TO her_PRP$ classmates_NNS as_IN they_PRP tell_VBP her_PRP (and so on).Using this code, I converted it into a csv file so that each word and its tag are on their own line:This works fine, only the problem is that when I open the .csv file in Notepad++ or Excel, it seems to skip out lines 30 through to 540 (there are 571 in total) and replaces them with dots in one line.Screenshot of the area where the lines are missingIs there something I can add to my code that will prevent this from happening so that I can see every single line? Ideally in Excel as this is where the work will be continued.As requested by Jan:Here is the full .txt file:B_IN The_DT dare_NN Sophie_NNP listens_VBZ to_TO her_PRP$ classmates_NNS as_IN they_PRP tell_VBP her_PRP about_IN the_DT dare_NN ._.

("'", "''")And the intended solution would be simply what is in the above screenshot, but instead of the ellipsis, you should actually see every single word with the POS tag - all 571 lines. This is the full Excel table I get at the moment:Excel result with ellipsis (Would like for the ... to be replaced through the actual words and POS tags)
Use df.to_csvWhat you are seeing is the middle of the dataframe sentence as displayed on the screen. 
Do you need to use Pandas for this? Seems like you can read the entire text file to a variable and split on the spaces.Edit - some more details:First you want to open the files with 'with'. This ensures the files are closed after you are done with them.Next you have the file contents (presumably as text) and you can simply perform the .split(" ") method on the string which would split on the spaces and give you a list containing many strings.Then we open the output csv file with 'with' again and use the csv module writerows to write the file out. writerows:  Write all elements in rows (an iterable of row objects as described  above) to the writerâ€™s file object, formatted according to the current  dialect.
You can give list to pandas DataFrameHope this helps!
