I need to create a list of datetime elements every minute from 2007-01-01 00:00 to 2016-01-01 00:00 but without February 29th. My code is the next:I should have a list for 9 years without 29.02. But my list of dates still contains February 29th of 2008 and 2012. I was trying to apply this code:but as a result I have a list, which does not contain an appropriate number of days, anly 8 years and 14 days.Do you have any solution or ideas about solving the issue? 
How about:
You can do this easily with pandas a popular external data manipulation package:This takes about 700ms on my machine.
Here's a relatively efficient, Pure Pythonâ„¢, way to do it. The way leap days are skipped is simply by not including them in the _DAYS_IN_MONTH table (so nothing special is done depending on whether or not the current year being processed is a leap year).I don't know precisely why you [think] you need this, but it might be better to do it via a generator function, which would eliminate the need of storing so many datatime objects in memory at the same time. 
You can't compare attributes of the datetime object to the object itself, and that is what is causing the problem. This should be the solution. This is by no means optimized and is very unpythonic, but see if you can improve it. I have a chemistry exam tomorrow and I don't have time. Cheers!
