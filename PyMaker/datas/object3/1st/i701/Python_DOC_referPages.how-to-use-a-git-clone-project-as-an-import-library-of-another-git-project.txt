I have two cloned git projects in my directory, myProject and OpenSourceProject. I did a pip install of OpenSourceProject so that I could use it as a dependency within myProject, for example:However, I recently cloned OpenSourceProject from GitHub with the sole purpose of modifying some code (fixing bugs and etc). It is now in the same directory as my other git cloned project, myProject. Is it possible for me to import the modified git instead of still using the pip install version? And how can I do that?
1st, you still can pip install the modified version; just cd to the cloned directory and run pip install .Or you can modify sys.path to point to the cloned code. See the tutorial on how Python finds modules to import. Change sys.path in your scripts or environment variable PYTHONPATH before running the scripts.
