In the following code in python:Why print(a[b]) can be executed but an error message is shown for print(c[b])?
This type of indexing only works for numpy.ndarray and c is just a python list so you can't index it like numpy.ndarray. You can convert it to numpy array first then use your indexing.
In python, list accepts integer based index.To executeOutput of the above codeThe C list is being iterated from index 2 to index 3. As python iterated upto end-1 index.E.g c[2:4] only index 2 and index 3 will be considered.
When you use bracket on an object like this:You are calling the function __getitem__ of the class of the object a with b as the argument. See this for more detailed of the function.Now if a[b] does not show an error while c[b] raises one this means that the implementation of the method __getitem__ for the class of a is handling the type of b and the implementation of this method for the class of c does not. This behaviour is exactly the same for every functions, the call is just a bit hidden.
