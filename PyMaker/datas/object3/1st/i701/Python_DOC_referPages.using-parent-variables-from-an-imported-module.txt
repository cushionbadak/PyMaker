I have some script, i.e. main.py It uses a module module.py with some variables:functions func1, func2...integers int1, int2...and so onSo, I need to extend the functionality of module.py by a nice brand-new submodule named submodule.py that should use variables of module.py to deliver me new features.Here's some code of submodule.py:So I'm using from submodule import * (I know there are no overriding names) in the module.py code and then using module.New_Feature in main.pyThat code throws NameError: name 'func1' is not definedSo how I can import submodule to use module's variables in it?EDIT: Just explaining why I need this. I'm writing an API wrapper with a bunch of features, but these features should be optional to not overweight main file so users can just use what they need.
