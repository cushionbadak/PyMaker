Natural Text
I have a list of tuples which look like belowI want to store those tuples which have the same second values. As you can see, the tuples ('loc', 'blr') and ('cap', 'blr') have the same second value.I want these two tuples to be stored in a list for me to refer.This is what I tried but it doesn't work as expectedBut I get all the tuples as if all tuples have same second value. How can I accomplish this?Desired output
You could group together lists with common second elements in the following way:If performance is an issue consider using operator.itemgetter:Now, if you only want to keet cases where two tuples had a common second element, you can do:I proposed this answer so that this way you can extend this to n common elements in the second place, as you may have more than 2.
You can use O(n log n) itertools.groupby (requires pre-sorting your input list), but O(n) collections.Counter is sufficient:
You can group these tuples using dict for a more common caseall pairs with same second value will be grouped under different keys
