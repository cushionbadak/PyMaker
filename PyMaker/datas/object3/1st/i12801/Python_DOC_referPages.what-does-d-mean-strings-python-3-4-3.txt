I'm practicing for my finals, doing a task where I'm to assign a number to a spot in a row/column system. The suggested method of solving is this:So I am specifically asking about the content of the print function. Does the {:d} part just mean a dictionary by the name of (row, col, num)?I was wrong in my assumption that this was about dictionaries. It was actually a formatting toolI'm sorry if this is a stupid question.
It is a formatting character. It tells the formatter to treat the argument as an integer number and format it as such. Other valid formatters could be x to format it as a hexadecimal number, or b for binary, etc.See the Format String Syntax, and more specifically, the Format Specification Mini-Language:'d'  Decimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10.Each {...} part is a slot, and the positional arguments to the str.format() method are slotted in in the same order.
