On Python 3.5.0:On Python 3.5.1:Seems like something about namedtuple changed (or maybe it was something about vars()?).Was this intentional? Are we not supposed to use this pattern for converting named tuples into dictionaries anymore?
Per Python bug #24931:[__dict__] disappeared because it was fundamentally broken in Python 3, so it had to be removed.  Providing __dict__ broke subclassing and produced odd behaviors.Revision that made the changeSpecifically, subclasses without __slots__ defined would behave weirdly:Use ._asdict().
From the docsNamed tuple instances do not have per-instance dictionaries, so they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples.The  docs (and help(namedtuple)) say to use c._asdict() to convert to a dict.
__dict__ was implemented as a @property and has been removed; you can see the change in the source code:3.5.0:3.5.1:
