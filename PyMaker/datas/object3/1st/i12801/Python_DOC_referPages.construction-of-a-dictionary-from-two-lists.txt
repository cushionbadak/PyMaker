This question already has an answer here:Convert two lists into a dictionary in Python                    15 answers                I have two lists as shown below (of equal length)I want to construct a dictionary as followsMy python interpreter says invalid syntax. why is this invalid? How would I do this?
Comprehensions expect a single iterable (list, etc) to loop across.  So, to solve it, you first need to convert your two lists into a single list, then feed that list into a comprehension that converts it to dict.Pulling the above line apart a bit, you first use python's zip to aggregate the elementsThen you convert that into a dict:or more simply

What you actually want is Doing a nested loop will give you the wrong results as it will iterate the cartesian product of the two lists as evidenced by:
You can simply do it using this.
