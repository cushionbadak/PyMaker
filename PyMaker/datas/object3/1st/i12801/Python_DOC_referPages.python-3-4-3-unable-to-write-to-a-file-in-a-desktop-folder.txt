Natural Text
I have a simple code to write a file in a specific folder. System creates the file in the folder but couldn't write on it. It is on windows and I checked the IDE write access (Pycharm) they seems fine. File is empty. Following with code is to read whether I could write or ensure the previous one is finished. It is not writing the short string to the file.  I have tried it on command line but it didn't work there also.
The write is a method (function), you need to call, instead of assigning to it.
