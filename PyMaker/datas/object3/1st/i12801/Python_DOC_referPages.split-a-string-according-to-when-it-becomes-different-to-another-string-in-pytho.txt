Natural Text
I have a variable that contains strings, and the strings are grouped. For example the variable looks something like:and I need to split this into two variables, one containing "crop production" and "fertilizer use" and the other containing "beans" and "cassava". The use of comma and colon was intentional; the use isn't consistent throughout the data.Therefore, I need a way to split the string according to when the content of one string differs from the previous. I'm sure there must be a way to do this but my python skills are not up to it yet, so I'd greatly appreciate any advice.(I should also make clear that the use of beans and cassava is purely illustrative, the data contains many different items and therefore I can't simply split when it sees "beans" for example)
The index will hold the location at which they differ.
