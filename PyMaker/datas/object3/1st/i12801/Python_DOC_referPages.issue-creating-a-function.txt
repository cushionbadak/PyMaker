I'm trying to take this piece of code and put it into a function however it's not printing when I run it, this is the following code I've written, what's missing? Thank you for your help!
When a python file is executed it is assigned a name. The initial file that is executed via "python file.py" is assigned the name "main" and it is stored under the variable __name__. In other cases, say the file is imported ("import file") then __name__ is assigned a different name.see https://docs.python.org/3/library/main.html
