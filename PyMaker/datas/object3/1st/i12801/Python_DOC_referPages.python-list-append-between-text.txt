In Python 3, how would you go about taking the string between header tags, for example, printing Hello, world!, out of <h1>Hello, world!</h1>:
You need an HTML Parser. For example, BeautifulSoup:Demo:I'm not allowed to use any additional libraries, aside from what comes with python. Does python come with the ability to parse HTML, albeit in a less efficient way?If you are, for some reason, not allowed to use third-parties, you can use a built-in html.parser module. Some people also use regular expressions to parse HTML. It is not always a bad thing, but you have to be very careful with that, see:RegEx match open tags except XHTML self-contained tags
Definitely HTMLParser is your best friend to deal with that issue.There are related question which  already exist and cover your needs.
