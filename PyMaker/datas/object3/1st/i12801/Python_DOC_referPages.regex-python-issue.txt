Natural Text
RegEx Expression:Input Text - JSON TEXTProblem:RegEx should check in JSON text if one of these words --> (Height or Width or Length or Depth) are there then fetch the value.

After converting into json you can access using regular dictionary key as d['Product Long Description'] and thereafter you can use many way to extract any information from that - I just showed one way to go-Output-
