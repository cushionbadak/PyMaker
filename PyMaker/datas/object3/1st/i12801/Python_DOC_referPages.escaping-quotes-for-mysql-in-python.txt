Following the advice on this thread, I am storing my list as string type in MySQL database, but, I'm facing this error: on some list entries like this one:I figured that's because there's a double quote at the beginning of foo_bar and I am using the following code to make entries in the database:And the double quotes are not being escaped.If i remove the double quotes from:  ("{}", "{}", "{}", "{}"), I get the same error,I tried using a different string formatting, (using %s) but that didn't work either.Any ideas?
Do not use string formatting to interpolate SQL values. Use SQL parameters:Here the %s are SQL parameters; the database then takes care of escaping the values (passed in as the 2nd argument to `cursor.execute) for you.Exactly what syntax you need to use depends on your database adapter; some use %s, others use ? for the placeholders.You can't otherwise use Python containers, like a list, for these parameters. You'd have to serialise that to a string format first; you could use JSON for that, but then you'd also have to remember to decode the JSON into a Python string again when you query the database. That's what the answers to the other question tried to convey.For example, if var4 is the list, you could use:
{!a} applies ascii() and hence escapes non-ASCII characters like quotes and even emoticons.Check out Python3 docs
