Natural Text
Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once. I must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.I am not getting the desired result
Use a set. A set is a data structure similar to a list, but it removes all duplicates. You can instantiate a set by doing set(), or setting a variable to a set by using curly brackets. However, this isn't very good for instantiating empty sets, because then Python will think that it's a dictionary. So to achieve what you're doing, you could make the following function:
Dorian's answer IS the way to go for any practical application, so my addition is mostly toying around.If a word is really long, it's more efficient to just search whether each letter in the alphabet is in the string and keep only those that are present. Explicitly,Code to test timingsTests:This shows that Dorian's answer should perform equally well or even better for small words, even though the speed isn't noticeable by humans. However, for very large strings, this method is much faster. Even for an edge case, where every letter is the same and the rest of the letters can only be found by transversing the whole string it performs better.Still, Dorian's answer is more elegant and practical.
This is what makes the test succeed.acdb
