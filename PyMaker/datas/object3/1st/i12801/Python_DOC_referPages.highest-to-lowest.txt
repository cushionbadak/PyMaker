Natural Text
I have a problem with my code where I'm trying to find a way to show scores highest to lowest. But everytime I do it a bunch of numbers come up or it said object. I'm trying to get the scores from a text file where it is stored.The rest of my code is fine except for this part. I tried so many ways to the point that I don't realise what I'm actually doing.My text file looks like this:This is what i get when I run my code: when really it should be like this
sorted(f) gives you something like:Note that there's some \n, which means new lines.Solution: Simpely use str.splitlines() like:f.split(',') gives you (after fix that \n issue):This doesn't work because there's some spaces behind ,. Also there's another space at the end of the line.Solution:Use re.split('\s*,\s*', f), to remove the another space at the end of the line, you can use str.strip() like this:list(reversed(scores)) can only reverse the scores list. you should use sorted() here again. But since use sorted on str object(like '2', '3') will gives you incorrect output. For example '10' < '2' is True. Covert them to int object use map(int, scores).Also you need Highest to lowest. Then you could enable reverse option of sorted via:Here's another question on SO about what's the difference between reversed and sorted(list, reverse=True)print(hl) can only print that list out. In this case I think you need join them use ' ,'.join([name]+scores):So the full code looks like:The output would be:
