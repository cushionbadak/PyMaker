Natural Text
I have a file.dat which looks like the following:I want to create 3 variables x, y, z such that x would be an array with the first column, y with the second column and z with the third column. I have tried with the following:However, this is not working and it gives an error. Is there any simple and easy way to perform this?
First of all as a more pythonic way you can use numpy.genfromtxt to read your text as an array, and then get the columns by transposing the array :And about your code, it's not clear that what's data, anyway if you want to loop over the lines of your file you need to simple loop over file object:Or as a more elegant way use zip() function to get the columns :  
f.read() return the whole file. I think you need split them, use str.splitlines().file = f.read() but for row in data? I think you meant data = f.read().If you're looking for a more simply way, I'd suggest:Or just don't define that data variable:Which gives you:
Try this. split() across the row and append it onto list, something like this. It's simple thoughx y and z contain the first second and third row respectively
