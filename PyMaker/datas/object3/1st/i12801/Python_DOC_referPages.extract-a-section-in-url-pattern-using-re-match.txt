In nodejs, i use regex to extract the sub-section under tenant in this url, http://myServer:8000/api/running/tenant/sk/services. It prints correctly, sk.Code is,I moved the code to python as,It throws AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'Why doesn't it match one word that comes after tenant?
findall/search should help youfindallsearchThe reason match fails is because it tries to match it at beginning of string re.match documentationre.match(pattern, string, flags=0) If zero or more characters at the  beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a  corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if the string does not  match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length  match.Note that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match() will only match at the  beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead  (see also search() vs. match()).
match does not have group attribute. Try search instead-Or try re.split that returns a regular list- (?<!\\)/(?!=\\) means find / that does not have / after or before- and split the text by it-
Actually you don't need regex in this case, str.split() is enough:
