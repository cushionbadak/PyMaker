Can anyone explain why its printing failed? word is a string but it keeps jumping to the else.
When you sayyou are checking if the word is the same as the str() function.If you want to check if the input is a string, then you can use the isinstance() function, like thisBut input() function, in Python 3.x, always returns a string only. So, you don't have to check if the input is a string or not.Note: In case, you are using Python 2.x, print is actually a statement, not a function. You can read more about that in this question.
