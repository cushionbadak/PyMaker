When installing python 2.7 on Windows using silent installer (.msi), is there a command-line option to add Python to path environment variable, like the GUI option?Python 3.5 installer includes an option PrependPath=0 by default, but can Python 2.7 use it?https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.htmlLooks like this issue was discussed here, but no resolution for Python 2.7?https://bugs.python.org/issue3561EDITthis batch command rocks!!!setx \M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python\Python27;C:\Python\Python27\Scripts"but setx will truncate the stored %PATH% string to 1024 bytes.
The Python MSI installer can update the system path since 2.4. Just add ADDLOCAL=ALL to the command line. You'll have to restart your system before it propagates.https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4/msi/
I have observed that on Windows 7 (Professional) with python 2.7.14 x64, no restart is required for Python to be added to PATH.  Just start up a new command window after the install and python will be in the PATH.You can determine whether or not a restart is required by the install by running the msi as follows:That is, if %errorlevel% is 3010 (ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_REQUIRED), then a reboot will be required.  The use of start/wait causes cmd.exe to wait until the msiexec process finishes.  This allows the msiexec return status to be available to cmd.exe.BTW You may wish to include the option ALLUSERS=1 on the command line if you want the installation of Python to be available to all users on the system.
