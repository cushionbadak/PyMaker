Natural Text
I have been reading python documentation , could someone help me with interpreting this?I initially thought it meant that try statements had to have either formats try And finally ortry, except, else AND finally.But after reading the documentation, it mentioned that else is optional and so is finally. So, I was wondering what is the purpose of the documentation showing us the code in the above format to begin with?
You do have two forms of the try statement. The main difference between them is that in the case of try1_stmt an except clause must be specified. In Introduction | Notation of the Python Language reference, the following is written:A star (*) means zero or more repetitions of the preceding  item; likewise, a plus (+) means one or more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets ([ ]) means zero  or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional) . The * and + operators bind as tightly as possible;  parentheses are used for grouping. So, specifically, in the first form:The else and finally clauses are optional ([]), you only require a try statement and one or more (+)
