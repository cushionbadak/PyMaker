I am new to python.I want to grab a whole column from a *.csv file.in order to do so, I saw that my best way is to convert my csv to 2-dim. array using:and than for example if I want to grab the 8-th column just to write:column8=csv[:,7]my problem is that I have fields, in double quotes, with a comma in them, so I have a ValueError:ValueError: Some errors were detected !so all I want is, if for example this is my csv:a,b,c,df,g,h,"i,j"k,l,m,"n,o,p"so if for example I want to grab the 4-th column I want the answer to be:di,jn,o,pany ideas anyone??thank you!!!
