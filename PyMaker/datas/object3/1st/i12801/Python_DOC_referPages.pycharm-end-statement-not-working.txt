So i'm currently learning Python and I code it on the Pycharm IDE. I was trying to write a function but for some reason Pycharm wont accept the 'end=' statement saying something like its not defined.Here is my code It gives me the following error:It's only doing this on Pycharm. When I tried it on the dafult Python IDLE it worked just fine. Can anyone help me fix this?
As already answered in comments, only python3 have keywords arguments for print():For python2, print is a statement defined as this and have no keywords arguments:You can either switch to python3 or disable the statement and use the print() function with this future line at the top of your module:from __future__ import print_function
