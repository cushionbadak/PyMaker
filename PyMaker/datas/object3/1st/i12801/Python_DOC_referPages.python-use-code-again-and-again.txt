I have a piece of code which getting data from excel sheet using python XLRD and automate it via seleniumI need to run this code again and again around 550 times but with incremental rowsit need to be sheet1.row(1), sheet1.row(2), sheet1.row(3) and so on....Please tell me how I can automate or use this code with different row variable
You mean like this?I Python 2 you can use xrange instead of range, for lazy evaluation of the range sequence.You can read more on for loops in the Python tutorial
import xlrdexcel_sheet = xlrd.open_workbook("teacher.xlsx")sheet1= excel_sheet.sheet_by_name('parents')that work fine now code fetching 0 to âˆž data from rows.
