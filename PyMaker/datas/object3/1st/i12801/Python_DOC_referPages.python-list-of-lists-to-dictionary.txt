Natural Text
I have a file which contains data in the following format: please note this is an example of what it looks like, the actual file contains more than 2 rows I read in the file, convert the text to integers, and store them into a list. This is done with the following code:The current format for the list looks like:I need to turn my list of lists into a dictionary. How would one go about doing this? Dictionary key should be the first element
I'm going to play guess-what-you-want, and assume the first numbers in each row are in fact some kind of sequential identifier, and you wantto becomeso...(and I've changed the name of file because file() is already a builtin function in Python, and reusing that name for something else is bad form).Or you could use a dictionary comprehension instead, starting with your items list:
Assuming you want your dictionary key to be the 1st element of the list, here is an implementation:It works by iterating through list, and the sub-list l2. Then, I take the 1st element of l2 and assign it as a key to dict, and then take the rest of the elements of l2 and put it as the value.The result is the finished dictionary {1: [30, 5], 2: [64, 4]}
