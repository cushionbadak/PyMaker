I basically have n number of players and for every player I am calculating how similar they are to every other players and storing them in order or similarity. I am using Pearson Correlation Coefficient to measure similarity between any two players. Now basically I want a data structure in which i can store information for every player including the similarity value between them and all other players. So for player1 i want to keep a list of its similarity value with all other players. As such I thought of creating a list of arrays and every index would represent the player, for example index 0 would be player 1 and so on. Now inside the index we would have an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary would have key of playerId and value as the similarity between itself and the player we are referring to.
Let us keep it simple. All you need is one dictionary and two helper methods as belowThis considers the case the similarity between player1 & player2 remains the same irrespective of the order during put & get. Here is how to use themIf you are in need of finding other players, the helper method should be easy again. logs:

It is?Perhaps there is a more elegant way to do this, but it works... =P
You may be looking for a dictionaryyou can then access it asor change it withadd newand see all
