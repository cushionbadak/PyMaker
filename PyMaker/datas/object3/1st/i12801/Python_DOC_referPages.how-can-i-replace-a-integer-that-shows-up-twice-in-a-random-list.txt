This question already has an answer here:Generate 'n' unique random numbers within a range [duplicate]                    4 answers                I have a list that looks like this:but if it outputs something like this[9,0,5,5] what can I do replace the repeating integer?
If the goal is to get four unique items in random order, let Python do the work for you:random.sample is intended specifically for "random sampling without replacement", which appears to be the goal of your code.
