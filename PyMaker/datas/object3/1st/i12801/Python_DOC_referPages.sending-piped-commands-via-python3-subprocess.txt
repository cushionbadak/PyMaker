I am trying to execute the following subprocess command via python3.4I have tried numerous methods using .call and .Popen but it either doesn't like my pipe or it doesn't like my switchHow do I properly send 2 piped commands via Python3 subprocess?
The answer can be found in the subprocess documentation.The functions from the subprocess module normally do not call a shell to interpret the commands, but rather invoke them directly with the given arguments! This behaviour can be overidden by using the argument shell=True (example from the Python documentation):However, this is not advisable if the command and arguments are not fix but depends on user input. Then, the correct way to do this is to use two Popen calls and construct the pipeline by hand (code example again from the Python documentation):
You don't need pipes at all, just pass the cwd to to subprocess:If you did wanted to  change directory for more than just the subprocess, you should use os.chdir.
