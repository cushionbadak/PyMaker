Not sure what is your exact question but if you want to filter a list in python you have at least two possible ways to do so. First one is to use filters that is my suggestion number one. This can be "expanded" toHowever there is a difference between python 2 and python 3 versions of filter. Python 3 filter function returns an iterator from those elements of iterable for which function returns true. In this case python 2 returns a list containing elements that filter function returns true with.Second opportunity is to use generators, for example like thisHere is a couple of pretty useful examples about this.In your case just use something likeIf another list can't be global use python functools
