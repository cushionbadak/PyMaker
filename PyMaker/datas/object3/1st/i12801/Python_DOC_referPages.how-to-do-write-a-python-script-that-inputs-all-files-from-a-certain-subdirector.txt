Natural Text
I have multiple text files in a certain subdirectory. All the text files are the same size, same amount of content, etc. I do not know how to write a python script that takes an input file and can run from the Terminal.

How does one do this? I usually just go to the local subdirectory and run the file from there, i.e. And 'output' will be the text file. I'm not sure how to write this so that in runs in the command line.
