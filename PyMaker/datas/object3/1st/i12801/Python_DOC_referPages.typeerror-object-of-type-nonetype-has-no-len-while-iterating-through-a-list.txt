This question already has an answer here:Why does list.append evaluate to false in a boolean context? [duplicate]                    7 answers                I get the following error 'TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()' for the program below. Why can't I iterate through a list and compare it to another list? 
list.append returns None.The following line:should be replaced with:Otherwise, word_list becomes None causing the TypeError later.
