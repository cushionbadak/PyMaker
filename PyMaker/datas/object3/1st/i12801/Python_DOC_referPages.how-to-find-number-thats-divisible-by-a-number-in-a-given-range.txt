I have this code:Which is checked at 100 FPS â€” as I move right/left current_level.world_shift is changed. However this code does not work. Can someone help me with that?
You can't use a generator expression in an if statement like that. This is because initially a generator expression yields a new generator object and instances of most types are generally considered True (see Truth Value Testing in the documentation). To do what you want I suggest you instead use the built-in any() function. Doing so will be fast because it will stop soon as a True boolean sub-expression value is encountered. Here's what I mean:any() will return True if current_level.world_shift*-1 is evenly divisible by any number in the open-ended range (assuming that's what you're trying to determine). By open-ended I mean that the value generateMax will not be considered because range(start, stop) only covers the values from start to stop-1.
I think you're misunderstanding the range() method. It doesn't create a random number, it creates a list of numbers in a particular range. E.g., range(1,5) yields [1,2,3,4]I think you were trying to have an assignment in the conditional, e.g., if (n == 1 with n = 1), but mistakenly ended up using list comprehension, which always validated as True. I'm kind of amazed that didn't give a syntax error.Python does not support assignment within a conditional, you'll need to assign before the if, or don't assign at all, like in the above code.
