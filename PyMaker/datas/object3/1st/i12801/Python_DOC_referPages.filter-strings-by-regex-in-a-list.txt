I'd like to filter a list of strings in python by using regex. In the following case, keeping only the files with a '.npy' extension.The code that doesn't work:The same regex works for me in Ruby:What's wrong with the Python code?
re.match('regex') is equal to re.search('^regex') or text.startswith('regex') but regex version. It only check if the string starts with the regex.So, use re.search() instead:Output:And if you just want to get all of the .npy files, just use str.endswith():
Just use search- since match starts matching from the beginning to end (i.e. entire) of string and search matches anywhere in the string.Output-
re.match() looks for a match at the beginning of the string. You can use re.search() instead.
If you match, the pattern must cover the entire input.Either extend you regular expression:Which would match:Or use re.search, whichscans through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match [...]
