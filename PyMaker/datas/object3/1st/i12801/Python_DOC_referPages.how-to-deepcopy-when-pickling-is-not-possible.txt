I'm trying to deepcopy a dictionary in Python 3.4 but some of the values are not "pickable", i.e. when I try to deepcopy the dictionary, it raises a RuntimeError exceptionWhat would be the best option to deepcopy the dictionary?So far, I'm recursively iterating through the dictionary and creating a new one but I would like to know if there's a more robust and elegant solution.Note: I cannot modify DataObject structure to support pickling.
You can add copy functions to the copyreg module to handle types that cannot be pickled:The idea is that you return a constructor and the arguments that are to be passed to the constructor to re-create the original value.The copy.deepcopy() function then uses the above pickle_dataobject() to obtain a copy whenever ob is DataObject is true (the class is looked up in the copyreg.dispatch_table dictionary that copyreg.pickle() adds your function to).
