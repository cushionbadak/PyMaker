I am trying to generate substrings from a bunch of sequences using a for loop so I can then remove all common substrings from each sequence.My code:When I run what I have so far and printing the new dictionary self.substrings, all the values from the function get_all_substrings is:I know this has something to do with the yield, but searches haven't been able to help me fix it.
get_all_substring() is a generator. That means that it will generate values if you iterate through it, however you are only calling its method.If you want to save it into  self.substrings[key] you can do something like orIf this is the only use case of get_all_substring(), you definitely do not need the generator. So you can simply remove the yield key and return an array.
you must iterate a generator in order to get its values (list does that ... but defeats some of the purpose of a generator)is typically how you interact with a generatoryou could just return an iterator if you like the generator behaviouror a list comprehension if what you want is actually a list
