Im getting the error:
You need to convert the number to str (not int) and iterate it:usage:Using sum and generator expression:
The problem here is that your are passing an int to your function, which you cannot iterate over. I suggest the solution
If you want i to range over the digits of n, you'd need something like:Or, you could just pass "123" instead of 123 to sum_digits, which the title of your post suggests is what you actually mean to do.  Of course, then you'd need to convert each character to its numeric value.
You cannot iterate over an int but you can still do it without casting to str:Demo:It does not make much sense to convert from int to str then back to int again.
