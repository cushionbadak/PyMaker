I am trying to identify all cells that contain external workbook references, using openpyxl in Python 3.4.  But I am failing.  My first try consisted of:However, when I print the cell values that have  external values to the console, it yields this:So, openpyxl obviously does not parse formulas containing external values in the way I imagined and since square brackets are used for table formulas, there is no sense in trying to pick up on external links in this manner.  I dug a little deeper and found the detect_external_links function in the openpyxl.workbook.names.external module (reference).  I have no idea if one can actually call this function to do what I want.From the console results it seems as if openpyxl understands that there are references, and seems to contain them in a list of sorts.  But can one access this list?  Or detect if such a list exists?Whichever way - all I need is to figure out if a cell contains a link to an external workbook.
I decided to veer outside of openpyxl in order to achieve my goal - even though openpyxl has numerous functions that refer to external links I was unable to find a simple way to achieve my goal.Instead I decided to use ZipFile to open the workbook in memory, then search for the externalLink1.xml file.  If it exists, then the workbook contains external links:Once I have the XML file, I can proceed to identify the cell address, value and other information by running through the XML tree using ElementTree.
I have found a solution to this. Use the openpyxl library for load the xlsx file as 
There is no way to do what you want from within openpyxl. You are free to try and use the library to work with a file archive yourself but this will entail working closely with the file format specification.
