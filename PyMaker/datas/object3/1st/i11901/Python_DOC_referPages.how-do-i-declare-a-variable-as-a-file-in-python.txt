This is incredibly noobish, but here's an example of what I want:None of the attempts in __init__ work.  I tried searching for python init variable as file but those keywords brought out a lot of posts not answering the question.  
As noted in the comments, the open() function in ButtonPressed method will overwrite anything done in the __init__ call. I would recommend keeping this line As this will allow you to check whether the variable is None before attempting to use it somewhere else in the class
You probably want to use the open() method. I don't think that you'd want to do this in your constructor, but open() is what you're looking for.
