Assume I have the following two dimensional array:To Do: I want to get extract the 0-index values for this multi-array, that is the 'String A', 'String B', 'String C', 'String C' and store it in a single array: s_array dynamically.Problem: I use a for loop to iterate through all the values. Here is the codeAt this point s_array should be have:s_array['String A', 'String B', 'String C', 'String D']But it does NOT.I think something is wrong with the logic of my code. But I can't identify the issue, any ideas?
Use a list comprehension:
A very compact way to do this is to use the built-in zip function. GiventhenreturnsThat's because the * "splat" operator unpacks the items in m_array and passes each one as an argument to zip. See Unpacking Argument Lists in the official Python tutorial.So we just need to extract the first tuple and convert it to a list.output
You are iterating through each item in m_array[i_array][0] and appending each item instead of appending the whole list.  You don't need to use indexing, though, because you can just iterate through m_array:When all a for loop does is add things to a list, that is a sign that you can probably use a list comprehension:
As you can see there's many ways. Best of all for current situation, I think, is list comprehension.One more interesting way is to use map and itemgetter:
I think see the issue. You are iterating through "String A" instead of m_array. m_array[i_array][0] is "String A" and you aren't changing value of i_array.Simple fix:I am sorry if this doesn't help but I can't ask for clarification on what are you trying to achieve (not enough reputation). 
Following the comments on PM 2RING's answer, I did some profiling tests which revealed the following results:Note:Test performed on my ubuntu 14.04 Box, LENOVO THINKPAD ULTRABOOK, with CORE i7.
