I have a sequence of events. 1's are good, 0s are bad.Looking for the most Pythonic way of finding the maximum, minimum and average length of 1 sequences.For example:
One approach would be splitting your string on zeros, dropping empty strings, mapping by length, and sorting:After that your shortest streak would be at index zero, the longest one would be at the last index (accessible with -1) and the average would be easily computable by applying sum and dividing by length converted to float:Demo.
You can do this using list comprehensions and the len function to get the list of wins length but before that you need to split your string on zeros using the split method.To compute the average use sum and lenor the mean function from the statistics module new in Python 3.4
Not very Pythonic, but I would catch all the ones with regex like this :Demoand then proceed like this, where a is your given string.
