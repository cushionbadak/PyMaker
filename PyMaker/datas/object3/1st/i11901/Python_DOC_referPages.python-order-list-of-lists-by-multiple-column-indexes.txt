Let's say I've the following list x in Pythonand I want to sort its elements in order to obtain the following resultthat is I want to sort it by two columns, the first one (the most important) and the second one (the less important). This is probably a duplicate question but I haven't been able to find the solution...
Since it does not matter whether you sort by the third column as well, or not, you can use plain sort here, and get the same result:This is because lists are compared left to right and sorted in lexicographical order.If you did want to order by arbitrary column order, you should use operator.itemgetter, which is faster than using a lambda function for the key.
The following sorts list by the first element, then by the second element:
You can simply use sorted as sorted automatically handles if the sorting is applied from first element to last.
