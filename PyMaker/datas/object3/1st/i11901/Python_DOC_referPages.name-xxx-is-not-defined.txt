Why these two function want not work ?I have that error:What I'm doing wrong ?How this should look like ?
In python, it is necessary to use self to access other methods and attributes of the same object. When you simply call view_splash, python looks for the function definition but will not look at the methods of Window. By explicitly prefixing view_splash with self., python then knows that you want the method Window.view_splash and it should work as you expect.So for your specific code, this would require you to update your run method to be the following:I'm assuming that there is additional code outside of the class which defines lines and words as global variables which Window.run can then access.
