What does it do ?
Those are type hints. Various type checkers can use them to determine if you're using the correct types. In your example, you function is expecting ham of type str, and eggs of type str (defaulting to eggs). The final -> str implies that this function, should have a return type of str as well.For more information see:What are Type hints in Python 3.5https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.htmlhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/
It specifies the return value. It has nothing to do with the code at all and is just for documentation purposes.
