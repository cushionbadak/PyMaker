print statement in Python 2.x support redirection (>> fileobj):In Python 3.x, print function accepts optional keyword parameter file:If you do from __future__ import print_function in Python 2.6+, above approach is possible even in Python 2.x.

As Antti mentioned, you should prefer python3 and leave all this annoyingpython2 junk behind you. The following script works with python2 and python3.To read/write files, use open function from the io module, this ispython2/python3 compatible. Allways use the with statment to open a resource like a file. The with is used to wrap the execution of a block within a  Python Context Manager. File descriptors have context mananger implementend, and will be closed automaticly on leaving the with block.Not depend on python, if you want to read a text-file, you should know theencoding of this file to read it proper (if you are unsure try utf-8first). Beside, the correct UTF-8 signature is utf-8 and the mode U isdepricated.With the input text.txt file:I get the following output_text:
