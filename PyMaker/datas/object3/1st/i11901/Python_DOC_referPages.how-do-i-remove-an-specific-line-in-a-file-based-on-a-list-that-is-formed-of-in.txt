Natural Text
I have a file with this format:Frank,456,768,987Mike,123,456,798And I'm using this code:So, if the list with the inputs equals a line, that line must be removed. Why is this code not working? The files becomes empty.
One of the problems is that you are comparing a string with a list. The other problem is that you are not closing the file at the end. Here is a version that works:I just hardcoded the values at the beginning for the sake of simplicity. I'm assuming that the file will always have the same correct format. You could also use regex and do some pattern matching. Here I'm making sure that I am converting all the values to string, since join won't accept any integer:
You are writing the data into a buffer and you need to flush the text from the buffer to the file and then don't forget to close it.This should be helpful..what exactly the python's file.flush() is doing?Hope it's worked:)
This should work:
The problem is that line is a string, and data is a list.Also, do not convert to float because you wil have to re-convert to string.Finally, this will also fail because of end-of-line characters at the end of each line.This solution compares two lists, item by item.  Another solution would be to build a unique string with ",".join(data) (see other people's answers).
The following code snippet is working properly.Test.txt inputTestResult.txt output
