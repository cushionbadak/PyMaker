I'm trying to crawl a list of URLs contained in a CSV file.  The URLs are listed in column 6 in the CSV.   The format of the URLs is: https://www.targetdomain.com/mainDirectoryName/subDirectoryName/pageName.I'm not reading the data in from the CSV correctly with the code below. Where am I making a coding error?
You should use csv.reader:If you need to skip the header row, you can do it by calling next(reader):
if url has no fixed occurrence with respect to column or row in csv , u can simply use regex and read file line by line as follows:hope this helps :)
