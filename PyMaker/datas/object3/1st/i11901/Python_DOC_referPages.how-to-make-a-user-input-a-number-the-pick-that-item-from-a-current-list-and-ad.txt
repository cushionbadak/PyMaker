list.index() returns the index of the element value you pass it to.

index() actually returns the index of the value that you pass to the method. You're getting an error because the value 4 isn't in the list that you're calling the index() method on. If you're already turning the prompt into an int() after getting it from the user, then you can just specify that you'd want the element at that index from the list like this:Be careful, though. The input() that you get could be out of range of your lists. So, I would would put your inputs into a while loop to make sure that you get a valid input:
