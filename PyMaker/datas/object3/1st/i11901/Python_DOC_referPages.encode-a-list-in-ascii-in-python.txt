I would like to encode a list in ASCII.My list:My goal:Currently I do this:See Website to convert a list of stringsI lost some values with this method.
It's because you are converting to an actual list, but you originally had a dictionary.  Just do this:You were using a list comprehension, but what you wanted was a dict comprehension.
The 'u' in front of the string values means the string has been represented as unicode. It is a way to represent more characters than normal ASCII.You will end up with problems if your dictionary contains special charactersrepresented as u'\u041e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044c\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0441 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439'will raise this errorIf you still want it, but with the risk of raising a few exceptions you can use the followingFrom Python 2.7 and 3 onwards, you can just use the dict comprehension syntax directly:d = {key.encode("ascii"): value for (key, value) in data.items()}In Python 2.6 and earlier, you need to use the dict constructor :d = dict((key.encode("ascii"), value) for (key, value) in data.items())
