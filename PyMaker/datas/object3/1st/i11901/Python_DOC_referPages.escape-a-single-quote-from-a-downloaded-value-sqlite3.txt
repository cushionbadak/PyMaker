Some of the locations contain a single quote For example maryville, John's lane, LondonI know that when creating a data base locally, I must use two single quotes to escape this. John''s lane. REF:- questions/603572/how-to-properly-escape-a-single-quote-for-a-sqlite-databaseHow can this be achieved when scraping a website.My Code is below:-I get this error because of the presence of the 's I am saving the full address to one fields. Thanks in advance for your help.
You should use placeholders instead of manually trying to escape your data.will printA question mark in the query to execute signifies a placeholder and your DB-API (sqlite3 in this case) will handle replacing those with the data you provide. It'll also handle required escaping.Also you should consider using executemany, since manually building a huge placeholder list for VALUES (?), (?), (?), ... will causeso doand you can insert thousands of rows.
