I have tried a number of ways to download files from google drive via oauth and the API, however I am not able to get the files downloaded. I believe I have properly authenticated. After running my code, it looks like there was success with downloading the file (no errors), but no files were downloaded.This is the code I have tried so far:However, this results in "Download 100%." being printed to the console, but no file downloaded.I have also tried:This also does not produce a downloaded file, but it does give me a 200 message.Both of these seem like they are properly making contact with the API. Is there an additional step I have to do to actually get the files on my computer?Edit:this was the remainder of my code:
Changing from BytesIO to FileIO allowed the file to actually be downloaded. This was the line I modified my code to:Here is the complete code that allowed me to download the file:
The file is downloading, but the example given by google doesn't do anything with the file.You simply need to return the contents of the BytesIO buffer like this (just adding a return at the end)...
