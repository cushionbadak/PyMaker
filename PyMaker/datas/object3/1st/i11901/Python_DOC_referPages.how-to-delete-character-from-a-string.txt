I'm a beginner in python and i started to learn python 3 without learning python 2. I'm trying to apply the string.translate() function which I've learnt  that is not supported in python 3. running it gives following error:I intend to get the output as python. How can I do that?
Answer to the questionDon't use the name str for your string variable. It will mask the built-in str:Output:Your intab and outtab must have the same length. Most functions from string in Python 2 became methods of str for a while in Python 2 and were dropped as functions from string in Python 3. So use str.maketrans().Solving the problemIf want to remove characters from a string you can do:Output:If you want to remove numbers you can also do:Output:
Use str.maketrans static method instead (note that you don't need to import it).
As already mentioned in from Python 3.x you need to use the static method str.maketrans. That being said the intab and outtab must have equal length.But you can also do this using regular expression
