I am having a hard time looping through files in a directory that is different from the directory where the script was written. I also ideally would want my script through go to through all files that start with sasa. There are a couple of files in the folder such as sasa.1, sasa.2 etc... as well as other files such as doc1.pdf, doc2.pdfI use Python Version 2.7 with windows PowershellLocations of Everything1) Python Script Location ex: C:Users\user\python_project2) Main_Directory ex: C:Users\user\Desktop\Data3) Current_Working_Directory ex: C:Users\user\python_projectMain directory contains 100 folders (folder A, B, C, D etc..)Each of these folders contains many files including the sasa files of interest.  Attempts at running scriptFor 1 file the following works:Script is run the following way: python script1.pyHowever, the following does not workScript is run the following way: python script1.py A sasa.1I get the following error:with open(paths) as file_object:IO Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:'C:Users\\user\\Desktop\\A\\sasa.1' Please note right now I am just working on one file, I want to be able to loop through all of the sasa files in the folder.
It can be something in the line of:Avoid using the variable dir. it is a python keyword. Try print(dir(os))

If the pattern is followed by  an os.sep, only directories and subdirectories match.
Also note you can change directory location using
