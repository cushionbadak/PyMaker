I need to convert this python 2.7.0 code into python 3.5.0 code, can you please help me because i have never used python 2.7 so i don't know whats going on.  Can you also use the "#" to explain whats going on
Full details about differences can be found there: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmlHere, it's basically three really, really common cases.Python 3k input is Python raw_input, it returns a string. (PEP 3011)If you want something else, you need to explicitely convert the string into the right type.You'll often see eval(input(...)) but I'd advice against this, if you know the proper type, use it!Python 3k range is now an iterator, so xrange is useless, and you can use range instead.Python 3k print behave now like a function, so you need parenthesis. PEP 3105I'll let it to you to do the changes.
