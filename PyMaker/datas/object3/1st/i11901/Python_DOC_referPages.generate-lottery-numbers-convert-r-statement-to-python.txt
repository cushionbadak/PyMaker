I have the following function in R to generate 10 random lottery numbers:output:I've converted it to Python like this:output:In the first case I get numbers of 5 digits while in the second one the numbers could have up to 5 digits, but also less.So, is there any similar way to obtain a list (or string as in the first case) of 5 digits numbers?
You can combine str.format and map, for oneThe asterisk in this context unpacks argument lists. In other words it generates positional arguments from the given iterable (map in this case).You can also store the lottery numbers as a list of stringsNote that python's range is open as in [start, stop), so usefor a range of values from 0 to 99999.
You will want to format your string
