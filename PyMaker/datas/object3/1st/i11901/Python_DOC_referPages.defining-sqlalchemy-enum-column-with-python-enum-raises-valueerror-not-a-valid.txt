I am trying to follow this example to have an enum column in a table that uses Python's Enum type.  I define the enum then pass it to the column as shown in the example, but I get ValueError: <enum 'FruitType'> is not a valid Enum.  How do I correctly define a SQLAlchemy enum column with a Python enum?
The column type should be sqlalchemy.types.Enum.  You're using the Python Enum type again, which is valid for the value but not the column type.
