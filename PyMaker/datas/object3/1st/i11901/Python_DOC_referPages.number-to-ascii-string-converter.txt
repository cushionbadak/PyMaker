I am trying split an integer into a list and convert every element into it's ASCII character. I want something like this:Is there a way I can do this? I want it to work for any number such as  '65066066065', which will return 'ABBA', or '70', which will return 'F'. The issue I'm having is that I want to split the integers into the right numbers.

How about something like thisYields
