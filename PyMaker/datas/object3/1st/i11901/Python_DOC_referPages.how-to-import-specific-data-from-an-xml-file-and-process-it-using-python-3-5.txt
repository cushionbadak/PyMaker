I have an xml file containing the following code:plus a whole lot of other records.Question: What is the simplest way to import this data and process it in python? I am trying to use  xml.etree.ElementTree, what I would like to do in the end is add up the sales prices and store that information in a variable.Any ideas?
Use .findall() to locate the ROW elements inside RECORD elements and .attrib to access the AMOUNT attribute. Complete example:Prints:Then, you can use the built-in sum() to add up the amounts: sum(amounts).
