I have a list of functions called func_list.I want to execute them one by one, and the result of the execution of func_list[index] must be passed as argument to func_list[index + 1], and so on. I came up with this code:Is there any better way of achieving the same?
This is what functools.reduce is for.This will runfunctools.reduce takes two arguments (and optionally a third). The first argument is a binary function that returns a value, the second argument is an iterable of values to pass into the binary function, and the optional third is a value to place before that list (as the first argument to the first run of the binary function).The result of the previous function call is given as a to the next function call, along with the next item in the iterable as b. Therefore lambda a,b: b(a) calls the previous result as the argument of the next function.
