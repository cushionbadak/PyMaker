This question already has an answer here:if command in python                    3 answers                The problem "Given 2 ints, a and b, return True if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10."In the first test why does entering (9,9) and (8,3) return True? I have since solved the problem using a different solution (further below) but I am struggling to understand why the first solution does not work since neither integer is 10 nor do they equal 10 when summed together!Thanks for your help.
It says a or b == 10, since a is true, i.e not zero it returns true.
This evaluates to True as a evaluates to TrueYou must write 
That doesn't do what you think it does. It will be evaluated as:You most likely want:
This will first evaluate a in the context of a boolean expression, and if this is true the whole expression is just true. If it is false, then it will evaluate b == 10. It is different from a == 10 or b == 10.Alternatively, you would just say this will also do what you want to accomplish.
Because this:is executed as the equivalent ofYOu can NOT test multiple values against a single fixed value like that. You have to test each one individually, e.g. if you hadthe statement would have worked. Read the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence
