Natural Text
I want to search a directory, including all subdirectories that may or may not exist, for a file in Python.  I see lots of examples where the directory we are peeking into is known, such as:  ...but what if the file I want is located in some arbitrary subdirectory that I don't already know exists or not?  For example, the above snippet could never find a file here:/dir1/dir2/dir3/.../dir20/myfile.pdfand could clearly never generalize without explicitly running that line 20 times, once for each directory.I suppose I'm looking for a recursive search, where I don't know the exact structure of the filesystem (if I said that right).
As suggested by @idjaw, try os.walk() like so:
Here is code do find a file (in my case "wsgi.py") below the pwdIf the file exists only in one dir, it will list one directory
