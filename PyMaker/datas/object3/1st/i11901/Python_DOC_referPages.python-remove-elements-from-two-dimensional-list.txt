Trying to remove min and max values from two dimensional list in array.My code:This causes me some erros, which i not particulary understand. I'm quite sure that innerlist is not array but ordinary variable. But still i think it should be somehow possible to remove min and max elements from two dimensional list.I mean I need to remove in every innerlist in my list highest and lowest values.LF help!Regards.
Just for the sake of showing a much simpler way of doing this using list comprehensions, the sorted method and slicing:Some reading material on each of the items used to solve this problem: listcomprehensionsortedslicingTo take care of duplicates, this answer by Padraic is very well done. 
If you want to remove all occurrences, you will have to find the min and max and remove all occurrence from each sublist:Which will give you:To find the min and max in a single pass you can use a helper function:Even if your own logic worked and you wanted to remove all the elements equal to the max, it would not work using remove as it will only remove the first occurrence each time.Based on one of your comments you seem to have strings in your sublists which will error when compared to an int, if the string is always the first element you can slice it off:
try this approach:foreach innerlist:sort the arrayremove the first elementremove the last element
It should work like this:Your errors where:minV = myList[0]0] a [ to littlemaxV = 0 works only if the list is always positivemaxV and minV should be inside the first loopinnerlist.remove(maxV) should be list.remove(maxV)I also renamed innerList to value
Unindent your removes, to take them out of the loop and:
