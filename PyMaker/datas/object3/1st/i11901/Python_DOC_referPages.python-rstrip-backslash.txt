I'm trying to remove the string "IT\ICCU\LO1\0834426" from a massive 3 million line file. However, when I run this script it doesn't remove the string.When I'm editing the script in Pycharm, the string appears green except for the characters "\0", which appear black. Is this a problem because the backslash is an escape character? Anyone have any ideas how to solve this?
What you're looking for is the replace() function and use raw strings like so:            
string.rstrip() is used to strip whitespace characters from the right end of a string.Look at string.replace() instead.
I don't think that using a raw string is what the OP requires:using line.replace() with a string will achieve the desired result.Or at least that is my interpretation.
