Define a function test_sort that takes a tuple containing a sort function reference and a function description as a parameter and executes that sort function with the data from the previous task. Track the comparisons for each set of data, calculate the average number of comparisons for the list of random lists.The sort function reference just means that you can put a function definition into a variable just like any other value, and then execute that function variable. You can also pass a function definition as an argument to a another function and then execute the resulting parameter as a function.this is the codethe main:The error I get:This what I did in the previous task as mentioned in the question above:
Define a function test_sort that takes a tuple containing a sort function reference and a function description as a parameter Following those instructions, your logic is fine, but your tuple is not. You put the description first. Therefore, your error starts with Because f is a string (the description of the function). I also see you have Which will print the function object (<function Sorts.bubble_sort at 0x1029beae8>), not the description string. So, you have two options. Switch the ordering of all the tuples. I.e (Sorts.bubble_sort, 'Bubble Sort') and keep the other code the sameUse f = function_tuple[1] for the function that you can call and function_tuple[0] as the string to print. Also, why is a_random treated any differently than the others? Just do the same thing as the other lists.
