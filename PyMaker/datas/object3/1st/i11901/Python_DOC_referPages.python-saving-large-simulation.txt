I am coming from Matlab background and recently started coding in Python. I generate massive data using Monte Carlo and these are sometimes 10 dimensional arrays. In Matlab I have been using .mat file format to store these arrays, along with inputs and other parameters using struct.What is the recommended storage or equivalent for Python ?
The standard object serialization in python is pickle. From the docs“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is  converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse  operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like  object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.An example would beAn alternative would be to use something like h5py which is a third party module for writing data to HDF5 format. Depending on your application, this could be a more performant solution since HDF5 is designed with large numerical data sets in mind. In fact, the latest .mat files are actual designed on top of hdf5 files, source.
you can use serialization objects in python with pickle library or cplicke for (python 2.x), https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.htmlexample:if you want save as filethen use you can use-# Pickle the list using the highest protocol available. = -1-# if not = 0See:pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOLpickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL
