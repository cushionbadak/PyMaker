Is that somehow possible to get reference to parent function foo from inner_func or bar?Looking into source code of PythonTutorOnline I found what I need here. Is there any other approach to do that so? if not how I can get current stack info without using Bdb?
This will only find FunctionDef's inside the body of another function:test.py:Code:Output:
It's far from perfect, but here's an idea:getattr(__import__(foo().__module__), 'foo')where the name 'foo' can be obtained somehow according to a comment by @zondo.
