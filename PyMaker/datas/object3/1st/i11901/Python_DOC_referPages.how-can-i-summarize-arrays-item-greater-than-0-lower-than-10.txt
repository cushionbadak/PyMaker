I'm new to Python, and I'm trying to run a simple code, that summarize arrays item, greater, than 0, lower than 10.can you, please look through my code - can't get, why it still summarize all entered numbers:
You should be using and not &, & is bitwise and:x & yDoes a "bitwise and". Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it's 0.What you should be doing:The difference:You cam also simplify it further with chained comparison:If you are trying to get the sum of all in the range 0-10, you can just use sum and filter with the if after mapping to int:
You can also while summing, filter those integers which are outside your desired range:And like it's been mentioned in the previous answers, you were using the bitwise and & instead of the logical one andAnother better approach, is to do it with generator expression avoiding using any of filter, 'lambda' and map:Profiling both methods, lead to:As one can notice, the generator expression is faster in this case.
Each time one token is bigger than 0 and smaller than 10 you set b equal to the sum of all tokens (independent of the value of these). You should either:create a "filtered" list and sum that onewrite the "sum" yourselfThe second approach would look like the following:That said, your code isn't very "pythonic" (that means it does not use the capabilities python gives you do deal with problems). A for loop can not only count an integer variable up (like a java for (int i=0; i<10; i++) loop) but iterate over any iterable (comparable to a for (Object : iterable) loop in java). See the official tutorial for more information.Later you might want to use list comprehensions instead of a for loop in this case.
