I have two lists:list_a = list_b = list(range(2, 6))final_list = []I was wondering how to multiply all of the values in both lists together. I want my final_list to contain[2*2, 2*3, 2*4, 2*5, 3*2, 3*3, 3*4, 3*5, 4*2, 4*3, 4*4, 4*5, 5*2, 5*3, 5*4, 5*5]
You could use a list comprehension:Note that list_a = list_b = list(range(2, 6)) makes both variables point to the same list object. If this is not desirable, use separate lists:
itertools.product may be used to get cartesian product from arbitrary number of iterables.To handle general case you may use reduce approach. This will work fine for arbitrary number of input sequences.
