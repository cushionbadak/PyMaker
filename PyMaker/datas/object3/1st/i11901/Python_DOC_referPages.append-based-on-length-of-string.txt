I have a df like so:and I want to make it so Month and Day have two digits no matter what.  So my desired dataframe is like this:I have been playing around with this:but I am not sure how to actually reinsert the new values into the dataframe and I am pretty sure there is a better way to do this in the first place
You can use astype for converting to string and zfill for filling 0:If type of all columns has to be converted to string:Timings:Code:
You should let those DataFrames be as is and only when you need to produce reports should you worry about this presentation problem.Then it becomes a general string formatting problem (see also format()).  Shown below are (1) convert-to-string, (2) padded-to-length-two-with-leading-spaces, (3) padded-to-length-two-with-leading-zeroes:
I think it could be a good idea to create a date column using to_datetime to use the numpy datetime datatype. It acutally looks like this will give you the formatting close to what you want, however you can also format your dates from here using any format you want with dt.strftime:
Please try this option. If you want to have month and date with 2 digits each.
