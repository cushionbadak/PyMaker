I'm new on a python project and learning the language. They're using python v2.7.Dictionaries are being used in different ways in the code and I'm having trouble understanding what exactly is happening in the below code. Could a python guru demystify for me what's going on below. Check out my comments.The assignment to key_mapping is confusing. But then the next line assignment of the dict to the results list is even more confusing. Not sure what's going on there either. 
Going through the parts where you had questions (adding parenthesis around tuples might help a bit):
You are correct.  That is a tuple.  If you were to put it in one line, it would be more obvious, but since it is in parentheses, Python allows the programmer to split it into multiple lines.client_key, result_key is still a tuple.  Just put x = 4, 5; print x into the Python shell and you will see.  The parentheses in tuple instantiations are not really necessary most of the time.  It just makes it more obvious what is happening if they are there.Take a look at the docs for dict:If keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are added to the dictionary created from the positional argument.Therefore, those lines are equivalent to:Just as client_key, result_key are a tuple when key_mapping[key] is assigned to them, they are a tuple in this case also.  Your results dictionary could look like this:
