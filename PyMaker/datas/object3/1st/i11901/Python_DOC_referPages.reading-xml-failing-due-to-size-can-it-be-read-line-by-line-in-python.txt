The following python code works fine when I use it on a test dataset of a few thousand records but when I try it with an xml of about 400MB it runs out of memory. Is there a way to get it to read line by line?This will write to sqlite3 but fails with a memory error on testing (before it gets to the DB writing process that's not included in the sample code above).The data I am trying to read can be freely downloaded from http://data.gov.au/dataset/abn-bulk-extract
Which part have failed? The file.read() or ET.fromstring?Easy solution (besides buying more memory) would be to save the retrieved file and use ET.parse(filename) to avoid reading the XML as a string to memory.Other case is to use xml.sax API, which don't parse XML at the same time.
