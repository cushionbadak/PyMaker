I want to open multiple pdf files from a specific directory.The name of these files are taken from a csv file and it opened each matching between the csv and the name of the pdf file.My problem is that only first match is opened not all.How can I fix that?The code that I tried:
Ignoring potential filename lettercase issues, the reason only one pdf file is being opened is because dir_path.glob('*.pdf') returns a generator object which you attempt to iterate over multiple times using the nested for pdffile in pdf_files: loop.The simplest way to fix that is to convert the generator into a sequence object, like a list, that can be iterated over multiple times. I've done this in the code below as well as corrected or simplified a couple of other things.
I suggest to iterate over the file names in your csv file and check every time if the file exists, instead of creating another list with existing files in the directory. You could use os.path.isfile() for that check.Here's an example:By using the with open() formalism, you don't have to bother closing the file afterwards. 
The following should do what you want. First it reads in the second column entries from the CSV file and creates a lowercased set holding all of the filenames to be searched for. Next it uses the glob.glob() function to get a list of PDF files from your chosen folder. Lastly it checks to see if the file is in the list of required pdf_filenames, and if it is, launches them using the shell.Note, I lowercase all of the filenames as Windows is case insensitive.
