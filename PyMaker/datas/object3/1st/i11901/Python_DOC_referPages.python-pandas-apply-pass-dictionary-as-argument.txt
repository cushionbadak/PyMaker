Natural Text
I want to pass a dictionary as an additional argument to a function. The function is to be applied over each row of a data frame. So I use 'apply'. Below I have a small example of my attempt:I get the following error message:    ('fun() takes exactly 1 argument (3 given)', u'occurred at index 0')I use **dict1 to indicate key-value pairs in the function 'fun'Curiously enough if I pass two arguements, things work fine
The problem is that you are not passing a tuple, (dict_test) is not a tuple, it's just the same as dict_test. You want a tuple with dict_test as the only element, that is (dict_test,).
From pd.DataFrame.apply doc:That last line means that if you want to unpack dict_test to pass arguments as keywords to fun, you can do:Previously you were using:That means apply will try to call fun this way:But this is not how you defined fun (you'll get the difference once you know a bit more about positional and keyword arguments).
