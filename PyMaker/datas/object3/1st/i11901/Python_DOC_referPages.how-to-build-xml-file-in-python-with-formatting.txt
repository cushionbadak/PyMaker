I'm trying to build a xml file in python so I can write it out to a file, but I'm getting complications with new lines and tabbing etc...I cannot use a module to do this - because Im using a cut down version of python 2. It must all be in pure python.For instance, how is it possible to create a xml file with this type of formatting, which keeps all the new lines and tabs (whitespace)?e.g.I've tried enclosing each line etc.However, the output Im getting from the script is not anything close to how it looks in my python file, there is extra white space and the new lines arent properly working.Is there any definitive way to do this? I would rather be editing a file that looks somewhat like what I will end up with - for clarity sake...
You can use XMLGenerator from saxutils to generate the XML and xml.dom.minidom to parse it and print the pretty xml (both modules from standard library in Python 2).Sample code creating a XML and pretty-printing it:Output is:Note that the text content elements (wrapped in <subitem> tags) aren't indented because doing so would change their content (XML doesn't ignore whitespace like HTML does).
The answer was to use xml.element.tree and from xml.dom import minidomWhich are all available on python 2.5
