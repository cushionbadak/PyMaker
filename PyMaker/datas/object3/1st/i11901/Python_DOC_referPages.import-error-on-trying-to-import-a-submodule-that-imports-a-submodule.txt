I feel like I'm missing something simple and basic. Here's a toy setupb.py has a function foo with no dependenciesa.py needs foo from b.py to work and imports it directlymain.py needs bar from a.pyNow, running a.py works just fine, it successfully imports b and finds foo.Trying to run main.py however breaks with an import error: specifically "import b" fails during "import a"I get the impression that what needs to happen is that b needs to be exposed by an __init__.py in a/ but I'm unsure what the pythonic way of doing this would be.What is the preferred solution to importing a module (a) which imports another module (b) preferably without bringing PythonProject awareness to a?

This was never properly answered even though Paul H alluded to the answer.It's very simple and mentioned but not directly stated here.If you have a directory like this:The __init__.py file in (for example "effects") needs to include To call a submodule from within a submodule, as you asked, for example, echo calls surround, then you will need to import surround into echo usingimport effects.surround as surround
