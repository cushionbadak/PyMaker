I have a set of tuples (set1), where each tuple is (somename1, somename2, Number). Where number indicates the times we've seen somename1, somename2.I want to merge it with a different set (set2) where somename1, somename2 might be in the set, and update Number accordingly.Right now, for obvious reasons, set1 & set2 returns an empty set. How can I update set1 efficiently?Sample data = Set1 = {('soda','coca cola',5), ('chocolate','mars',13)}

Here's an example if you want to use sets for input, and are just interested in the resulting data in any format (looks like I'm using defaultdict a lot lately):Prints:
