Natural Text
I'm creating a text-based adventure game in Python 3.4.3 and I can't figure out how to make the code repeat a question. There's a bunch of narration before this, if that helps understand what's going on at all.I want the code to repeat the question to the user, until they've answered every possible answer and move on to the next question. I also want it to repeat the question when they get else. How do I do this? 
Don't use str as a variable name, it will shadow an important builtin and cause weird problems.Use a while loop to restrict the output to valid options.See also:string.striptuplesNone
Basically you can put your question in a loop and iterate through it until you enter one of the desired 'if' case. I have modified your code as below. Please have a look
Do something like this:
Here's how I would do this; explanation is in the comments:Now, none of this scales very well if you add more than a few directions;because I assume that after you go "right" you want a new question, so that's anew loop inside the loop, etc.Now, this is just one way of doing it; one downside here is that you'll needto repeat the descriptions for the locations if you want to allow the player toapproach one location from different directions. This may not apply to youradventure game (the original adventure doesn't allow this, if I remembercorrectly).You can fix that quite easily, but I'll leave that as an exercise to you ;-)
