Given a setup like this:I want to get a dict that has keys = object.state, values = sum(object.amounts of objects with that state). In this case:I want to do this automatically, so I don't need to know the different possible states in advance.For sure I could iterate through in some boring manner like this:But that is a bit verbose, and I'm wondering if there's a nicer way to do it, maybe with dict comprehensions or something, but my efforts so far have been in vain.

Dictionary comprehension is not the most optimized approach in this case. Instead you can use collections.defaultdict() like following :
You could use defaultdict.You could also use setdefault.
