I'm exploring python. If have now lerned from the answers, that when I use *, a.__mul__() is called to compute b and a.__rmul__() to compute c (and this is more expensive, since the integer is tried to be called first :))So, in general:How can I see which function is called for some shortcut operator like *, and, or +=, ...
Python language reference 3.3.7: Emulating numeric types says this of the __rXXX__ magic methods:These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, //, %, divmod(), pow(), **, <<, >>, &, ^, |) with reflected
__mul__ is called when the object itself is on the left, and __rmul__ is for when it's on the right. For these particular objects, 2*a has the same result as a*2 because this kind of multiplication is commutative, so it comes out to the same thing, so both docstrings are right.
