Natural Text
I have a large document corpus, D which is basically a Python list of n filtered tweets.For example, D[0] is "New Exploit to 'Hack Android Phones Remotely' threatens Millions of Devices" Also, n is of the order 10^4.Say, there's another list of m = 10 topics for my documents in Z, that I wish to randomly assign to each document and,Z = ['hack', 'tools', 'android', 'google', 'anonymous', ... ].  How do I go about creating an n x 2 array, such that that the assignment of topics is (as close to) a truly random process?Edit:I'm not sure how to code this. Sorry if the explanation is a little vague, but there isn't much information to give. I simply want a way to map from Z to D, randomly (to obtain an n x 2 array not an n x m array, honest mistake).
I think this is what you are after.This list comprehension iterates through D (Your corpus) and matches each element to a random element of Z (your topics).Tuples might be a better choice than lists for the individual pairs though, as they are more commonly used to represent a collection of different things - see this answer for when to use Lists vs Tuples.
