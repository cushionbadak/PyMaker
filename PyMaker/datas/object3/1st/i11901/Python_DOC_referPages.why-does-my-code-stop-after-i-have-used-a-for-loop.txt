Natural Text
This is the code i have so far for my gcse computing controlled assesment. I a trying to get the user to answer a question, then python will pick out specific words(that are the same as the words stored in a file) then link it to a solution.My problem is that the code stops running after the for loop used in the function "power_problems" and i don't know why
Check your indentation at datafile_1.read() and datafile_1.read()with open("keywords_1","r+") as datafile_1 - you typed the filename with no file type so the function will stop because there no such file or directory to read.Try not to use global variables, it just not safe.
