I need to create two tables in peewee. The tables are exactly the same, but one is temporary.This is the definition of the table model:Now I need to also create a temporary table my_table_temp which is an exact copy of my_table. Yet I noticed that if I do my_table_temp = my_table when I do my_table_temp.create_table() I actually create in my database a table named my_table.Is there a better way than redundantly 
Why not simply extend my_table and do nothing else,
What about this solution?
Extending Wojciech's comment, why not use e.g. my_table_temp = type("my_table_temp", (my_table,), {} )Or if using CamelCase as recommended,MyTableTemp = type("MyTableTemp", (MyTable,), {} )For details on using type to dynamically create classes, see here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#typeor using types:https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html
