This statement is from Python 3 Doc:Note that when using from package import item, the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package ...It says we can from package import subpackage.Here I create a package audio, and two subpackage format and sound.Then I import its subpackage :The output is class 'module'It shows that for from package import subpackage, Python intepreter always takes the item as module, not subpackage.Moreover, since sound is taken as module, how to access its echo module?it will raise AttributeError: module 'audio.sound' has no attribute 'echo'Hence, I wonder whether it is meaningful to import sub-package, or is it possible to import subpackage?
There is only a module type in Python, subpackage is not a type. All packages and subpackages are modules. is it possible to import subpackageYes? You already imported sound as a subpackage of audio... is it meaningful to import sub-packageAlso, yes. How else would you use the classes and functions defined by any module? If you would like to import echo, then do so like this
