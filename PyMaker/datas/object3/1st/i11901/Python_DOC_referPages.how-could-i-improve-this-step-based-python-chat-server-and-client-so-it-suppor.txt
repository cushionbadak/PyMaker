Here is the server:And here is the client:What is the most efficient way to upgrade this code to support multiple instances, and more importantly: how could I assign names (nicknames) to all clients and make it so clients could type whenever they want? I tried to use Threading, but that was a huge disaster .
Multiple clientFor multiple client connection, you need to have some non-linear execution.You can either use coroutines or threads to achieve this.Python 3 comes with asyncio, library that uses coroutines (and lot of other features) to emulate multithreading. I suggest you look into this.You can also use threads, it's not that complicated. Whenever a client connects to your server, you just have to create a new thread to execute your function. Python official documentation should help you achieve that.NicknameWhenever a client connects to your server, you could instantiate a User object in the newly created thread with your client information, so that each thread has its own User instance.
