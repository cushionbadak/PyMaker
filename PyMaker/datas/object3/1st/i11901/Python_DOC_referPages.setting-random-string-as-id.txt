I want to set a random string as ID in django. This is what I have currently:The problem is that before I didn't put pkgen and I just put ID, so when I go to my admin page for the note, it just says Changing it to pkgen and redoing migrations just makes it crash and give the TypeError above. Does anyone know how I can fix this?
If you want to set a random string as a django object's id, you should use the UUIDFieldfrom the documentation:A field for storing universally unique identifiers. Uses Pythonâ€™s UUID class. When used on PostgreSQL, this stores in a uuid datatype, otherwise in a char(32).
