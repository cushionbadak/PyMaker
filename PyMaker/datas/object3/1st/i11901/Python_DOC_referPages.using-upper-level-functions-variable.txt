This question already has an answer here:Read/Write Python Closures                    7 answers                I want to use the num_samples variable that I have defined in the make_averaged function. When I use the variable in fun_averaged it should search it in the scope of its upper level function.However I get an Error
Changing:into:Should help. You can access num_samples from the outer function but you cannot assign to it with +=.I do not recommend it for this case, but in Python 3 you can use nonlocal to actual do what you intend:It works for the first call of fun_averaged. But the next time you call fun_averaged the value of num_samples will be 0.
