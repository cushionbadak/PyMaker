I have this problem, while writting genetic algorithm, when I try to simulate mutation process:1. so I choose random position = randint(0, len(genes)-1)where genes are in format "10101" and 1s and 0s are set randomly2. I try to replace 1 or 0 with 0 or 1 to simulate mutation then I got many errors. I tried this way: That does not work. I tried also with: So, how do I replace one sign with the other getting it by its position in the string? 
Strings are immutable, you need to reassign and you can do something like this:
strings in python are immutabe.So you need to create new instance for modification.Or you could use list for that purpose and after modifications convert it back to str.
As others have pointed out, strings are immutable. However, you can shorten your version using the niceties of the slice operator:
As I commented strings are immutable so you cannot use assignment, you could store the string in a bytearray and mutate that then just call str on the bytearray to get the new string back from the bytearray when you are finished mutating:It is going to be a lot more efficient if you make all the changes and then get your string back as opposed to continually creating new strings.
