I have my code:This prints:I want to print like this:How to do it in python?
prints Valid for Python 2 and Python 3.Explanation:range(5) is the same as range(0, 5). map(str, x), given an iterable x, returns  a new iterable having all the items in x stringified (e -> str(e) ). ', '.join(iterable) joins a given iterable (list, generator, etc) whose elements are strings, into a string 1 string using the given separator. Finally str.format() replaces the {} placeholders with its arguments in order.
Since you want to print all the elements of the list, you can convert all the numbers to string and join all of them together with ,, like thisSince the range's default start parameter is 0, you can call it like thisAlso, you can use templated strings like thisYou can apply the str function to all the elements of the number list, with map function, like this
will do what you want. In a highly legible form although not the best speed possible.
Another version of the same thing:
In Python3 you can use the end kwarg of the print function. This is not possible in Python2.
