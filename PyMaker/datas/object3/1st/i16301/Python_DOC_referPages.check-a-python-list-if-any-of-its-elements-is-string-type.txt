I am trying to raise a TypeError if a list contains an element of string data type when a mixed type of list given. I was able to do this with the code below but I wonder if there is a better way to achieve the same result.
You can use any and a generator expression:Aside from the fact that there is less code, this solution is actually a lot more efficient than your current one.  This is because, instead of building an unnecessary list, it will lazily compute the result and only check as many items as are necessary.Also, if you are using Python 2.x, then it might be better to test for instances of basestring rather than just str.  This will allow you to also catch any unicode strings that are inside the list.
Filtering the list for strings works too:If the filtered list is empty, no strings are in the original list.
