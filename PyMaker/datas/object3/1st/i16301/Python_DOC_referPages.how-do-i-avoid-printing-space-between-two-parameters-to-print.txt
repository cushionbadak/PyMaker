I haveHow do I get the output (notice the lack of space between is & 65536)Without manipulating the strings prior to the print()
There are two choices.First, you can use the sep keyword argument to the print function:Or, better, you can use string formatting instead of a multi-argument print call:The second one is a lot more flexible, and more readable for any but the simplest cases. But either one works.

print('The value of i is{my_var}'.format(my_var=i))orprint('The value of i is' + str(i))
Another way you could do it is:i=65536print('The value of i is', end='')print(i)When you do:You are making it so it does not skip to the next like after finish that print statement.
