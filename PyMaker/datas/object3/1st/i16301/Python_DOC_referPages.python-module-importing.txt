I'm working on a GUI app.  Let's say that I have a file main.py which is in the root directory and I want to import widgets like this:And my app is structured like so:IIRC, I would have to import classes from the other modules like so:So my question is if there is something I can do in widgets/__init__.py to make it so that I can do imports in the way I want to?
You actually have it there already, just make your __init__.py have those two lines:Anything that you import (and any other symbols you define) in __init__.py will then be available.E.g. if you put:in __init__.py you could also do: from widgets import apple.  No magic :)
In __init__.py you can import the modules, then export them:Now, you can do the following:
The best way would be to use __init__.py to perform setups needed for the package.Then in main.py you can perform imports directly.A more convenient way to package everything in __init__.py
yes, by adding the public variables of the other modules to __all__ in __init__.pysee https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import
