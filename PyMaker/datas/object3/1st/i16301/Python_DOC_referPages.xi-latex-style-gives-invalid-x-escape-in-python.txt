I am plotting in Python using Geany, but when I try to label my axis with say $ \xi$ i.e. the greek letter xi, I get theinvalid \x escapeerror. This does not happen for any other greek letter. Any idea how to resolve this?
In Python strings, \x indicates a hexadecimally escaped character, such as '\x7a', which is the same as 'z', because the ASCII code of 'z' is 7a in hexadecimal. You have to escape the backslash into \\ (your resulting string would look like "$\\xi$") or use raw strings (r"$\xi$") where the escapes are (mostly) ignored.The official docs provide a list of escape sequences.
You could use a raw string: r"$ \xi$" which will not treat the \x as an escape for a  unicode char.Or, you could escape the slash: "$ \\xi$"It doesn't happen with other greek letters you've tried because they don't happen to start with a character used as a control code. But if you tried "\rho" I imagine you might be surprised, as "\r" is a carriage return code.There are various such codes, including \b, \t, \n, \a, \r, \u, \v, \f, \x, \U
