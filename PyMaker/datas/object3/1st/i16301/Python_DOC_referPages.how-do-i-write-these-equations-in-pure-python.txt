Given these example equations with all but the word degrees in broken python:L = 280.460 degrees + 0.9856474 degrees * nandlamtha = L + 1.915 degrees * math.sin(g) + 0.020 degrees * math.sin(2*g)How can I can I write these in functional python to get the correct values for L and lamtha?
math.sin requires that you pass radians to it when you call it. If you pass your input as degrees, you will not get the correct result - convert to radians before you call math.sin.The return value of math.sin won't be in degrees or radians - it's just a ratio, so there's nothing to convert there.
It's necessary to convert all degrees where degrees are called for into into radians when operating on them or along with math.sin and similar functions that require radians as an argument. Finally, if I need to, I can convert the resulting lamtha into degrees with math.degrees.
