I'm trying to download data from unread emails into csv files, in the sense, each unread email data goes into a separate csv file. I'm able to use imaplab and email to get the body of unread emails but I do not know how to save them into separate csv files and name them with the first line of the email body. Here's my code so far. Thank you.SOLUTION:
This would write the files properly delimited
