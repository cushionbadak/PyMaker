Natural Text
I have defined a function with a long list of arguments. The total characters in definition is above 80 and doesn't abide by PEP8.What can be the best approach to avoid horizontal scrolling.
An example is given in PEP 8:So that is the official answer.  Personally I detest this approach, in which continuation lines have leading whitespace that doesn't correspond to any real indentation level.  My approach would be:. . . or just let the line run over 80 characters.

For Python code that uses the "typing" type checker, I suggest this:Variants with multiple parameters in a single line look really chaotic when type annotations are used, IMHO. So I think it's better to have each of them on its own line.If you use "yapf" you can use these options in .style.yapf:
Personally I also used to come up with the same solution as @BrenBarn 's second style. I like its way to properly represent the indentation of function parameters AND its implementation, albeit that "unhappy face" is somewhat unusual to some other people.Nowadays, PEP8 specifically gives an example for such case, so perhaps the mainstream is going to adapt that style:
I personally like to line up the params one-per-line starting with the open parentheses and keeping that indent. flake8 seems happy with it too.
I find myself this way to be quite interesting:it allows code-folding to reveal the function signatures quite easily, for instance, consider the below snippet:This way allows to code-folding the whole file and seeing all functions/signatures at once, ie:
