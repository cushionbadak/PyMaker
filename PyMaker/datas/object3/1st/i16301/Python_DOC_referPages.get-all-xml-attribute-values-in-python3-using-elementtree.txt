I have the following xml file I want to write python 3 code using ElementTree to get all country names. So the end result should be a dict or array of ['Liechtenstein','Singapore','Panama']I am trying to do this using Xpath but getting nowhere. So my code is as followsHowever the above does not work as I feel my xpath is wrong. 
Use findall() to get all of the country tags and get the name attribute from the .attrib dictionary:Prints ['Liechtenstein', 'Singapore', 'Panama'].Note that you cannot get the attribute values using an xpath expression //country/@name since xml.etree.ElementTree provides only limited Xpath support.FYI, lxml provides a more complete xpath support and therefore makes it easier to get the attribute values:Prints ['Liechtenstein', 'Singapore', 'Panama'].
