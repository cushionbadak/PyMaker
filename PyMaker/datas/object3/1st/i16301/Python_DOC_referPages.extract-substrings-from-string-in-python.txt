Natural Text
I have a .txt file in the format:I would like to extract each substring deliminated by '|' So for example,Is there an easy/efficient way to do this (possibly using regex)?

Even better, instead of reading in a CSV-dialect file as text and then trying to figure out what to do with it, read it in as a CSV-dialect file using the csv module:This will print 'AED', then 'AFN', and so on.If you want to turn this into a list of lists, that's easy:Now data is:The major advantage here is that if you later realize that your file has, e.g., some column values that had to be quoted, or optional columns left off the end, or just about anything else you didn't anticipate ahead of time, you don't have to go back and write a new parser, you just figure out which dialect parameter needs to be changed.Or, if you'd rather access the columns by name instead of index, you can just switch to a DictReader and you get back dictionaries instead of list.
