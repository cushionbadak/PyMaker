This question already has an answer here:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'                    1 answer                I am trying to get abs of float, which is initially stored in str as: which gives error:I am not regular in python, but it seems, the string to float is correct, as from here or here. Not sure, what is going wrong here.
You can't add a float value and a str value; you have to convert the result of the abs function back to a str explicitly before adding a space to it.
