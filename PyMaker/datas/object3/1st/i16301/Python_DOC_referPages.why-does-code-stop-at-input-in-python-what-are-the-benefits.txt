As anyone would know python will stop or pause at input(), this makes it hard to get input with a timeout, this is possible:My real question is why does the code pause at input and mainly what benefits are there from this?Surely if we can get around this (for just about anything I presume) then it is silly to have the code hold up like that. All opinions welcome, give me your view.
Maybe there should be a built in function to disable the pause. This would make multithreading much easier, but the pause is handy when you have to test some variable that is created with the input:if this was run without a pause you would get an error input1 is not defined, so the pause is crucial. hope this is helpful.
One benefit? If your code comes across a variable that should have been set, but doesn't exist because the user hasn't entered a value yet, it would raise an error. For example:A basic sample, but none the less - how would Python use the age variable if it doesn't have a value yet, because it didn't pause to wait for an input?Threads can be used fairly easily for processes that you want to happen behind an input, though.
