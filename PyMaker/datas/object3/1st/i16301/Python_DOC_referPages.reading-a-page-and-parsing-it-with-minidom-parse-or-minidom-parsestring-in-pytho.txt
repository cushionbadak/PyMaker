I have either of these codes:which gives me the error xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError: syntax error: line 1, column 0Or this:which gives me the same error. res.read() reads fine and is a string.I would like to parse through the code later. How can I do this using xml.dom.minidom?
The reason you're getting this error is that the page isn't valid XML. It's HTML 5. The doctype right at the top tells you this, even if you ignore the content type. You can't parse HTML with an XML parser.*If you want to stick with what's in the stdlib, you can use html.parser (Python 3.x) / HTMLParser (2.x).** However, you may want to consider third-party libraries like lxml (which, despite the name, can parse HTML), html5lib, or BeautifulSoup (which wraps up a lower-level parser in a really nice interface).* Well, unless it's XHTML, or the XML output of HTML5, but that's not the case here.** Do not use htmllib unless you're using an old version of Python without a working HTMLParser. This module is deprecated for a reason.
