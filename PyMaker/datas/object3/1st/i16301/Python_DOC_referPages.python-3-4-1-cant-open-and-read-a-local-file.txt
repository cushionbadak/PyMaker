I am having trouble opening this file while located in a sub-directory directly underneath my Python file... is there a better way to open files from ANY directory on my computer?I can't read from the file because I get the following error:BTW:  The file to be read is just a source file from an HTML Chrome webpage.EDITI'm looking for more help with the path and wondering why I get the first mentioned Traceback regarding the path
os.path.relpath() returns a string, not an open file object. You'll need to open a file first; use the open() function:with here treats the file object as a context manager; when the indented codeblock under the statement is exited (either because the code completed or an exception occurred), the file object will automatically be closed.
Your Source_obj is just a string, not a file.By open()-ing it you can read from the file. Using the with context manager, the file will be properly closed for you when you leave that block of code.
