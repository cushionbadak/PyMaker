I'm trying to make byte frame which I will send via UDP. I have class Frame which has attributes sync, frameSize, data, checksum etc. I'm using hex strings for value representation. Like this:Now, I need to concatenate this hex values together and convert them to byte array like this?!But when I print converted value I don't get the same values or I don't know to read python notation correctly:So, first word is converted ok (AA01 -> \xaa\x01) but (0034 -> \x004D) it's not the same. I tried to use bytearray.fromhex because I can use spaces between bytes but I got same result. Can you help me to send same hex words via UDP?
Python displays any byte that can represent a printable ASCII character as that character. 4 is the same as \x34, but as it opted to print the ASCII character in the representation.So \x004 is really the same as \x00\x34, D\x856\x00 is the same as \x44\x85\x36\x00, and \xd4? is the same as \xd4\x3f, because:This is just the representation of the bytes value; the value is entirely correct and you don't need to do anything else.If it helps, you can visualise the bytes values as hex again using binascii.hexlify():and you'll see that 4, D, 6 and ? are once again represented by the correct hexadecimal characters.
