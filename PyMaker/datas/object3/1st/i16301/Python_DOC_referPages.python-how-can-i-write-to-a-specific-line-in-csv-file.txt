This question already has an answer here:How to modify a text file?                    8 answers                just found out how to write and read to a csv file. It's very helpful, but im having some trouble with it. I noticed that when I scroll down in the csv file, it creates new lines, which then messes up when I want to append data to the csv file (it shows up at the bottom of a bunch of empty lines). So what I plan on doing is: Going down the document until it finds an empty row and get that line number with the line_num  reader object.So then I would just need to be able to write to a specific line. Is that possible? I have been using this webpage as a guide. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
Can't be done. If you want to write to the middle of the file, you need to read the whole thing in and write the whole thing back out with your change.Here's a thread about the same thing.
