One thing I do not understand is why company_to_placements[company] = []? If a company is not in  company_to_placements, shouldn't that company_to_placements[company] = [1] since it is the first time for that company to appear?  
If a company is not in  company_to_placements, shouldn't that company_to_placements[company] = [1] since it is the first time for that company to appear?No, because you are explicitly adding the company in the next line. However, you cannot use the list.append() method yet if there is not yet a list in the dictionary for a given key:Because there is no 'Saucony' key at first, trying to use that key to retrieve a list and call append() on that list object fails; a KeyError is thrown.The if company not in company_to_placements: test simply creates the initial empty list, the next line then adds the integer to the list.The code could be simplified to:using the dict.setdefault() method to add an empty list to the dictionary if the company key is not yet present.Another option would be to use collections.defaultdict() object to materialise a new list every time you try and access a key that isn't yet present:
