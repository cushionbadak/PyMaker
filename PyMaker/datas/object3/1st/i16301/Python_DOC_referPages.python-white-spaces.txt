Natural Text
I've made a program as follows:it's supposed to give me the letters of input (every third letter) which it does, although it also prints a white space at the end which I have been unable to get rid of. I've tried everything including the .rstrip and [:-1] with no luck
You are telling print() to print that whitespace with end=' '.Instead of calling print() repeatedly, pass in the whole list in one go:Now each element of x is printed as a separate argument, using the default 1-space separator, and a newline as end.Outside of passing in the elements as separate arguments to print(), you can also use str.join() to build one string with separators; this does require that all elements in x are strings or you'd need to explicitly convert them:
Try this:join lets you put a space between adjacent characters, leaving out the trailing white-space
