os.walk already visits all subdirectories it encounters (that’s why it’s called “walk”; it walks through the whole directory structure). So you do not need to recursively call your function again for every directory you see.Your logic would be appropriate if you were using os.listdir to just give you the contents of a single directory. In that case, you would have to recursively list the contents for every subdirectory too.
