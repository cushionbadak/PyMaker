Natural Text
I just started learning python 2 days ago and Im trying to make some kind of text based adventure to practice , the only problem Im having is with functions:The idea behind this is to call the menu function , which gives a value equal to user's input , which gets fed into the action function when the latter is called and does something depending on the user choice.Cant tell what im doing wrong though , as the code doesnt seem to work. Thanks in advance
It looks like you are using Python 3.x.  In that version, input returns a string object like raw_input did in Python 2.x.  This means that the return value of the function menu_op will always be a string.Because of this, you need to compare x with strings rather than integers:I also changed the second if to elif since x could never equal both '1' and '2'.
You're calling menu_op() function twice. The first time it gets called choice is not passed to action_op()And the value returned from menu_op is a string so you should compare strings in action_op instead of comparing x with integers
choice= int(input('Choose action: '))  # make choice an int to compareinput is a string and you are comparing if x == 1 where x is "1"
