I have found that the python internal deals with dictionary object different as the other object like function and list.Does anyone have idea why python mock library (1.0.1) has a patch.dict specifically besides the existing patch and patch.object? 
foo = {'key': 'value'}original = foo.copy()with patch.dict(foo, {'newkey': 'newvalue'}, clear=True):assert foo == {'newkey': 'newvalue'}assert foo == originalSee the reference
