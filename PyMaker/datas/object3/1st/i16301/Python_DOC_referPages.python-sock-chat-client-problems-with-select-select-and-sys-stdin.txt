So I'm currently trying to make a small chat client using a server and some clients. I found some code online and I wanted to use it as a basis for making my own. The problem I'm facing now is that it was written in Python 2.x and I'm using 3.x. There wasn't really much to convert, but I ran into some problems where the program uses sys.stdin.The original code can be found here.Here's my code:``The error I'm getting is:I'm obviously getting this error because there's no input of any kind, but since I was unable to find any documentation I could understand on what's going on in the lines below, I have a hard time fixing it. I don't know what kind of input it should have gotten through sys.stdin.Sorry If I weren't clear enough on my problem, reply and I'll provide whatever information you need. Thank you for helping me :)
WinError suggests you're on Windows. sys.stdin can be treated as a socket on *nix platforms but not on Windows.See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.htmlNote that on Windows, it only works for sockets; on other operating  systems, it also works for other file types (in particular, on Unix,  it works on pipes).A quick search suggests that people might get around this by using select on sockets on one thread and blocking local I/O on a second thread, but don't quote me on that being the best or only way. Async frameworks like Twisted probably have already solved this, as well.
