I have a list like:Now I want to merge the list having same element at first position.I'm clueless.
You'd be better off with a dict-like structure, defaultdict with set would seem the best choice.Here's an example:BTW: Your input list looks a bit strange, the keys are strings (instead of numbers) with a trailing coma: '4,'; and the values have double quotes: "'Chicago'".
You could do something like that:It's not a list but a dictionaryThe output is:
Separate your concerns.Depending on your index range just take something like an array or a hashtable.Then for each item, you can have a set, and depending on your desires, you could have multiplicity in your set or not.For initial construction you will need to traverse the list.
I've written this solution that I think it's very clear and efficient. Using a defaultdict (data type from the collections package) you can obtain the same result with a little effort:Passing a list to the defaultdict constructor your able to automatically create an empty list when a new key is specified.I suggest to you to consider this example: defaultdict examples
