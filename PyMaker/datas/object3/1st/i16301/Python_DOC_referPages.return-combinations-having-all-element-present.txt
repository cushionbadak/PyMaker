I have a list say lis1 = [1,2,3]and a list of subset of above list say I want to generate all combinations of lis2 such that all items of lis1 should present in the combination. For eg. this is a valid combinationsone such combination is [[1,2],[2,3]] (all items of lis1 i.e [1,2,3] is present in it)whereas this is not What I did was generated powerset of lis2 via this functionBut as obvious the returning set contain combinations which are of typeHow do I check for the combinations which contain all the item of lis1
You can apply your powerset function to get combinations of subsets and filter the results:If you want no duplicate elements in the resulting subsets, use this instead:Both methods use sum(s, []) to flatten the nested lists and then compare those to the original elements using either set (all present, ignore duplicates) or sorted (all present, exact same count).
