I want to print the string. In my code i am not getting the right string.This gives nothing. I want to extract 001 from there.Note: I don't want to use rawstring.because here user is getting the path from other resource. Is it possible to replace single slash by double slash to solve this problem
You need to use a raw-string so that escape sequences are not processed:Demo:
Three errors: '\001' gives the codepoint in octal, actually the character at codepoint 1. Use double \\ or raw-strings.Second: r'\[' escapes the '[', use double \\ instead: r'\\[+0-9()]' (I have rearranged the characters in the set, so that it doesn't look like a expression group.Third: You want to look at str.group(0) to get the whole matched string.
