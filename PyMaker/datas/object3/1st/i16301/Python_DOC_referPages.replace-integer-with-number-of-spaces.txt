If I have these names:bob = "Bob     1"james = "James     2"longname = "longname     3"And priting these gives me:Bob     1James     2longname     3How can I make sure that the numbers would be aligned (without using \t or tabs or anything)? Like this:Bob     1James   2longname3
This is a good use for a format string, which can specify a width for a field to be filled with a character (including spaces). But, you'll have to split() your strings first if they're in the format at the top of the post. For example:The < means left align, and the space before it is the character that will be used to "fill" the "emtpy" part of that number of characters. Doesn't have to be spaces. 10 is the number of spaces and the : is just to prevent it from thinking that <10 is supposed to be the name of the argument to insert here.Based on your example, it looks like you want the width to be based on the longest name. In which case you don't want to hardcode 10 like I just did. Instead you want to get the longest length. Here's a better example:See: Format specification docs
