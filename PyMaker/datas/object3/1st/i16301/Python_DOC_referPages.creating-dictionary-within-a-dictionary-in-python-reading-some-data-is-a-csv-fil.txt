I have a csv file called sample.csv which contains the following data:-I am trying to write a python script that would read all the lines in this csv file and I want it to read the hour which is '01' here and make the hour as the head key and then make the minute as the subkey and the remaining fields as its values. Here is my code snippet:-Here I get the hour, the minute and the remaining fields but kinda struggling in creating the desired output that is making hour as the head key, the minute as the subkey and the corresponding fields as the values and so on for every minute in that hour that is '00', '15', '30' and '45' and for every hour. Currently there is only 1 hour in this csv file, in future there can be more than 1 hour. 
A solution with csv module
Check if key exists before insert a new value (this will be inside your las loop)Unchecked but should work. Should let you something like:Been 1 the hour, 33 and 34 the minutes and 22, 25 the values (can be strings or whatever)EDIT:  True, the minutes must be arrays to store many values in the same minute, so do the same with minutes, letting it this way:So the output should be this way:EDIT II: The final code will be:If don't works check your loop:And try changing:with a new field called And put 'print's to debug the program.
