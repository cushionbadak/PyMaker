I'm currently learning Python through Codecademy. One of the exercises uses this in it's for loop:I've only seen things like:That being said, I don't understand what the "index," part of the loop is, or what it's function is. All I understand from this is that it will index each item in the list, and print them. Thanks in advance.
Enumerate makes a list of tuple which are (index, element).   This is the output of enumerateYou can unpack these tuples and do whatever you'd like with each component of the tuple.
enumerate returns both the index of the item in the list, and the item itself. Each item in a Python list (and almost any list in any programming language) has a numeric index in addition to the value it contains. In Python, indexes start at 0. So for your choices list, pizza has the index 0, pasta has 1, salad has 2, and nachos has 3. This index exists to allow you direct access to the nth value of a list, without having to loop through it (among other uses).Here's what your code does when executed:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate
enumerate adds an index or position value to each item in the list starting at 0.so in your example pizza would have an index of 0, pasta has an index of 1 and so on...Then your for syntax is slightly different to get both the index and value of the current item.So first time through the loop you will have index = 0 and item = 'pizza' 
It comes from the enumerate built-in function as described in the documentation for enumerate: python 2 documentation, python 3 documentation. I think the documentation describes it very clearly so would recommend reading there.
