I am using the following code to dedup and count a given list: With my testing code:result is:The code is doing fine and the output is correct. However, I feel my code is quite lengthy and am wondering would anyone suggest a more elegant way to improve the above code? Thanks!
Yes, don't re-invent the wheel. Use the standard library instead; you want to use the collections.Counter() class here:You may want to just return the counter itself and use all functionality it provides (such as giving you a key-count list sorted by counts).If you expected only consecutive runs to be counted (so ['a', 'b', 'a'] results in [('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('a', 1)], then use itertools.groupby():
I wrote two versions of some shorter ways to write what you accomplished.This first option ignores ordering, and all like values in the list will be deduplicated.  This second option respects order and only deduplicates consecutive duplicate values.
