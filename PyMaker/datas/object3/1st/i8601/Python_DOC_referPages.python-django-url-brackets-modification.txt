Natural Text
I am trying to write a Python script which will replace the brackets with: ( -> %28 ) -> %29 I found that the django module in Python can do this using the function iri_to_uri. For example I want to convert https://example.com/pat(da35dd40)/index.html into https://example.com/pat%28da35dd40%29/index.html but for some reason my script doesn't work: And it reports invalid syntax, if I put the URL into quotes it doesn't transform the brackets. The ultimate goal is this script to process an input from the user and escape all special characters, so that the script could be processed by other processes. 
Try using the quote from urllib. It makes the url safe to be passed around.Just be careful and keep the http:// out, only parse the url without the protocol. (Thanks @MariusSiuram for reminding of this)
Thanks to @FernandoCezar, I found the solution. The code below will not interpret the characters defined after safe so it will correctly convert the link:  urllib.quote('https://example.com/pat(da35dd40)/index.html', safe=':''/')
