Is it possible to use mv in Windows python. I want to use mv --backup=t *.pdf ..\ to make copies of existing file but don't want to overwrite them, and Windows move command does not supports suffixes with existing files.I can run my script with mv command in Windows Bash or CygWin but not on cmd or powershell. So is it possible to use Linux commands in Windows python?EDIT: i'm using python 2.7
well I tried a different approach to rename the existing files with a random hex at the end on the 'name'and i'm pretty much satisfied with it :Dif os.path.isfile('../%s.pdf' % name) == True:    os.system('magick *.jpg pdf:"%s".pdf' % name_hex)else:     os.system('magick *.jpg pdf:"%s".pdf' % name)
os.rename(src, dst)Rename the file or directory src to dst. If dst is a directory, OSError will be raised. On Unix, if dst exists and is a file, it will be replaced silently if the user has permission. The operation may fail on some Unix flavors if src and dst are on different filesystems. If successful, the renaming will be an atomic operation (this is a POSIX requirement). On Windows, if dst already exists, OSError will be raised even if it is a file; there may be no way to implement an atomic rename when dst names an existing file.or shutil.move(src, dst)Recursively move a file or directory (src) to another location (dst).If the destination is an existing directory, then src is moved inside that directory. If the destination already exists but is not a directory, it may be overwritten depending on os.rename() semantics.If the destination is on the current filesystem, then os.rename() is used. Otherwise, src is copied (using shutil.copy2()) to dst and then removed.If I got you right both will work for you.by the way I know that when you install git you can enable Linux commands inside your CMD during the installation. (pay attention to checkbox there), but I'm not sure how it will behave and integrate with your scripts.
