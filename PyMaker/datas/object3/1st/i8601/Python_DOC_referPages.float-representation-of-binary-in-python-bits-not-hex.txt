How to get the 32 bit float representation of a string as binary IEEE 754?Example'00111111100000000000000000000000' -> 1.00This question is the reverse of:Binary representation of float in Python (bits not hex)and I couldn't find the answer elsewhere. Please note that I am very new to coding so please be gentle.
Using struct.pack and struct.unpack:int(.., 2) to convert the binary representation to int (base 2)struct.pack('i', ..) to convert bytes (i: 32bit int)struct.unpack('f', ...)[0] to convert bytes back to float.For other struct format character, see Format charactes - struct module documentation.
