Python does provide a CookieJar library but this will not be enough if javascript is also mandatory.Instead you could use Selenium to get the HTML. It is a bit like a remote control for an existing browser, and can be used as follows:(Also look at PhantomJS for a headless solution)Which would give you your links starting as follows:Note: To use Selenium, you will need to install it, as it is not part of the default Python libraries:
