I am having a problem with an error message about tk not being defined? How can I get around this, I thought I defined it. I was wondering if it was a problem with the window = tk but when I remove one and vice versa the define problem still occurs.
Your code is a bit namespace messed up. Some parts of your code follows the format from tkinter import * provides. While some parts followed the format import tkinter. You can do both, but it's not preferred. Many people like to use import tkinter as tk since it's easy to type and use.Your error is that you used tk() which isn't a thing. tkinter.Tk() is probably what you meant. And you should change all Label to tkinter.Label and Entry to tkinter.Entry inside your Signup function, to fit your import tkinter code. The place where you copied from most likely had from tkinter import * in the top.
