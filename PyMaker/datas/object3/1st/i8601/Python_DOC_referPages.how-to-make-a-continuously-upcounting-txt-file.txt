Natural Text
I am trying to make a code block that creates a series of .txt file names.  It will open a new file and prompt the user to enter text for the file, continuing until the user doesn't want any more files.How do I get it to create a series of file names such as file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt, etc. ?
Assuming you do know in advance how many files are required you can pass a start value to the function range()
