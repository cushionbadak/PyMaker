Can you help me shorten this python code involving list comprehensions? In my current code, the variable e_col is not utilized. What I don't know yet is how can I utilize this e_col variable. Here's the code:When I ran this code, it returns:I also looked into itertools.product but I can't understand how it works.
list comprehension can do "product" with nested loops, pure Python, no libs
It seems like the basic structure of your elements is:Then you just need the row and column numbers, for which itertools.product certainly seems like a good bet:Which gives the same output:It's not clear why you used two ranges rather than just e_col.
