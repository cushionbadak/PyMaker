I have several variables, some of which I need to change on a certain condition.I'd like to use the dict approach described here, but how can I modify it to change multiple variables? I want it to work like this:Or can this not be done without creating a function and hard-coding all of the conditions in separately?
This will change variables in the module's global namespace
Use the dict.update method like so, if I get you right:
you can resign the values back to variables
According to this, you can access variables by name using globals(). Applying this method to the problem you are trying to solve, all you have to do is use your default value in the call to options.getIf the variables are members of an object, you can use setattr as explained here.
