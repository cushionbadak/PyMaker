I am trying to print out all possible combinations of the elements in a list.As the initial list [1, 2, 0]. This programme produces the outputI have had to physically change the list from [1, 2, 0] to something else like [1, 1, 0] to get the other possible combinationsand then go on to change the list to [2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2] etc. to get other combinations and this is very time consuming and not easy to do once I increase the list to 4 elements like [1, 2, 0, 1]I have been able to find a way to do this using python's intertoolsThis produces exactly what I am looking for, it generates all the possible types of combinations of the elements 0, 1, 2I am trying to produce all these combinations through a loop that goes through iterations e.g. first iteration (0, 1, 1) then second iteration (0, 1, 2) as shown below:
A pure python equivalent of itertools.product() is shown in the docs:
You can look at the code for itertools product here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.productIf you want your function to have the same variable names as yours, here's a modified version of the product code to do what you want:output:
this method uses recursive function to generate the list of all combinations, then u can iterate over it.
