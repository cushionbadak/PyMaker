I am new to python OOP programming. I was doing this tutorial on overloading operators from here(Scroll down to operator Overloading). I couldn't quite understand this piece of code. I hope somebody will explain this in detail. To be precise I didn't understand the how are 2 objects being added here and what are the linesdoing here?This generates an output Vector(7,8). How are the objects v1 and v2 being added here?
v1 + v2 is treated as a call to v1.__add__(v2), with self == v1 and other == v2.
This is the Python data model and your question is answered hereBasically when v1 + v2 is performed python internally performs v1.__add__(v2)
This code is performing vector addition, the same way you would add two vectors on paper, it combines the corresponding components using scalar addition.  You are overriding the __add__ method to tell the interpreter how addition should be performed for your class.The code:combines the a component of your vector class.  The code:combines the b component of your vector class using the appropriate addition function for the type of b.Those new component values are passed to the constructor of the Vector class to return a new Vector.The + operator will invoke the __add__ method on your class to perform the addition.
