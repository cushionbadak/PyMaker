I am trying to create a python script that will iterate through a folder structure, find folders named 'bravo', and modify the xml files contained within them.In the xml files, I want to modify the 'location' attribute of a tag, called 'file'. Such as: I just need to change the drive letter of the file path from ‘e’  to ‘f’. So that it will read:However...The name of these xml files are unique, so I cannot search for the exact xml file name. Instead I am searching by the xml file type.Also, there are other xml files in my folder structure, without the ‘file’ tag reference, that I wish to ignore. The only constant is that the xml files I want to modify are all stored in folders named, ‘bravo’. I also wish to create a log file that lists all the xml files and their filepaths which have successfully been updated (and preferably the ones that failed).Using answers to similar questions on this site, I have cobbled together the following script.In its current state, the script trys to modify every xml files it finds. I have not been able to successfully add code that only searches folders called, ‘bravo'.When the script modifies an xml file, not in a 'bravo' folder, it errors because these files do not contain a 'file' tag.Please could someone help me to correct my script (or create a new one).Here is an example of the folder structure...My folder structureAnd my script so far...
Test if the directory name fits, before your second loop. You'd have to get the last directory in the path first. As in: How to get only the last part of a path in Python?You could use the https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html module for logging.If you only want to replace a single letter, then maybe you can directly replace it instead of parsing xml.
