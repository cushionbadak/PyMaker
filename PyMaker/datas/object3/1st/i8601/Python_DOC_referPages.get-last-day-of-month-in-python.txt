Getting error for December month.  ValueError: month must be in 1..12
You can't make a datetime with a month of 13. So you have to find a way to fix it. A simple solution is to convert the incremented month to an extra year:
In line 3 month=cur_ds.month+1 you are giving 13th month which is not valid. If you want to calculate last day of a given month you could also use month range from calendar library.
You're passing in 12 as current month, then adding one to get next_month, making it 13.  Check for the 12 case and set month=1 instead.
