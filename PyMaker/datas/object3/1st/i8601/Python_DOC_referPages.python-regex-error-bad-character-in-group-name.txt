By using named groups, you can make your expression shorter and more Pythonic!For clarity:Groups 1 and 3 capture the presence or absence of the quotation mark in a subgroup (a and b, respectively), then check for that subgroup at the end of the word.You do not need to name the groups either! You could simply reference their number:As a final test:Output:
