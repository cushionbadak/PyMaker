I want to turn this code into a for loop, because this is disgusting! I can't figure out how though.
You are basically picking two sets of coordinates from the series (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 3), (3, 0), in a ring fashion. You can do so by iteration over that series with an index to use for the second point:By giving the enumerate() function a starting point of -1 we create an offset that'll find the right matching point in points.You could also use the zip() function:Pick whichever you feel fits your usecase best.Demo (replacing the actual assignment with a print() statement to show what would be executed):
