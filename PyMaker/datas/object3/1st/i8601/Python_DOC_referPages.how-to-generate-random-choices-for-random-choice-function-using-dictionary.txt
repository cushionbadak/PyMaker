I am trying to create a function which generates a random password using random.choice function,but i also want the choices to be random,i am trying to use a dict for this purpose,but not getting the desired result..My code is:If i print and check the values of k,l,mam getting values such as letter1/letter2/symbol1/symbol2/number1 so trying to use those values in choice function.where as when i directly use: password=(choice(letter1)+choice(symbol1)+choice(number1)) it works fine.So how the above Choice function can be implemented using Dictionary.
You want to store the actual list in the dictionary, instead of the name of the lists. This will allow you to do what you want to do; to use the lists when you access the dictionary.Note that random's module warns about using it for security:Warning The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes. For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module.It recommends secrets module. It also has a choice() method too. 
An alternative approach (working example on repl.it):weights specifies how many of each type is required. The rest are randomly chosen.length is the total length of the resulting passwordExamples:
I don't think you need a dict, also use the string module:Output:
