I wrote this code and it prints rows sequentially:Is it possible to access rder with hasNext and next fashion, i.e. without for construct? For example, how to skip first row?The question is general, I would like to understand, what does it mean to be able to stay before in. In Java this means being of Iterable interface and I can easily find it's documentation and know, what I can do with it. In Python there is no information that I can find about what is returned by the reader function and I don't know what I can do with it except what is written in example. And that example is written to only use it with for.Can I choose to choose something else?
csv.reader returns an iterator.The iterator can be used in a for loop via in:So this:gives:The iterator can be read inside the for loop using next():If we need to consume a row inside of the for loop we can do:To give:The iterator can also be used outside of the for loop:Will give:Test Data:
csv.reader returns an iterator based on the underlying objects iterator protocol. It will not work as an iterator if the underlying object does not support iteration. If you use a text file, that is based on what is causing next to function for a text file (usually a \n sequence but not always...)You can write a loop Python that is not based on the for protocol. Instead, you use try/except and catch the StopIteration exception:But specifically, to get a header, it is probably better to do:Or, with Python3 you can shorten that to:But you can also use a non-file object, like a string with csv and records separate by a separate delimiter:In this case, next is moving to the next list element that is the result of the .split()
