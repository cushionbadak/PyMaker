I am trying to create a gui using tkinter in which a folder gets created in the C: drive under subdirectory "raw" with a user-specified entry in the entry widget.on creation of folder i want to click images from live webcam sequence for which i use opencv.  Problem: only a single image is getting captured!  I want to capture 30 images of the same person and store in C:/raw/s, where s is an user-specified directory.here is the code.I'm not sure why the img_counter variable is not getting updated.Any inputs would be highly appreciated 
I'm not sure why the img_counter variable is not getting updatedFirst of all you need to read about mutable and immutable objects in Python and so far integers are immutable ones.After that you declare the global img_counter and trying to pass it by reference to the function.So you got access to value but can't modifie it because you use global keyword incorrectly. With global keyword you can bind variable within a scope of desired function! Take a look at code below:With global keyword you can declare global variables inside a function (don't do that!)As you see in both cases there's no need to pass something to function! So in you code you can get rid of lambda function.Afterwords:Best way to structure a tkinter application
