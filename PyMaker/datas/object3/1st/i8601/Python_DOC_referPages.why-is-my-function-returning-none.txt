This question already has an answer here:Python Function Returning None                    4 answers                I built a calculation and it works:But when I try to make a function on of this, simply doesn't work. Can you please direct me?
Functions without explicit returns or empty returns will return None.If you don't want this, use a return at the end of your function to return some value.Some other tips.Make your function only do one thing:Currently your function is getting input, creating a list, and summing everything. This is a lot. You'll find that if you make your functions smaller, you'll get some nice benefits. You might consider something like this:so you might use it like this:Don't shadow Python built-ins:If you call your variables the same thing as Python builtins, you'll find yourself in trouble. See here:Normally list() would create an empty list (as seen above), but this is impossible because you've bound an object to the name list. Look at other builtins which could be shadowed here.
You are not returning anything.Your indentation is incorrect.You shouldn't use python builtins as variable names (list).(Note: _ is often used as a disposable variable)You don't really need the second loop as return sum(lst) would do the same thing.Alternatively, you don't need lst at all:
I changed your variable name for the list as it shadows the built-in name and added the return statement. Works as you intended it to.
