Score updates consumes a dictionary (see Example) and produces another dict with the value of the string, corresponding to the value of the letters from the dict Scoring. The output looks like Final(see below).This is what I have so far and I'm unsure on how I'm supposed to loop through the string to calculate the sum of it.Hope you are able to help. Thank you
Assuming you already had a dict Scoring, you could just use a dict comprehension with sum. 
You need to enumerate the values along with the keys. Then you can just map each character in the value to its number and sum that
