I inherited some code that looks like this:where each File contains a simple array of reals.I now need to run this program many times and the I/O is hurting me. I want to omit the files and read the Python output into Fortran and read the Fortran output back into Python. I can omit the first file by calling the Fortran routine from Python and providing the reals as a series of string arguments. What would a working code snippet look like to output the variable 'b' into another Python script without using an intermediate file?I've read about f2py, but the amount of refactoring involved in turning the inherited Fortan scripts into Python modules is more than what I want to do. 
If you could rebuild the Fortran code as a library, you could use that from Python using in several ways.Using ctypes. See e.g. the example at walking randomly.Using cython. See e.g example 1 and example 2.
I've found that what suits my needs is the following:
