Natural Text
Regex help.  I am searching a string and looking to find and remove text.What I have so far is not working.I want to find and copy the entire line.When I print a I get none.What I am looking for help with is how do I find the line findme= and remove the entire line from the string and save the line to a variable to be used later.  As well as removing the line from the string.
If you want to import re this is one way:
You don't need regex:This results in:
Your regex needs to search for a group that starts with findme= and the any character or number.I suggest you to use re.sub if you want to find and replace string(change_to) from your thistring
