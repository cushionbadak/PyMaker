I have a gff file looks like this: I wish to rename the ID names, starting from 0001, such that for the above gene the entry is: The above example is simply for one gene entry, but I wish to rename all genes, and their corresponding mRNA/exon, consecutively starting from ID = dd_0001. Any hints on how to do this would be much appreciated. 
The file needs to be opened, then the id replaced line by line.Here is the docs reference for file I/O and str.replace().Tested in Windows 10, Python 3.5.1, this works.To search for ids, you should use regex.  There are other ways of doing this, but this is quite robust.
