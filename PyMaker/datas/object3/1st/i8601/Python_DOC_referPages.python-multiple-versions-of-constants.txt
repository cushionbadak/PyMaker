I am writing a program in Python 3 to work with several devices. And I have to store constants for each device. Some constants are general for all devices and permanently fixed, but some other ones are different from version to version depending on the firmware version of the devices. I have to store constants for all versions, not only for the last one. Tell me please the Pythonic way to define constants for different devices and multiple versions of them.My current solution looks like this:Thank you in advance! Or, if you could point me in the direction where I can read about the above, I will be grateful for this too.UPD1:Thanks to @languitar I decided to use one of INI/JSON/YAML/TSON... format. For example, formats supported in library python-anyconfig. Format INI (proposed by @languitar configparser) looks good for my purposes (also TSON seemed interesting), but, unfortunately, both of them don't support hex value. I was very surprised. But all my constants should have hex format. And then I decided try YAML format. Now file with constants look like this:But I am not sure, whether this is the right way to store constants for devices and all their firmware versions
Just change your names to all capital letterslike GENERAL, DEVICE_1, etc
