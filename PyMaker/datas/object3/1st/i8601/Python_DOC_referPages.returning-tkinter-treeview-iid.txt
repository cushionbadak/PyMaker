Natural Text
I have a treeview and have inserted some data into it as shown below.This adds an entry to the end of the treeview with text "test a" and column values of "data1" and "data2".The iid has been set to "test1".I would like to return the value of iid of an item in the treeview so that I can use it for some other function (I will be storing a file path in this iid)I tried using treeview.item() and this returned the following dictionary without the iid:(where version and author are the column headings)So my question: is there a simple way to return the iid of a given row/entry to the treeview?
To get  the iid you can use the identify() function:The  iid  argument stands for item identifier which is unique for each item, and you can give it the value you want.
Learning Python, found no answer to this question here that I liked, so I finally figured out what I wanted and thought I would post what I found. iid = tree.focus() returns the information requested.in my treeview i added this code:this is my result from the code:{'text': 'TRAINS', 'image': '', 'values': '', 'open': 0, 'tags': ['m']}iid =  1 Item =  {'text': 'TRAINS', 'image': '', 'values': '', 'open': 0, 'tags': ['m']} Child iid's = ('8', '9', '10')Notice at the beginning of line two of the result the iid is listed as "1" which is the correct iid for the item. All treeview items I select returned the correct iid.Hope this helps the next person a little.
