Today I tried an enumeration with aenum (like in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1695250/4720441):orientation = Enum('red', 'yellow', 'green', 'orange') but this generated an error in the aenum library:File "C:\Python\27\lib\site-packages\aenum__init__.py", line 1417,  in _get_mixins_      issubclass(base, Enum) and TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a classHow can I fix this?
The various ways to create an Enum using call syntax are:This is the same across the stdlib version, enum34, and aenum1.  The enum2 package is an old-style library.The stdlib versions contain:3.4EnumIntEnumunique3.6FlagIntFlag*enum34 is the same as the 3.4 stdlib.aenumcontains the above, plus:OrderedEnum - members can be compared against each otherAutoNumberEnum - value is automatically generatedMultiValueEnum - members can be looked up with have multiple valuesNoAliasEnum - duplicates are unique, not aliasesand various helpers to manipulate the construction of enumerations:skip - prevents attributes from becoming enum members (attribute stays the same)constant -- to prevent attributes from becoming enum members (attribute becomes a type of read-only property)extend_enum - add new members to an existing enumeration (useful when the Enum is built in stages)And extra related types:NamedConstant - No enumeration fanciness, just a value with a nameNamedTuple - similar to the stdlib namedtuple, but built using metaclasses instead of eval1 Disclosure:  I am the primary author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum) library.2 The author of the older enum library also helped with the stdlib version.
aenum.Enum is not constructed like this (see https://bitbucket.org/stoneleaf/aenum). Instead you should be passing in a first argument containing the Enum name, and a second argument corresponding to a space separated list of enum keys you want enumerated. E.g. Note on the answer at https://stackoverflow.com/a/1695250/4720441In this answer, the poster creates an enum function, which combines it's arguments into a dict, and then passes that dict to the standard Enum constructor (as the third argument).
