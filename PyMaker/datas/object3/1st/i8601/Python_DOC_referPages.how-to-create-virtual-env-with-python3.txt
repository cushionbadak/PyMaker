I am using python 2.7 + virtualenv version 1.10.1 for running myproject projects. Due to some other projects requirement I have to work with other version of python(Python 3.5) and Django 1.9. For this I have installed python in my user directory. Also I have dowloaded and installed virtualenv( version - 15.1.0) into my user directory. But whenever I am trying to create virtual env I am getting the below errorCan anybody tell what I am doing wrong with this 
In Python 3.6+, the pyvenv module is deprecated. Use the following one-liner instead:This is the recommended way to create virtual environments by the Python community.
Python already ships with its builtin "virtualenv" called venv since version 3.3.  You no longer need to install or download the virtualenv scripts for Python 3.3+.https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.htmlCheck that your installation provided the pyvenv command that should take care of creating the "virtualenv".  Arguments are similar to the classic virtualenv project.
I install it using the command (for Python 3.x), 
Install virtualenvwrapper on top of virtualenv to simplify things.Follow the blog to install in easy steps: virtualenvwrapperSteps to create it:mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 Install packages using - pip install package_nameworkon - activates the virtualenv, deactivate - deactivates the viirtualenv
