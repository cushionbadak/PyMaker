I'm trying to use the argparse module in python for a script I am writing, I want to be able to use multiple flags in my command and store those variables. Here is what I have so far.How I get invalid syntax when I run any of the commands:Can anyone see where in my add arguments I'm making an error?
If I understand correctly you want to specify the number of command line arguments to be consumed by a flag?Have a look at this. Specifically: nargs - The number of command-line arguments that should be consumed. For example for the flag --renamegroup you need nargs=2 so that you can put --renamegroup oldname newname  "Oldname" and "newname" being the two arguments that follow the renamegroup flag.Basically what that line should look like:  
Try usingso this flag expects exactly two arguments.
