I want to delete  words in the string if \x comes in that word. I am trying thisBut it gives;SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-1: truncated \xXX escape
Update: You clarified that you're really trying to remove non-printable characters from a string.The backslash is there because it's in your input.Python is trying to interpret the \x in the string below as a command to insert a character using a hexadecimal value.To fix it, either escape the backslash like this:Or better, use a raw string like this:which tells Python not to expand the \x inside the string.If you're trying to split on non-printable characters...If you're really looking for a literal '\x'...
"\x" is not consider as charater you should make a raw string of your test string to make "\x" consider as character :EDIT to have Joe is a boy :
IF YOU WANT TO PRINT ONLY VALID ASCII CHARACTERSoutputJoe is \ a boy.If you want to filter only valid alphabetic characters you can use .isalpha(). If you want to allow numeric characters too, you can use .isalnum() instead of .isalpha(). \x is an escape character so you method will not work.output Joe is  a boyUpdateEdit  If the above two method does not work for you individually and if you only want Joe is a boy as outputOutputJoe is a boyyou can also use regular expression
Use r with the string to treat it as a raw string. So the escape codes will be ignored.OUTPUT
