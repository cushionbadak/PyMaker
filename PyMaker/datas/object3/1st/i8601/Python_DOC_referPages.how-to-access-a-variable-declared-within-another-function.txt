Please assist me to find an answer
Your instance never calls the method mydict.  Remember that python is interpreted line-by-line the self.myDictIn will not be assigned at that point.Instead, why don't you write self.myDictIn= .... in the constructor?
In myadd(self), declare myDictIn as global. As you know variables need to be declared/assigned before using it. If programme encounters myDictIn before assigned, it throws the error. So please declare myDictIn before programme encounters myDictIn. Hope this helps!
It looks like you just need a getter and setter here, you can use python properties to do that:This way, you can still change the value of MyDictIn easily
