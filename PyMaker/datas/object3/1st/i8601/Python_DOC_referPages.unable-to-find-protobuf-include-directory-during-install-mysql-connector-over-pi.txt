I pulled mysql-connector-python code and when I run python ./setup.py build I get the following error:pip install Protobuf was uselessHow can I solve this problem?
I found that this error occurs since version 2.2.3.You can avoid this issue using version 2.1.6.pip install mysql-connector==2.1.6try above.
As of 2.2.3, Connector/Python uses a C++ extension that interfaces with a MySQL server with the X plugin enabled, using Protobuf as data interchange format.So, you need to set up where Protobuf is installed on your system (the library, include and protoc binary paths).RequirementsA C/C++ compiler, such as gccProtobuf C++ (version >= 2.6.0)Python development filesInstallationYou have two options when using pip + pypi:1) Set environment variables for MYSQLXPB_PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_DIR, MYSQLXPB_PROTOBUF_LIB_DIR and MYSQLXPB_PROTOC.2) Add --install-option to set these options when using pip:Important: Keep in mind that 2.2.3 is a development release.
I also have this issue on my Ubuntu 16.04 and finally can install mysql-connector 2.2.3 with the following steps:Install these packages via the Ubuntu package manager:Set these environment variables:Install the mysql-connector package via the Python package manager:Hope this helps.
For some reason I noticed that pip install mysql-connector tried to install v2.2.3, which we don't want. Therefore, I specifically entered pip install mysql-connector==2.1.6 and it installed without error. Please note too that I am using a virtualenv running python 3.6.1. I installed it there. Here is documentation on installing specific python modules that helped me. https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html
I am on WIN 7 64-bit, python 27. This command works for me and seems most appropriate, particularly when v2.2.3 is a development version.
To install protobuf with mac ports, I did the followingInstalling protobuf:port install protobuf-cppDeclare where is protobufexport MYSQLXPB_PROTOBUF_LIB_DIR=/opt/local/libexport MYSQLXPB_PROTOC=/opt/local/bin/protocexport MYSQLXPB_PROTOBUF_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/includeInstalling the connectorpip install mysql-connector
Please know that 2.1.6 Connector fails with NoneType error when connecting to Django 1.11. Fixed in 2.1.7.Read: mysql-connector-python fails to work with django 1.11.
