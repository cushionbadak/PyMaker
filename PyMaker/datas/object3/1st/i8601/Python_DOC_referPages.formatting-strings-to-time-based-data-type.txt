I have a list of strings that represent different timed race results of varying time intervals (ss:SS, mm:ss.SS, hh:mm:ss). I would like to standardize the time intervals in a common format that supports all of these formats, and is able to be handled across languages.I will want to do calculations on these times, store them in a database, as well as convert them back to the original string to be displayedMy current thoughts are the following myTimespans = [ "12.04", "1:00.42", "4:19:27" ] produces something like Not sure which is the most practical to implement, and how I should write a python script to convert the strings.Any tips / suggestions appreciated!
You can use datetime or dateutil library to parse them into datetime format. I just use regular expression to clean string first.As mentioned in the comment, question should be more specific.
import datetime!Specifically, datetime.datetime.strptime()strftime() and strptime() Behavior
