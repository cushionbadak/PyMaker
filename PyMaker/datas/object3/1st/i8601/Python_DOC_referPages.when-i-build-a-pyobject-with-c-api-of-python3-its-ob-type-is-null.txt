I ran such code in C++11:Then I checked the value of aa, it's not NULL, but aa->ob_type was NULL.However, when I ran:aa->ob_type was not NULL anymore. I read the document of PyLong_FromLong, and found this:Seems that when building PyLongObject between -5 and 256 will meet this problem. But I don't understand the reason.What's more, this problem doesn't appear in Python2. That's incredible!
You haven't initialized Python. Since these small objects are special-cased they are set up when Python is initialized.correctly printsaa=7aa->ob_type=0x7f380d6b5800 (note that this will vary from run to run)If I comment out Py_Initialize() and Py_Finalize() then I get a segmentation fault, but if I don't try reading the value with PyLong_AsLong then I get a null pointer for ob_type.The documentation does tell you to initialize the interpreter.With respect to Python2 it has two integer types PyInt and PyLong with PyInt handling the small values and so having the special-cased table. You'll probably see the same issue if you use PyInt in Python2. Anything you do with Python before calling Py_Initialize is undefined though, so it could fail in different exciting ways.
