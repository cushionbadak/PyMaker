Natural Text
I am given a text file containing the print-out of a multi-level python dictionary. What is an easy way of loading it back to Python as "dictionaries in a dictionary", preserving the hierarchy? I'm thinking about rule-based parsing, but that would be horrendously complicated. 
The best way to go about this in this case would be to load the string into a JSON parser. This will return you the object you need. Please use the following code (where 'filename' is the name of the file that holds your original string).The myJSON object is now a dictionary:
First read the file content into a string, like:Then simply use the eval() builtin:For the specific string you gave, that will yield errors unless you first do, e.g.,because false and true are used like variable names in the string.
