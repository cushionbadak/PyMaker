Im new at programming and i was wondering how can i open a notepad document so the user can type on it. I already know that you can useto open and write on a file but instead of writing on python i wanted the file to open directly so the user can type on the actual file not in python shell.So far i know that i have to usebut i dont know how to make the file pop up so the user can enter data. can somebody help me?
This easiest approach using os is to use os.system to run a shell script:Or using subprocess.Popen which is usually the recommended way:But I believe only Windows has the Notepad application. You can also use the suggested method from the comments:But that only works in Python 3.5+
This will pop-up Notepad. If the file doesn't exist, there will be a prompt asking if you'd like to create it.
