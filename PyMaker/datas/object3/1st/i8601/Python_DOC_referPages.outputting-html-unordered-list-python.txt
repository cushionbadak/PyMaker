I'm attempting to write a function with python that will take an list of strings that I have defined and display them as a single string that is and HTML unordered list of said strings. So far my code is:When I attempt to run this however I get no traceback and nothing happens. Does anyone know why this is happening? I know this is probably a trivial question but I've searched for answers and cannot find a solution. Thanks!
You could do something like that:There were some problems with your original code: you did not call the function, so no wonder it didn't do anythingeven if you did, the function did not actually print anything, it just returned some valuesthe function didn't really take arguments, so it was not re-usable at allA better (IMO) solution would be to have a function generating the HTML code, and printing the result:You can also read about list comprehensions. It would make working with lists simpler:
Looks like you are trying to build a website. Why don't you use a template engine, like Jinja 2 for this, instead of printing a HTML snippet from a function? For that you will need a Python web application, plausibly written in one of web frameworks. I'd go for Flask here, it's simple to start working with and Jinja is a default template engine for Flask.If you just want to generate static HTML files, I would recommend Frozen-Flask, which allows you to generate static HTML files that can be hosted without a need to deploy any Python web application on your server. Just copy generated files to your hosting and you are ready to go.If you still want to just print a HTML snippet, your code should be something like Ealhad posted in his answer.Also, you original code contains a few problems:
