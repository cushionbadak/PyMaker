I have a function which can return a variable number of outputs. I would like to save this to a dictionary like so:Now while this thing does work, I was wondering if there is a more elegant way of doing it. Any ideas?
You can use the enumerate() function to add the indices in the dictionary:This gives you the exact same integer index to value mapping. However, just a list would give you the exact same index-to-value mapping:(if some_test_function already returns a list object, just remove the list() call).
