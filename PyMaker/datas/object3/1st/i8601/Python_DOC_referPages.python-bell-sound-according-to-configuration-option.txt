I have a line of code that rings a bell in the cmd when the program requires interaction from the user.I do that in python with the print('\a') command. However I want to put this command behind a configuration option because I don't want a bell ringing on every prompt. How can I do that?? Thanks a lot.
Any number of ways you can do this. One would be configparser. Many usage examples here.Put the bell sound into a variable and prefix it before each print. Use '\a' when you want it and '' when you don't.in your config.INI, or any other means of getting the preference from the user:And for all places you may want the bell:And probably better to put that into a function like ask_user() so that you don't have to always write those print/input lines.
