Suppose I have the following numpy.ndarray:How is is possible to convert it to a dictionary of this form:The question is similar to python 2d array to dict but I cannot work out a solution similar to the answer there no matter how hard I've tried.
Assumed a as your array,Try this,Result Dictionary created with the concept:
You can do that with a pair of nested for loops.The built-in enumerate function steps through a list or other iterable, giving us both the item and its index.outputThat can be condensed considerably by using a nested pair of dictionary comprehensions:
Just loop through and build your nested dicts:
This function should work for a 2-D array and 1-D array as well. Additionally you can make it work for list with int/float just by commenting the first line of the function.
