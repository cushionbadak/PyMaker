I'm new to python. Here's my file:contiguous.py:I try to execute:Why the error? What am I missing?
You don't have to declare a variable to use it in Python. You just instantiate. So you would want to write just arr = [] and nothing for i. Furthermore, your loop syntax is incorrect. You should write for i in range(len).
Ok, your function in Python is:which is equivalent to:Which are both dangerous if val is mutable: Python is pass by assignment, so if you try to make an array of empty lists, via fillArray(len, []), you will have a bad day.
There is no var keyword in python. Simply remove that.Variables are set with:Also, the way you set more than one variable per line in python is:Also, your loop looks wrong. It should be:
You don't need the keyword var. To make arr an array, just do:Variables in python don't have types, only objects do. The type of a variable at any given moment is the type of the object they refer at that moment. So the line above initializes arr to an empty list, effectively making arr a list too. Also, some other considerations about your code: you are trying to fill an array with a value. There's a much easier way to do it:In this case you don't even need to do arr=[], your whole function can be replaced by the line above.
In python, you don't need to say var to assign variables as there is no variable declaration in python. You just arr = []. You also should not say , i after assigning to the variable, because i would be referencing a variable doesn't exist. Since you assign i later, you don't need to do that at all, actually. Also use for i in range(len).
