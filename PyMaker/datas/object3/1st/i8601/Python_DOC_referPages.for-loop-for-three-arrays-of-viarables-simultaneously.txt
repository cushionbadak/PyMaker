I want to loop through three lists of numbers simultaneously and do calculations on each combination of variables.So I can later store all the calculated data in a 3-dimensional dataframe.I've tried:but this does not seem to work, it only performs the calculations for each value of x and y, but not z.Any ideas how I can also loop through z at the same time?
How about using zip:Update with concrete exampleOutput:
if you want all the combinations, use itertools.product
Turns out the piece of code I tried to use actually did work. Just had to enumerate all my inputs.for (x,y,z) in [(x, y, z) for x in a for y in b for z in c]:It's possible to use this for dataframes with even more than 3 dimensions.The itertools.product should also work for Multi-dimensional array for-loops.Thanks for the responses everyone.
