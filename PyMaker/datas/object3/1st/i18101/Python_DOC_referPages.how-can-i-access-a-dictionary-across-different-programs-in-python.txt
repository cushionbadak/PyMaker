The setup in Python as follows:Program 1 startsProgram 1 creates a dictionary in the form myDictionary = {'':{'':''}}Program 1 exitsProgram 2 starts# At this point, i want to access myDictioanry.Program 2 exitsTo be precise, I am storing cookies in that dictionary. My webapp testing application requires me to login all the users once. Once logged in, the second program must test it for some other things which use these cookies. I want to skip the login module and get the cookies from the previous program itself.Is there a way to store and access this dictionary across programs in Python? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance
As per phro's answer, you can't expect to be able to persist data across python instances without storing it somewhere.  Having said that, you could pickle, dump it as json, shelve it, or, if things get hairy, sqlite it
Not the most elegant solution but you could pickle it.
