I have a dictionary with 20 000 plus entries with at the moment simply the unique word and the number of times the word was used in the source text (Dante's Divine Comedy in Italian).I would like to work through all entries replacing the value with an actual definition as I find them. Is there a simple way to iterate through the keywords that have as a value a number in order to replace (as I research the meaning)?The dictionary starts:Sort of an application that will suggest a keyword to research and define.
Here is a function that will find your key and replace your value.The output is:If you find it is taking too long to loop through your dictionary try a generator function:Output: 
You cannot select on specific values (or types of values). You'd either make a reverse index (map numbers back to (lists of) keys) or you have to loop through all values every time.If you are processing numbers in arbitrary order anyway, you may as well loop through all items:otherwise I'd go with the reverse index:Now you can look up keys by value:
In case you need a declarative solution, you can use dict.update() to change values in a dict.
If you iterate over a dictionary you get the keys, so assuming your dictionary is in a variable called data and you have some function find_definition() which gets the definition, you can do something like the following:
