Natural Text
I am using Python 3.2 for Windows with Tkinter 8.5.  Does anyone knows if it is possible to open text file by selecting an item on a listbox and display the text file contents on a text widget?  Here is my code:I need help to write the definition for "recipe_ingredients" so that when the item in the list is selected, a text file linked to the item is opened and its contents displayed in text widget.  I need to know how how to link a file to the listbox item and how to call it using the handler shown in the code above.
Text FilesYou can open a text file and dump it's contents into a string like so:More info on text files and PythonLinking listbox with text filesTo link listbox items with a text files, I suppose you could have all the things you are putting in the listbox in a dictionary, more info here. Unlike arrays or lists, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. So for instance you could have a filename as the key and whatever you want in the listbox as the value.I hope I helped a bit.
