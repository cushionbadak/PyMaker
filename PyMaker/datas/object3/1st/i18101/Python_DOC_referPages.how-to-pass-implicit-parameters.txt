Natural Text
I am not sure if this is the right way to ask the question, but here it goes.I have a class say This class has been coded by someone else, I just wanted to ask what would be the right way to pass the parameters. Center is this case is tuple like (3,4). But when I try to pass it directly in this manner, it says 'tuple' object has no attribute 'x'. Any help would be appreciated.
I am not sure what kind of object center is, or T_shape constructor is expecting?But you can achieve with namedtuple.
