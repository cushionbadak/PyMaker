I stumbled across this extra, no-underscores mro method when I was using __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta. It seems to be the same as __mro__ except that it returns a list instead of a tuple. Here's a random example (ideone snippet):I found later that this isn't unique to ABCMeta but is available in all new-style classes.So... why? What is this doing that __mro__ isn't?
Directly from the documentation:This method can be overridden by a metaclass to customize the method resolution order for its instances. It is called at class instantiation, and its result is stored in __mro__.Pretty self-explanatory to me...mro() is called on instanciation and stores its result in __mro__. They don't really have the same purpose.
