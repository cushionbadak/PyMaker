I am having an issue where I want to bring a variable into a function by name.I have tried this so far:However if I try to edit that input variable after I input the code the number the function detects the old input so it would still print 25 as oppose to the new input squared.Is there a cleaner way to pull a variable into a function that actually works?
Default functions values are calculated during function creation time, so even if you change the value of x it is not going to be changed in the function.From docs:Default parameter values are evaluated when the function definition is  executed. This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the  function is defined, and that the same “pre-computed” value is used  for each call.Read: Using mutable objects as default value can lead to unexpected results.If you want to access a global value then simply do:Or better pass it explicitly:Another reason why not to use global variables inside function:Using classes:
Just reference the global variable directly, instead of using it as the default value of an argument.
The default value of y is set during function definition, not when running it. So default value for y is set to value of x on def line.This should work:
Generally in python Keyword Arguments are always assigned a value and you cant change that assigned value . So in your codeFor the keyword argument y the value of x i.e 5 is assigned and we cant change that value. So even if you change the value of x you will get the same output as 25To solve this the function might directly access the global variable and return the value like the below code
This is the correct way to do thisOr you can simply do it like thisIn this case the same global variable is referenced if it exists.
