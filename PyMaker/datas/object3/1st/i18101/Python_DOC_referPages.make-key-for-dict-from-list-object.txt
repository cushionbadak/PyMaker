I have list:I know for certain that d is a dict such that d["key1"]["subkey2"]["subsubkey3"] is valid.How can I transform list k as a key for dict d so as to return d[k[0]][k[1]]...? 
You can try using reduce() with operator.getitem:In Python 3.x, you should use functools.reduce().reduce() simply takes a 2-argument function and applies it to the elements of a list consecutively, accumulating the result. There is also an optional initializer argument, which we have used here. As the docs state, reduce() is roughly equivalent to:In our case, we are passing an initializer so it will not be None. Hence what we have is:Our function in this case is getitem(a, b) (see link above) which simply returns the a[b]. Moreover, our iterable is k and our initializer is d. So the reduce() call above is equivalent to:
After this code finishes temp_d will contain your value
This is one of the few times when reduce might be a good idea - what it does is successively apply the same operation on a value.This is equivalent to:
