I read a lot on reload but I am not able to use reload function.There is some error in imp.py itself.I didn't make any changes.fileread is stored in proper directory of python.
You need to pass actual module objects to imp.reload().If you only have the module name, look up the module object in the sys.modules mapping:This only works on modules that have already been imported; if some of your entries are not imported yet, at the very least catch the KeyError skip these:Optionally, you could use importlib.import_module() to load such modules instead.
