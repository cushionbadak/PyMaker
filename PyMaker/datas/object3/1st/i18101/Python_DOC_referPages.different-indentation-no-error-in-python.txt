Though i give different indentations the code is working fine i'm unable to figure it out.
it will not be flagged as as IndentationError, sine any block of statement has to have at lease 1 space of indenthere your if and else are two different blocks, so it was indented anyway so the interpreter throws no errorThis will work without any problemBut if I try the following I will get IndendationError
The Python documentation explains indentation. Here's a relevant excerpt:At the beginning of each logical line, the lineâ€™s indentation level is  compared to the top of the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If  it is larger, it is pushed on the stack, and one INDENT token is  generated. If it is smaller, it must be one of the numbers occurring  on the stackIn your code, since the indentation level is larger than the top of the stack (which is 0), it is treated as a single indent. The else: line popped 2 off of the top of the stack, so the interpreter has no memory of your previous indentation level of 2. It only knows that it's higher than the 0.Problems arise when you start mixing indentation within a block:When the parser reaches return False, the stack contains [4, 8]. The next line has an indent of 6, which is not contained in the stack and therefore generates an IndentationError.
