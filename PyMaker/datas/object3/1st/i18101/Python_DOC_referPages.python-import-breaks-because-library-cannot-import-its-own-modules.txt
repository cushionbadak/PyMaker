I'm trying to use mongokit in my Pyramid project, but when I import it, I get the following error.There is a cursor.py file with a Cursor class in it in the same folder as __init__.py.According to the documentation, when you import a module, it is supposed to put its own directory at the beginning of the search path. However, when I print out sys.path from both foo.py and __init__.py, it is the same in both places.I can't find anyone else having this problem.Edit: I am using Python 3.3
mongokit is not compatible with python 3.From their version notes:v0.9.0now MongoKit requires PyMongo >= 2.5
The same error may occur if you use python 3.x and try to import some module for python 2.x.
