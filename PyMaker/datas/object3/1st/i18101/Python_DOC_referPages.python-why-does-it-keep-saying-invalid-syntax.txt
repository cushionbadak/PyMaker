I wrote this program in order to be able to find the number of A/U and C/G pairs from the users input. When I run it, it keeps saying "Invalid Syntax" while highlighting the first "else:" after the while loop in red. Anyone know what I need to change to fix it? 
You have an else: that isn't attached to any if, for, while, or try statement, which is illegal.If you meant for the else to be attached to the while, the solution is simple: Change the indentation to attach it:See break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops in the tutorial (and Compound statements in the language reference for full details).
Your else needs to be indented at the same level as your while, which doesn't really make sense in this case because there's no break in your loop, or you need to add an if on some line before it.
I see two obvious things:Everything after def main(): should be indented;Else should be at the same level of indentation as while. It is not a child, but a sibling of while.
Others have already explained the error.Try changing you while loops to this:Without any while or else:.Also the following snippet should do the same thing:
