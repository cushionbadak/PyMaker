This simple function returns:'int' object is not iterableerror in iPython. I don't know why it does this, while function doesn't work - condition seems to be true.(while's condition was simplified on purpose; original code doesn't have it)
I think you wantorinstead of m, n = 1.This (sequence unpacking)[http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences]:does something different to what you seem to think it does.It actually means this:For instance, you could do this:Then:In your case, you this doesn't work, because 1 is an integer, it doesn't have elements, hence the error.Useful features of sequence unpacking combined with tuples (and the splat operator - *):This:swaps the values of a and b.Unpacking range, useful for constants:The splat operator:
When you do m, n = 1 this is called tuple unpacking, and it works like this:Since 1 is an integer not a tuple, you get this weird error; because Python cannot "step through" (or iterate) an integer to unpack it. That's why the error is 'int' object is not iterable
