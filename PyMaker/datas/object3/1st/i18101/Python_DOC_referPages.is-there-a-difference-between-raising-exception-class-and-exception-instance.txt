In Python, I can raise an Exception in two waysapart from the fact that you can supply exception message in latter case, is there any fundamental difference between these two styles? Should I choose one over the other?
from the doc both are valid (no unexpected behaviour):The sole argument to raise indicates the exception to be raised. This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class that derives from Exception).In my opinion, an instance need to be used if you want it to hold data, whether it is a message (as you said) or custom data or whatever.as @alko said, if you don't give an instance it will instantiate one with no argument.this won't work if you need a mandatory argument:
To summarize comments: there is no difference. Either syntax will throw ValueError instance. Relevant excerpt from the docs:If it is a class, the exception instance will be obtained when needed  by instantiating the class with no arguments.
