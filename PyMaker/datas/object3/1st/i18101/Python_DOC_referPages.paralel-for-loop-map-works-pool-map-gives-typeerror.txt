I am making a condensed (only upper right) distance matrix. The calculation of the distance takes some time, so I want to paralelise the for loop. The unparelalised loop looks likewhere clusters is a list of objects to compare, compare_clusters() is a likelihood function and 1/compare_clusters() is the distance between two objects.I tried to paralelise it by moving the distance function out of the loop like soBefore paralelising I tried the same code, but with map() instead of pool.map(). This worked as I wanted. However, when using pool.map() I get the error What am I missing here?
From Pool.map's documentation:A parallel equivalent of the map() built-in function (it supports only one iterable argument though). It blocks until the result is ready.For ordinary map, you can supply multiple iterables. For example,But you can't do this with Pool.map. The third argument is interpreted as chunksize. You are giving it a list when it expects an int.Perhaps you could pass in only a single iterable, by combining your lists:I haven't tested it with pool.map, but this strategy works for ordinary map.
