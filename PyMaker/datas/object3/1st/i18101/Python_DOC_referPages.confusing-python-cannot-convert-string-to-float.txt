I got a value error and even if I try playing around with the code, it doesn't work!How can I get it right? - I am using Python 3.3.2!Here is the code: As you can see, the program asks for how many miles you can walk and gives you a response depending on what you type in.This is the code in text format:
The problem is exactly what the Traceback log says: Could not convert string to floatIf you have a string with only numbers, python's smart enough to do what you're trying and converts the string to a float.If you have a string with non-numerical characters, the conversion will fail and give you the error that you were having.The way most people would approach this problem is with a try/except (see here), or using the isdigit() function (see here).Try/ExceptIsdigit()Note that the latter will still return false if there are decimal points in the stringEDITOkay, I won't be able to get back to you for a while, so I'll post the answer just in case.The code's really simple:It will keep trying to convert the input to a float, looping back to the beginning if it fails.When eventually it succeeds, it'll break from the loop and go to the code you put lower down.
You need to take into account that the user might not fill in a proper value:A try/except handles the ValueError that might occur when float tries to convert the input to a float.
The traceback means what it says on the tin.float can convert strings that look like valid decimals into floats.  It can't convert arbitrary alphanumeric strings, notably including 'How am I supposed to know?'.If you want to handle arbitrary user input, you have to catch this exception, with a try/except block.
