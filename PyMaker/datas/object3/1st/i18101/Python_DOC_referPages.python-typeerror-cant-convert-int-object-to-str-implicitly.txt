I try to write to a file but python gives me an error.Also try with str()The same error:
Your first line is missing the format placeholders:It is the {} placeholders that str.format() fills. Note that you only need one string, with placeholders where the arguments to str.format() are to be filled in.Demo output:
Your string looks malformed in some fashion -- If you're looking to append the randrange values between the strings, you need to add '+' to both sides of the format.It's usually clearer to just create a string and explicitly insert the values though.This also gives you the ability to control the output if you wanted to do any type of string formatting or aligning of the values.
