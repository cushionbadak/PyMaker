Here is the code:The error I'm getting is:But the first argument to startswith is supposed to be a string according to the docs... so what is going on?I'm assuming I'm using at least Python 3 since I'm using the latest version of LiClipse.
It's because you're opening the file in bytes mode, and so you're calling bytes.startswith() and not str.startswith().You need to do line.startswith(b'>'), which will make '>' a bytes literal.
Without having your file to test on try encoding to utf-8 on the 'open'
