I have a list of lists and I want to write it in csv fileExample list:data[0] should be column nameseverything else is row wise dataPlease suggest me a way to do this.
This is trivial with the csv module:You already have the header in data as the first row; you can write all rows in one go with the writer.writerows() method. That's all there is to it, really.
I get the following error when I include newline='': TypeError: 'newline' is an invalid keyword argument for this function.This is what I used and worked fine for me.
