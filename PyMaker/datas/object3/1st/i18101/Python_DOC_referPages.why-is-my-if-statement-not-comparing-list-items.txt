My code is supposed to increment a sentence's alphabets by 2. ex: a->c, l->nI put the print("hi") statement to check if the if-statement was ever evaluated to be true but it never does. Can someone please tell me why?
is checks object identity. Since you appear to be testing whether two strings have the same value (not are the same object), you would be better served by ==. For example:You can make the same update for your other if statements as well.
The problem is that is compares identity and not equality of strings. Two short strings that are equal may be identical due to some string interning CPython does, but you generally should not build on this behavior. Instead, use == to compare the equality of strings.Note, that you can do this a lot better using str.translate, with a map created by str.maketrans:You can further use string.ascii_lowercase so you donâ€™t need to type the alphabet yourself; or use string.ascii_letters for lower and upper case characters:
Besides of the is thin, you have another problem in your code:As soon as y == 24, it will break: First, a will be added and then alphabet[26] - which results in an error.So change your logic toThis can even improved further:If you make alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', you can do
This might help clear up the "is" keyword. "is" checks the object identity, not the value.Output:So, all three have the same value, but only 1 and 3 are identical.
