I just need a hint on how to do things properly.Say I have a script called script.py which uses a list of names as argument ["name1", "name2", etc. ].I want to call this script from another script using the subprocess module. So what I would like to do is the following :Of course that doesn't work because the subprocess.Popen method requires a list of strings as arguments.So I considered doing the following :Now the process starts but it doesn't work because it has a string as argument and not a list. How should I fix that properly? 
Concatenate them using + operator.BTW, if you want use same python program, replace "python" with sys.executable.
Thanks for the quick answer falsetru. It doesn't work directly but I understand how to do.You're suggestion is equivalent to doing :Where I have 3 arguments that are the strings contained in my original list.All I need to do in my script.py file is to build a new list from each argument received by doing the following :myList is now the same than the one I had initially!Don't know why I didn't think about it earlier!
