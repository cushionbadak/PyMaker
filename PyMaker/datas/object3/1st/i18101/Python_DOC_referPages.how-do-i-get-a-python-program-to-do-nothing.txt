How do I get a python program to do nothing with if statement?Please help!
You could use a pass statement:Python 2.x documentationPython 3.x documentationHowever I doubt you want to do this, unless you just need to put something in as a placeholder until you come back and write the actual code for the if statement.If you have something like this:You can in general change it to this:But in this specific case you could (and should) do this:
The pass command is what you are looking for. Use pass for any construct that you want to "ignore". Your example uses a conditional expression but you can do the same for almost anything.For your specific use case, perhaps you'd want to test the opposite condition and only perform an action if the condition is false:This will be the same as this:That way you won't even have to use pass and you'll also be closer to adhering to the "Flatter is better than nested" convention in PEP20.You can read more about the pass statement in the documentation:The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.
you can use pass inside if statement.
You can use continue
