I will take an example first so that my question will be clearAssume,method1 in above statement will return both a,b values, but I will require only variable "b" throughout my program. Is there any placeholder kind of thing in python so that it is not required to name the variable "a"Something like,is required. Thanks in advance
In Python versions 2.x, since _ is a valid variable name, what you wrote would work:You could use a name like _ignore to make your intention clearer. If you really need to not keep the variable around, just del _ignore on the next line.From version 3.0 of Python, you can do this even with an arbitrary number of extra values:See What's new in Python 3.0 and PEP 3132 for details.
