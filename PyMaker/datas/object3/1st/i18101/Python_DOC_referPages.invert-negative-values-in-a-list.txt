I am trying to convert a list that contains negative values, to a list of non-negative values; inverting the negative ones. I have tried abs but it didn't work.My input isHow can I make it into this format as I am trying calculate the area
Try a list comprehension:
Your attempt didn't work because abs() takes an integer, not a list. To do this, you'll have to either loop through the list:Or you can use list comprehension, which is shorter:Or simply use the built-in map function, which is even shorter :)Hope this helps!
The simple pythonic way is the list comprehension above but if you're using Numpy for anything else you could do:with no need to convert or do any looping.
what you want is to use the absolute value (|x| = x if x > 0, |x| = -x if x < 0)
This is a wrong answer to your question, but this is what I came here looking for. This is how to invert all the numbers in your list using operator.neg; i.e. also positives to negatives.It returns:Or you can do a list comprehension of course:
