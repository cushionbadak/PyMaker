When I input D into interactive window of python3.3,I supposed that it should appear:[set([1, 3, 4]), set([2, 3, 5]), set([1, 2, 3, 5]), set([2, 5])]Why a map object?
Why the result of map is an object? Because in documentation for python 3.3 it is written that it yields the result, thus it is a generator.You can read it by usingor as it was suggested by Grijeshlist(D) will convert it to list
In Python 3, map doesn't return a list, but a map object, an iterator. There's a similar question about this.If you need a list, you can easily convert it to a list:See the docs about this.By the way, it's a good practice to use lower case letters for variable names. Hope this helps!
