I was currently playing with the 'urllib' module in python, and tried this to extract source code of a website:However, I get the following error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in        temp = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.quora.com/#') AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'request'I am using Python 2.7.5 by the way. 
It seems like you are reading Python 3.x documentation.It's urllib.urlopen in Python 2.x.
