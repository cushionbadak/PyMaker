This project states that Python 3 must be compiled without sigaltstack enabled.  So what do I need to do to compile Python 3 without sigaltstack enabled?
Run ./configure with options you want. Then, you will get pyconfig.h in addition to Makefile, config.log, ... .Edit the pyconfig.h: Find a line that contain HAVE_SIGALTSTACK, delete or comment out the line.Then, make, ...How to confirm: Check whether faulthandler module has _stack_overflow function. It should not have it.According to faulthandler module documentation:The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport  or the Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for  signal handlers if the sigaltstack() function is available. This  allows it to dump the traceback even on a stack overflow.
