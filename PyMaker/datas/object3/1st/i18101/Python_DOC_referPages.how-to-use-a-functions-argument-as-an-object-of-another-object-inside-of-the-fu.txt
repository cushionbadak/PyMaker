I've been stuck on this for a long time (like literally weeks), I've completed everything else in the code but this. I've also researched a lot but can't get anywhere near the solution. The only reason I waited a week to come here is because I wanted to solve this myself, but now, I give up!Now, suppose I have the following code:Now, when I create an instance and try to call the method meth2like this:It gives me an error for obvious reasons. How can I get it do what I want-- pass an argument to a function and use that argument as an object of another object? 
Looks like you want getattr():getattr(a, b) is equivalent to a.b (where b in the second case is the string that the b of the first case holds). In this case, a is self.hello and b is obj. From your snippet, it looks like you want to call the obj attribute as opposed to returning it directly, which is why we have a () at the end.
