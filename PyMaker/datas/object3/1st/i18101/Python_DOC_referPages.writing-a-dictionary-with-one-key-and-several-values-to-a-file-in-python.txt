Im trying to save a dictionary into a file the dictionary has 1 key and 3 valuesthis is the way I saved my dictionary What is the problem with my code? I've been trying to fix it for about a hour thanks!
If you do not need a user readable representation, take a look at the pickle module which does object serialization.If you need something readable, a JSON encoder is included in the standard library, wjich will serialize the basic datatypes (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries).
Your general approach is wrong here and I don't know if I should be doing your homework, but here's a version of the program that you wrote that works:It's a little more general than yours (just writes the string version of all values to the file), but I figure someone with less specific needs might read this at some point.Note: This is only for if you specifically want a space-delimited list of keys plus the values in the way the original question was worded. For anyone without these very specific requirements, I agree that pickle or json or some other standard serialization format is preferable!
