As suggested by Mark Ransom, I found the right encoding for that problem. The encoding was "ISO-8859-1", so replacing open("u.item", encoding="utf-8") with open('u.item', encoding = "ISO-8859-1") will solve the problem.
Your file doesn't actually contain utf-8 encoded data, it contains some other encoding. Figure out what that encoding is and use it in the open call.In Windows-1252 encoding for example the 0xe9 would be the character Ã©.
Also worked for me, ISO 8859-1 is going to save a lot, hahaha, mainly if using Speech Recognition API'sExample: 
Try this to read using pandas 
If you are using Python 2 the following will the solution:Because encoding parameter doesn't work with open(), you will be getting the following error:
If someone looking for these, this is an example for converting a CSV file in Python 3:
Sometimes when open(filepath) in which filepath actually is not a file would get the same error, so firstly make sure the file you're trying to open exists:hope this will help.
