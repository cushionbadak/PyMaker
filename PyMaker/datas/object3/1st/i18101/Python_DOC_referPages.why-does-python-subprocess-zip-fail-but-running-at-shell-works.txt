I'm on Mac OS X using Python 2.7; using subprocess.call with zip fails yet running the same command at the shell succeeds. Here's a copy of my terminal:I've also tried with full paths and had the same result.
Because running a command in the shell is not the same thing as running it with subprocess.call(); the shell expanded the example/* wildcard.Either expand the list of files with os.listdir() or the glob module yourself, or run the command through the shell from Python; with the shell=True argument to subprocess.call() (but make the first argument a whitespace-separated string).Using glob.glob() is probably the best option here:
Martijn's advice to use glob.glob is good for general shell wildcards, but in this case it looks as if you want to add all files in a directory to the ZIP archive. If that's right, you might be able to use the -r option to zip:
Try shell=True. subprocess.call('zip example.zip example/*', shell=True) would work.
