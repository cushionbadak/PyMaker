Could someone please tell me why am I getting the following error?NameError: global name 'CircleGesture' is not definedin my function on_connect I am setting the Circle gesture:but whenever I try to do anything for example:I'm in ubuntu. 
I do not know the module, and without seeing your code this is just a guess, but from your question I infer that you use this Leap Motion API, and did something like import Leap in your code.This way, you do not yet have the CircleGesture class in your name space, but you have to access it from within the Leap module, just like you did with Leap.Gesture.TYPE_CIRCLE.Try this: circle = Leap.CircleGesture(gesture)(as a side note: in Python, you do not have to terminate your lines with ;)
