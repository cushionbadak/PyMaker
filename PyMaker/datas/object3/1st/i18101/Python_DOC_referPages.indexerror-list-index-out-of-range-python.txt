I have copypasta'd a python code from a youtube video which should basically allow me to extract the titles and the links from a RSS feed. I am getting the error in     EDIT: Another question, After following unutbu's answer, I have been able to get the output but it is likebut if I remove the b from the regular expression , then I get a error for using a string instead of a byte like object
lists[:]=range(2,16) creates a list of numbers from 2 to 15:The error implies that there are fewer than 16 elements in findheadings.So instead of relying on the arbitrary assumption that there are a certain number of elements in findheadings, in Python it is more idiomatic to useto iterate over the elements of findheadings. heading will be assigned to a value in findheadings with each pass through the loop.To loop over both findheading and findlink, use zip:Note that if there are a different number of elements in findheading and findlink then zip will stop when there are no more elements in the shorter of the two. Use itertools.zip_longest if you want to iterate until both are exhausted.
