how should be valid domain name regex which full fill following criteria.each label max 63 characters long minimum 1 characterscontains numbers, letters and '-', Butshould not start and end with '-'max domain name length 255 characters minimum 1.for examplesome of valid combinations:I created this ^(([a-z0-9]){1,63}\.?){1,255}$But currently its not validating '-' part as required (it's , missing)Is there any way? plz correct me if I am wrong.
and mandatory to end with '.' :Here i found the solution 
Maybe this:
Instead of using regex try to look at urlparse http://docs.python.org/library/urlparse.htmlIt's fairly simple to learn and a lot better and comfortable to use.
Don't use regex for parsing domain names, use urllib.parse.If you need to find valid domain names in HTML then split the text of the page with a regex [ <>] and then parse each resulting string with urllib.parse.
TRy this:
Use the | operator in your RE followed by the '-'.. ensure you escape the literal '-' with \
This expression should meet all the requirements:^(?=.{1,255}$)(?!-)[A-Za-z0-9\-]{1,63}(\.[A-Za-z0-9\-]{1,63})*\.?(?<!-)$uses lookahead for total character lengthdomain can optionally end with a .
