It prints diga and digb but doesnt work with c!  Any help?  It's supposed to be a Denary to Binary converter but only 1-64, once i've cracked the code will increase this!  Thanks so much
Wow that was a lot of work, you don't have to do all that.here are the functions comprising this one from easy->importantstr() returns a stringrange() is a way to get a list from 1 number to another.  Written like this range(count-1, -1, -1) counts backwards."".join() is a way to take an iterable and put the pieces together.map() is a way to take a function and apply it to an iterable.lambda is a way to write a function in 1 line.   I was being lazy and could have written another def func_name(y) and it would have worked just as well.>> is a way to shift bits.  (which I believe understanding this one is the key component to understanding your problem)
You only set digc in one of the top if/else statement. If 32/denaryno<1 is True, you don't set digc at all.Set digc at the top of the function (to 0 or whatever else you want it to be). This applies to all the digit variables, digd, dige, etc.What you really should do, instead, is use a list of digits, and append either a 0 or a 1 to that list every time you divide the number by a factor.You may want to take a look at the divmod() function; it returns both the quotient and the remainder. You could also do with some looping here to slash the number of if statements needed here:
