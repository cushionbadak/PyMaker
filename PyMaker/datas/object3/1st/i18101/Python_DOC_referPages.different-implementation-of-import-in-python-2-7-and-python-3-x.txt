In Python 3 I got something like this to work:in Python 2.7 I get an error that the function I am passing in with functionName does not exist. In this example the package a_nested_package is in sys.path, it has a package to_be_imported, which has a package at_run_time. All packages have __init__.py files.I tried:playing with the level argument (I tried -1 and 1)removing a_nested_package from packageStringremoving a_nested_package from packageString and replacing it with .Also, if this is completely the wrong approach to do run-time imports of functions, please let me know! I am pretty new to Python (coming from C++, PHP and Java)
Use the importlib module to dynamically import modules, then use getattr() to retrieve a specific name from that module:
__import__ works just like the import statement.  (For good reason.)When you do this:You don't get a baz object in your file; you get foo!  Likewise, this:returns the foo module, but guarantees that it's been populated with bar.So in your example, __import__ is returning a_nested_package, and you have to traverse the rest of the path yourself.  Which sucks, and is why importlib is useful.  :)
