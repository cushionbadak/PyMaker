I can't figure out why I get the error:  TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to string implicityThis is the relevant code for the class:And here's the part of the code for the main program:And I can't figure out why I get this error. I've tried searching for it but I am new with programming so I have a lot of trouble with interpreting a totally different code but with the same problem. Very much grateful for your help ahead.
You have set the value of your pig to a string, then when you call pig.runAndGainValue(5) you are trying to add an integer to a string:This raises an exception as Python strings are not implicitly converted to numbers, even when their value could be interpreted as a number:When creating the Pig, make sure value in an integer, always. Perhaps you need to explicitly convert in the initializer:or just make sure your inputs are integers.
