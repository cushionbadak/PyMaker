how can i use fork() in Python3.3**This is My code :Input:Output:
os.fork is only available in Unix-like system. You cannot use that in Windows.os.fork()Fork a child process. Return 0 in the child and the childâ€™s process id  in the parent. If an error occurs OSError is raised.Note that some platforms including FreeBSD <= 6.3, Cygwin and OS/2 EMX  have known issues when using fork() from a thread.Availability: Unix.
Since os.fork isn't available on your target, consider instead using the subprocess module or even (batteries-not-included) envoy.These create a convenient abstraction around launching children.
You should use the python's default multiprocessing package. It works with both Linux and Windows.
