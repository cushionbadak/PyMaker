Natural Text
I am trying to write a python script with several text files inside a subdirectory, e.g. which will execute each file inside this subdirectory. How can one use argparse to do this? Should you write a function to access and open each file?Now, what do I do with args.inputdir? How do I extract files? 
How can one use argparse to do this? Should you write a function to access and open each file?That sounds likely since argparse shouldn't really need to know what to do with the commandline arguments -- just how to get them.  It probably looks something like:Here I've assumed that your directory contains only files (not more directories).  If it does contain more directories, you'll want to filter those out (maybe using os.path.isdir).
It's not a job of argparse.Use os.walk to iterate files recursively.
