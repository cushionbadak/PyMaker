I am currently working through Learn Python the Hard Way, exercise 15. The script I am trying to run is:When I run the script I get the error: 'Invalid Syntax', and it points to the "print txt.read" portion of the code (line 5).As stated, I am using python 3, and I know this book is written for Python 2. So my question is: what is the Python 3 equivalent of "print txt.read"?Many thanks
In addition to print needing to be a function (i.e. print()), your example is missing a starting quote on the line for raw_input.  It should be:And, you're missing a closing parentheses on one of the print lines.
print is a function call in python 3
