I have this list in Python:How can I get a list like this?, sum third elements with the same second element and firstI need to sum the third element by grouping the second and first element. For example, all the jhidalgo with 20...the sum is 7+0.4+0+1.6 = 9
Assuming that the values are intended to interpret commas as decimal points, and that all values to be grouped are consecutive, you can use itertools.groupby to good effect here:Using groupby is the best solution if the data is already consecutive by key (and preserves order without difficulty), but if the values to be grouped are not consecutive, you can either sort (by the same key used for groupby), e.g. running mylist.sort(key=itemgetter(0, 1)) before computing summed with groupby as above, or to avoid O(n log n) sort costs, you can use a dict (or for simplicity, defaultdict(float)) to group non-consecutive groups:
You can use pandas, It's a great python module for data analysis.Or:
