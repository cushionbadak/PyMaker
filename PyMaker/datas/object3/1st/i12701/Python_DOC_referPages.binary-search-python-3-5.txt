I'm trying to write binary search in python 3.5 but it wont work I'm not sure why. if I put value as 4 it displays found, if I put anything else nothing happens and its stuck running doing nothing. Thanks for your help.
User1915011 beat me to my answer. In line with his answer and @wim's comment, I have made the following changes your binarySearch method. Changed the loop to use the found variableAdded an additional assignment to midpoint inside the loopEnsure the loop terminates by adding first<=lastReturn found after the while loop to indicate success or failure.
Your looping condition is just wrong while binarySearch?You change value of midpoint only once instead you should be changing it every loop iteration. You compare value with index (midpoint) and should be comparing withlist value (alist[midpoint])This is wrong: return True and print ("found") it will always return None.
binary converters are also coolprint(list)
Here is a detailed explanation how it works:
