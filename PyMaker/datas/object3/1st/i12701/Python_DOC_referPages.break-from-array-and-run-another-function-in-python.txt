My code: I want to run exit() after every 3 elements of the array and then resume from the last element. 
You can use enumerate and modulo:Output:If you actually want to use n elements at a time maybe passing them to a function:Output:
However, I question some parts of your code. Here are some notes:arr is a python list, not an array, so the name is not the best one.Your exit function simply returns the string "Exit", are you sure it does what it is supposed to do? I am printing the return value of exit(), because simply calling it would do nothing useful. In addition, it would probably be better to write func such that it takes a list as a parameter. Lastly, exit is already a built-in Python function, overriding it is a bad idea.
