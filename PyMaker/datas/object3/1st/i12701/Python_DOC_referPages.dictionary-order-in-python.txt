Everywhere I search, they say python dictionary's doesn't have any order.When I run code 1 each time shows a different output (random order). But when I run code 2 it always shows the same sorted output. Why is the dictionary ordered in the second snippet?Outputscode 1:code 1 again:code 2 (always):
It's related to how hash randomisation is applied. Quoting docs (emphasis mine):By default, the __hash__() values of str, bytes and datetime  objects are “salted” with an unpredictable random value. Although they  remain constant within an individual Python process, they are not  predictable between repeated invocations of Python.For each subsequent run, your strings (keys in snippet 1) are hashed with different salt value - therefore hash value is also changed. Hash values determine ordering.For int type, hash function never changes - in fact hash is always equal to integer value.If hashing function never changes, there is no change in ordering in subsequent runs.For details in how Python dictionaries are implemented, you may refer to How are Python's Built In Dictionaries Implemented.
