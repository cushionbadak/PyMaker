I am confused how to structure a project containing a package and a unittest.I have this directory structure:constants.py__init__.pypackage.pyusage.pytest_package.pyEverything works until I try to run the test_package.py module, which understandably cannot import package:However, this seems to be preferred structure of package / tests. How can I make it work? Or should I do it completely differently (structure, directories, imports, test execution...)?
Either:Setup your PYTHONPATH such that TestProject is in it.Run tests using unittest like this:~/Python/TestProject $ python3 -m package.tests.test_packageUse unittest commendline interface:~/Python/TestProject $ python3 -m unittest package/tests/test_package.pyFor more information see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#command-line-interface
