I'm trying to subtract dates, both in the format of Month, Year. I wasn't sure if I should use datetime? I was reading over the docs and wasn't sure what would be the best way to calculate something like subtracting January 2005 from July 2008.
If you're trying to get the length of time between two points, subtracting datetime.datetime objects is definitely the approach to take.This generates a datetime.timedelta  object
A good idea is to use datetime.datetime objects. Subtracting datetime.datetime objects generates a datetime.timedelta object, as exemplified below
