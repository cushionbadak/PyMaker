Here is my code and I'm having a NameError with this code.NameError: name 'i' is not definedSo that I can't run the code.. Can you help me about it..the small code that explains i what i'm trying to do :I just want to generalize the code for every j in list.
The error is occuring because there is no variable named j.Replace the j in a(j) with in_file.Change this:To this:If you prefer to use j instead, then you would need to create/define the j variable like this:It is best practice to give a meaningful name to variables, exactly as you did with in_file.
Then you post a code which uses some file, post a file too, really. Or at least add a content of that file in the code itself. You can do it by adding something like this at the beginning:This is the same as doing this:for a file containing this:About you doing readlines() in the body of that function, and then doing recursion. Get this outside, it doesn't belong there, and it will probably everything on the second call, because readlines() will return nothing if file is already has been read.I'd recommend to use for loops instead of recursions, they are just safer and simplier. I didn't really understood what you are trying to do, so it's just a recommendation.lines and linex are dangerous names, you'll mistake one for another one day and will search for a mistake for hours. Maybe call it like all_lines and lines_list?
