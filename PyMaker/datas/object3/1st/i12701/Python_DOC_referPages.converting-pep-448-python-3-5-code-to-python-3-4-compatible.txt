I have the following function:How do I convert this piece of code into Python 3.4-compatible?I believe, the code currently uses PEP 448 - Additional Unpacking Generalizations right now, which is a Python 3.5 feature.
The new unpacking feature is what won't work in 3.4.You'll have to use the older, more verbose method of merging dictionaries.
