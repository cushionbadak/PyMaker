I have this string /1B5DB40?full and I want to convert it to 1B5DB40.I need to remove the ?full and the front /My site won't always have ?full at the end so I need something that will still work even if the ?full is not there.Thanks and hopefully this isn't too confusing to get some help :)EDIT:I know I could slice at 0 and 8 or whatever, but the 1B5DB40 could be longer or shorter. For example it could be /1B5DB4000?full or /1B5
Using str.lstrip (to remove leading /) and str.split (to remove optinal part after ?):or using urllib.parse.urlparse:
You can use lstrip and rstrip:This only works as long as you don't have the characters f, u, l, ?, / in the part that you want to extract.
You can use regular expressions:
What about regular expressions?In this case it matches everything that is between '/' and '?', but you can change it to your specific requirements
Split will simply return a single element list containing the original string if the separator is not found.
