In python I want to calculate the number of bits required to represent an unsigned number. For eg:I am simply calculating it as follows len( bin( n ) ) - 2Is there any other better way to calculate this ? purely using bit manipulation so that I can use it on other languages as well ?
The easiest way is to use the .bit_length() method of int type:If you want to do the bit twiddling yourself, you could use the following function:
If you really want a bit to do it, then
