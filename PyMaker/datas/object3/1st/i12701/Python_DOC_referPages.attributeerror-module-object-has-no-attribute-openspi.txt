I am a beginner with my Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. I am trying to connect an NFC card reader to RPi. I watched the following video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGs048l6kbQ&list=PLP7qPet500dcE-zP_-EVEisi7N1Lh4Ekk&index=1I went successfully through videos 1-5. In the 6. video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jncDxNI3AGk&index=6&list=PLP7qPet500dcE-zP_-EVEisi7N1Lh4Ekk) I typed the command sudo python read.py, and it showed me the following error:I couldn't find anything on the Internet, what can be a solution to my error. Could you help me, please?Thanks in advance.
Try installing the spi-PY package using python setup.py build && python setup.py install (use sudo if needed).
clone SPI-Py  package from https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py.git and call python setup.py install
I ran into the same Problem... You got to use virtual-env (recommended by community).Reinstalling all the dependencies inlcuding the SPI Module in an active virtual-environment did the trick for me. The DocÂ´s: Virtualenv.
