I am writing a Python script that has to execute a shell script. In my GIT repo I have plans to commit both (Python program + Shell script) in same directory in my repo. My issue is that when someone pulls out my code and wants to run my Python script from any relative / absolute location - I need to refer the shell script in the directory where my Python script resided.I am not sure which one I should make use ofIf I run my python script in same directory it prints same values - even if I execute from a separate directory and run my script as mentioned below I still get same values:If it so which one I should actually make use of? What is the difference in between each of them?========== Updated =========I created a symbolic link to my code like as mentioned below:Now when I re-run my code as mentioned below -I get the below outputSo I think the below one is the correct one as I am always getting the expected output:
Well first you want the directory, so let's use os.path.dirname(...)And os.path.abspath(__file__) should get you the path of the script, the difference between this and os.path.realpath() is the latter eliminates symbolic links, so not sure if you want thatSo I'd use os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
The difference between os.path.realpath and os.path.abspath is the former eliminates symbolic links whereas the latter be the absolute path of a symbolic link.In this case, the order of os.path.dirname and abspath or realpath shouldn't matter -- It would only matter if the file you passed in didn't have a directory portion.
You should use absolute path with directory name of pathname, like this:Find the common pathname manipulations (os.path) documentation to find the difference between the usage here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html
