Natural Text
First of all, we have two files:file01.txtThe second file has only one line!file02.txt The first parameter is th same in both files (unique).I must replace data file01 by some from file02. Match criterion is the first parameter (code).I have one input (request for code) and readlines for both file what next I need to do Also I'm working with lists.Expected result:The output should be:
SolutionThis works for the given example:Step by stepWe open both files for reading:The read data looks like this:We only need the code from file02.txt:The data2.split('|', 1) splits at |.  Since we need only one split, we can limit it with 1. Now we open file01.txt again. This time for writing:This line if line.split('|', 1)[0] == code: does the same split as above but for all lines of file01.txt. If the code is equal to the one from file02.txt, we use the line from file02.txt, otherwise we just write the line form file01.txt back.
You could use csv.reader() to read the file, and put them in a dict, then replace the keys like this:And d looks like:To get the excepted output:And if you want write them into a file:
You can simply concatenate the two sets of data into a single pandas.DataFrame(), as follows:Which gives:Now you can get rid of the columns you don't need (eg using pandas.Drop())
