How can I write the code so python ONLY prints out the lower case letters of the string. In this case, it should exclude the P.I tried this:But it doesn't solely print out the lowercase letters. How could I only get the lower-case characters out of the string instead of the whole string in lower-case. 
You want letter.islower() (which tests), not letter.lower() (which converts).If you want to print non-cased characters too, you'd check:
Try using islower instead :
Yours doesn't work because you've called .lower(), which is a method of the String class - it changes the case of the letter in question, and results in True.There are likely many ways to obtain the result you want, the simplest I can think of being:Note that there is an equality test in mine, which is what yours is missing.EDIT: As other answers pointed out, .islower() is a more succinct way of checking the case of the letter.  Similarly, .isupper() would print only the capital letters.
You could use
What will actually answer to your question (as i can tell from provided output) will be something like: import string word="Programming is fun!" filter(lambda c: c.islower() or not(c.isupper() and c in string.printable), word)
