Is it possible to return unpacked arguments?  What I am picturing is to return msg, *msg_args which would return a tuple such as (msg, msg_args[0], msg_args[1], msg_args[2]).  This would allow me to send it to another function for string interpolation.Desired results: print Hi Peter.  How are you?  I am fine.Actual results: SyntaxError: can use starred expression only as assignment target.  The line containing the error is return msg, *msg_args.
If you're not using Python 3.5+ with additional unpacking generalizations, you can't unpack as part of a return value. Just explicitly make the combined tuple through tuple concatenation:
In python versions prior to 3.5, simply construct a new tuple using it:In python 3.5, your current syntax would be fine.
Simple. Just don't use the star and reference as a list.The * is only used in the method definition to show that it will be a tuple of all of the rest of the arguments. Inside of the method, you reference that tuple without the star. It is just a tuple.
