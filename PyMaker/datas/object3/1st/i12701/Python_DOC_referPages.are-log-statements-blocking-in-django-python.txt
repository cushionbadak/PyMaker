Will calls to logger block request processing in a Django views?For instance, in the example below, will the logger.info() at line 2 block the response on line 3?I've looked at the Django logging documentation and the python logging module docs but I can't find a concrete answer to this question.I understand the the Handler decides where each log message goes, but I am not sure if the Handler itself is non-blocking. Would appreciate if someone could clarify or point to documentation explaining this.
From Django DocsDjango uses Python’s builtin logging module to perform system logging.  The usage of this module is discussed in detail in Python’s own  documentation.From Python DocsSometimes you have to get your logging handlers to do their work  without blocking the thread you’re logging from. This is common in Web  applications, though of course it also occurs in other scenarios.So, although not explicitly mentioned yet logging does seem to be blocking. For details see Python Docs.
