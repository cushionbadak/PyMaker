My script have to work in Linux and Windows.And the script receive 2 pattern strings as arguments.The following code works without problems. But I want not to use specific character "/". Because it close to bug, I think.Do you have some idea?
Using os.path.join is the best approach, replacing:with:os.path.join will properly prevent doubled separators, so it doesn't matter if confdir ends in a slash or not, it will produce output with only a single slash.In rare circumstances, you may want to work with os.sep and os.altsep instead, but that's uncommon. The main reason you might use them would be to explicitly lstrip away incorrect leading slashes on a path component; trailing slashes don't matter (os.path.join dedups for you), but leading slashes are treated as the beginning of an absolute path, and throw away previous components.
You could use an object such as pathlib.Path that takes care of the trailing path separator automatically e.g.:
