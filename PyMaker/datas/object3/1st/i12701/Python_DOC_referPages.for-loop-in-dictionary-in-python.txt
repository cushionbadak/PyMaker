The above code is from an concurrent.futures example in https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.htmlIt seems to me that a for loop is used in a dictionary. I am wondering if there is a documentation about this?
This is dict comprehensions.You should view the doc of list comprehensions (it works similar to dict comprehension)
