Natural Text
I have a tuple (could also use list instead) like this:What would be a sensible way to represent this as a JSON struct in python? The key is a string like so:Any suggestions? The JSON will be parsed in JS in the front end and will always be the same length. Missing entries are represented by '-'.
Use json.dumps.BTW, JSON has only array ([...]); no distinction between list and tuple.
Represent a list as an array, i.e. beginning with [ and ending with ].
