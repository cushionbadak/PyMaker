I'm looking for a test script in Python to test a few things to see how fast/slow it completes on various systems.Just some simple commands that are looped to make the script take say 10 second to complete and a report of how much cpu it uses, how much memory and how long it took to complete?I guess for the memory part we would use memory_profiler, I guess psutil for the cpu calling out 5 readings one at the start (all separated by 2 seconds) then the average cpu usage used, 1 in the middle of the script and 5 at the end (all separated by 2 seconds)How best would I go about this or is there already a script avaliable, I can't find anything that is good enough for this.
IPython has %timeit:line_profiler and memory_profiler can be run from the IPython console:More details: http://www.huyng.com/posts/python-performance-analysis/Average CPU is... trickier. Linux does report a kind of average CPU usage over time, check this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145247/understanding-cpu-while-running-top-command
