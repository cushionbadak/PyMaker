In the Python documentation for distribution, it is stated that the manifest template is named MANIFEST.in by default. It then doesn't appear to state anything about how to change that default.For the sake of a mixed language project, I'd like to name MANIFEST.in something more like PYTHON-MANIFEST.in or some such to avoid the mental load on developers who need to know what belongs to what language (and we cannot just put the Python subproject into a subdirectory as it needs access to umbrella project items at root).Is this possible? If so, how?
The command-line help for the Distutils sdist command has the answer:So you can name your “manifest template” file any name you like, and then specify the template filename with the template option for sdist.I could not find the answer in the Distutils documentation, which really needs some dedicated improvement and maintenance.
The above answer gave me a place to look and find a way to do this programmatically.When using setuptools it's possible to simply reassign the variable that's used to find the manifest template:I imagine that a similar thing would be possible with pure distutils by deriving from distutils.command.sdist.sdist and changing what self.template is assigned to in an overridden finalize_options (and further, of course, assigning this as your custom sdist command).
