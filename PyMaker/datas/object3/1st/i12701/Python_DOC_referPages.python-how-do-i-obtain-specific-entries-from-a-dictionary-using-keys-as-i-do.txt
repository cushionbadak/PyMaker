With an array x=['A','B','C'], I can obtain several elements from it by just stating the index: eg.print(x[0:2]) yields ['A','B'].Now for a similar (ordered) dictionary x={1:'A', 2:'B', 3:'C'}, how would I obtain 'A' and 'B' in the same way, by referencing the keys 1 and 2? Trying a method similar to the array above gives me an error:Note that the key tied to the entries are important, so it won't help converting the dictionary into a list.Also, I plan on doing this to a lot of entries (>100), so calling each individual one won't be useful. My real program will involve numbered keys starting from 100 and calling keys 200 to 300, for example.
The way to retrieve a value from a dictionary is dict_name[key]: Note that if the key doesn't exist this will raise a KeyError. A way around it is to use get(key, default_value):You can use a for loop in order to check multiple keys:
You can use operator.itemgetter:
You can map get() to the object that describes which keys you want, such as range() (which has syntax and results similar to that of slicing):Or a generator expression instead of map():
>> list(x.values())[0:2] This gives the output: ['A', 'B']Since you mentioned 'ordered' dictionary, this could be a possible solution but without referencing the keys.
