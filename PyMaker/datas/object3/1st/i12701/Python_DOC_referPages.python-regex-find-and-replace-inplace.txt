I have a snippet that finds floating point numbers like 1.321234123. I would like to get rid of some precision and make 1.3212 out of it. But how can i access the found match, convert it and replace it?Python Source:The Input File:
Use fileinput.FileInput, with inplace=True. printed line will be used as a replacement string for each line.UPDATEre.sub can accept a function as replacement. It will be called with match object and the return value of the function is used as a replacement string.The following is slightly modified version to use captured groups (to use in replacement function).
I hope this is what you are looking for
\1\2 captures the matches in the two sets of parentheses. This doesn't round, but it will truncate
