I have a bunch of strings written in hours that I want converted to minutesSome example input strings:I'm trying to come up some regex that will capture all of them and convert the whole thing to an integer that the minute valueThe above will turn into:I'm not too familiar with regex. I started playing around with something like this:However that doesn't appear to catch much at all. Only situations where theres a single digit followed by a letter. Furthermore, I'm not sure how to actually do the conversion into minutes
re.sub can accpet a replace function instead of a replacement string. The function will be called with match object, and the return value of the function is used as a replacement string.
Get first all digits string from the data by regular expression.use map to convert from String to  Integer.use join or for look to generate final output.Code:Best to go with string processing.
