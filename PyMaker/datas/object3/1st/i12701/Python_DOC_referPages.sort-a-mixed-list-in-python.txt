I want sort a list;My input is My excepted output is Please give me something. Thanks in advance.
So if I'm right, you're trying to get [1, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], and then [1, 5, 6], [2, 5, 6], [3, 5, 6]. Then sort your list use sorted(),  and (x[1][1:], x[1][0]) gives you something like 4, 5, 1, 4, 5, 2. And then sorted() function will sort the list based on them.Note that sorted() will create another list, however it doesn't change the current list. If you want to change it you need use:However, here's another way use list.sort():
UpdatedHere is something that produces the output that I think you want:OutputThis sorts on the second item to the end of the inner list, then on the first item of the inner list. You will notice that your input for items [20, [3, 4, 5]] and [30, [2, 4, 5]] changes in your expected output to [20,[2,4,5]]  and [30,[3,4,5]]. You do have a typo in your question.Original answerIt looks like you want to sort on the inner list of each list item. I say "looks" because that does not produce the required output, but it looks close.Output
You can pass a key element to the sorted function:
You should use a custom function for sorting. If I understand what you try to do, you need:
well this kinda works, it's not changing inner list the way you want it to.
How about:If you want the output to be: [[1, 4, 5], [2, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], [1, 5, 6], [3, 5, 6], [2, 5, 6]] as you indicated in your comment below, you can use sorted and list comprehension:
