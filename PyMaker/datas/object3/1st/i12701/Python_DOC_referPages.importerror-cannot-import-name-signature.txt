I am tying to modify the original sklearn.CalibrationCV  to create my won version. The original code has "from .utils.fixes import signature". So I did the following in my version:but got a error:When check the sklearn source code on GitHub. I see the following code inside fixes.py:Then I did from inspect import signature directly. Still get "ImportError: cannot import name signature"Besides how to fix this, I am also curious about why the original version can import a module that will be imported from another source? Thanks.
In python 2, the inspect module does not have a signature method.In python 3, the inspect module does have a signature method.This code is just trying to work with both python 2 and 3.You may want to use the funcsigs module if you are using python 2, or use sklearn.externals.funcsigs directly (for version sklearn >= 0.17).
