How to add days in epoch time in Pythonabove command giving me epoch time I want to add 90 days in that time. how do I add days in epoch time?
datetime makes it easy between fromtimestamp, timedelta and timestamp:On Python 3.2 and earlier, datetime objects don't have a .timestamp() method, so you must change the last line to the less efficient two-stage conversion:The two-stage conversion takes ~10x longer than .timestamp() on my machine, taking ~2.5 Âµs, vs. ~270 ns for .timestamp(); admittedly still trivial if you aren't doing it much, but if you need to do it a lot, consider it another argument for using modern Python. :-)
If the input is POSIX timestamp then to get +90 days:If you want to work with datetime objects then use UTC timezone:Don't use local time for the date/time arithmetic (avoid  naive fromtimestamp(), mktime(), naive_dt.timestamp() if you can help it). To understand when it may fail, read Find if 24 hrs have passed between datetimes - Python.
You can you dateutil.parser as well:
