I am fairly new at python, but have used regex for a while.  What am I missing here:Why does this match at the beginning of the string, but not at the end?  I am using python 2.7 on windows and linux.
You should use search instead of match. According to the docs:Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).So when you use match it's the same as using ^ in your regex (matches the position before the first character in the string).
