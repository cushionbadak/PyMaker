This question already has an answer here:HTTP requests and JSON parsing in Python                    6 answers                I am creating a Django web app.There is a function which creates a JSON response like this:And I get the response in the web browser like this:Now from another function I want to consume that response and extract the data out of it. How do I do it?
You can use the json library in python to do your job. for example :Since you have created a web app. I am assuming you have exposed a URL from which you can get you JSON response, for example http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1.The urlopen function sends a HTTP GET request at the given URL. parsed_json is a variable of the type map and you can extract the required data from it.
The answer I want to suggest is a little different. In your scenario - where one function needs to be accessed from both server and client end, I would suggest provide some extra parameter and change the output based on that. This reduces overheads and unnecessary conversions. For example, if you pass in an extra parameter and change the result like this, you don't need JSON parsing on python. Of course there are solutions to do that, but why need converting to json and then parsing back when you can avoid that totally?Then in your python code call like this - 
You can use literal_eval on the json string to parse it as dict. literal_eval is part of the ast (Abstract Syntax Trees) module. You can use it to:Safely evaluate an expression node or a Unicode or Latin-1 encoded  string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or  node provided may only consist of the following Python literal  structures: strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, booleans, and  None.
