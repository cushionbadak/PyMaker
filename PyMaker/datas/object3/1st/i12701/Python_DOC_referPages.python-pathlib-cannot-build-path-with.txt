I am using the library pathlib, and try to build a Path in the following way.However, when running this, I get the following error:I think I am following the syntax as defined in the pathlib documentation (but probably I am not in an obscure way).What am I doing wrong?
Almost certainly, you have defined a custom class called Path (or imported Path from another module). In either case, that Path overshadows the one from pathlib. To verify, runto find out which module Path is coming from.
For readability I prefer using Path.joinpath. In your case, it will be :Thus you can use * operator and for long lines it will be more comfortable. Using the tools the library provided you ensures you won't run into these errors, since they handle the details for you.
