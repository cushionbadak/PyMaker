In asynchronous JavaScript, it is easy to run tasks in parallel and wait for all of them to complete using Promise.all:I tried to rewrite the latter in python:But it executes my tasks sequentially.What is the simplest way to await multiple awaitables?Why doesn't my approach work?
The equivalent would be using asyncio.wait:Why doesn't my approach work?Because when you await each item in seq, you block that coroutine. So in essence, you have synchronous code masquerading as async. If you really wanted to, you could implement your own version of asyncio.wait using loop.create_task or asyncio.ensure_future.EDITAs Andrew mentioned, you can also use asyncio.gather.
