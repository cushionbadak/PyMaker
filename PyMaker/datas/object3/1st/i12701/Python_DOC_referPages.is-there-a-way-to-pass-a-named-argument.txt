Here's my code:So I found out I can easily pass a class as a parameter. But the last problem is about the named argument. If you watch my code, I do a langue=TagWithValue..[blabla]. The problem is that it's a "named" parameter, and I'd like to be able to pass it like that:And then to call it somehow like that (it doesn't work yet):For now I get this error:To be more precise, I need to call many_to_many_class.objects.create() one time with known_languages=blabla and another time with types_permis=blabla which, in other words, should call once many_to_many_class.objects.create(known_languages=blabla) and many_to_many_class.objects.create(types_permis=blabla) and I would like to know if there's a way to precise only the name of the parameter, not blablaHow to solve this?
That is extremely not recommended, but it is possible by using exec() function.But as I said, it is not pythonic and can easily fail. You should have it really tested in order to go ahead with this approach.My suggestion is to encapsulate into functions each situation, and call these functions according to the argument passed. But in order to answer your question, that is the way its done.
Seems like normal keyword unpacking would work . . .Of course, now champ might not be the best name for the function parameter, but hopefully you get the idea.
Here's my working solution, I don't know if it's the best "pythonic" way but it works like a charm:
