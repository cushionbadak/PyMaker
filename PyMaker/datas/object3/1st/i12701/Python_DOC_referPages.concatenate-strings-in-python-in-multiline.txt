I have some strings to be concatenate and the resultant string will be quite long. I also have some variables to be concatenated.How can I combine both strings and variables so the result would be a multi line string?The following code throws error.I have tried this tooPlease suggest a way to do this.
There are several ways. A simple solution is to add parenthesis:If you want each "line" on a separate line you can add newline characters:
Python isn't php and you have no need to put $ before a variable name.
Python 3: Formatted StringsAs of Python 3.6 you can use so called "formatted strings" (or "f strings") to easily insert variables into your strings. Just add an f in front of the string and write the variable inside curly braces ({}) like so:To split a long string to multiple lines surround the parts with parentheses (()) or use a multi-line string (a string surrounded by three quotes """ or ''' instead of one).1. ParenthesesWith parentheses around your strings you can even concatenate them without the need of a + sign in between:Good to know: If there is no variable in a line, there is no need for a leading f for that line.Good to know: You could archive the same result with backslashes (\) at the end of each line instead of surrounding parentheses but accordingly to PEP8 you should prefer parentheses for line continuation:Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.2. Multi-Line StringIn multi-line strings you don't need to explicitly insert \n, Python takes care of that for you:Good to know: Just make sure you align your code correctly otherwise you will have leading white space in front each line.By the way: you shouldn't call your variable str because that's the name of the datatype itself.Sources for formatted strings:What's new in Python 3.6PEP498
I would add everything I need to concatenate to a list and then join it on a line break.
