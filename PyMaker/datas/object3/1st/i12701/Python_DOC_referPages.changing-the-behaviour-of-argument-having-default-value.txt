I have a script that has a argument which has a default value.I want to do something:Is this doable in argparse?Hi all. Please note that my problem is different from the one mentioned in the solution.Basically i want action corresponding to -R to be performed only when i pass -R on command line.If only -R is passed then value of -R is default value.If i run the py file without -R then no action corresponding to -R should be done.
should produceThis is documented in https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs, subsection nargs='?'.
