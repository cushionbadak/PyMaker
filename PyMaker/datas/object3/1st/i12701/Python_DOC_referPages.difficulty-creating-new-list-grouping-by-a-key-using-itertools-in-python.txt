I have list of dictionaries as belowI tried below code to remove loc, sectors from above listsso that my list would contain only id and locFrom this, how can I create new list such that it will have list of id's and the count of them that were grouped by locations like below.I found this difficulty in making the list as above using itertools, probably I might be missing some better approach on achieving as above, could you please suggest.
You need to pass a sorted sequence to itertools.groupby.According to itertools.groupby documentation:...  Generally, the iterable needs to already be sorted on the same key  function.The operation of groupby() is similar to the uniq filter in Unix. It  generates a break or new group every time the value of the key  function changes (which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted  the data using the same key function). That behavior differs from  SQL’s GROUP BY which aggregates common elements regardless of their  input order.fs_loc →
