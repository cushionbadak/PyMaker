I want to extract lines from File1 which are not present in File2File1File2so the output should be:One possible command in bash is:And it works perfectly well in bash, but I don't know how correctly to implement in Python.I've tried withAnd is not working.Any hint?
If you must use a shell, do it safely:That is to say: Instead of passing the filenames in as part of your code, pass them as out-of-band variables such that their names can't be interpreted by the shell.
How about a pure python solution?Or with less memory overhead:
It doesn't work because you need use bash run the command:Normally, os.system() use sh run the command. But however, there's little different between bash and sh.So in this case, I used bash -c 'command' call bash run the command. Then it could works.From the manual of bash:-c     If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.If there are arguments after the command_string, they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with $0.
