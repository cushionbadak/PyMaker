I don't understand how if not x % 2: return True works. Wouldn't that mean this if x is not divisible by two, return True? That's what i see in this code. I see it as if not x % 2: return True would return the opposite of if a number is divisible by 2, return True.I just don't understand how that part of the syntax works.  
Wouldn't that mean this if x is not divisible by two, return True?No, because when x is not divisible by 2 the result of x%2 would be a nonzero value, which will be evaluated as True by Python, so its not would be False.Read more about Truth value testing in python.
The modulo operator % returns the remainder of a division. If x is divisible by 2 ('even'), then the remainder is zero and x % 2 thus evaluates to zero (=False), which makes the whole expression True.
note, to add to the other answers: x % 2 does not mean "x is divisible by 2"; instead, it is the modulo operator, and returns the value y such that x is congruent to y (mod 2), which is really just the remainder of dividing x by 2. Here is a fix for your code:See also: The modulo operator, in the python language reference (under "Binary Arithmetic Operators", fourth paragraph down.
If the remainder of X / 2 is 0, then return true
Simpler and readable is for instancewhere it explicitly tells the expression must equate zero in order for the function to return True.
If operation X modulo 2 = 0, function returns true - which means that the number is even.Operation modulo 2 returns the remainder from division by 2.Example:5 % 2 = 1 because 5 = 2*2 + 17 % 2 = 1 because use 7 = 3*2 + 16 % 2 = 0 because 6 = 3*2 + 0
