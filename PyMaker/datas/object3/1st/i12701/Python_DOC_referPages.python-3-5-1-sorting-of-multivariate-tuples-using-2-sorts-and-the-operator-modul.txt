I'm working through 3.5.1 Python and I'm working through basic Tuples. I expanded the basic tuple array by 1 additional variable and I wanted to sort the program by name and then grade. My code is:When I run the code, I get a compiler error of:Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
I think you meant to use sorted:becauselist.sort does not return unlike sorted, but just sort the list in-place.list.sort does not accept positional argument.
