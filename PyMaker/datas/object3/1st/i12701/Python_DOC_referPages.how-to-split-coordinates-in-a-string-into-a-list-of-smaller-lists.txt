Natural Text
I am trying to turn a string of coordinates "(x1, y1), (x2, y2)" into [[x1,y1], [x2,y2]] where all the coordinates are converted into floats as well.My current code doesn't seem to trim whitespace of the y coordinates nor does it convert the strings into floats.
One option could be to enclose the coordinates into square brackets and use literal_eval():
