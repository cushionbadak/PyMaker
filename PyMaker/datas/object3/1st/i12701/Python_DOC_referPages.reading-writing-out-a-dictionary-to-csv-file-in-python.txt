Pretty new to python, and the documentation for csv files are a bit confusing.I have a dictionary that looks like the following:key1: (value1, value2)key2: (value1, value2)key3: (value1, value2)....I would like to write these out to a csv file in the format where each line contains the key, followed by the two values.I would also like to be able to read them back into a dictionary from the file at a later date.
I don't find enough reasons to use Pandas here for a relatively simple problem. Note to OP, if you want to store values to file only for the purpose of reading it back, then use JSON instead of CSV. Exporting to CSV should be minimised to the very purpose of interacting with non-technical people (potentially Excel users). Here is how I will store it in CSVThis code explains what happens inside the list comprehension.
I highly recommend Pandas for this.Convert to Pandas DataFrame:Create a CSV file:Read the CSV file back as a DataFrame:Convert the DataFrame back to the original dictionary format:EDIT: Since you mention that your goal to use the output file in Excel, Pandas to_excel() and read_excel() might be more useful to you since they better-preserve the content between conversions.Also, you might want skip Excel altogether and use the standard Python scientific stack.
I would use pandas, it can be done in one line:
