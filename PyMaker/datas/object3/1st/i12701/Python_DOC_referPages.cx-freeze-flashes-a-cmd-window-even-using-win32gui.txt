I am new to cx_Freeze. I started using it in a big python application. That application is using PySide and uses multiprocessing. On application start and each time a thread starts I see a cmd window flashing shortly (just open and close really quick.. no time to read anything).Now I tried with a very simple application. Like this:But this is still showing and flashing a window on start.Here is the setup file I use with this:May be I am doing something wrong? Is the multiprocessing support the issue? Any hint appreciated.Btw, I am using python 2.7.3x64 and cx_Freeze 4.3.4, PySide 1.2.2 ...
solved.And after finding the problem, the question was probably not right.I catch a os.system('rd /s /q somefolder') call. In one of my modules loaded.As soon as I remove that, which is not necessary right now, the console window flashes dont show again. I used it in one single place, but the flashes appeared in several places (threads). I used as well Popen, which apparently works fine.
