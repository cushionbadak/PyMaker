I have a dict, of varying length. Each entry has a name and a list as so:How do I get the intersection for the following list? I need to do it dynamically, I don't know how long the dict will be.For the above list, the intersection would be empty, I know. But forIt should return
Normally, intersection is a set operation. So, you might want to convert the values of the dictionary to sets and then run intersection, like thisIf you want the result to be a list, just convert the resulting set to a list, like thisHere, the expression, *(set(values) for values in data.values()) creates a generator, which yields each and every value of the dictionary item converted to a set and the generator is unpacked to the set.intersection function.
Provide another way using reduce.the way it behave is like(e.g the_list = [[1, 2, 3], [], [2,3]]):so the solution will be:
