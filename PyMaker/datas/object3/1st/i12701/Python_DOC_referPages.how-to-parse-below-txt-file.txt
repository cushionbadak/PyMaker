Tweaking the dialect settings on the reader initialization should do it. From what your data looks like, it would probably be:It's possible you may need to tweak other settings, e.g. doublequote, escapechar, etc., depending on whether vertical pipes can appear in fields, and if so, how they should be escaped. You can read the formatting parameters documentation for more info.
