This Python program enters fdisk.  I see the output.  fdisk is an interactive program.  How do I get the Python program to pass an "m" to the first field and press enter? I'd rather not import a new module/library, but I could.  I've tried different syntax with subprocess.call() and extra parameters in the above.  Nothing seems to work.  I get different errors. I've reviewed Python documentation.  I want to feed input and press Enter in the subsequent, interactive menu options of fdisk.
Check out the pexpect library (I know you didn't want an extra module, but you want to use the best tool for the job). It's pure Python, with no compiled submodules, so installation is a snap. Basically, it does the same thing in Python as the classic Unix utility expect - spawns child applications, controls them, and responds to expected patterns in their output. It's great for automation, and especially application testing, where you can quickly feed the newest build of a command-line program a series of inputs and guide the interaction based on what output appears.In case you just don't want another module at all, you can always fall back on the subprocess module's Popen() constructor. It spawns and creates a connection to a child process, allowing you to communicate with it as needed, and in fact pexpect relies a great deal on it. I personally think using pexpect is more intuitive than subprocess.Popen(), but that's just me. YMMV.
