Hope this helps,I downloaded from seaborn from GitHub.Through command prompt, cd to downloads\seaborn folderThen using spyder from anaconda, checked if it was installed by running the following in a consoleSeeing that it was not there, go to tools and select "Update module names list"Again trying the previous code in a python console, the lib was still not showing.Restarting Spyder and trying import seaborn worked.Hope this helps.
