I was trying to pass a value by calling C file from python and then return that value from C to python again. My question is how to do this? Can it possible to use return Py_BuildValue(a+b) kind of thing?
Specify the format of the value:You can find more format unit here (Py_BuildValue documentation).
You can use the explicit constructors for integers PyInt_FromLong or PyLong_FromLong instead.You can find functions like this for any type you can create with Py_BuildValue and get a little type safety on top.
