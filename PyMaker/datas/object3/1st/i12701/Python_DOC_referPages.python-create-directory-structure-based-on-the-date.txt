Consider using strftime instead. Which you can use to defined a format to your liking. You will also need to use makedirs as described by @Valijon below.You can also append a given time to create a time-stamp in the past or in the future.Also note that your path is a bit dangerous, unless you want to create folders directly under the root partition.Note that makedirs will raise an exception if the directory already exists.Either make a neat function to handle these scenarios or use a try / except clause. But I'd strongly recommend making a mkdir -p function.
Just change os.mkdir to os.makedirs
