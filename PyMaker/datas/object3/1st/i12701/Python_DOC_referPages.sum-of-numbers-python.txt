Assume the file containing a series of integers is named numbers.txt and exists on the computers disk. Write a program that reads all of the numbers stored in the file and calculates their total.The program is not giving any errors back, but I'm getting the wrong total. I'm getting 5,750,884.00 and should be getting 284.00This is what I've come up with so far:

Since you're using Python 3 (presumably CPython), the absolute fastest solution is:In CPython, that pushes all of the work to the C layer (no matter the size of the file, same number of byte codes executed), and streams the file (so peak memory usage doesn't grow with file size).When summing floats, you may want higher accuracy, which Python provides with math.fsum:It's slightly slower (not meaningfully; a matter of maybe 2% slower, give or take), but in exchange, it doesn't suffer from the additional loss of precision that generic summation of floats would incur due to storing partial sums with progressive rounding error.
Use the with syntax for managing file closing, and use the sum function to add the items (with a generator expression)
