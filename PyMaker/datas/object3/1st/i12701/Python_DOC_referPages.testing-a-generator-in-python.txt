I programmed a very simple generator in Python 3.4:The code works when I use a for loop to consume the generated values:But I'm now trying to create a unit test, and for that, I'd need to get each value at a time (outside a loop). I'm trying something like this:When I try that, I always get aSo, when I call the values myself, it return something (is it a pointer?) instead of the generated value.As I'm considering I'm using a basic generator pattern, my question is a little broader then my own code: what's the proper way to test a Python Generator?
A generator is meant to be iterated through.  You can use the next() function to get the next value of the generator.  Be aware that if your generator has exhausted it's values, it will raise a StopIteration exception.
I needed to unit-test a generator myself, so I created this helper function:Here's an example of using it:
