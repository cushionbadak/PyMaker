I need help with this code:I'm trying to minimize function from user input. Example of function: 20*x[0]**0.3*x[1]**0.4 - 2*x[0] - 3*x[1]. But something goes wrong and i get TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'I have spent a lot of time to make it work, but cant solve this problem. What im doing wrong?
exec returns None. Use eval does. Use eval.And input returns a string; You don't need to convert it to string:
