How can I convert "[(5, 2), (1,3), (4,5)]" into a list of tuples [(5, 2), (1,3), (4,5)]I am using planetlab shell that does not support "import ast". So I am unable to use it. 
If ast.literal_eval is unavailable, you can use the (unsafe!) eval:However, you should really overthink your serialization format. If you're transferring data between Python applications and need the distinction between tuples and lists, use pickle. Otherwise, use JSON.
If you don't trust the source of the string enough to use eval, then use re.The code above is very straightforward and only works with 2-tuples of integers. If you want to parse more complex structures, you're better off with a proper parser.
'join' replace following characters '()[] ' and creates string of comma separated numbers5,2,1,3,4,5'split' splits that string on ',' and creates list strings['5','2','1','3','4','5']'iter' creates iterator that will go over list of elementsand the last line uses a list comprehension using 'zip' to group together two numbers
