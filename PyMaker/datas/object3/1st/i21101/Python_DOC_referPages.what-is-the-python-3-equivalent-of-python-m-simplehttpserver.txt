What is the Python 3 equivalent of python -m SimpleHTTPServer?
From the docs:The SimpleHTTPServer module has been merged into http.server in Python 3.0. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to 3.0.So, your command is python3 -m http.server.
The equivalent is:
Using 2to3 utility.
In addition to Petr's answer, if you want to bind to a specific interface instead of all the interfaces you can use -b/--bind flag.The above snippet should do the trick. 8000 is the port number. 80 is used as the standard port for HTTP communications.
In one of my projects I run tests against Python 2 and 3. For that I wrote a small script which starts a local server independently:As an alias:Please note that I control my Python version via conda environments, because of that I can use python instead of python3 for using Python 3.
The command python -m SimpleHTTPServer is for Linux. Use Command python -m http.server 7777 for Windows
