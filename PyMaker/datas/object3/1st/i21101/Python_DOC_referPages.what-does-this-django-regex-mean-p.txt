Natural Text
I have the following regex in my urls.py and I'd like  to know what it means. Specifically the (?P<category_slug> portion of the regex.r'^category/(?P<category_slug>[-\w]+)/$
(?P<name>regex) - Round brackets group the regex between them. They capture the text matched by the regex inside them that can be referenced by the name between the sharp brackets. The name may consist of letters and digits.Copy paste from: http://www.regular-expressions.info/refext.html
In django, named capturing groups are passed to your view as keyword arguments.Unnamed capturing groups (just a parenthesis) are passed to your view as arguments.The ?P is a named capturing group, as opposed to an unnamed capturing group.http://docs.python.org/library/re.html(?P<name>...) Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring  matched by the group is accessible within the rest of the regular  expression via the symbolic group name name. Group names must be valid  Python identifiers, and each group name must be defined only once  within a regular expression. A symbolic group is also a numbered  group, just as if the group were not named. So the group named id in  the example below can also be referenced as the numbered group 1.
(?P<category_slug>) creates a match group named category_slug.The regex itself matches a string starting with category/ and then a mix of alphanumeric characters, the dash - and the underscore _, followed by a trailing slash.Example URLs accepted by the regex:category/foo/category/foo_bar-baz/category/12345/category/q1e2_asdf/
New in version 3.6.(?P<name>...)Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group name name. Group names must be valid Python identifiers, and each group name must be defined only once within a regular expression. A symbolic group is also a numbered group, just as if the group were not named.copy paste from Python3Regex
