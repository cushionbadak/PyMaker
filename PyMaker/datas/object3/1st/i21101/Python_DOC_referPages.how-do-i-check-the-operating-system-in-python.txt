I want to check the operating system (on the computer where the script runs).I know I can use os.system('uname -o') in Linux, but it gives me a message in the console, and I want to write to a variable.It will be okay if the script can tell if it is Mac, Windows or Linux. How can I check it? 
You can use sys.platform:sys.platform has finer granularity than sys.name.For the valid values, consult the documentation.
You can get a pretty coarse idea of the OS you're using by checking sys.platform.Once you have that information you can use it to determine if calling something like os.uname() is appropriate to gather more specific information.  You could also use something like Python System Information on unix-like OSes, or pywin32 for Windows.There's also psutil if you want to do more in-depth inspection without wanting to care about the OS.
If you want to know on which platform you are: "Linux", "Windows" or "Darwin" (Mac) without more precision, you should use:The platform.system function use uname internally.
More detailed information are available in the platform module.
You can use sys.platform.
There seems to be some conflicting information about how Windows identifies. Some sources are saying "Windows", and other sources are saying "win32".With that in mind...That might be true in Cygwin though. But you can always add a check to make sure "cy" isn't in there.
