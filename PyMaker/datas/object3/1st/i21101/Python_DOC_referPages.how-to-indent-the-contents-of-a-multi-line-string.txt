Natural Text
I'm using the python cog module to generate C++ boilerplate code, and it is working great so far, but my only concern is that the resulting code, which is ugly by itself, is made worse by the fact that it's not indented. I'm too lazy to get the indentation right in the string generation function, so I'm wondering if there is a Python util function to indent the content of a multi-line string?
Why not pipe the output through a command-line code formatter such as astyle?
You can indent the lines in a string by just padding each one with proper number of pad characters. This can easily be done by using the textwrap.indent() function which was added to the module in Python 3.3. Alternatively you could use the code below which will also work in earlier Python versions.Result:
If you have a leading newline:Heredocs can contain a literal newline, or you can prepend one.Here is it shown in pprint dump:>>> pprint(indented)'    Hello\n    World\n    'Awkward, but worksIf you do not have a leading newline:Optional, trim first newline and trailing spaces/tabs
There is a script located in the python Tools/Scripts/ directory which is primarily for fixing the indentation of entire python files.  However, you can easily tweak the script a little and apply it to sections/lines of code, or other types of files.The script is also located online, here:http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Tools/scripts/reindent.pyOr, as a module here:http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Reindent/0.1.0
