Natural Text
How do you tell Python where to save a text file?For example, my computer is running the Python file off my desktop. I want it to save all the text file in my documents folder, not on my desktop. How do I do that in a script like this?
Just use an absolute path when opening the filehandle for writing.You could optionally combine this with os.path.abspath() as described in Bryan's answer to automatically get the path of a user's Documents folder. Cheers!
Use os.path.join to combine the path to the Documents directory with the completeName (filename?) supplied by the user.If you want the Documents directory to be relative to the user's home directory, you could use something like:Others have proposed using os.path.abspath. Note that os.path.abspath does not resolve '~' to the user's home directory:
A small update to this. raw_input() is renamed as input() in Python 3. Python 3 release note
Another simple way without using import OS is,
Using an absolute or relative string as the filename.
