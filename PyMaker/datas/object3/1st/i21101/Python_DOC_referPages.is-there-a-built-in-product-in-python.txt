This question already has an answer here:What's the function like sum() but for multiplication? product()?                    8 answers                I've been looking through a tutorial and book but I can find no mention of a built in product function i.e. of the same type as sum(), but I could not find anything such as prod().Is the only way I could find the product of items in a list by importing the mul() operator?
PronouncementYes, that's right.  Guido rejected the idea for a built-in prod() function because he thought it was rarely needed.Python 3.8 UpdateIn Python 3.8, prod() was added to the math module:Alternative with reduce()As you suggested, it is not hard to make your own using reduce() and operator.mul():In Python 3, the reduce() function was moved to the functools module, so you would need to add:Specific case: FactorialsAs a side note, the primary motivating use case for prod() is to compute factorials.  We already have support for that in the math module:Alternative with logarithmsIf your data consists of floats, you can compute a product using sum() with exponents and logarithms:
There is no product in Python, but you can define it asOr, if you have NumPy, use numpy.product.
Since the reduce() function has been moved to the module functools python 3.0, you have to take a different approach.You can use functools.reduce() to access the function:Or, if you want to follow the spirit of the python-team (which removed reduce() because they think for would be more readable), do it with a loop:
numpy has many really cool functions for lists!
