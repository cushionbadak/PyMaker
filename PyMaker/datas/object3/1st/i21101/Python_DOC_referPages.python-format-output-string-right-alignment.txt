Natural Text
I am processing a text file containing coordinates x, y, zevery line is delimited into 3 items usingAfter processing data I need to write coordinates back in another txt file so as items in each column are aligned right (as well as the input file). Every line is composed of the coordinatesIs there any manipulator like std::setw() etc. in C++ allowing to set the width and alignment?
Try this approach using the newer str.format syntax:And here's how to do it using the old % syntax (useful for older versions of Python that don't support str.format):
You can align it like that:where > means "align to right" and 8 is the width for specific value.And here is a proof:Ps. *line means the line list will be unpacked, so .format(*line) works similarly to .format(line[0], line[1], line[2]) (assuming line is a list with only three elements).
It can be achieved by using rjust: 
I really enjoy a new literal string interpolation in Python 3.6+:Reference: PEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation
Simple tabulation of the output:output:%10.2f: 10 is the minimum length and 2 is the number of decimal places.
Here is another way how you can format using 'f-string' format:This will provide the following output:What you are doing here is you are saying that the first column is 15 chars long and it's left justified and second column (values) is 10 chars long and it's right justified.
