I'm trying to use the multiprocessing module in Python 3.  However, everytime I try to set up a Pool, I get the following traceback.The simplest code that can easily trigger this is the first example in the multiprocessing module documentation.(source: https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html)My question: Is this a bug in Python 3.4?  Or am I doing something wrong?  The equivalent code works in Python 2.7.
You have a local module named queue; it interferes with the standard library module.Remove it or rename it and your code will work again:If you have trouble locating it, run python3 -c 'import queue; print(queue.__file__)'.
