In the function main I havepython complains:  local variable 'date' referenced before assignment, which is expected. In other parts of main() I pay attention not to assign but to modify, thus I have for example which python is happy about (it woudn't be if I set e.g. a_cats = a_cats.clear() ).Is there a way to modify  a datetime object without explicitly using "=", so that I can avoid using global variables ?
If you're using Python 3.x, you can declare the variable as nonlocal:
datetime object is immutable. The only way to change date is to bind it to a new datetime object.To assign to outer-scope variable, you could use nonlocal in Python 3 as @falsetru suggested or emulate it using a list or a custom object in Python 2:See What limitations have closures in Python compared to language X closures?
