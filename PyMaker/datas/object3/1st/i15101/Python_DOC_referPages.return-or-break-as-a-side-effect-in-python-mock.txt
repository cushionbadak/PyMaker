I have a multiprocessing application that has workers running in "while True" loops.  For testing, I'd like to be able to mock sys.exit() in a way like this:orSo I can break out of the loop and complete my test.  Neither of these work, but is there a different way to do what I'm trying to accomplish?
You can use an Exception as side_effect to simulate sys.exit behavior without exit from your test.side_effect documentation say:This can either be a function to be called when the mock is called, an iterable or an exception (class or instance) to be raised.So you can not use a statement like break or return but what you want to do is exit from your run cycle and that can be obtained by raise an Exception ... I hope you don't use a wild try-except in your thread's main cycle.I wrote a simple example to test it, I used decorator patch syntax and put inline side_effect=Exception that make the test more readable:
