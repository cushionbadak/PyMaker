How can I make multiple inequalities in python? for example.
school_type != "h" or school_type != "m" will always evaluate to True because school_type will always be either not equal to "h" or not equal to "m".  You should be using and in your while-loop condtion instead of or:That, or you could use not in:
As @iCodez just said, you want to iterate again if the school_type is something different from "h", and something different from "m" and something different from "e". And as he said, this is better expressed with something like school_type not in ["h", "m", "e"]. That expression is simpler, easier to read and less error-prone.After you change the while's condition, there are still two things that I'd fix in your code. First, if the condition is true, that is, the user typed a wrong value for school_type, a proper action should be taken: The user must be asked to type a new value, until he/she types a correct one. Second, you should use raw_input() instead of input(). The difference is the first one is better suited for strings, while the second one is problematic, and in this cases actually requires the user to type the " around the input value.The resulting could be something like this:
