Natural Text
I have recently been creating a guessing game for my co - workers as a project to learning Python 3.3x. I have been storing the results in a text file formatted with the name and score, separated by a colon, as shown...The text file is read with the following code, thanks to Padraic Cunningham. The issue now is, is that I want to see Dave, Adam and Jack's most recent four scores. One way that I thought about this is to somehow read the list above and reverse it, so that it would see the most recent results first. I thought I could first inverse the dictionary, using the line of code below:But that does not work, as it returns the error:As I want to store the 4 most recent results, then I would need to make sure that the oldest result is deleted every time a new result arrives, and updates the dictionary. How would I be able to make sure that only 4 maximum values are assigned to each key? Could that be done by inversing the dictionary? I have tried to see if other questions follow the same principle, but I have not found anything as such. NOTE I have seen the itemgetter method, but I have MORE than one value for each key.  The text file would appear like this:
You COULD use a defaultdict with deque(maxlen=4) to handle that.However you're probably better off just creating this data structure to begin with and pickling the object.
