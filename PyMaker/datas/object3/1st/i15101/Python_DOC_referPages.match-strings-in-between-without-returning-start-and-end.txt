You must be doing .group(0), which returns the entire match.  You should be accessing capture group 1 instead.  This will return only the text matched by (.*?):Below is an excerpt from the documentation:match.group([group1, ...])Returns one or more subgroups of the match...If a  groupN argument is zero, the corresponding return value is the entire  matching string; if it is in the inclusive range [1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group.
