I'd like to count the uniqueness of my variable names in all the python code I've written. To do so, I need to strip out all the keywords and reserved words (which are known), the comments and the strings. For example, the following code:should be stripped to the tokens of for, x, in, range, y, foo, print, q which can be further parsed using a known set of keywords. Is this possible using the python engine itself (maybe with the ast module)?
This is my first time playing with the ast module, but it was relatively easy to collect all the object names referenced in a source:Where x.py was:Output:Note that keywords aren't included already, but it does pick up the function name range.
If you're more concerned with getting the list of variables rather than how to strip out all strings, comments, etc., you could try something like:to print anything that shows up in either the local dictionary or global dictionary. Use dir(myobject) to get the variables for myobject.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
