How would I go about killing a process on Windows?I am starting the process withI have triedErrorsI cannot use .join.
On windows, os.killpg will not work because it sends a signal to the process ID to terminate. This is now how you kill a process on Windows, instead you have to use the win32 API's TerminateProcess to kill a process.So, you can kill a process by the following on windows:If the above does not work, then try signal.CTRL_BREAK_EVENT instead.
You should provide a minimal, working example of the problem you are having.  As show below, this minimal, working example correctly terminates the process (Tested on Python 2.7.5 64-bit), so the error you are seeing lies in code you haven't shown.Output:
I had to do it using this method from this link:This is because self._active_process.kill() was not adequate
Works. I am unsure why -1 returns a access denied error but -9 does not.
