Natural Text
I have a series of entries in a text file like this:I want to make a function that will periodically read each line in the file and do something depending on whether the entry is less than 2 days old, more than 2 days old, or more than 7 days old.I'm not sure how to get the code to understand the sttime timestamp in the file though. My code (so far) is as follows:That retrieves the timestamps ok, but how to read them and interpret them as times I have no idea :/(This will end up in an if loop eventually that does the function described above, but first I just need to know how to read those times...)
This will give you a datetime object which you can compare against other datetime objects:linets = datetime.strptime('%Y%m%d_%H:%M:%s', line.strip()[:17])Oops! Mark got those arguments the wrong way around. It should betest
