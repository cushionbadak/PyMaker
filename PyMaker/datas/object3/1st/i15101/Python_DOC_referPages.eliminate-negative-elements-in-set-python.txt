What would I need to write inside the X set in order to eliminate -2 from X1? Something that would work like this: X = set([x for only x<0])
You can use a set comprehension:This produces a new set by looping over X1 and including all values that are 0 or greater:See the Python tutorial on sets for a pointer on set comprehensions, which are closely related to list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.
