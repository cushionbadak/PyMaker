can anyone is help me with that:I need to find all words from list containing letters [t OR d] AND [k OR c] but not any of [s,z,n,m]I figured out first part, but don't know how to include stop list:in Python notationThank you in advance
Based on answer of PadraicEDIT We both missed this condition [t OR d] AND [k OR c]So - fixed accordinglyAnd the result is
You can use 2 steps. First find t|d AND k|c, then filter out matches with  unwanted letters.Since you said you figured out first part, here is the second:
If you need the t or d appearing before k or c, use : [^sznm\s\d]*[td][^sznm\s\d]*[kc][^sznm\s\d]*.[^sznm\s\d] means any character except z, n, m, s, whitespace characters (\s) or numbers (\d).
Or using a list comp with set.intersection:
Use this code:
You need to use lookarounds.ie, 
I really like the answer by @padraic-cunningham that does not make use of re, but here is a pattern, which will work:Positive (?=...) and negative (?!...) lookahead assertions are well documented on python.org.
