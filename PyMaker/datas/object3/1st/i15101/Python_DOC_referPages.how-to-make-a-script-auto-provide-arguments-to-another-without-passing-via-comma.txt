The best way to explain my question is with the help of an example.Consider a Python Script that asks a question and gives an answer depending on the question.The above Script would normally prompt the User for an Input, BUT I'd also like it to be called by a Batch Script which will provide the input to the called Python Script.I'll hardcode these inputs in the Batch File itself (as seen below).Is there any way to achieve this (make the Python Script aware of ans) without modifying the Python Script itself to handle optional command line arguments ?I'd prefer the Batch Script to run as if it were the user giving inputs to the script from an array of variables.
Variables set in .bat, .cmd, should show up as environment variables.Python can read environment variables passed in via the os.environthus you could write:or even do a function:
I suppose that echo 'Yes' | python QandA.py would work. You can add several answers in a fixed sequence, separated by newlines:For longer scenarios when you e.g. have to react to changing prompts, you can use expect.
Piping in a single answer is trivial:But piping in multiple answers is tricky. The following is broken because the batch parser inserts an extra space before each & and )The easiest way to provide multiple answers without extra space is to delay the appearance of the & so the initial parsing pass that prepares the pipe sees only a single ECHO on the left side
