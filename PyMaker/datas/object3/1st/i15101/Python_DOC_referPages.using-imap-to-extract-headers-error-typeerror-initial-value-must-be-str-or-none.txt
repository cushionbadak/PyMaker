Here is my code that connects to gmail and parses the emails:At this stage i get the error message "TypeError: initial_value must be str or None, not bytes"Im using python 3. How do i convert the result to a string so ican parse the headers using parser.parsestr?
Replace with That should make it work on Python 3.x.xThis is one of the pain points of migrating code to make it Python 3, but once you understand it, it is very easy to fix. Also, if you make that change, it will break compatibility with python 2.x.xIn python 3 all strings are unicode, and if you receive bytes, you have to first convert them to str data type. You can read more about that here
