How can I use functions that return multiple values as inputs to a format string, without getting the TypeError: not enough arguments for format string error?Expected output: "1,2,3"
Element indexstring.format() is more powerful and lets you access list elements or even attributes:Concatenate tupleThe problem with foo(), 3 is that it's a tuple and an integer, two different types. Instead you can create a 3-tuple via concatenation. If you use string.format() it's a bit trickier, as you need to unpack it first using the * operator so you can use it as arguments:Temporary variablesOf course, you can always do it this way, which is obvious but verbose:
The reason print "%d,%d,%d" % foo(), 3 is not working is because Python is thinking you're trying to print two items here: "%d,%d,%d" % foo() and then 3. Due to this the first expression clearly fails because of in-sufficient number of items:In fact even something like "%d,%d,%d" % foo() + (3,) won't work because I guess operator precedence comes into play here:A working version will be:
A general solution to take an arbitrary number of arguments and print them with some delimiter would be to use str.joinAnother example
