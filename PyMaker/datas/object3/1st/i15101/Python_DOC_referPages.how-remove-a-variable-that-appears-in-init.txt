If i have this:I want to use One but altering the name name and relace it by otherThe solution I supposed is inheriting:The idea is : How to delete or change the variable names that appears in __init__ ?
You can't do what you want, not if you are calling One.__init__ from Two.__init__.If you want to alter what attributes are set, simply don't call One.__init__() here. Set your own attributes instead:Now self.name will never be set. This most likely will break the rest of functionality in One, something you probably don't want to do. The rest of the methods in that class are likely to rely on certain attributes having been set.In OOP terms, if Two is not a special kind of One object, don't inherit from One. If Two is a kind of One object, don't try to make it into something else.
There is no relation at all between the name of the parameter passed to __init__ and the name of the instance variable that might eventuality be initialized by that argument. This is only a matter of convention than both are called the same.Both code fragments below will perform exactly the same:As about renaming an instance variable, you might do something like that, but this is (very) bad style and has (great) chances to break something in (the base class and/or in any client code that expects a proper One instance):
