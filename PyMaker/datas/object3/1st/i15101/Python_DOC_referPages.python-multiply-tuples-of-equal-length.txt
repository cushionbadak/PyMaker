I was hoping for an elegant or effective way to multiply sequences of integers (or floats).My first thought was to try (1, 2, 3) * (1, 2, 2) would result (1, 4, 6), the products of the individual multiplications.Though python isn't preset to do that for sequences. Which is fine, I wouldn't really expect it to. So what's the pythonic way to multiply (or possibly other arithmetic operations as well) each item in two series with and to their respective indices?A second example (0.6, 3.5) * (4, 4) = (2.4, 14)
The simplest way is to use zip function, with a generator expression, like thisFor example,In Python 2.x, zip returns a list of tuples. If you want to avoid creating the temporary list, you can use itertools.izip, like thisYou can read more about the differences between zip and itertools.izip in this question.
If you are interested in element-wise multiplication, you'll probably find that many other element-wise mathematical operations are also useful.  If that is the case, consider using the numpy library.For example:
A simpler way would be:
With list comprehensions the operation could be completed like
use itertools.izip instead of zip for larger inputs.
