Use the builtin csv module. This is assuming you want it in a key,value1,value2,... format.
Assuming the numeric keys are line numbers, try something like this:You'll want to look at Python's string API, list handling, and file handling to get more familiar with Python...
Using Python's csv module would make doing this super simple:Note the iteritems() dictionary method is gone in Python 3, so you'd need to use d.items() instead.
