I am very new to Python and i am trying to get this code to read a .plist file from a iPhone backup however it keeps coming up with unexpected character after line continuing character. I am using python 3.4 and running it on Windows 7. Any advise would be much appreciated  
Python includes a standard library for reading .plist files: https://docs.python.org/3/library/plistlib.html. Does this suffice?
