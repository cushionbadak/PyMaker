I can't install Django, I read that pip is included in python 3.4, but when I write following command:pip install djangothis error appears:SyntaxError: invalid syntax.What I should do? Am I missing something? I'm using Python 3.4.2
From the SyntaxError: invalid syntax it looks like you're typing it in at the python interpreter (the >>>). pip install django needs to be run from a terminal.pip is installed when you install python but it is a program in its own right not a python package/module. Docs are here
Since Python 3.4, pip installer is included by default with the Python binary installers.Read the docs:pip included with PythonInstalling Python Modulesor (on Debian/Ubuntu)
I recommend using virtualenv for you django project, which includes pip. You can install virtualenv by:Then cd to a folder you want to create a django project:then simply runYou should be able to pip install django from there
