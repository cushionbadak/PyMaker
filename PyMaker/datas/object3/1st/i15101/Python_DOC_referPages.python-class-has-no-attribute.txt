I'm new to Python and I'm learning about classes and functions and I want to print a class's function but all i get is the error "Class has no attribute"items.py:main.py:The error is
Gold is not an attribute on the Item class, no. It is a subclass, and a global name in its own right. You can import it from your items module:You cannot create an instance of it, because used the wrong name for the Item.__init__ method:Note that the method you created has three underscores in the name. If you fix that:you can create instances of the Gold() class:Now, if you really wanted to create attributes on the Item class, you'll have to add those after you created the class:You don't need to create subclasses for that. You could use the enum module here though:Here Gold is an attribute of Item:
Here's what you're doing wrong:Gold is a subclass of Item, not an attribute of it. Your error is popping up when you try to do Item.Gold. Gold is accessed entirely separately.You need to instantiate your classes into objects. Once you instantiate an object, you can call your methods on it and access its attributes. Each object stores methods and attributes independently, so one gold coin can have a different name, description, value, or even print its info differently.When trying to access a parent class from within a subclass, you just reference the class name directly rather than using super().You have an extra underscore in your Item class's __init__()So with that in mind, your new main.py should look like this:And your items.py will look like this:
You can call functions that are in Item from the Gold class but not the other way around. So your main should be:Please note that if you don't end functions with (), then you'll just get the string representation of the function. But if you do that in your current code it wouldn't work unless you create the object first and then call print_info().
