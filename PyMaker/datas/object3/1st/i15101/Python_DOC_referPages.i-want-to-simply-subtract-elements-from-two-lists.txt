I have two open lists. First Weight (fWeight) and Second Weight (sWeight). I want to subtract the fWeight from sWeight. I am getting this error:Is there a a simple solution for this?
The substraction operator is not defined for list, as it makes no sense in a general way. However, you can simply get the single items using the [] operator, and calculate the difference in a new list:
If you need to subtract every item from one list to the corresponding item of a second list of same size, the easiest way (and probably the most idiomatic way) is to use a list comprehension and the zip function:Here is a simple example:Please note that for space efficiency reason, in Python 2, you might prefer using itertools.izip instead of a plain zip.
I would do:In case that you work with Python 3, use range instead of xrange
