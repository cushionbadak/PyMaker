Trying to write to a file with variables, but that is returning error:
The .format method expects you to template the blanks to be filled in your string with the {}-style, not %s. It also expects the interpolated values to be given as its arguments.
The given string literal is printf-style string. Use str % arg:To use str.format, you should use placeholder {} or {0} instead of %s.
The Errormyfile.write(template.format()) returns nothing to which you are using % operator to concatenateMinimal EditYou can perfectly use %s .The problem is you mismatched parenthesis and the parenthesis i.e. ) should be after your variable as in myfile.write(template.format() % (variable)). But as template.format() is redundant, it can be ignored. Thus the correct way isNote:- Any string with an empty format() and no {} in the string returns the string itself
