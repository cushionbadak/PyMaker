i need to create a new directory in my Python program, each time it is executed. For example, if it is executed the first time, the directory C:\Users\person\Desktop\Test_1 is createdIf it is executed for the second time, the directoryC:\Users\person\Desktop\Test_2 is createdand so on. How can this be achieved?
Find all directories starting with Test_, find the one with the highest number, add 1 and create a new directory.
First and most simple way is just parse dir structure, get the last number of index and and than create new directory with new index.If you are not familiar with creating directories, this topic will be useful for you: How to check if a directory exists and create it if necessary?Also os.path is your best friend here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#module-os.path
