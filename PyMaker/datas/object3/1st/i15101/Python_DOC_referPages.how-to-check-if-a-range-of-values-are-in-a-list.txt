I have a list with two integers which can change randomly. I want to check if any of these integers are over 21.So for example if I wanted to find a specific integer I would say:However, how would I change this to a range of values instead of a specific integer.
Since you only have two numbers, simple conditional operators will suffice:Otherwise, if you have more numbers, you can use any and a generator expression:
You can try it this way (using any):The integers can be an iterable of any length, say [2,3,1,6,7]. It'll check them one at a time to verify if it satisfies the condition that i > max(score). The first one that does will short-circuit the result to True. The code inside the condition then executes successfully.
You might look into using a Set. 
You could use range:If your list is not ordered, you have to add s.sort() before proceeding with the use of range
