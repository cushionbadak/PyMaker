This line:assigns a new tuple object to the name pt1 (see the docs, the tutorial). Tuples do not, by default, have an x or y attribute. You either need to access the first and second items in the tuple by index:or to create a collections.namedtuple, which allows you to define attributes:That being said, as i and j are still in scope, the easiest thing to do would be simply:and even if they weren't still in scope you could unpack pt1 (whether tuple or namedtuple), and use the separate x and y:
Because pt1 is a tuple and doesn't have x or y attributes . You probably want:
You are trying to access an x attribute in pt1, but pt1 is a tuple and tuple have no x attribute. You could eitherWrite a Custom Point classUse a named tupleThe second solution could look like the following:
You can't access plain tuples like that, you need to change toHowever, Python does have a namedtuple which can be accessed via attributes; there's even a Point namedtuple example in the docs.Here's a small example derived from the docs I linked to:output
