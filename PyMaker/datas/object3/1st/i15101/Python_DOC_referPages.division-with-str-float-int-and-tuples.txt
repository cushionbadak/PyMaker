Basically, I want to be able to divide int, str, tuple, and float in half. I'm having trouble with distinguishing the type of an input and then returning the same type.For example, half(7) should return 3 (not 3.0!), half(9.0) should return 4.5, half("seventeen") should return "seve", and half((1,2,3,4,5,6,7)) should return (1,2,3).  I have tried this code without success:
First of all you need to check types. Secondly, this code assumes you're using Python 2.
Just use functools.singledispatch, which chooses the implementation based on the type of the first argument:You can shorten this to passing lambdas to half.register instead of using decorators and function statements if you prefer so:

You can use a dict with type as key and lambda as value using // for ints and / for floats and simply indexing for str and tuple len(x)//2.
