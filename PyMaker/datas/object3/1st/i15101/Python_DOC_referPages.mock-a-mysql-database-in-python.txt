I use Python 3.4 from the Anaconda distribution. Within this distribution, I found the pymysql library to connect to an existing MySQL database, which is located on another computer.I now want to write test code for my application, in which I want to create a very small database at the setUp of every test case, preferably in memory. However, when I try this out of the blue with pymysql, it cannot make a connection.I have been googling around, and found some things about SQLite and MySQLdb. I have the following questions:Is sqlite3 or MySQLdb suitable for creating quickly a database in memory?How do I install MySQLdb within the Anaconda package?Is there an example of a test database, created in the setUp? Is this even a good idea?I do not have a MySQL server running locally on my computer.
Both pymysql, MySQLdb, and sqlite will want a real database to connect too. If you want just to test your code, you should just mock the pymysql module on the module you want to test, and use it accordingly(in your test code: you can setup the mock object to return hardcoded results to predefined SQL statements) Check the documentation on native Python mocking library at:https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.htmlOr, for Python 2:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock
