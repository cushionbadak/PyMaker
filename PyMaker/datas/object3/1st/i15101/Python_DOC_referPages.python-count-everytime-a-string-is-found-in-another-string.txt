Natural Text
I'm trying to enumerate the time the program finds a specific string in a longer text but I'm stuck, the program shows the length of the response string instead of the times ultrias is present in response. Here's the code:
Python strings have a built-in str.count() method that can do that:outputIf you aren't permitted to use the str.count() method, you could do something like this:But I wouldn't recommend it.Neither of these algorithms handle overlapping matches, but the second example can be easily modified to do that:
Others have answered with a few different ways to achieve your requirement, however, none explained why the output of your code is the length of the input string.for loops have a loop variable that is assigned values from the object that is being iterated over. In the case of the object being a string, the for loop will iterate in order over each character in the string, assigning the character to the loop variable  e.g.So you can see that i is assigned in turn a character from the string "Hi there". The same thing is happening in your code: ultrias is the loop variable and is being assigned consecutive characters from the string "Hi i am 17, did you know I am 17".The output will be:Also note that the value of ultrias after the loop has terminated is the last value assigned it by the loop - not "am 17" but "7".
You can use str.count:
Use string.count(string) to get what you need.
Through re module.
