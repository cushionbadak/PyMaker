I'm using Python3, but the script is not compatible with this version and I hit some errors. Now I have problem with cmp parameter. Here is the codeI would really appreciate any help how to deal with this error in Python3.
You should try to rewrite your cmp function to a key function instead. In this case it looks like you can simply return the counter() function output for just one element:I took the liberty of replacing the reduce(...) code with the sum() function, a far more compact and readable method to sum a series of integers.The above too will first sort by the output of counter(), and by the length of each sorted element in case of a tie.The counter function is hugely inefficient however; I'd use a Counter() class here instead:This function will work in both Python 2 and 3:If you cannot, you can use the cmp_to_key() utility function to adapt your cmp argument, but take into account this is not an ideal solution (it affects performance).
