I am following a tutorial to add 'Search Function' in my project. However the tutorial is based on Python2x & Django 1.7 while I am using Python 3.4 & Django 1.7. The search code uses bing_search along with urllib2. However urllib2 is not supported in Python 3 and the same has been distributed in several subsequent modules. Some how I have managed to get my code compatible with Python 3. However now I am having the following error when I submit the search query. Here is my code for your review:Please guide me what should I do now. Thank you in advance....! PS: I've seen some of similar posts but I could not workout the problem. 
You'll need to decode the response before passing it to the json module:The server is meant to provide you with a charset=... parameter in theContent-Type header, which the message.get_param() method above would retrieve for you. If the parameter is absent, the code falls back to UTF-8, the default encoding for JSON as per the RFC.
