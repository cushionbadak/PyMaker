What I'd like to accomplish is to set testobj.alpha to .5 in the example below:As the comment says, in the for loop, a new class member called i is created, rather than setting the existing alpha member to .5  
Use setattr to set attributes dynamically:or update the internal attribute dictionary directly (vars will serve as a proxy for the __dict__ attribute):The latter approach will fail if an object doesn't have the __dict__ attribute (e.g. it was defined with the __slots__ attribute).
