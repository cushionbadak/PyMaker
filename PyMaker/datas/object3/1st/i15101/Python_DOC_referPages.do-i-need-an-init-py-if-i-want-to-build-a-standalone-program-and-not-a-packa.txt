I am working on a standalone Python-GUI-program. When I runI get the following warning:Is this warning only meant for packages or should a standalone Python program also have an __init__.py instead of something like main-window.py or my-first-program.py?Should I rename my main file (in my case Ã¬bk-st.py to __init__.py) or would it be good to retain a certain structure in the __init__.py (i.e. make a separate file that calls the ibk-st.py file)Link to project:https://github.com/tobias47n9e/innsbruck-stereographic
You should rename the ibk-st into a valid package identifier for python (ibk_st maybe); then ibk-st.py into something like main_ui.py; then have an __init__.py for that whole package (alternatively you can rename ibk-st.py to __init__.py). Do note that setup.py can install command line scripts; you can provide a thin wrapper as file bin/ibk-st-ui with contentsThe module installation will ensure that the script is runnable on whatever platform the user is using.Then in your setup.py you should haveNow when you run the setup.py install or install the package, the modules can be embedded into other programs and the command ibk-st-ui will be installed in the the bin folder (be it the bin of a virtualenv or the system /usr/local/bin), that can run the UI.
