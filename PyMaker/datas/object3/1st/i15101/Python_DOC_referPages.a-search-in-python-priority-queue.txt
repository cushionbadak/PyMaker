I am trying to write an A* search to solve a maze in Python, however I am struggling to find a built in priority queue that works for this. I am using PriorityQueue at the moment, but it offers no functionality in order to change an items priority, which is a problem in the commented section at the bottom of the algorithm (in the else if statement).Does anyone have any idea what I could do in that else if block, or what built in priority queue would give me this functionality?
The closest you will find in the built-in libraries is heapq.After changing the priority you need to call either heapq.heapify (costs O(n) time but will not change A* overall complexity) or use the internal heapq._siftdown function at O(log n) time.
