I'm trying to  print the lines present in the  url file however,I'm getting an error that says:Below posted is my code
If you want to write the bytes from the url as is (no decoding/encoding):It expects that the character encoding used by response is the same character encoding your terminal uses otherwise you'll see mojibake. See A good way to get the charset/encoding of an HTTP response in Python.Your code in the question contains multiple errors e.g.:wrong indentationit tries to use a str object as a context manager that leads to AttributeError (__exit__ method is not defined) because str object does not implement the context manager protocolfor line in ins is misleading: iterating over a string yields characters, not lines.
