I'm using Python 3 to get the response from Instagram API using the code belowthe xRequest method gets the response from the Instagram API URL, when I print the object it looks like a legit JSON object but when I do the json.load method on it I get the following error AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'read'The same code works on Python 2 , I tried to search for it Python docs for Python3 but no luck. Can anyone help me out with this?Thanks a lot !
If the instagramJSON is a str then you should use json.loads instead of json.load. If instagramJSON is a string then it would have raised the same exception in Python 2 so there may be more going on.Python JSON documentationIf it is a response generated by urllib.request then the top answer to this question may be relevant.
