Here's my code: Any help would be appreciated. Stuck on returning an error 'int' is not iterable and not sure where to go from there. Receiving error when running first part of my function at #minimum.
There is no method named get_stats. Call stats instead.By the way, your code is totally wrong in terms of both indentation and logic. I'd recommend you to use max and min functions to get the maximum and minimum values in the list.
Python has a lot of baked-in functions and modules for doing common operations, i.e. basic stats (max, min, mean, median) via the statistics module.
