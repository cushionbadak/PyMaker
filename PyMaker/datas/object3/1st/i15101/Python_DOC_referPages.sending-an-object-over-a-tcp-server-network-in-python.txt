I am currently working on a small project experimenting with different regions of python. I decided to make a multi-client TCP server in python, and wanted to be able to send a "packet" through the server, it be received by the other clients then parsed. However, I get an error if I try to send the packet, saying I must send either bytes or a string, is there a way to convert the object into bytes, then back or send the packet object through the server itself.## EDIT ##I have researched into UDP servers, and I do not believe that is what I am looking for, I probably provided too little information. I am creating a small trial game, for me and some friends to mess about on, I need there to be a constant connection to the server, as information is going to be constantly being sent across the network such as location,direction,speech,inventory etc. and I wanted a way to turn the entire Entity class into a byte array then send that and it be turned back into an instance of the Entity class when it was received. 
You could use pickle to serialize/deserialize objects to strings and back. https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html
The simplest possible approach would be to send (gzipped?) JSON'd or msgpack'd objects.For example, using UDP, this could look something like the below code; note that you would want to reuse the socket object rather than instantiating a new one every time.
