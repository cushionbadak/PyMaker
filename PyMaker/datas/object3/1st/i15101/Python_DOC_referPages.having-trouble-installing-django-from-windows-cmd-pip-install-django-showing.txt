My macbook got stolen so now I'm trying re-install Django using Windows (7) cmd.I did some research here in StackOverflow and couldn't find an answer that's working.Used this question as a reference and set PATH using setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python34\Scripts": 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external commandI'm now in C:\Python34 in the cmd and it's resulting in same "not recognized as an internal or external command" error. When I try: C:\Python34\Scripts> pip install django it results in an 'Exception" error: Storing debug log for failure in C:\Users\myname\pip\pip.logI'm not sure what's going and I was wondering if there was a simpler way to approach the issue, since I'm very new to programming.Thanks!EDIT:
Best way to install python is to install a virtual environment per project. That way you will no longer have path issues. Note I have installed the 64 bit version of Python34 and the default directory is C:\Python34\
Use and elevated Cmd Prompt and then py -3.4 -m ensurepip -U --default-pip to instal pip.   After that use py -3.4 -m pip install Django==1.8.3
