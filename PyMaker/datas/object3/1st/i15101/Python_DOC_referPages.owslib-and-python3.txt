I've got following problem:Installed libs:I'll be gratefull for any ideas how to solve it.
dict.iteritems was only around in Python 2.x, back when dict.items returned a list.  In Python 3.x however, dict.items was changed to return a view object and so dict.iteritems was removed since it was no longer necessary.This means that the version of OWSLib that you are using was made for Python 2.x and is therefore incompatible with Python 3.x.  You need to either use Python 2.x or install a version of OWSLib that can use Python 3.x.
