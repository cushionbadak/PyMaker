I have a file And I want to have one number per TLD like:and here is my code:But I get this error:Can anybody help?
To answer the title of your question: "how to sum values for the same key" - well, there is the builtin class called collections.Counter that is a perfect match for you:then to write back:
Taking a look at the full traceback:The error is telling us that we tried to add something of type NoneType to something of type str, which isn't allowed in Python.There's only one object of type NoneType, which, unsurprisingly, is None – so we know that we tried to add a string to None.The two things we tried to add together in that line were d.get(TLD) and count, and looking at the documentation for dict.get(), we see that what it does isReturn the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.Since we didn't supply a default, d.get(TLD) returned None when it didn't find TLD in the dictionary, and we got the error attempting to add count to it. So, let's supply a default of 0 and see what happens:Well, we've still got an error, but now the problem is that we're trying to add a string to an integer, which is also not allowed, because it would be ambiguous.That's happening because line.split('|') returns a list of strings – so we need to explicitly convert count to an integer:... and now it works:Turning that dictionary back into the file output you want is a separate issue (and not attempted by your code), so I'll leave you to work on that.
