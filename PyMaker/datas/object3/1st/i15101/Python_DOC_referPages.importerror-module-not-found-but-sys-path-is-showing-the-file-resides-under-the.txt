When I print sys.path in my code I get the following as output:['C:\Netra_Step_2015\Tests\SVTestcases', 'C:\Netra_Step_2015\Tests\SVTestcases\TC-Regression', 'C:\Python27\python27.zip', 'C:\Python27\DLLs', 'C:\Python27\lib', etc.]Now, when I write "import testCaseBase as TCB" where testcaseBase.py is in this path: C:\Netra_Step_2015\Tests\SVTestcases\Common\shared I get an error: "ImportError: No module named testCaseBase"My code is in C:\Netra_Step_2015\Tests\SVTestcases\TC-Regression\regression.py. My code goes ahead with compilation, but testcaseBase.py which is residing in a parallel directory fails to compile. What might be the reason? 
Perhaps I'm missing something, but this file path......isn't in your sys.path, so it's not surprising you got an error. You have several options though. Changing your project structure or, if Common and shared are actual packages with __init__.py defined inside of them, do:You can also just append the path in your calling script, so:Or, actually just add the following path to your ENV variable (PYTHONPATH)But it's not necessarily a good habit to substitute good directory structure and importing techniques with editing your PYTHONPATH each time. You'll be much better off if you resolve this another way.
putC:\Netra_Step_2015\Tests\SVTestcases\Common\sharedin your PYTHONPATH env
Please dont use ~/ in the path . it does not work. Use the full path.
