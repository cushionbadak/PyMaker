I tried to write a code that can distinguish the following four different errors.TypeError: The first parameter is not an integer;TypeError: The second parameter is not a string;ValueError: The value of the first parameter is not in the range of 1 to 13; orValueError: The value of the second parameter is not one of the strings in the set {'s', 'h', 'c', 'd'}.However, I only can get the first one to work but not the other three errors. I tried different ways to make it work, but still can't figure out what's wrong.I know maybe it is due to that I have same TypeError and ValueError. Therefore, Python can't distinguish the second TypeError which I hit c1 = Card(13,13) is different from the first TypeError. So, I only get the message that "The first parameter is not an integer" when I have c1 = Card(13,13).
You are trying to distinguish between the error sources in completely the wrong place. By the time the error gets out of Card.__init__, there is no way to tell why e.g. a TypeError was thrown. For each error class (TypeError, ValueError) only the first except will ever be triggered:Instead, you should provide the specific error messages inside Card.__init__, when you actually raise the error and already know what the reason is:Then you can handle them much more simply:If you have a particular need to distinguish between different errors of the same class, you can either explicitly check the message:or create your own, more specific Exception sub-classes, so you can have separate except blocks:(this is just an example, they are too specific in your particular case).It's probably worth having a read through the documentation on exceptions and the tutorial on using them.
