Is there an until statement or loop in python? This does not work:
The equivalent is a while x1 != x2 loop.Thus, your code becomes:
This will run until x == 0
You don't really need to count how many times you're looping unless you're doing something with that variable.  Instead, you can use a for loop that will fire up to 10 times instead:As an aside, don't use list as a variable name, as that masks the actual list method.
Python emulates until loops with the iter(iterable, sentinel) idiom:I was forced to construct a trivial lambda for demonstration purposes; here a simple range() would suffice, as as @Makoto suggested.
