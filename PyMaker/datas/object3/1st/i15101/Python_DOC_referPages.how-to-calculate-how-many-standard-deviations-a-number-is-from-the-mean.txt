I have a matrix of size (61964, 25). Here is a sample:Scikit-learn provides a useful function provided that our data are normally distributed:My problem, however, is that I have to work on a row basis - which does not consist of 25 observations only - and so the normal distribution is not applicable here. The solution is to use t-distribution but how can I do that in Python?Normally, values go from 0 to, say, 20. When I see unusually high numbers, I filter out the whole row. The following histogram shows what my actual distribution looks like: 
scipy.stats has the function zscore which allows you to calculate how many standard deviations a value is above the mean (often refered to as the standard score or Z score).If arr is the example array from your question, then you can compute the Z score across each row of 25 as follows:This calculation uses the population mean and standard deviation for each row. To use the sample variance instead (as with the t-statistic), additionally specify ddof=1:
