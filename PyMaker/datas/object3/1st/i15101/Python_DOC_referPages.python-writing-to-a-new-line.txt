Natural Text
I have looked at the many other threads on this topic, but I cannot seem to find the right code that appends the new line at the end of the file.Here is my code :However, the only thing that seems to output in the Score.txt file is {},{},{}.My intended output is that each time I run this program, it will output the new data onto a new line, without overwriting the line above it.
"{},{},{}"+"\n".format(Name, Date, Score)You are calling the format method on string "\n".Try "{},{},{}\n".format(Name, Date, Score)
When you do:Python interprets it as:because the method invocation  .format(...) has a tighter binding than the + operator.  Meaning, it applies to just the string "\n" and not the combined string "{},{},{}"+"\n".Moreover, calling the str.format method on the string "\n" is effectively a no-op:So, the string that is written to the file is just "{},{},{}"+"\n" or "{},{},{}\n".To fix the problem, simply include the newline in the format string:
You are currently formatting the \nto format the whole string you need to tell that's the \n is a part of your string.
It's formatting the \n (new line) string and then adding the braces.  Try this.
Just use brackets:Or, maybe better:Then the .format will be applied to the whole string.
Try the code below:Take a look at this documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples to see format examples.Also you forget to use "\n" on each value.Regards,
