I'm new to Python, and confused by the date/time documentation.  I want to compute the time that it takes to perform a computation.In java, I would write:I'm sure it's even easier in Python. Can anyone help?
Equivalent in python would be:It's not clear what are you trying to do that for? Are you trying to find the best performing method? Then you should prob have a look at timeit.
Building on and updating a number of earlier responses (thanks: SilentGhost, nosklo, Ramkumar) a simple portable timer would use timeit's default_timer(): This will return the elapsed wall clock (real) time, not CPU time. And as described in the timeit documentation chooses the most precise available real-world timer depending on the platform. ALso, beginning with Python 3.3 this same functionality is available with the time.perf_counter performance counter. Under 3.3+ timeit.default_timer() refers to this new counter.For more precise/complex performance calculations, timeit includes more sophisticated calls for automatically timing small code snippets including averaging run time over a defined set of repetitions.
Use timeit. http://docs.python.org/library/timeit.html
You can implement two tic() and tac() functions, where tic() captures the time which it is called, and tac() prints the time difference since tic() was called. Here is a short implementation:Now in your code you can use it as:and it will, for example, output:See also:Python's datetime library: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.htmlPython's time library: https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html
For Python 3.3 and later time.process_time() is very nice:

For some further information on how to determine the processing time, and a comparison of a few methods (some mentioned already in the answers of this post) - specifically, the difference between: versus the now obsolete (as of 3.3, time.clock() is deprecated)see this other article on Stackoverflow here: Python - time.clock() vs. time.time() - accuracy?If nothing else, this will work good: 
If all you want is the time between two points in code (and it seems that's what you want) I have written tic() toc() functions ala Matlab's implementation. The basic use case is:Super, incredibly easy to use, a sort of fire-and-forget kind of code. It's available on Github's Gist https://gist.github.com/tyleha/5174230
