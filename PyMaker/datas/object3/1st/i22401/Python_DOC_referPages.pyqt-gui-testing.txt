Does anyone know of a automated GUI testing package for that works with PyQT besides Squish?  Nothing against Squish I am just looking for other packages.  It would be cool if there were an open source package.  I am doing my testing under Linux.
It looks like PyQT4 includes a QtTest object that can be used for unit testing.
WATSUP has worked for me.
You should be able to use pyunit in conjunction with PyQT. http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/
You can use py.test with the pytest-qt plugin. There's a simple example of how it can be used hereAnother alternative is to use the built-in unittest module together with QtTest (parts of QtTest has been built into PyQt). A longer example is given in this articleAll of this is free and open source :)
