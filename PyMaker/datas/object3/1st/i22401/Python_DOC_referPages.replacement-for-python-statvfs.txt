The python statvfs module was marked as deprecated since python 2.6 and it's now removed since python 3.0. I haven't been able to figure out what apps are supposed to use if they want to get information about a disk, specifically how to check the capacity and free space of a given path. Anybody have any idea? This is on os x, if that makes a difference, although being cross platform would be a plus.
It appears that only the module that contains the constants for sequential access is being deprecated. Doingwill still work.Sidenote: according to the docs, this function is only available on unix based platforms. So OSX and linux variants are fine, as is freeBSD and others, but windows won't be.
I had the same question, it's os.fstatvfs(fd)As of Python 3.3, this is equivalent to os.statvfs(fd). Availability:  Unix.
