What does this mean in Python:I know what sock is, and I get the gist of the recvfrom function, but what the heck is 2**16? Specifically, the two asterisk/double asterisk operator?(english keywords, because it's hard to search for this: times-times star-star asterisk-asterisk double-times double-star double-asterisk operator)
It is the power operator.From the Python 3 docs: The power operator has the same semantics as the built-in pow() function, when called with two arguments: it yields its left argument raised to the power of its right argument. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type, and the result is of that type.It is equivalent to 216 = 65536, or pow(2, 16)

2 raised to the 16th power
I believe that's the power operator, such that 2**5 = 32.
It is the awesome power operator which like complex numbers is another thing you wonder why more programming languages don't have.
