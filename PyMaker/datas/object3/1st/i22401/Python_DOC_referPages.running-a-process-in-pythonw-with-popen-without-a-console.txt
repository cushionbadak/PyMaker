Natural Text
I have a program with a GUI that runs an external program through a Popen call:But a console pops up, regardless of what I do (I've also tried passing it NUL for the file handle). Is there any way to do that without getting the binary I call to free its console?
From here:
This works nicely in the win32api. The other solutions were not working for me. 
just do subprocess.Popen([command], shell=True)
You might be able to just do subprocess.Popen([command], shell=False).That's what I use anyways.  Saves you all the nonsense of setting flags and whatnot.Once named as a .pyw or run with pythonw it shouldn't open a console.
According to Python 2.7 documentation and Python 3.7 documentation, you can influence how Popen creates the process by setting creationflags. In particular, the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag would be useful to you.
