my troubles with ConfigParser continue. It seems it doesn't support Unicode very well. The config file is indeed saved as UTF-8, but when ConfigParser reads it it seems to be encoded into something else. I assumed it was latin-1 and I thougt overriding optionxform could help:Of course, when I read the config I get:I've tried a couple of different variations of decoding 's' but the point seems moot, since it really should be a unicode object from the beginning. After all, the config file is UTF-8? I have confirmed that's something is wrong in the way ConfigParser reads the file by stubbing it out with this DummyConfig class. If I use that then everything is nice unicode, fine and dandy.Any ideas what could be causing this or suggestions of other config modules that supports Unicode better are most welcome. I don't want to use sys.setdefaultencoding()!
The ConfigParser.readfp() method can take a file object, have you tried opening the file object with the correct encoding using the codecs module before sending it to ConfigParser like below:For Python 3.2 or above, readfp() is deprecated. Use read_file() instead.
Try to overwrite the write function in RawConfigParser() like this:
The config module is broken when reading and writing unicode strings as values. I tried to fix it, but got caught up in the odd way the parser works.
Seems to be a problem with the ConfigParser version for python 2x, and version for 3x is free of this problem. In this issue of the Python Bug Tracker, the status is Closed + WONTFIX.I've fixed it editing the ConfigParser.py file. In the write method (about the line 412), change:byI don't know if it's a real solution, but tested in Windows 7 and Ubuntu 15.04, works like a charm, and I can share and work with the same .ini file in both systems.
In python 3.2 encoding parameter was introduced to read(), so it can now be used as:
what I did is just:
