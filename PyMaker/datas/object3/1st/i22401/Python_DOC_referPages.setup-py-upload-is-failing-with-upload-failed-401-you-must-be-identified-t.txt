When running....I get the following output:It's prompting to save the login details, despite ~/.pypirc already containing this. It then fails to upload files for a package I own, and have full write-access to.
Just found this page, which solves the issue:I also noticed that while it was asking me to save my login information, and I hit Y everytime, it still asked me for the username and password. It turned out that it was saving the information incorrectly as follows:Changing it out to this solved the problems:The above content goes into the .pypirc file in the user's home directory.Ugh.. I think this may be a good time to give distribute a try..
None of the changes to ~/.pypirc listed here worked for me.This worked for me, with no changes to ~/.pypirc.  I added "-r https://www.python.org/pypi" to the command line:My ~/.pypirc looks like this

I changed [distutils] to [pypirc] as per the docs and this worked for me.Here is my ~/.pypirc file:
I had this problem, due to my own fault but hopefully this may help someone else who makes this same mistake.I'm using python 3 on Linux Ubuntu, during registration I issued the setup command using sudo! The result was the .pypirc file in my home directory was owned by root and wasn't readable when trying to perform a module upload immediately after as a none privileged user.By changing the ownership of the file to myself, the issue was resolved.
I ran into the same problem. I'm on a new OS X Sierra. Adding [server-login] entry to ~/.pypirc seemed to fix it http://www.seanbehan.com/how-to-fix-pypi-upload-failed-403-invalid-or-non-existent-authentication-information/
