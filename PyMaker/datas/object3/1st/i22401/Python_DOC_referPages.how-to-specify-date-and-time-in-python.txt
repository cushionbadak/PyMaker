Quite simple newbie question:What is the object used in python to specify date (and time) in Python?For instance, to create an object that holds a given date and time, (let's say '05/10/09 18:00').EDITAs per S.Lott request, what I have so far is:I stop there, after the "=" sign for I realize I didn't knew what the right object was ;) 
Simple example:
Nick D has the official way of handling your problem.  If you want to pass in a string like you did in your question, the dateutil module (http://labix.org/python-dateutil) has excellent support for that kind of thing.For examples, I'm going to copy and paste from another answer I gave a while back now:Simple example:To ambigous:To all over the board:Take a look at the documentation for it here:http://labix.org/python-dateutil#head-c0e81a473b647dfa787dc11e8c69557ec2c3ecd2
Look at the datetime module; there are datetime, date and timedelta class definitions.
So, you can either use format string to convert to datetime.datetime object or if you're particularly looking at today's date could use today() function.
