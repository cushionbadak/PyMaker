I've created a method to convert an int to a bitfield (in a list) and it works, but I'm sure there is more elegant solution- I've just been staring at it for to long.I'm curious, how would you convert a int to a bitfield represented in a list?
How about this:This gives youThis only works for positive integers, though. EDIT:Conversion to int using int() is a bit overkill here. This is a lot faster:See the timings:
This doesn't use bin:and this is how to handle any integer this way:See bit_length.If you want index 0 of the list to correspond to the lsb of the int, change the range order, i.e.Note also that using n.bit_length() can be a point of failure if you're trying to represent fixed length binary values. It returns the minimum number of bits to represent n.
TryThis does not work for negative n though and as you see gives you a list of strings
I'm doing this for my program where you specify a template to get your values from an int:how to usein the template, specify ints relating to your bit-sizes:or you can specify the bit-size of each value needed using strings: (noob friendly)EDIT: and vice versa: (separate code)the code:EDIT2: faster code^
Does not work for negative values
