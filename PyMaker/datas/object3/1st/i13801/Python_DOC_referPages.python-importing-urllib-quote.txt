Natural Text
I would like to use urllib.quote(). But python (python3) is not finding the module.Suppose, I have this line of code:How do I import urllib.quote?import urllib orimport urllib.quote both giveWhat confuses me is that urllib.request is accessible via import urllib.request
In Python 3.x, you need to import urllib.parse.quote:According to Python 2.x urllib module documentation:NOTEThe urllib module has been split into parts and renamed in Python 3 to  urllib.request, urllib.parse, and urllib.error.
If you need to handle both Python 2.x and 3.x you can catch the exception and load the alternative.You could also use the python compatibility wrapper six to handle this.
urllib went through some changes in Python3 and can now be imported from the parse submodule
