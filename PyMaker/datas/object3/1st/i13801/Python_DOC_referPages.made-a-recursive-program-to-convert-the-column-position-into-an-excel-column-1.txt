I made this program to familiarize myself with recursion and for all intents and purposes it is working.Some example outputs:For the last output why is there a @? I assumed there was no issue as int isn't declared until I use alpha_covert which by then should only be less than or equal to 26.Is this some kind of float rounding error?Some additional samples while I'm trying to self-solve this. I don't know what this means:
The problem here is that:happens before you've converted to_print to an integer. Also, you should really be using equality (==) not identity (is); small integers are interned in CPython, but this is an implementation detail you shouldn't rely on.The simplest fix is:but a better way is to convert the number first, and use the fact that zero numerical values evaluate false-y:
