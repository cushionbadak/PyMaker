I've got a list with both the date in human readable form and the date format, I'm trying to make it sort the dates.it fails to return the correct order.
You can use time.strptimeBasically, you can split at the '@' character, then all of your strings can be used to create struct_time objects. You can use a lambda in the key argument of sorted to sort by these struct_time objects.Also note that you can reverse the sort order using the reverse argument
