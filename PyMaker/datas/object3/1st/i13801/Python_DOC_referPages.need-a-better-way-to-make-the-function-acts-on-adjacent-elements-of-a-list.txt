I have a class A, a list of A instance(alist). Class A has an instance method (funca) that has only one parameter of another A instance and returns A instance.Now I want to use "funca" to get the result of all the elements in "alist".My script is like this:I feel the code is ugly. Is there a better way to do this? (iteration or something?)
You are essentially chaining the A.funca() calls based on the list, producing the call:You could use the reduce() function:This essentially does the same as what your loop did, but in one line.The from functools import reduce imports  the function from the Python 3 location; in Python 2 it is one of the built-in functions. From Python 2.6 onwards it is also available in the Python 3 location for forward compatibility.
