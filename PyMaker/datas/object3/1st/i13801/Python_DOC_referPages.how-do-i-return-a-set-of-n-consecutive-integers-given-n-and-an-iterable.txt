For example, calling consec(2, [2, 2, 3, 9, 9, 10, 1, 6, 6]) returns {2, 9, 6}. I cannot use anything in itertools, all I can use is next and iter and I cannot make a secondary list to track the values or use len.Here's what I have so far:
It should be pretty easy to do this with a simple for loop over the values in the iterable. Just count how many times in a row you've see the current value and when it reaches n, add it to the results:I don't bother to avoid repeated counting of the same value, since the set will ignore any duplicate values added to it.If you need to use a while loop for some reason, you can always convert the for loop into one.The for loop:is almost equivalent to:The only difference between the two versions is the existence of the it variable during the iteration. (The iterator used by a for loop is never bound to a variable name.)
Or  use range and index instead of slicing:If you have to use next,use an inner loop in range n-1, see if all next n - 1 and prev  are equal and add to the set if the loop finishes:
Do it recursively:
You can use itertools.groupby:Example:Edit: Whoops, I guess I read "I cannot use anything in itertools" as "I found nothing in itertools that I can use", but you probably meant "I am not allowed to". Anyway, I'll leave this here for those who can use stuff from itertools...
