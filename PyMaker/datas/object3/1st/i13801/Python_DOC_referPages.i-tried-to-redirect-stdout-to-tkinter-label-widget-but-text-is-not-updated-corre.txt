Natural Text
Here is what is bugging me:I try to redirect stdout to tkinter Label.... and it doesn't work. When I press button instead of "Button clicked" I got only blank space.The weirdest thing is when I use file to store output and then I read it and put file text in Label everything just work!My question: why directly redirection of stdout doesn't work for widget here?    
It actually does set the label text as you've requested, but then changes the text to a newline character with a second call to write because that's the string terminator - see the Python 3 docs for print().You could modify the write() method to only set the text if it's not a single newline:Or you could change the print() call to pass an empty string as a terminator and then write() could be simpler:You could even think about overriding the Label class config() method to only update the text option if the provided argument isn't empty or a newline...
