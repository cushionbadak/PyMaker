I am trying to create a list of 3D indexes in python. One way I can do is iterate over all the ids in nested loops and do as follows:However, I remember there was a one liner way to do this but for the life of me I cannot figure it out. I tried something like:However, this resulted in a syntax error.
You meant to write:The commas are not necessary after the range() calls and you can directly assign the result (a list) to the variable l.
You are getting SyntaxError, becauseyou separate the for expressions with commas. But as per the grammar for list comprehension,commas should not be there.Now, even after removing the commas, your program will have a logic errorHere, the expression (x, y, z) for x in range(0, 10) for y in range(0, 10) for z in range(0, 2) is treated as a generator expression. So, you need to create a list, with list function, like thisInstead, you can use list comprehension to create a new list, like thisBut, in this case, you can use itertools.product, as wellproduct function returns a generator, to get the actual entire list, we use list function.PS: You don't have use the starting value in range function if it is zero, as that is the default value.Note: What you are actually trying to do is called generating the cartesian product of three iterables. The result will have huge number of elements. So, unless you need all the elements at once, you can simply iterate the product's result. This will greatly improve the program's performance as the entire result need not have to computed immediately.Now, the values are generated only during their respective iterations.
