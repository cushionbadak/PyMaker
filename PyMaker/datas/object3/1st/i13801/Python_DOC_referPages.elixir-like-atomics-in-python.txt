I am building a project in python that requires the use of a small state machine. I could of course just make a bunch of states likeand then just keep track with something like state = __StateOne__, but I was hoping to be able to do something like elixir style atomics. Would this be possible with some import or third party library?
Use enums:states.one, states.two, states.three... are now sorta like atoms, for your purposes.
