I'm on Python 3.4 making a practice app to learn Python's asyncio module.I've got several modules in my application:app.pycounter.pyserie.pymission_control.pyYou can also find the source at this Github gist.In mission_control.py, the method data_received() appears not to be called when the client (app.py) sends data via its self.transport property.Where is the implementation error and how can I fix it?
The problem is that data_received is not (and cannot be) a coroutine, but you're using yield from inside it. Internally asyncio is just calling self.data_received(data) without any yield from call, which means the body of the method isn't being executed at all - instead a generator object is immediately returned. You need to refactor your implementation to not use yield from, which requires using callbacks instead:Another option would be to use the asyncio Streams API instead of  asyncio.Protocol, which will allow you to use coroutines:
