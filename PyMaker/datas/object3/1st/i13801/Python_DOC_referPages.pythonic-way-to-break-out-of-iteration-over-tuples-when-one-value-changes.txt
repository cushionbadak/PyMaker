I have a set of data:This has been read into a list of tuples, call it data.I would like to create a second list, which contains values of H up until the first repetition i.e. H = [5,10,15,20] when finished. There are two boundary conditions which would work, either when the current H is less than the previous, or when the current W is greater than the previous. I considered simply using enumerate(data) and checking previous vs. current, but is there a more "pythonic" way of doing it?
You can use itertools.takewhile:Result:EDITA more readable version:
Just store the previous value:or you could track unique H values:or you could use itertools.groupby() to group on the second value in the tuples and only use the first group:
I would use a while loop. Something like this:
