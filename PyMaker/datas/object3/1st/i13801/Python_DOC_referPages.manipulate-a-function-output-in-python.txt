In a script that I'm building, I need to create a function that will be able to manipulate the following output:Out of the above output, I need to take only the fields that exist under the 'ID' field and execute a certain command on each (need to bear in mind that in certain cases there could be only 2 IDs in the list, while in other cases I may get more than 14 IDs).In bash what I did was to direct the output to a temp file, then use a 'for' loop and perform the desired operations:Now, I figured I could probably do the same thing in Python using the same commands more or less (by importing the os module and running the commands as plain shell), however I really want to learn how to do it the Python way, which is probably more efficient and could help me in future cases as well..
It looks like you're trying to parse the output of nova list.  While that may be an acceptable short-term solution, if you're starting to work with Python a better choice may be to use the existing novaclient Python library (which, if you're able to run the nova cli, is already installed on your system).Using the Python API means you no longer need to parse the output of commands that are designed primarily to be human readable, rather than useful as input to scripts.Everything you can do with the nova command line client you can accomplish with the novaclient API (in fact, this is exactly what the nova cli uses to communicate with your OpenStack environment).If you are just starting out with Python this may not be the best place to start, but it's something to keep in mind if you grow more familiar with the language.
