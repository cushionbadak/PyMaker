How I could split this: to:where rest_part_of_string can be one string or could be splitted every \. I don't care about rest, i just want first two elements together.
Using regular expression (re module documentation):
you could split the path on \ and rejoin based on index:
python 3.4 has methods for that (note the forward slashes instead of the backslashes (or double the backslashes))pathlib documentationfor what you need parts is interesting:in python 2.7 this needs a bit more work:
You need os.path.dirname() (or os.path.split), applied recursively or iteratively, until you cannot go up in the directory hierarchy further.In general the functions provided by os.path should work better that re-invented wheels, due to better cross-platform support.  There are a large number of primitives from which you can build your own path-manipulating function.
