I'm trying to interface a software with python via a TCP connection. The software is AGWPE (in fact, it's soundmodem, but they share the same API). When I ask the software for "normal" packets, everything fine, but when I ask for "raw" packets, the hex bytes the tcp connection gives me won't decode as nothing at all. Not ASCII, not unicode, not latin-1.This is the API of AGWPE already to the packet I'm having trouble with:http://uz7.ho.ua/includes/agwpeapi.htm#_Toc500723814This is my code:And this is my result: (I would paste it but seems that notepad and the browser don't like some characters)Raw on:http://i.gyazo.com/2e6eecf99c6e79c7cdbcf868a734694b.pngI would be expecting something like on the example:....K...LU7DID..8.LU7DID-4..B...,.E....n......n...i8...[LU7DID@LU7DID-4] B,C,D,E,X,I,M,?,N,P,U,J,R: ..with the char 0x00 instead of . of course. At least something readable.Thanks a lot for your time.
I assume you're using python 3. Try something like:From python docs
