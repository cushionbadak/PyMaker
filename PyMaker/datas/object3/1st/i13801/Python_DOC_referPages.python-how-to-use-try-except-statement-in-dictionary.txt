I was trying to do this, but It didn't work.  Just to clarify I want value to equal list[0] if it exists.  Thanks.
You'd have to put the try..exept around the assigment; you cannot put it inside an expression like you did:Alternatively, move the assignment to a separate set of statements:or explicitly test for the length of list so you can just select None with a conditional expression:where the if list test is true if the list object is not empty.You could also use the itertools.izip_longest() function (itertools.zip_longest() in Python 3) to pair up keys and values; it'll neatly cut off at the shortest sequence, and fill in None values for the missing elements:Here, if list_of_values does not have 3 values, then their matching keys are set to None automatically:
You can actually use the 'in' keyword to see if something exists as a key in a dictionaryJust a note, avoid using 'list' as a variable name.Here's what you're trying to do I'm assuming:
