I have a directory structure:B imports A. This works when I run B.py from somedir/x/. However, in C.py when I try to import B.py and then run It complains about A not being found. I can add somedir/x/ to the pythonpath so that when I run C.py, it can find B and also A. But, I am concerned if there will be another A in a different directory (diffdir/z/A) I use which might conflict with the pythonpath that includes somedir/x/A.
I am guessing the basic issue you are getting is because of the change to intra-package references between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. From documentation -6.4.2. Intra-package ReferencesWhen packages are structured into subpackages (as with the sound package in the example), you can use absolute imports to refer to submodules of siblings packages. For example, if the module sound.filters.vocoder needs to use the echo module in the sound.effects package, it can use from sound.effects import echo .Basically, if you are importing B and B imports a sibling, in Python 3.x you would need to use absolute path to import A in B . From what you said , that you are importing B as - Then in B you would need to import A as -Or you can also try -
