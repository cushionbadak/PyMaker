Natural Text
I'm working on a text based adventure game in python. Nothing super fancy. I want to have a lever in 2 different rooms unlock a gate in a third room. Both levers need to be pulled in order for the gate to be unlocked.here are the two rooms with the levers.Here is the room with the gate.I shortened the code so you don't have to read through all the unnecessary stuff. My biggest problem is I'm not super familiar with the Python language yet, so I'm not sure how to word everything to find the answers I'm looking for.edit: Instead of FirstRoom.WolfLever I also tried just using WolfLever, in the body of my code, above Start() I have:But my functions weren't updating these values. So I tried the FirstRoom. approach.
Credit to @Anthony and the following link: Using global variables in a function other than the one that created themGlobals definitely were the answer (With the exception of using classes). Here's what my WolfRoom() and SnakeRoom() functions look like now:For FirstRoom() I addedto the beginning of the function and right before Start() I have this way I have no errors or warnings (Was getting syntax warnings for assigning a value to my levers before declaring them as global) and everything works perfectly.
