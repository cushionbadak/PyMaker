I am a beginner to python. When I try running the above code I get the error:TypeError: 'int' object is not iterableI'm trying to get a random number from a range (defined in range_of_numbers) to print a certain amount of times (defined in number_of_trials). Please help, what am I doing wrong?
Use range to make an iterable (list if you're using Python 2.x) which will be used for iteration.and you need to pass two integer to random.randint, not an interable (or list):
I think what you want to use is choice.Then changetoThe choice function will randomly pick an element from a non-empty sequence.
One issue and one suggestion in your code -You are doing - for each in number_of_trails: - this is wrong, you are trying to iterate over an integer, you should do - for each in range(number_of_trails): .The best to use here is random.choice() (Instead of randint()). Especially if the range_of_random_numbers is not continuous.Example -From documentation of random.choice() -Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq.
It should be like You got the error due to the fact int object are not iterable that is :i.e)
