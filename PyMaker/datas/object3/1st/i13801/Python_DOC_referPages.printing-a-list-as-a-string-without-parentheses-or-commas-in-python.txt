I have the list :: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]created by a loop. I want it to printI've used the .strip('[]') to get rid of the parentheses but I cannot get rid of the commas.

You can do it with another loop, and using a comma after the print:Note: The comma will avoid printing a new-line character.
