let's say I have two dictionariesI'd like a function that returns the second dictionary as which is matching the keys of dict_1 against those in dict_2. If one matches replace the value in dict_2 with the value in dict_1 for that key. Otherwise nothing.
A simple way to do this by iterating over dict_2's items and using dict_1.get() providing default value as dict_2 corresponding value -Same using dict comprehension -
Another way is to find the common keys, and iterate over them like this:This should be much less computational expensive if it's relatively few common entries compared to the total number of entries in the dictionaries.
You could use dict comprehension  and if else to do it :output:But this creates a new dict object  
You can use dict.viewkeys to find the common keys:For python3 just use .keys as it returns a dictionary-view-object not a list:
