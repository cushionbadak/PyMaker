I'm eventually trying to have multiple threading.timer threads running with differing wait times but I am having trouble getting even one thread based on single variables to run correctly.I've added lines to try and eliminate processing time drift but I'm still not getting predictable results. When I run this script:I get this output:Which has a seemingly random pattern of uncertainty in the amount of time the timer functions wait. Is there some way I can be certain the function will wait for the correct time?
You may want to try some other machines/configurations.That's Windows 7, PyCharm 4.5.1, python 2.7.9, all 64-bit
If you are looking for exactly a second of difference between each thread, this is what documentation has to say:Quoting from [Python 3] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#timer-objects)The interval the timer will wait before executing its action may not  be exactly the same as the interval specified by the user.
