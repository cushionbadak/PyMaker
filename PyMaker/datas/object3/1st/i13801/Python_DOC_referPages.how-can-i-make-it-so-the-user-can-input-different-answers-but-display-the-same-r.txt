This question already has an answer here:Comparing a string to multiple items in Python                    3 answers                I'm wondering how I could display the same result if the user inputs two specific answers in the input command (ie 'end' and 'End').Here's the code I have so far; everything is working except the "end" part:I think it's worth noting that if I do type in 'end', it goes back to pass2.
You need to use or:if you want to check the string case-insensitive, use str.casefold:
The condition is wrong -This would only evaluate to true (when end is 'end' ), because this would get translated as -And any non-empty string in python is True-like (has true value in boolean context.)To check for all cases, best thing to do would be to check your variable's .lower() with 'end' , example -And since you are taking input using input() function, you actually do not need the is not None part, so you can do -
