Natural Text
Is there a method that converts a string of text such as 'you' to a number other than which only converts one character at a time?
In order to convert a string to a number (and the reverse), you should first always work with bytes. Since you are using Python 3, strings are actually Unicode strings and as such may contain characters that have a ord() value higher than 255. bytes however just have a single byte per character; so you should always convert between those two types first.So basically, you are looking for a way to convert a bytes string (which is basically a list of bytes, a list of numbers 0â€“255) into a single number, and the inverse. You can use int.to_bytes and int.from_bytes for that:
You don't need to convert the string into tuplek is overwritten. Collect items using something like list comprehension:To get the text back, use chr, and join the characters using str.join:
Treat the string as a base-255 number.(Note this is essentially the same as poke's answer, but written explicitly rather than using available methods for converting between a byte string and an integer.)
