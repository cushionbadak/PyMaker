I've been trying to design a bandpass filter using scipy but I keep getting a LinAlg Singular Matrix error. I read that a singular matrix is one that is not invertable, but I'm not sure how that error is coming up and what I can do to fix itThe code takes in an EEG signal (which, in the code below, I have just replaced with an int array for testing) and filters out frequencies < 8Hz and > 12Hz (alpha band)Can anyone shed some light on where the singular matrix error is coming from? Or alternatively, if you know of a better way to filter a signal like this I'd love to test out other options too
As indicated in iirdesign documentation, Wp and Ws are "are normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the Nyquist frequency".If your sampling rate is Fs (for example 100Hz) you can normalize the cutoff and stop frequencies using:
