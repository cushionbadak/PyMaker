I have a nested dictionary called "high_low_teams_in_profile" which looks like this:And I want to get {m_profile1: 4, m_profile2: 4}What is the most eloquent way to do it in python?Right now I have the following:
I'm not sure if I'd say it's the most Pythonic, but it's the most functional:The arguments of sum is a generator expression and the outer { prof:sum(...) for prof in p} is a dictionary comprehension.
While this may not be the most pythonic, the following code should work and is more readable than your original version. Note the iteritems() method, which allows access to both the keys and values of the dict, while itervalues(), as the name suggests, only iterates the values of the dict.In addition, you could use the following. While it is a shorter number of lines, it is slightly more difficult to read.
