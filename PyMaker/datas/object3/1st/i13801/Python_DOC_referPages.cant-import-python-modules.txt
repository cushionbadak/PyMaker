I am trying to install EasyGUI. There is no setup.py so I can't install the module like you can with a proper module that has a setup.py fileAny help would be appreciated. Thanks
You haven't install them, you just have to put it a directory, where Python find them, e.g. in a folder is already in your PYTHONPATH.Perhaps the best if you put PythonXX/Lib/site-packages directory.
Don't put manually python file into PythonXX/Lib/site-packages directory, use pip install <package-name> instead e.g.:The advantage is that you can upgrade it later:Or uninstall:pip is the preferred installer program.
