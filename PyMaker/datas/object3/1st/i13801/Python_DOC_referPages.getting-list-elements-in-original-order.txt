My current code:output:I want it like this:maintaining the original order.I don't want to use re.replace, I just want to use w.startswith().
To use startswith() while maintaining the original order you need to perform the operation inside one list comprehension. We can do that using a conditional expression:output
Your code does not work since it is building 2 lists; the first one contains those which start with + or (, and the second one those which don't; these are then catenated in order.Your code fixed and using a conditional expression properly would readHowever a better and more powerful option would be to use re.sub hereThe regular expression ^[+(] matches the beginning of string followed by exactly 1 + or (; whatever is matched is replaced with an empty string ''.On the other hand if you really want removing all leading ( and + characters, no matter how many, use the .lstrip:This will also replace +(++++((((foo with foo which might or might not be what you wanted.
