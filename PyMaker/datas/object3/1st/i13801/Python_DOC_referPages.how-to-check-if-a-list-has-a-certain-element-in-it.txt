Say I don't know what is in my_list, how can I check if "bye" is an element in my list.  And if "bye" is an element in my_list, then how can I know which index it has (for this case "bye" is in my_list[1])?
how can I check if "bye" is an element in my list.then how can I know which index it isYou can skip the first step because if you try to find the index of a value that isn't in the list, you will get a value error which you can handle like this:

you can try list.index.i will hold the index if hi is in the list, otherwise it will be False, because list.index raises ValueErrror if it can't return the index.
You can use the in operator to check if a specific item exists in a list. To find the index of any item in a list just use the .index() function. If you are a beginner in Python you can use the below method else you can check out exception handling.
