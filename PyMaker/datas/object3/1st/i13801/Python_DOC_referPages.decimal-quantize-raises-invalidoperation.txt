looking at Decimal i tried to convert pi to various precisions. i can call pi.quantize() with the first two options below but it raises an InvalidOperation with the third option. the precision of pi is nowhere near that...what is happening here? have i misunderstood what this function should do? why does this exception occur at 1.000 and not before/after?the same exception happens with '0.001' as argument for quantize.
Per the documentation:...if the length of the coefficient after the quantize operation would be  greater than precision, then an InvalidOperation is signaled.Therefore your precision must be set to 3; to check this, try:You should read through the documentation on contexts to understand what they're for and how to use them. For example, you could try:
