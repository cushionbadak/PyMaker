So here's an example of the terminal line I'm trying to run after importing the OS into a Python Script of mine:Even though OS imports have been working for me lately, the fact that the variable is in the MIDDLE of the imported OS command is not allowing my code to run:the above is what I have tried in a few different syntax's with no success. Is there a way to accomplish what I'm looking to do using the os.system method?
Don't use os.system(). it is deprecated.Instead trythe shell=True means that the command will be run in a bash process so that echo and the pipe would work.
