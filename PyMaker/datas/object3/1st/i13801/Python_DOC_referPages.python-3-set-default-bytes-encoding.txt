In Python 3, bytes requires an encoding:Is there a way to set a default encoding, so bytes always encodes in UTF-8?The simplest way I imagine is 
The documentation for bytes redirects you to the documentation for bytearray, which says in part:The optional source parameter can be used to initialize the array in a few different ways:If it is a string, you must also give the encoding (and optionally, errors) parameters; bytearray() then converts the string to bytes using str.encode().It looks like there's no way to provide a default.You can use the encode method, which does have a default, given by sys.getdefaultencoding(). If you need to change the default, check out this question but be aware that the capability to do it easily was removed for good reason.
