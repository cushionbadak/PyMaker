So I'm trying to get the URL of a page in python3...If I do the following,I get the html as desired. However, if I were to choose a different url, as in the following,I get the following error after the second line:Traceback (most recent call last):File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> File      "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 153, in urlopenreturn opener.open(url, data, timeout)File     "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 461, in openresponse = meth(req, response)File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 574, in http_response'http', request, response, code, msg, hdrs)File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 499, in errorreturn self._call_chain(*args)File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 433, in _call_chainresult = func(*args)File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/urllib/request.py", line 582, in http_error_defaultraise HTTPError(req.full_url, code, msg, hdrs, fp)urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: ForbiddenAny ideas why this would be happening and how to fix it?
If you look closer at the error message you'll see that it is a HTTP error and a special one:So you talked to the server and got your response back but you don't know why you were denied.You can get a more detailed message in an HTML returned by the server with something like this:For me it says:You can treat HTTPError as a file object (https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.error.html#urllib.error.HTTPError):Though being an exception (a subclass of URLError), an HTTPError can  also function as a non-exceptional file-like return value (the same  thing that urlopen() returns). This is useful when handling exotic  HTTP errors, such as requests for authentication.
