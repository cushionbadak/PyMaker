I have a list of dictionaries like thisand driver dictionary like thisI need to map the keys of each data dictionary inside the list with the value of driver dict. The sample output would look like thisand so on.My approach was to first convert the list of dictionaries into list of keys and then iterate thro' each item in driver dict and pop the item and replace it with the key from the new list.This gives me the output like thisWhere i am doing it wrong?NOTE: The ordering is important i.e B3 of data dict should match with 1 of driver dict and so on.
First, instead of just using driver.items() you should use sorted to make sure that the items are in the right order (they should be sorted anyways, but there is no guarantee for that). Then, instead of using nested loops, you should zip the keys and driver data. Finally, to make sure that the resulting dict is ordered (if this is important), use an OrderedDict.The problem with your nested-loops approach is that you overwrite all the keys with the last value in the final iteration.
