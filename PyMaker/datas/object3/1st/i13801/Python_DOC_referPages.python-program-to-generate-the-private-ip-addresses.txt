Below given program is to generate N number of private IP addresses randomly.If x1 = 172,x2 value should be from 16 to 31...But it generate the value from 0 to 255... Can someone please have a look and let me know what could be the error? Code:
That is because you are checking int with stringi.e)Modification:edit:edit2:Since if and else or doing the same thing you can merge them as elseoutput:edit3:And I personally think that the x1 that is ip first segment should change  randomly when loopingTherefore this edit code:output:
When x1 is set you are using quotes making it a string.  Remove the quotes and it will be a numeric.  This is important later when you compare it to a numeric value.Then the comparison elif (x1 == 172) will work as expected.
Can be done with this code?Then, you can use those string with ipaddress module.
