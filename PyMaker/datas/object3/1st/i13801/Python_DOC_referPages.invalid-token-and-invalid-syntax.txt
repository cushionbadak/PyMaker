I have a question in python's error case. I have tried here....I want to know:Which is the invalid token, 0, o or 8? Why is 0o08 invalid syntax?
An integer literal starting with 0o is interpreted as octal. Per the documentation:The token 8 is not a valid octdigit, so is not allowed in an octal literal, hence "invalid token". The reason that the error messages are different is that (related to Python's LL(1) parser, which only looks ahead one token at a time):If the first token after 0o is not an octdigit, that is clearly an invalid token and parsing stops immediately; whereasIf subsequent tokens happen to be invalid, this isn't detected at such an early stage and parsing continues until the whole line gets rejected as invalid syntax.You can see this difference in the highlighting in IDLE (only 0o highlighted vs. whole line highlighted), and if you try some alternatives:
