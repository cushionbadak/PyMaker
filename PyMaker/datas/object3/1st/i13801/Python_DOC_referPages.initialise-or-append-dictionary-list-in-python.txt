Can the following code snippet be simplified into one statement somehow?I could write a function accepting the aDict, aKey and someValue, but is there a way to do this using only native python stuff?
collections.defaultdict is made just with this purpose in mind:Here, when you access a key that does not exist, it is automatically initialised with an empty list.
