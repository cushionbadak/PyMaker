Natural Text
I would like to know what the "(f"c: {c:_^5}")" is doing 
f"c: {c:_^5}" is an f-string, which can be used for formatting strings in Python 3.6+. It contains a replacement field {c:_^5}, which formats the value of c with center alignment, the width of 5 and '_' as the fill character.  Check Format Specification Mini-Language for more info.
