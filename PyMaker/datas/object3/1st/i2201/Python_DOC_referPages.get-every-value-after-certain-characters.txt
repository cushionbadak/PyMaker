Say I have a string = 'iwebeivb&euro;&nbsp;25.00\n uyrewgiwebeivb&euro;&nbsp;26.00\n uyrewg iwebeivb&euro;&nbsp;27.00\n uyrewgHow could I get every value after every &euro;&nbsp;? I can only figure out how to get the first one: (25.00)
Use re.findall():The regular expression above will capture all the numbers ([\d.]+) that are preceded by &euro;&nbsp; and return a list with the matches. The () surrounding [\d.]+ means that this is the matching group we want to extract.
