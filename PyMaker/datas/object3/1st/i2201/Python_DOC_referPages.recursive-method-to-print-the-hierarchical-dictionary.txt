I want to create a recursive method with Python that prints this dictionary:And gives it like this:I made this method:And I got this error when running the code:How can I make a script that allows me to print this hierarchy? I'm not really good with dictionaries. I'm working with Python 3. Any help please? Thanks.
Do you need to reproduce the exact order?  You could use something like this to traverse the data structure:
You get that AttributeError because you are recursively calling the hierarch function on every 'children' value. That's valid for the keys like 'employee-1', since the recursive call will loop over the associated dict, but it will fail on 'name', since there is no associated dict, just a name string.So you need to test each item to see whether it's valid to recurse on it. You can use the type function for that, but it's recommended to use the more versatile isinstance function.  Rather than printing the desired names, we can make the function more flexible by turning it into a generator. That way we can loop over the generated results, printing them as we go, or perform some other processing. Or we can easily collect them into a list, or a new flat dictionary.output
