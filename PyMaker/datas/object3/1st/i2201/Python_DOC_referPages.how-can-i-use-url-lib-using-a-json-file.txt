I'm trying to get data from a json link, but I'm getting this error: TypeError: can't concat str to bytesThis is my code: How can I solve this error?
Your question answer is change your code to:Change at 2018-10-02 22:55 : I view your source code and found Response 503 , the reason why you got 503 is that request did not contain cookies:you have update your headers.
you are providing the data argument by mistake â€¦you'll have to use a keyword argument for headers as otherwise the second argument will be filled with positional input, which happens to be data, try this:See https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.Request for a documentation of Requests signature.
You could have a go using requests instead?To check the response:GivesThis response means:  "503 Service Unavailable. The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance"I would suggest the problem isn't the code but the server?
