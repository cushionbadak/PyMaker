I am using python and invoking external utility "send-data" in my .py file as shown below,I have no control over send-data utility and it creates file under /tmp directory with random name as shown below in the response string.Wondering how can i delete the file "pbadLWX" under /tmp folder after each execution? Considering every time file name could be different?
You can parse the output via re module and then delete the file via os.remove:
