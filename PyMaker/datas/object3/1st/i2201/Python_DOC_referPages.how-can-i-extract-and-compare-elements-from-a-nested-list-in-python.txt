I will post only the format of my list.I am trying to split this list:Into thisso i can iterate in list2[x][y], or any better idea please to compare values between list1But it says that list does not have split() method.Again it is a learning project so it does not need to give me the straight answer, i am just looking for hints and help how to do it.
You could zip both sublist together and compare them from there   Can be done with List comprehension:From here you could just compare each tuple elements by using [i][0] and [i][1]
You can also use map in nested manner to do something like this perhaps:              However, if your objective is to just compare each elements you can do something like this:
