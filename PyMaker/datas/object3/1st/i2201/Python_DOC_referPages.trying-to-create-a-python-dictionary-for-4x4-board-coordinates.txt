I want the desired output as-coord = {0: (0, 0), 1: (0, 1), 2: (0, 2), 3: (0, 3),4: (1, 0), 5: (1, 1), 6: (1, 2),7: (1, 3),8: (2, 0), 9: (2, 1), 10: (2, 2),11: (2, 3),12: (3, 0), 13: (3, 1), 14: (3, 2), 15: (3, 3)}usinggetting the output as{0: (0, 3), 1: (0, 3), 2: (0, 3), 3: (0, 3), 4: (1, 3), 5: (1, 3), 6: (1, 3), 7: (1, 3), 8: (1, 3), 9: (1, 3), 10: (1, 3), 11: (1, 3), 12: (1, 3), 13: (1, 3), 14: (1, 3), 15: (1, 3)}not able to build the logic to get desired output. 
The most straightforward way is using the nested for loop.or, if you prefer oneliners, double comprehensionTo have one simple for loop or comprehension we can use integer arithmetic operators // (integer division) and % remainder This probably more elegant and fast
We can enumerate a Cartesian product of integers with itertools.product.
