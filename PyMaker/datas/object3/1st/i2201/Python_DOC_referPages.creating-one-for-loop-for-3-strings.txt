So I have a String called 'Number' with 'abf573'. The task is, to find out if the String 'Number' just has characters and numbers from the Hexadecimal System. My plan was to make a for loop, where we go through each position of the String 'Numbers', to check with an if statement if it is something out of the Hexadecimal System. To check that, I thought about writing down the A-F, a-f and 0-9 into Lists or separat Strings. My Problem now is, that I have never done something like this in Python. I know how to make for loops and if-/else-/elif-Statements, but I dunno how to implement this in to this Problem. Would be nice, if someone can give me a hint, how to do it, or if my way of thinking is even right or not. 
I find it quite smart and fast to try to convert this string into an integer using int(), and to handle the exception ValueError which occurs if it is not possible.Here is the beautiful short code:  
Strings are iterables. So, you can writeAlso, there is an isdigit method on strings, so your number is hex is not Number.isdigit()
