I have a json file; I need to remove the id key from the content, which I can do with my code.Now I want to print each line of the json file in a new file and use the name filed in my json for the file name.My json file ex:Code for removing id:
You sample input show a json object on each line.So my solution reads each line and converts it to a python dict (using json.loads()), removes the desired key from the dict (using dict.pop() to fail silently if the key is not present) and converts it back to a string (using json.dumps()), which is then written to the new file.EDIT: apparently each json line should go into a separate new file, according to OPs comments. That could be done like this, for example:
For deletion you could use something like this:and in order to create file with id value, just parse data object, and value of id node
You've imported the json package, but you're not using it. You should, it's great.Get your string from file and then use json.loads() to load the string into a json object. From there, you can get each element of the json object with for key in json_object.
