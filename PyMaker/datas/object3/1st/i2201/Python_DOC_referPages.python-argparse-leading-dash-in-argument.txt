I'm using Python's argparse module to parse command line arguments. Consider the following simplified example,which can successfully be called likeA single argument is required after -s and after each -a, which may contain spaces if we use quotation. If however an argument starts with a dash (-) and does not contain any spaces, the code crashes:error: argument -s: expected one argumentI get that it interprets -begins-with-dash as the beginning of a new option, which is illegal as -s has not yet received its required argument. It's also pretty clear though that no option with the name -begins-with-dash has been defined, and so it should not interpret it as an option in the first place. How can I make argparse accept arguments with one or more leading dashes?
You can force argparse to interpret an argument as a value by including an equals sign:python test.py -s=-begins-with-dash -a bar -a bazNamespace(a=['bar', 'baz'], s='-begins-with-dash')
If you are instead trying to provide multiple values to one argument:will grab everything after -a on the command line and shove it in a.Note that even though -s is a recognized argument, argparse.REMAINDER adds it to the list of args found by -a since it is after -a on the command line
