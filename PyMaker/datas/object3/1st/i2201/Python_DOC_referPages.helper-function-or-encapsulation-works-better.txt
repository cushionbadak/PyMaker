Natural Text
this code is repetitive so should I use a helper function for calling this function or encapsulate it?The only difference is the second last line of the if-else statement, screen.blit(youwin / youlose, (0,0)), and text = font.render("Accuracy: "+str(accuracy)+"%", True, (0,255,0) / (255,0,0))This is what I did using a helper function, but it wouldn't run:NameError: name 'initialize_game' is not defined.Some help would be great, Thank you!!
In Python, order of function definitions matters.  Under the hood, def is just an assignment, which assigns to the function name when executed.  This means that the function definitions must come before their use:Or more precisely, the definitions do not always have to come first in the source code, they just have to be executed first, so that the name is defined when it used.
You could use the ternary operator (value1 if condition else value2):Of course, making a function is never a bad idea.
