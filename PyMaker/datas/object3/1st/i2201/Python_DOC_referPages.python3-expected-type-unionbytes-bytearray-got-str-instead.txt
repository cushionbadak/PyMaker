You are writing a string (Unicode) to a BytesIO object.  You should probably switch your BytesIO to a StringIO.  If you truly want bytes, you can convert your Unicode strings to bytes using their encode() method, passing your preferred encoding scheme (e.g. 'utf-8').
As the error message says, you should pass binary data, not strings. Instead ofwriteto convert it to binary.
