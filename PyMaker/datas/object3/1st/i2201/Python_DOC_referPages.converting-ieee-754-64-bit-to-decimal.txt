I have a list of 64-bit IEEE-754 hex values, stored as strings, that I want to convert to python float:I've have tried to use binascii.unhexlify andstruct.unpack` to convert each string, but it fails since this is 64 bit. I can get it to work with 32 bit hex values: Result:When I go to 64 bit:Result:However, converting 40D3970060AA64C3 to binary is supposed to yield 2.00600059000000001105945557356E4.

It looks like the byte order is reversed for your (and my) platform relative to how it was encoded:BUTThis makes sense, since Intel generally stores everything in little-endian order internally, while the string, if interpreted as read, is by definition in big endian.
