which of the two are more pythonic?or:What I infer myself is that in the first example it is not clear at first glance what self.foo() does, until someone reads through the method itself.But the problem with the second one is that it may arise the warning that: foo method may be static.
A good way to initialize a class is:Since you want to initialize variables using a file, you may want to use ConfigParser. ConfigParser allows you to read from a file and access key-value pairs easily.My example class above takes in a config object in which you can get the values you stored from a file.P.S. I didn't test the code above. Take a look at the configparser docs for more info.
