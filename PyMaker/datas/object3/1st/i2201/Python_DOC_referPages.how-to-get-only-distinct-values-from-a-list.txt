This question already has an answer here:Get unique values from a list in python [duplicate]                    31 answers                I am trying to iterate through a column in a text file, where each entry has only three choices  A, B, and C. I want to identify the number of different types of choices (another text file has A, B, C, and D), but if I iterate through each element in the column with a 100 entries and add it to a list, I'll have multiple repetitions of each type. For example, if I do this, the list might read [A,A,A,B,C,C,D,D,D,B,B...], but I want to remove the extraneous entries and just have my list show the distinguishable types [A,B,C,D], regardless of how many entries there were. Any ideas how I might reduce a list with many common elements to a list with only the different distinguishable elements displayed? Thanks!Desired Output:[A, B, C, D]
This is what you needed with set():Another solution OrderedDict to keep the order of keys during insertion.In case you have liberty to use pandas then try below ones..In case you are looking for common values between two files:
There is a data structure called set in python that does not allow duplicates.This might help you out.documentation for set() at docs.python.org
We could use itertools.groupby and sorted to get this list of unique elements
