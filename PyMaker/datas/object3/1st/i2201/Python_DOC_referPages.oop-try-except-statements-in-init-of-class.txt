I want to control the input of the class Webpage. Meaning, I want to be sure that the webpage's link is appropriately provided, e.g. 'http://example.com'. However, when I try code: I do not get ValueError, as I would expect. Call of methods:result in which indicates that try/except worked partially - try did not execute self.link = link, however except statement wasn't executed.An example:works fine with get_link() and print methods of that class.Will appreciate any hint.
Raising an expection as in your case ValueError is done in the try block and handling of the expection it is done in the except blockFor more information please visit Raising Expections in python OutputHope this helps
You can use str.startswith and str.endswith and create the raise in else. Demo:
If you pass link example.com, if statement fails since it does not contain any pre mentioned prefix. Since its logically correct, it will never go down to except block. You may probably want to check if self.link exists inside get_link function 
Try this updated code
