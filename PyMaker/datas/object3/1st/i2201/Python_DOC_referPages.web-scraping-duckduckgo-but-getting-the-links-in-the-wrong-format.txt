I created a Python 3 script using the BeautifulSoup library. What it does, is going to the duckduckgo search engine using the following url: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=searchterm and then, it will display to me all the websites in the first page.Here is the code and it is working perfectly:The thing is, I am not getting the urls in the proper format (example: https://www.google.com). Instead, I am getting all my urls in the format of a search query.Here is what I mean when I search test on duckduckgo:I would like to know if there is a way to display all these urls in the standard format.Edit: This is not a duplication from my other topic, since in the last one I was told that the library PyCurl won't get me what i want (It wasn't able to catch the javascript code in the urls). Here my code is working but the output that I got isn't what I am expecting.
Python's urllib.parse library can help you as follows:This would display something starting:First use urlparse() to get the path components. From this take the query string and pass it to parse_qs() to further process it. You can then extract the link using the uddg name.
