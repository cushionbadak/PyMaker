I have with me now a group of about 20 SNPs that I would like to acquire all possible genotype combinations for. As an example, let's start off with three SNPs and their alleles.I want to start off by generating a list of all possible genotype permutations/combinations of these three SNPs, for example:And so on, for what I expect to be 3^3 = 27 possible combinations.From here, I hope to scale this up to my full group of ~20 SNPs. What is a good way of doing this, in Python or even in R?
We can use two functions from the standard itertools module to generate the combinations. We use combinations_with_replacement to build the 3 pairs from a SNP.outputThen we use product to build all the combinations from a list of SNPs.output
Here is a solution in R for the example you provided:output
