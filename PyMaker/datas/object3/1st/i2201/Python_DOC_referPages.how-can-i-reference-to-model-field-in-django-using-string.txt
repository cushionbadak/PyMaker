Consider my model (MODEL) has field has attribute NAME.I want to reference to that model attribute using string.eg. var = Model.objects.get( pk=1 ) var.str('NAME') = valuewhile trying with string it's giving me error :  can't assign to function callP.S.: I know for finding a value of attribute from string I can use getattr() but since I want to assign value, this method isn't helpful.
