Suppose I have a dictionary:As you can see, I have added a * to the end of one V. Whereas a 3 may be the value for just V, I want another key for V1, V2, V2234432, etc...I want to check it against:and get the value. what is the correct syntax for this?
You can use fnmatch.fnmatch to match Unix shell-style wildcards:NOTE: Every lookup will have O(n) time complexity. This may become an issue with large dictionaries. Recommended only if lookup performance is not an issue.
I would split your single dictionary into two, a regular one and a wildcard-derived one, so you can maintain O(1) lookup time complexity.
