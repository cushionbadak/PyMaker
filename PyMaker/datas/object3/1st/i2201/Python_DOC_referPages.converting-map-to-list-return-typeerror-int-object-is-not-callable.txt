I'm trying to convert map to list, but it's returned TypeError: 'int' object is not callable.. can someone explain to me?Error:
The map function in Python accepts the first argument as a callable function and the second as an iterable. Each item in the iterable is then passed through the function into an output map object.In your example, n is defined as an int pulled from the Stdin (input) due to the line n = int(input()). Therefore, the code above is equivalent to the following:This code won't run because n (as an int) cannot be called as a function.If what you are trying to do is convert input like 0 2 45 119 to a list of integers, you can pass the first argument of map as int, and int will be called on every element of the input provided.
