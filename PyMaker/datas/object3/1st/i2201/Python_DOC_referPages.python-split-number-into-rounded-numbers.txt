Is there a library that can split a number into multiple parts, but makes sure all the parts are rounded numbers?For example, splitting 100 into 3 would be 33.33, but I would like it to be rounded and make sure the total sum stays as 100 also:[34 33 33]
You can use the builtin function divmod for this. Since all this function does is simple arithmetic, I'm using single letter variable names.The return value is a list with the larger parts first.
Well I think this is what you wanted  Output
Assuming that your inputs are integers, another approach could be the following:Edit: as suggested there's no need to check if the remainder is zero or not, so my code could be simplified as:
I think you can implement it without libraries.1) If the number n is divided by 3, then the output would be [n/3, n/3, n/3]2) If the number n = 3k + 1(k>=0), then the output would be [(n/3)+1, n/3, n/3]3) Otherwise, the output would be [(n/3)+1, (n/3)+1, n/3]
