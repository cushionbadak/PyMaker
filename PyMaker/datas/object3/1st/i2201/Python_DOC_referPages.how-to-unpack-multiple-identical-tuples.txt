How do i make a new dictionary made out of all of values with a key of one? i tried something like this:but it did not workthanks for your help, I am just starting out with python
A dictionary uses a series of unique keys to identify a single or set of values. How you have your dictionary defined above will only return the second instance of the 0 and 1 keys. Your value can have repeated data, but not your key.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmlAdditionally, your dictionary values are lists, not tuples. It is important to know the difference as tuples are immutable objects, and lists are mutable objects.If you wanted to create a new dictionary using the key and value:ADDITIONAL INFO:You code above:is not complete, and one of the biggest reasons it is not working is because you are not unpacking a key with your values. It should beassuming that locationcoor is a dictionary.
Such dictionary can not exists, as keys are unique but this would be possible if that were a list of tuples like so lst = [('0',[0,0]), ('1',[2,1]), ('0',[5,1]), ('1',[20,1])] or same for list of lists.  We can use sort, groupby and a dictionary constructor
