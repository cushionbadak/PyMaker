First, I should say, I don't really know much about computer programming, but I find Python fairly easy to use for automating simple tasks, thanks to Al Sweigart's book, "Automate the boring stuff."I want to collect email text bodies. I'm trying to move homework to email to save paper. I thought I could do that by getting the numbers of the unseen mails and just looping through that. If I try that, the IDLE3 shell just becomes unresponsive, ctrl c does nothing, I have to restart the shell.Question: Why can't I just use a loop variable in server.fetch()??It seems you need an actual number like 57, not msgNum, in there, or it won't work.After looking at various questions and answers here on SO, the following works for me. I suppose it collects all the email bodies in one swoop.
I've found this gist with nice and clean code and a page with many helping examplesThe main difference between API of imaplib and pyzmail is pyzmail is all-in-one package with parsing and all client-server communication. But these packages are splitted into different packages in standard library. Basically, they both provided almost the same functionality and with the same methods.As an additional important note here, pyzmail looks quite abandoned.  To save a useful code from that gist, I copy it here as it is with very small modifications like extracting main function (note, it's for Python 3):
