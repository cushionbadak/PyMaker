is there an efficient way to replace the element in a list.For example, I want to replace "banana" to 3By doing the above code, instead of banana, the 1st row which correspond to apple is being change to int 3.It will be interesting if we can skip the use of FOR-LOOPReally appreciate if someone can point the right direction
you could use enumerate to get the index of the current item in your list:to explain what is happening in your code:thislist == "banana" is always False (comparing a str to a list)thislist[False] == thislist[0] (as False == 0)thislist[0] = 3: you only set the first element.if you want to use numpy you could to the same without a (explicit) for loop (not in plain python though...)note that multiple replacements can be done with one for loop only:
To avoid the for loop, you can try using the index() method of the list as follows:    i = thislist.index('banana')    thislist[i] = 3
When we have numpy solution, we nearly always have a pandas version solution, just FYI.Output:['apple', 3, 'cherry', 3, 3]
