This question already has an answer here:Why does the expression 0 < 0 == 0 return False in Python?                    9 answers                I recently started to learn Python.And my friend asked me which value 3 < 5 != True evaluates to.As I have prior experience to javascript and c++, I answered False. (I was able to see false in both languages)Because, operators with same precedence (comparison) works left to right.So that 3 < 5 is evaluated first, which becomes True and True != True is False.I believed it was right answer.But it turned out it wasn't.I ran this expression on my computer and it said it's True.Am I missing something? or Python evaluates operators with same precedence in different way?
The expression 3 < 5 != True is evaluated as:Since True == 1, this equates to:Of course, both parts evaluate to True and therefore your result is True.Chained comparisons are described in the docs:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent  to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both  cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).
