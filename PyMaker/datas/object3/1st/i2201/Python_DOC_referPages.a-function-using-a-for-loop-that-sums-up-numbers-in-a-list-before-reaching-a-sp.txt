I would like to use a for loop to go through a list of numbers and stop when it reaches a specific number like 4, returning the sum of the numbers that came before it.So if the list is [1, 2, 4, 0, 3, 2], the function would return 3 after summation.
Here are two ways (with and without function) using for loop. The if condition will break out of the for loop as soon as element will be 4, otherwise it will keep summing. Coming out of the for loop, you can print the sum sWithout functionWith function
You can use itertools.takewhile:The docs for itertools.takewhile give the equivalent generator which can be used to implement the logic directly:
