I am learning how to code with python using "Learn Python the HARD WAY" 3rd edition.I am on Exercise 6. Im not having to much trouble although the formatters still have me a tad confused.I know the formatter %s is used for strings.But I am confused about when to use others and why to use otherslike:%r, %d, %x, etc.....Any direction would be very much appreciated!
%r, %d, %x, %s are String formatters. %d formatter is used for numbers%s formatter will the string representation of the object (makes use of str())%r formatter will return the canonical string representation of the object (makes use of repr())%x is used for signed hexadecimal. The alternate form causes a leading ‘0x’ to be inserted between left-hand padding and the formatting of the number if the leading character of the result is not already a zero.You might also find this article useful that contains most -if not all- formatters.
