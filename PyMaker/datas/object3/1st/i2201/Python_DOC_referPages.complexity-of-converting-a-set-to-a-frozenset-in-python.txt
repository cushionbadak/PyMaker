What is the computational complexity of "freezing" a set in Python?For example, does the second line inrequire O(n) time? Or is it simply a "view" created in constant time?
b is not a view of a. You can check this via id:Hence a change in b will not be reflected in a. You can, of course, test this yourself. Since frozenset takes an iterable as an argument, it must iterate over each argument. This is an O(n) process.As an aside, there's nothing special about frozenset, even creating a set from a set has O(n) time complexity:
