I am trying to make a program that continuously asks for a string and outputs that to the .txt file. It works fine without the while loop so I am not really sure whats going wrong here.
Your program will run forever. The file you're writing to will not "save" (write to the actual file) until you close it (or explicitly tell it to, by using infile.flush()). Without the loop, the program terminates, which means that the file is closed and your changes are saved.The flush() method does not always necessarily save the file. In that case, you can use os.fsync(infile.fileno()).
The content of a file is not written immediately to your harddisk. The content is stored in the files internal buffer and eventually given to your operating system wich in turn decides when to acctually persist your data on your haddrive.More on file flushing (aka emptying the buffer to your disk): How often does python flush to a file?It is better to use the with open(name, mode) as filehandle: paradigm when writing. Try:Output:See examples at: reading-and-writing-files 
You just need to break from the while loop so that contents are actually written to the file.
