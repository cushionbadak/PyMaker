So I want to create two list objects and combine them using function union in class MySet. So far I haveSo to use it I would doAlso, I don't want it to print duplicates. So setc.elements should output [1,2,3,10,11]. And seta.elements should still be [1,2,3] and so on. Thank you. 
Python Sets are a good way of doing this.
If you want set-like behaviour, use actual sets.But if you really need to use a class which behaves like a list, change the union() function to this:First, new_set is being created as copy of self (seta). Then, each element of other_set (setb) which is not in self gets added, in order, to the new set.
This setup would accomplish what you are speaking of, just set up the method to concatenate the two list, how you call the methods is important.    
The answer of @aneroid is good, but would be very slow if other_set is large. Using set is one of the most scalable choices. The order will be ignored.If you want to keep the order, making a set object would be faster for very large other_set.
