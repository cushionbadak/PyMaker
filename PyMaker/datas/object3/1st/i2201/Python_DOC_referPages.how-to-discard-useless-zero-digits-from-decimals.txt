I'm new in Python and I have a problem about the decimal library.Some questions require that all zeros after the decimal point located behind the last non-zero digit must be discarded.UVA11821Such as 0.1230000 is an illegal answer .It should be converted into 0.123.I plan to do this question in python and decimal.However, I am not able to do the convert job.And here is my code.
Did you try normalize?Normalize the number by stripping the rightmost trailing zeros and converting any result equal to Decimal('0') to Decimal('0e0'). It should work in your case.
A very basic posibility is to work on the str output.Its not very elegant, but it does the job. But this is more work if you need to convert it back to a Decimal instance afterwards.EDIT: added basic check to only remove zeros after the decimal point.
