Hi So I've been using WTForms with success for a good period of time now.The problem is on how to parse dates.I've always used to assign variables according to form data as followsThis will store the user's input from the form data into my variable called "firstname", which works just fine, my problem is when it comes to dates.I have the following codeWTForms ClassThe booking routeThe HTML Template {jinja}I am also using datetime in pythonI've been trying to follow many docs on how to parse a date into a variable from a user input form with no luck, Does anybody know the right syntax?Thanks
form.date_created.data returns a datetime.date object.The month, day, and year attributes store these values as integers. There is no need to import the datetime to solve this problem.You can use date.strftime('%m-%d-%y') to get a string representation such as "10-22-18".Take a look at the WTForms Documentation for DateField.You can check out more about the date object in the docsPython DocsTip: if you had tried print(type(start_date)) to see what it prints, you probably would have figured it out on your own.
