You are most likely missing the arguments.When you run,sys.argv is a list with myscript.py at sys.argv[0],arg1 at sys.argv[1], etcSo consider using if conditions or try-except to check if we have necessary arguments to unpack:
You are getting this error because your sys.argv has fewer than 3 items.What does sys.argv store?It stores the arguments passed to your script by the command line.For instance. If you run python myscript.py an_arg another_one the values stored in sys.argv are going to be ['myscript.py', 'an_arg', 'another_one'].Please, take your time to check the docs on sys.argv.
