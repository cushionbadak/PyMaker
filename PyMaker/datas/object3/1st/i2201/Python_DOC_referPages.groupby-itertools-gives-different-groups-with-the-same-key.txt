[duplicate]                    7 answers                I am grouping string elements within a list by the first word and by the last word in the string. I am using groupby from itertools to do the grouping. The process seems to work fine for the last word, however it doesn't seem to do the same for the first one.The above outputsHowever if I try to get the strings grouped by the first word:It doesn't seem to workThis surprises me as the keys are the same
groupby assumes that the elements in the same group appear consecutively (i.e. basically the list is sorted). Right at the beginning of groupby's documentation it says:Make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the  iterable. The key is a function computing a key value for each  element. If not specified or is None, key defaults to an identity  function and returns the element unchanged. Generally, the iterable  needs to already be sorted on the same key function.Your list is not sorted. So sort it before groupby. Define a key function to be used by sorted and groupby:And then:
