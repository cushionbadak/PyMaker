You are passing function argument in wrong order:Here,should be
The issue you are getting is KeyError which is raised when  a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys. In your case the competencies key is not in dict d.                           So, you'll need to change your class call from:       es = employer_search(d,ans) To:      es = employer_search(ans,d) Side note:               You can make __init__ call mandatory using named parameter by writing it as:def __init__(self,*,ans,d) and then call it as es = employer_search(ans=ans, d=d) Also, if you are using Python 3 you can simply declare it as class EmployerSearch:. (CamelCase)
