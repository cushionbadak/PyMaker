This question already has an answer here:What is Truthy and Falsy in python? How is it different from True and False?                    4 answers                Boolean testing a list in Python                    4 answers                
So long as the list isn't empty then yes you can use a list to be evaluated as a True bool in and if/elif/else statement. Empty lists will be False, lists with at least 1 item will be TrueYou can always just try your own code out to see for yourself!
Yes, it is valid. Empty lists yield False, otherwise the expression yields True.If you want more clarity, you can also use a more verbose form:
Yes, because any object can be tested for truth value in Python as stated here:  Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while  condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines  either a bool() method that returns False or a len() method  that returns zero, when called with the object. [1] Here are most of  the built-in objects considered false:  constants defined to be false: None and False.  zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), Fraction(0, 1)  empty sequences and collections: '', (), [], {}, set(), range(0)Operations and built-in  functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for  false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important  exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of  their operands.)
