I would like to be able to run this function without needing to add .elements to the end. For instance, if seta=MySet([1,2,3]) and setb=MySet([1,10,11]), I can run setc=seta.intersection(setb.elements), but not without the .elements. How can I run it without needing to type .elements? 
Easily, all you have to do is access the .elements in the function. No __repr__ required.
Make your set an iterable by defining __iter__:Now iteration over an instance of MySet seamlessly iterates the elements it contains.I'd strongly suggest looking at the collections.abc module; you're clearly trying to build a set-like object, and getting the basic behaviors in place is easiest by using collections.abc.Set (or collections.abc.MutableSet) as your base class.
