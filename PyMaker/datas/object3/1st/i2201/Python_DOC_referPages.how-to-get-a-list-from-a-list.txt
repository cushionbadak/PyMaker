I read a pandas dataframe df from .csv file.Each cell of the dataframe contains a string like the followingI would like to have a list with the values as np.float. I tried
You can use ast.literal_eval to parse the string as a list of floats:
Without exterior modules, it's pretty easy to do with a list comprehension: So the one-liner would be:
You can use the python eval() function to convert the string into a python object, then turn into np.float objects:map(np.float, eval(df[i][j]))This makes the string into a python list first, then casts each item as a np.float.Since np.float == float, you can skip the casting to np.float, and just do eval(df[i][j])
You can use ast.literal_eval, and I recommend you avoid chained indexing. Instead, use pd.DataFrame.at for fast scalar access. Note also to iterate columns you don't need to access pd.DataFrame.columns:If you need to apply this for an entire series, you can use pd.Series.map or a list comprehension:If each list has the same number of items I strongly suggest you split into separate columns to permit vectorised functionality:Pandas is not designed to hold lists in series and for big data workflows you will likely face efficiency and memory issues with such a data structure.
