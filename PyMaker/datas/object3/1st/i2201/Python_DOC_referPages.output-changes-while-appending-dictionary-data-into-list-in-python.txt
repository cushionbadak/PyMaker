I have a dictionary containing data in a certain format. When I am printing the dictionaries individually,  it is printing the data correctly but when I am adding all dictionaries into a list and then printing the list, it is printing wrong output. May I know the solution to this problem?my code:Expected output:My output:
It looks like a reference error. You are doing "docData":"Matches":list_for_dictionary}}, and then overwriting list_for_dictionary in subsequent loops.Initialize a new list_for_dictionary = [], instead of clearing list_for_dictionary.clear()
