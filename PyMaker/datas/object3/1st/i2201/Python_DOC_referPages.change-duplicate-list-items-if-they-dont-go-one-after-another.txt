I have a list of integers that has duplicates. Example:37 1 30 38 5 39 5 5 5 40 33 5 35 42 25 36 27 27 43 27I need to change duplicate numbers to some other numbers if they don't go one after another. New numbers should not duplicates other numbers in a list. For example, the list above should become something like this:37 1 30 38 5 39 8 8 8 40 33 2 35 42 25 36 27 27 43 55This is what I got:[37, 1, 30, 38, 5, 39, 17, 17, 17, 40, 33, 13, 35, 42, 25, 36, 27, 27,  43, 8]But I don't think it's a good solution.
You can use itertools.groupby to process the list in chunks of identical numbers, and a generator expression with itertools.count to generate replacement numbers:
Just another method.Demo:Output:
