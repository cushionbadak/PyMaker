You can do that in following two ways. Option one uses more traditional way of file handling, I have used with statement, using with statement you don't have to worry about closing the fileOption two, which makes use of pathlib module and this is new in version 3.4 (I recommend using this)somefile.txt is the full file path in file system. I've also included documentation links and I highly recommend going through those.OPTION ONEDocumentation for The with StatementOPTION TWO - For Python 3.4 or aboveDocumentation on Pathlib module
