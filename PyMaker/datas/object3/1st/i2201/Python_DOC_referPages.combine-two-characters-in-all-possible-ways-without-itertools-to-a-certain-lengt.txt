I want to generate strings with all possible combinations of two characters of a certain length. For example, if I want to generate all the strings of length 3 with characters 'a' and 'b' I want the next output (not in a list):I had defined two functions:If I run the code with a lenth of 3 I get only 6 of the 8 combinations:   I'm still missing the bab and aba combinations. If I put 4 in my powerset function I get 8 of the 16 possible combinations. There should be an easiest way of solving the problem but I'm stuck. Do you have any idea?
