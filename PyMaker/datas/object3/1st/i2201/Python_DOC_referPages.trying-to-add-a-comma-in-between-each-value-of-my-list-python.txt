I am creating a dice program that must roll the dice a certain amount of times and append those rolls to a list. I am trying to figure out how to add commas in between each item of the list. This is the code that I have so far: 
change into 
print(', '.join(listRolls))For future reference, it's more "pythonic" (not my word) to use lower case variable_names, meaning your listRolls would then be list_rolls.  Your code will handle it JUST FINE, however!
If you want to print your whole list in one line, komma seperated simply useThe * before the list-variable will make single elements from your list (decomposing it), so the print command essentially sees:The sep="," tells the print command to print all given elements with a seperator as specified instead of the default ' '.If you need to print, say, only 4 consecutive elements from your list on one line, then you can slice your list accordingly: Output:Doku:unpacking listsprint(*objects, sep=' ', ...) range(start, stop[, step])
