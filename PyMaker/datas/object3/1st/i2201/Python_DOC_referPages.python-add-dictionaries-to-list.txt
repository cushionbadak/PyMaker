List 1dictionary 1dictionary 2Do something to merge dictionaries together....Result:How can this be done using Python? Thanks!
Lets try with your expected output{d1:d2} #TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'The error is raised because the dict type cannot be hashed. similar to the list type as it does not comes with a hash function. Therefore, moral of the story is in order for an object to be hashable, it must be immutable types like string, integer or tuple.In case you are just looking to iterate over the dictsOR  or create a new list with immutable keysFor further reference https://www.asmeurer.com/blog/posts/what-happens-when-you-mess-with-hashing-in-python/
If the data in your dicts never change, and you want the keys, then you should opt for using namedtuples.You'll need to convert that nested list into a tuple since lists are not hashable. Then you can take your existing dictionaries and plop them into your namedtuple (or create them directly).Now you can keep those namedtuples inside a set so that collection will contain only unique items! Also, namedtuples use less memory than a dict since it implements __slots__.
