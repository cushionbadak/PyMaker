my site is up and running. However, silly me I didnt put in a validator to check if users and username can only be in lower-case (I only realised that DJANGO allowed capitalized Users and usernames). Although, I have put up a warning but users usually ignore that still write upper case letters or alteast capitalized letters in their signup forms. I then encounter the problem of slugs not working, thereafter I have to manually change their usernames. I do not want to change the behavior of slugs and instead can I please ask for help from someone in changing my views? I have tried .lower() .format() as well and it didnt work. I am very weak on validators.forms.pyViews.py
You can add a validation in the SignupForm:So in case the data.islower() check fails (the username contains uppercase characters), it will raise a ValidationError, and thus the form is not valid.Note that islower() only checks case-based characters, so if the string contains digits, it will still succeed. You thus might want to finetune the check. Or as specified in the documentation of str.islower:Return True if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and  there is at least one cased character, False otherwise.An alternative might be to convert the data to lowercase, such that a user that enters 'FooBar' gets as username foobar, although this can result in the fact that users get confused that the username they picked is not the username they get.
Change username = form.cleaned_data['username'] to username = form.cleaned_data['username'].lower()
