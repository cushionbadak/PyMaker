This question already has an answer here:Number list with no repeats and ordered                    6 answers                Consider the tuple (x_1,x_2,...,x_n) with each satisfying 1 <= x_i <= m and x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n. I know that in Python, I can generate all the n-tuples satisfying the bound 1 <= x_i <= m using the following:list_of_tuples = list(product(range(1,m+1), repeat = n)) but this will return a list of tuples that do not satisfy the non-decreasing property of the tuple. How do I generate such sequences? As an example, say that n=3 and m=2 thenlist_of_tuples = [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 2)]However, we notice that (1,2,1),(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,2,1) do not obey the non-decreasing property. For instance in (1,2,1) we see that x_2 = 2 is not less than or equal to x_3 = 1. 
itertools.combinations_with_replacement does the job:
You can try this:For n=3 and m=2, it results in:This is not very efficient, though, but perhaps this does not matter.
Not sure that I got exactly what you're looking for, but perhaps this code snippet might work:Using the set operation you keep a single copy of each duplicate, and you're done.
This code could be done pretty easily with recursion, without using itertools.Example:
