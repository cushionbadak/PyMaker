I am using Thavelick's summarizer with some edits and cannot find a way to fix this error:TypeError: < lambda > () missing 1 required positional argument: 's2'Here is the code I know is causing the error: Thavelick's summarizer link: https://github.com/thavelick/summarize/blob/master/summarize.py
That code probably use the cmp argument for sort which is gone now. You cannot just use the same lamdba. The key function must accept only one argument.There is a way to blindly convert the code: use functools.cmp_to_key. However I believe in this case it is easier to provide a proper key function:Which can also be written as simply:The expression a - b returns a negative value if a < b, 0 if a == b and a positive value if a > b. So this means that your code is sorting output according to where the elements it contains are found in input.So the key function is to just lookup where the substring is in input.To use cmp_to_key you'd do this instead:
From the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functionsBoth list.sort() and sorted() have a key parameter to specify a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.Thus,
