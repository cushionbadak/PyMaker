I have below pattern of starsBased on that above pattern I have to generate numbered index like below.I am trying with loops but not able to find how to generate sub indexes. I am trying in python.Is there any library or algorithm that I can use to achieve this.
A simple generator function: at each iteration, bring the list of indexes to the length of the stars and then increment the last index.Also see the docs on str.join and map that are used for convenience.
Assuming your pattern is in a file "tempfile", you can use the following code : Explanation : Keep a memory array with all elements as 0For each line, count the number of asterisks, For a line with number of asterisk as n, increment the memory array with index = n-1 by 1, Assign all indexes to right with value = 0.Repeat logic for all lines.Output
Assuming your star pattern is stored in string s, here's one way to do it efficiently:This outputs:
You can build up a dictionary from your lines and print the whole dicts numbers after each line you parsed:Output:
You can create a list of counts which will keep track of each level. Increment current level, and reset all levels next to it.Output:
