I am working on a code in which I am traversing a list, for example:There are 8 elements(assuming that 'a' will always have even numbers) and I want to access 2 at a time, means the loop will execute 4 times. Every time the variable will increase by 2, like the odd and even numbersthe output will be an error because list index starts from 0 and ends on 3 and the list index will be out of range. this will not print 1 and 8 what do I have to do?
For the most recent version of your code the minimal fix (most close to the original solution)A better solution isTo handle even length use range((len(a) + 1) /2)
I think changing 2*i-1 to 2*i+1. That's a simple question.
You can iterate two-by-two without having to worry about indexing by creating a single iterator with iter and then zip it with itself.This is similar to the grouper function from itertools' recipes and has the advantage of being able to treat any iterarable, including non-indexed ones such as generators.Output
