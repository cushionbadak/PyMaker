I am learning Python and I have an exercise to work through:Write a program which will read in lines from a file and select the first three fields (separated by blank space). The program should  write a file called error which contains lines which look like Line  362 did not have 3 fields, to identify those which did not have 3  fields. The program should then write, into a file called output, the  first three fields in the form of a string of width 10, followed by  two floats of width 10 each with 3 places after the decimal point. In  case this is not possible, the fields should be written as strings of  width 10.I have done half of it, but I can't get the list items into the error exceptions report.  I don't get any error messages; I just get an empty file.  My exceptions data is displayed in Python but the write output is missing.This is my code:How can I resolve this? I don't need a full answer to the question, just a suggestion as to how I can get the 'short list fields' I have identified into the text file.Thank you!
you can use to keep track of the line number, and write a more informative error message.
By default open(file, 'w') will delete any existing file with the name file and create a new file. So maybe you are iterating over these lines correctly, but with every loop you call open(file, 'w') erasing any lines you had. An easy fix for this would be to move it outside the for loop or you could use open(file, 'a')This will append to any existing file instead of rewriting it. See Python Doc StackOverflow Post for more details
This should work. Please note that opening of file error.txt is done before entering for loop. Reason: In every iteration you only need appending a line to file and not opening file, appending line and closing file. So open your file once, do your stuff and then finally close it.
