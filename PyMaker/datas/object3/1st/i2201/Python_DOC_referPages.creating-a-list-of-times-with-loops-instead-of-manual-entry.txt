I'm trying to create a list with options in 30 minute intervals from 9am-5pm.e.g.How would I be able to accomplish this but using loops or a method that doesn't look this verbose?
Create an iterable of datetime objects, starting at 9 o'clock.Turn the datetime objects back to strings.Iterate over times_str in pairs. The itertools documentation has a recipe for this called pairwise. You can either copy-paste the function or import it from more_itertools (which needs to be installed).Output:You could encapsulate everything with a function.Demo:

You can do something like this..:You can change the number of times you run the loop. Change the condition to run until hours reach your desired time. You can also make some edits to get the key as 09:00 instead of 9:0.Basically, for a dict, you just have to have a key value as a string. You can use any string you want, and assign a value to it. Easy as pie.
Short and simple code with pandas:
