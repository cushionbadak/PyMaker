I am given the following data-file: stars.csvI have been given a class definition (and some methods) as shown:I was asked to a write a function read_stars(csv_filename) that takes as a parameter the name of a CSV file of person data and returns a list of Person objects, one for each line in the input file (and in the same order). The function should only require 7 - 10 lines. Then I need to a create a new function filter_people(people, status) that takes a list of people and a "status" string and returns a new list containing just the people from the original list whose health status equals the status parameter. Here's what I came up with so far:So far, so good. So, where am I stuck? In manipulating the filter_stars GLOBAL function. Is it possible to create a global function filter_stars(people, status) such that the output will be classified based on their bmi and status?Test codeExpected OutputI am finding it impossible to come up with a global function that can output as above.Help appreciated.
