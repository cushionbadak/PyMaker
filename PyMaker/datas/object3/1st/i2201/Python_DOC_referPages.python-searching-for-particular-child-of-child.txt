I am trying to download xml data (which I have done) parse it (which I have done) and search through xml data to return a result. After saving the xml file locally (because it's pretty large), I want to search for a substance, say, "Substance 2", and then search for a product name, "Product XYZ", then search for a MRL data under that product particular to that substance. (Note, substances are all unique, but products are not, because products are repeated under every different substance)To be more clear I will give an example: if the substance search term was "Substance 2", and the product search term was "Product XYZ", the the program would return "0.567".[edit]The part of my code relating to this question so far is:This doesn't throw an error, but it doesn't print any output either.[\edit]Please let me know if more details are needed. Help appreciated.
