Natural Text
I am unable to format in Python correctly. Below is what my list looks like. I am not sure why the spacing is off on some of the fields. Below is my code as well as a snip of how it reads.
If the name is too big(over 6 char) the tab will be moved one more down. You can either check if the name is too big and move it down own tab.By using something likenumTabs = '\t' * (2-len(last_name)//6Or a better approach would use something like str.format as mentioned by @Michael Butscher in the comments.
