I want to loop inside a dictionary that has arrays as values and get each element of the array. How do I do that? I tried this but it didn't work:
It appears you are trying to use count as an indexer. But this isn't necessary are you iterating over the elements of each list for each dictionary value. In addition, for iterating over values only, you can use the dict.values view. So you can use:If you wish to create a list combining all elements in all list values, you can use itertools.chain:
You can get a complete list of all the values by pulling each item from within d.values() Expanded 
You have the basic idea right. There are a few ways you can do this. I recommend reading py docs for the classes dict, enum, and list; create solutions using all of them; and to document your code with explanations of what's happening for each of them. It sounds kind of 'douchey', and I apologize for that, but it's important to understand how to read/use this information. As to fixing the errors in your code snippet:Another way to do this:And another:One more just for because:If you're struggling to understand the docs, then that's what you should ask for help on. Just be specific with what you're not understanding, and keep at it. You're not always going to feel like you need a manual on how to understand the manual. This is just python however. It has nothing to do with Django.
