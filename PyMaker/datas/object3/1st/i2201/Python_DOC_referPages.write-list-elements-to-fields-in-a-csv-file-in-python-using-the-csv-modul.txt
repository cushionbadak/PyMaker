Each element of 26 chars is a element in the list:The result of the list comprehension looks promising:But when i finally write the list with the writerow()-function.The content in the csv looks like this:Really this is good enough for my work but i wonder why every charackter is now comma seperated? And iam looking at the posts and the csv docs but i dont get it.Maybe someone can answert this question.Thanks in advanceBen
you're writing a list of strings using csv.writerows, which writes several rows.This function accepts an iterable of iterables. So when passing a list of strings, you're satisfying the input but it's not what you're expecting: the strings are seen as iterables, and are split character by character.To write all your data, 1 string per row, use:(well, csv module is hardly useful in that case, better use writelines on a file handle)To write all your data in 1 row use writerow (note the lack of s in the end):although comments suggest wisely that you want to split your strings again according to spaces, then use:or
