Background: I have a small feature in my Tkinter application which randomizes two random values from list and prints them to GUI. But I'm struggling to get right image (team logo) with random value.Goal: is to random team name (from list of 28 teams) and GUI should show team logo also. Pressing button "RANDOM" and it generates Team1 & Team2 and both should have logos next of the texts.I have done research about: I had time with this answer, but I could not figure it out. This dice game kinda does it but I need two values instead of one and my list is full of strings.Example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/27913052/5132305Now when I am pressing RANDOM-button, it does random correctly values to variables x & y from list.I also have 28 images in folder project/images. All of the images are "team_name.jpg"Question 1: How do I loop list and match team name and logo?All help is appreciated and some code review would be great also! (First question in SO!)
Comment: Implement Team.imageRunning your Team.image gives me:  You can't add a new attribute to buildin str object.This will work, change to:Comment: Do I need to make another tk.Label for team image?  There is no need to do so, this depends on your desired layout.Start with one tk.Label(self, image=image, textvariable=name)This looks like:Relevant: label-on-top-of-image-in-python Comment: Is it possible that self.visitor can show team+logo?  It's not the function of class Team() to show anything, it's the job of tk.Lable(....Relevant: updating-tkinter-label-with-an-imageQuestion: Two random values from list needs to match with imagesThis approach don't use two lists, it defines both values(team name, team image) in one class. Therefore no matching is needed.For example:Output:Tested with Python: 3.4.2
