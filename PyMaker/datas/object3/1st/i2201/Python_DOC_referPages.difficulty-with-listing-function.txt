Write a function named "counting" that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the number of values in the input that are between 29.88 and 48.05 not including these end points. (My code below)How do I return the number of values in the input instead of the first number of an input?
your return statement is indented too deep; you should return it after the for loop. also sum is not a good name as it is a built-in function that you overwrite.and you should add 1 to the sum (you are counting) and not x itself.you could also try this using the built-in function sum:(this is actually short for sum(1 for x in number if 29.88 < x < 48.05) and works because True is basically 1 and False is basically 0).
Or to be similar to yours:Or can do one-liner, len:
You could also use filter() on your list to keep only elements that the given function evaluates to true.
