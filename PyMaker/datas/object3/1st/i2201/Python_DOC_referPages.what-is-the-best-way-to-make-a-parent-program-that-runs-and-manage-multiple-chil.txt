I have a Python program that runs facial recognition service. The program comes with a Tornado server that serves a UI so I can see the recognition result. I have a few IP cameras and I want each of these cameras to have separate recognition service.  What I did right now is:  Is this a good way to do this? If let say one of the processes died, how do I check and bring it back up?
You have two options:multiprocessingrun a function in an other process, you can give args through args and kwargs.you can use shared Variable and Array with this strategysubprocessrun an other script with the command line, you can pass args in the string and get them back through sys.argv
