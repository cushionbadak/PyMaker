Natural Text
Given is a variable that contains a windows file path. I have to then go and read this file. The problem here is that the path contains escape characters, and I can't seem to get rid of it. I checked os.path and pathlib, but all expect the correct text formatting already, which I can't seem to construct.For example this. Please note that fPath is given, so I cant prefix it with r for a rawpath.How can I turn fPath via some function or method from:toI've tried also tried .replace("\","/"), which doesnt work.I'm using Python 3.7 for this.
if you would like to do replace then doreplace("\\","/")
You can use os.path.abspath() to convert it:
You can use Path function from pathlib library. 
I've solved it.The issues lies with the python interpreter. \t and all the others don't exist as such data, but are interpretations of nonprint characters.So I got a bit lucky and someone else already faced the same problem and solved it with a hard brute-force method:http://code.activestate.com/recipes/65211/I just had to find it.After that I have a raw string without escaped characters, and just need to run the simple replace() on it to get a workable path.
