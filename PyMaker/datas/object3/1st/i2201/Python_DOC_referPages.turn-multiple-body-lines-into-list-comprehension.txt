I have the following code that I want to write as list comprehension:How do I treat the multiple lines in the body?Basically, I want to transform my "in_str" into the following:
You have a varitey options with this one, and more that arent listed
How do I treat the multiple lines in the bodyBy simplifying the expression down; you don't need multiple statements to build the nested list:gives you the same result as declaring x = [] and appending two the results of two expressions.That would make the list comprehensionNext, you don't need to call list(word) to get the length of a string or to address individual characters. Strings are already sequences, so len(word) and word[i] also work:Next, if you used the enumerate() function, you can generate both a running index to replace the range() loop, and get access to the individual characters of word without having to index; you can start the running index at 1 with a second argument to enumerate() (the default is to start at 0):If you don't have to have a list for each pair, just use enumerate(word, 1) directly in loops and get tuples:Demo:
Please try this line:Or with lists: or a version from the comments (by @tobias_k): 
I would do as such;new_list = [list(x) for x in enumerate(word)]this gives;[[0, 'i'], [1, 'n'], [2, '_'], [3, 's'], [4, 't'], [5, 'r']]EDIT: I see @Chris_Rands beat me to the punch, put it as an answer good sir!
