I am trying to print a "triangle" if you will, with the letters in a string. If I have the word "right" the output should be something likeI am aware that you loop through the string with a for loop without indicesor with indicesbut I'm not sure how I would add each letter onto the next line.
Here you index, so you print the character on the i-th index. You can use slicing [Pythoncentral] to generate the list to (and perhaps including) i. For example:Notice the colon here, it means that we slice the string up to (but without) the i-th index. So string[:4], will generate a list up to (but without) index 4. So the string will have length 4.
You can achieve that using slicing and the enumerate builtin:enumerate generates pairs of indexes and elements. Example:
s[:1] means that you print all the characters in s from start to
