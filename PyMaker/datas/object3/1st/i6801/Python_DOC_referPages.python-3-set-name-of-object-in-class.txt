I want to set the name of a class to one of the variables within the class so that when I print classes I get their names, I've tried setting __name__ but it did not work.this is my classI create a list of objects then try print theminstead of SNMPData object at 0x.... is it possible to print instead?
Each class has a __repr__ and __str__ function which takes a single argument, self, representing the object itself. The __repr__ function returns the true string representation of the object and the __str__ function is used for str(obj) which is used for printing.You can do the same for __str__(self) if you want to observe this behaviour for printing.
You are looking to define __repr__ which should return a printable representation of the object. The official definition of __repr__repr(object):Return a string containing a printable representation of an object.  For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that  would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval(),  otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets  that contains the name of the type of the object together with  additional information often including the name and address of the  object. A class can control what this function returns for its  instances by defining a repr() method.bottom line is that the output from __str__ is meant to be readable by human ** whereas the output from **__repr__ is meant to be read by the Python interpreter.  so when you give the string to the interpreter, it should recreate the object. Also If an object doesn't have a __str__ method then __repr__ is used instead.
You are able to change a text representation of your custom object by overriding __repr__ and __str__ methods:
Define __repr__(self) and __str__(self).The former is the "official" string representation. The latter is what is returned when you cast the object to a str.
