I am new to python, to sensors and Stackoverflow. I am working on a project at my uni to read 4 sensor data on COM4 of my pc through pyserial. I wrote the below code to accomplish this:I get the output something like:Values 69,45,117,994 are readings from the 4 sensors respectively. I did some research and changed print (response) to print (response.decode('utf-8')) , now I get the output which looks like:I really need some help in separating and storing the sensor values from my initial output or from the output that I received after adding print (response.decode('utf-8')) as separate variables, something like field1=69, field2=45, field3=117, field4=994. So that I can send this to thingspeak API: PS: Scalable - more number of sensors might be added at later stage of this project, so the number of data values received will also increase.Please, I really need some help with this.
Good call on the conversion to text from bytes. Now suppose you store that decoded string, as inYou can use the splitlines string method to get strings for each line:Then you can interpolate those values into some template to give you the URL you want. If you'd prefer a list of the values, just use
