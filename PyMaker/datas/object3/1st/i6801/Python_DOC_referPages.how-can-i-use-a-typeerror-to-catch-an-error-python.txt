I created a Palindrome Game where a user is asked for a word and will get a response saying if it is a palindrome or if it isn't. I wanna check to make sure that the user has input a string and not a number and to try to catch it.My goal is to catch the error when the user inputs a number and not a string
You can check the condition isalpha() for string input
