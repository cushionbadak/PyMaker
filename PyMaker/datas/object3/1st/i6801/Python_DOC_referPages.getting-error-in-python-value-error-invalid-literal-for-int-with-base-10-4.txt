i want adding and subtracting this type of data: $12,587.30.which returns answer in same format.how can do this ?Here is my code example:I removed $ sign and convert it to int but it gives me base 10 error.
You mentioned you want to do arithmetic operations to the numbers (addition/subtraction) so you probably want them in float instead. The difference between an integer (int) and float is that integers do not carry decimal points.Additionally, as @officialaimm mentioned you need to remove the commas too, for examplewill give youSo putting it into your codeAn additional note for when you parse a floating point number (same applies to integers too), you may want to watch out for empty values, i.e.is bad. One of the things u can do in case col_amount and col_amount2 may be empty at some point is default them to 0 if that happensYou also want to read this to know about workaround to problems you may face with floating point arithmetic https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
There are two things you are missing here. Firstly python int(...) cannot parse numbers with commas so you will need to remove commas as well by using .replace(',',''). Secondly int() cannot parse floating point values you will have to use float(...) first and after that maybe typecast it to int using int or math.ceil, math.floor appropriately as per your choice and needs. Maybe something like this will solve your problem: If you are doing these sorts of things quite often in your code, making a function as such might be handy:
