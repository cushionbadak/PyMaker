I am using tweepy to capture twitter data, I would like to know if I have how to export the tweets to a json, txt or csv file?My code:I have tried to do it through functions, but every time I run into errors. In the txt file, it only writes the first tweet and json, informs that "its not serelized".Where is my error guys?
If you try to write your tweet to a JSON file, json.dump will attempt to convert it to the JSON format. This process is called serialization. json.dump only supports a small set of types in the default Encoder, which you can read about in the Python documentation. Since the class that tweeps uses to represent a Tweet is not part of these types, the json module raises the exception you mentioned.As a solution, you could serialize a dictionary containing various data about the tweet, here's an example:Note that using append mode with JSON files is usually not a good idea. You could use a JSON list instead.This reply to another question might help you with this.Edit: Here's an example for saving a JSON list:
