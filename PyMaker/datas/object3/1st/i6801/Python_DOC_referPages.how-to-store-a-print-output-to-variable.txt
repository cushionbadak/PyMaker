Natural Text
I wanted to know if there was a way to reproduce an output from one section of a code to the end of the code. So I am assuming I need to assign a variable to the print output function. Anyway this is part of my code that I want to store variable output to a variable and reproduce an output anywhere in my code:
You'll need to assign the result of output.format to a variable; not the value of the print function.The print function will always return None. In your loop, if you need the output for each iteration, store them in a list.
