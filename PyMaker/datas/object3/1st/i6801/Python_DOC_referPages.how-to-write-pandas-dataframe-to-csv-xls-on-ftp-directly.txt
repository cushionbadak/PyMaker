How to create a .csv or .xls file on ftp directly from Pandas dataframe as I do not want to create one on local machine and then push it on ftp. Many thanks in advance :)
As the docs say:Store a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate STOR command: "STOR filename". file is a file object (opened in binary mode) which is read until EOF using its read() method in blocks of size blocksize to provide the data to be stored…So, you need to give it a file-like object with an appropriate read method.A string is not a file-like object, but an io.BytesIO is. So:for reference you can refer Python write create file directly in FTP
