First of all heres the code:As per my last question I'm following this blog post:https://pawelmhm.github.io/asyncio/python/aiohttp/2016/04/22/asyncio-aiohttp.htmlI tried to adapt my code as close as possible to the example implementation but this code is still not making any requests and printing the headers in bound_headers as I wish.Can somebody spot whats wrong with this code ?
response.headers is a regular property, no need to put await before the callasyncio.wait on other hand accepts a list of futures and returns (done, pending) pair.Looks like you should replace await wait() call with await asyncio.gather(*tasks) (gather doc)
