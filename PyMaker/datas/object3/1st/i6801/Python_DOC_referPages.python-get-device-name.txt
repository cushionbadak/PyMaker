im not new in Python but I have one question left: How do I get the name of the Computer that im on/Device ? I tried many things, this is the last thing, I was in the os Module and found something but if i start the script, it gives me an error that in the os module isn't a 'getDeviceName' function.
would also work just fine.
to get the machine name, see platform.node():https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.nodeexample:
