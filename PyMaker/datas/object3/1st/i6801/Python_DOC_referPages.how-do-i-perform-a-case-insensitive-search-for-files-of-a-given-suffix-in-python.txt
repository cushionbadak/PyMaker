I'm looking for the equivalent of find $DIR -iname '*.mp3', and I don't want to do the kooky ['mp3', 'Mp3', MP3', etc] thing. But I can't figure out how to combine the re*.IGNORECASE stuff with the simple endswith() approach. My goal is to not miss a single file, and I'd like to eventually expand this to other media/file types/suffixes.TIA for any feedback
You can try this :)Python's string.split() will separate the string into a list, depending on what parameter is given, and you can access the suffix by [-1], the last element in the list
Don't bother with os.walk. Learn to use the easier, awesome pathlib.Path instead. Like so:"One-liner", if you're into that sort of thing (multiple lines for clarity):
The regex equivalent of .endswith is the $ sign.To use your example above, you could do this;Though it might be more accurate to do this;which makes sure that the filename ends with .mp3 rather than picking up files such as test.amp3.This is a pretty good example of a situation that doesn't really require regex - so while you're welcome to learn from these examples, it's worth considering the alternatives provided by other answerers.
