I currently am plotting multiple plots across 4 axis using seaborn. In order to do this, I manually select nrows=4 and then run 4 boxplots at once.I would like to rewrite this function so that it automatically recognizes the unique number of labels, creates the number of axes automatically, then plots.Does anyone know how I can accomplish this? Thank you.
The assignmentmakes ax a NumPy array of axes. This array can be one- or two-dimensional (depending on the value of the nrows and ncols parameters),so calling ax.ravel() is used to ensure it is one-dimensional. Now you can loop over zip(label, ax.ravel()) to call sns.boxplot once for each label and axes.Note that zip ends when the shortest of the iterators end. So even thoughlabel has length 1000, only the first 4 items are used in the loop since thereare only 4 axes.Alternatively, just assign label = ['A','B','C','D'] since that variable is not used anywhere else (at least, not in the posted code).
