In the following block of codes:I understand that the code will run 5 times where i = 0 to 4. However, I don't understand the logic behind the + operators added before and after the str() function.How can this + function() + applied to other scenarios?
str(i) is the string representation of i. Documentation:Return a str version of object.If a, b and c are strings, then a + b + c is the string resulting of their concatenation.Therefore, with i being an int between 0 and 4, say 3, 'Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')' is the folowing string:
In python, + is used for string contate.i.e:The output will be :
str is a function that returns a string representation of i, so:Calling a function that returns a string within a string concatenation 'A' + func() + 'B', will just use replace the function call with the string returned by the function (if no error or exceptions were raised), example:
