I was recently playing around with the following piece of code:On my local version of Python, it seemed to work as expected:My version is:Then I proceeded to try the same thing on repl.it: Code HereThe most information I could find about the version is:Which then gives this output:I am absolutely baffled... anyone care to explain?
The value of the name __builtins__ is an implementation detail:As an implementation detail, most modules have the name __builtins__ made available as part of their globals. The value of __builtins__ is normally either this module [the builtins module] or the value of this moduleâ€™s __dict__ attribute. Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate implementations of Python.(https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html)
Because possibly due to repl.it's sandboxing implementation or something along those lines, their version of __builtins__ is actually a dict.
