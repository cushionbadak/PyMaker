I'm trying to figure out a way to have argparse positional arguments be mutually exclusive to an optional argument.For example:Right now, if I were to just try '--interactive', it tells me that I'm missing positional arguments.Example code:I was wondering if there is an elegant way to do this (preferably using argparse functionality) so that '--interactive' disables the requirement of using the two positional arguments.
Usually positional arguments can not be omitted. You can try nargs='*' as an alternative.Use list args.ab to store positional argument. If it is omitted, then args.ab will be an empty list.
