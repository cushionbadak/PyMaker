example: my_list(1) = 10.0 (is there a way to do this?)I'm trying to create a for loop that prints each index separately, so basically I want to cycle through each index and print it  
If you want the non-Pythonic way
Just iterate over it:If you want to print the indices as well, use enumerate():
