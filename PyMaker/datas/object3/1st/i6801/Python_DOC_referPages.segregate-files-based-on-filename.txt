I've got a directory containing multiple images, and I need to separate them into two folders based on a portion of the file name. Here's a sample of the file names:22DEC167603520981127600_03.jpg13NOV162302999230157801_07.jpg08JAN147603811108236510_02.jpg21OCT152302197661710099_07.jpg07MAR172302551529900521_01.jpg19FEB173211074174309177_09.jpg19FEB173211881209232440_02.jpg19FEB172302491000265198_04.jpgI need to move the files into two folders according to the numbers in bold after the date - so files containing 2302 and 3211 would go into an existing folder named "panchromatic" and files with 7603 would go into another folder named "sepia". I've tried multiple examples from other questions, and none seem to fit this problem. I'm very new to Python, so I'm not sure what example to post. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
You can do this the easy way or the hard way.Easy wayTest if your filename contains the substring you're looking for.This solution in its current form is susceptible to mis-classification, as the number we're looking for can appear by chance later in the string. I'll leave you to find ways to mitigate this.Hard wayRegular expressions. Match the four letter digits after the date with a regular expression. Left for you to explore!
Without giving you the solution, here's what I'd recommend.Use os.listdir to iterate over files in your directory.Check the 4 digits by slicing your string. By the looks of it, you'd need to get file[6:10]Check if int(file[6:10]) in {2302, 2311}. If yes, dst = /path/to/panchromatic. Else, dst = /path/to/sepia/Use shutil.move to move files. Something like shutil.move(os.path.join(path, file), dst), where os.path.join joins path artefacts.Make sure you import os and import shutil at the top of your script.
Self explanative, with Python 3, or Python 2 + backport pathlib:
