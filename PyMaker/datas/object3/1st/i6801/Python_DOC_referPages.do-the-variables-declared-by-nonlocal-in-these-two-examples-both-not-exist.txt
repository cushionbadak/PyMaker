In the following two examples, is it correct that the variables declared by nonlocal do not exist? Then why is there an error in the first example, while there is no error in the second example? Thanks.Example 1:Example 2:
Per python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-nonlocal-statementnonlocal looks for the nearest enclosing scope. In Example 1, you have:count is two "scope levels" away and is also in the global scope, so nonlocal throws a syntax error since it is not in the nonlocal scope. In Example 2:Since a in example 2 was referenced in an adjacent nonlocal scope, it doesn't throw an error.
