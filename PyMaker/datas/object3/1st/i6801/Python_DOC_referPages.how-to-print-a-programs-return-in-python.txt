This question already has an answer here:Python - output from functions? [duplicate]                    3 answers                I am completely new to Python. I have a simple Program that finds the greatest common denominator (GCD) of two numbers. It goes like thisThis text is currently in a notepad document titled gcd.py on my desktop. As you can see the program doesn't actually print anything it just returns the greatest common denominator. I need to actually print the results by doing the following print(gcd(25,10)). I don't know where I can put that line to get the results I need. I tried inputting it into the windows command line by doing python print(gcd(25,10)). But that doesn't work. Neither does print(gcd(25,10)) in the python interpreter. I think I am supposed to put it in the python interpreter, but that the interpreter has to be set to the correct directory of my desktop (where the gcd file is found)but I cant seem to do that. I tried o.chdir and when I print(cwd) it prints the correct directory but it still doesn't work.This is my first time using python so I'm a little confused. 
Try this. You need to print it out in the same file or import it from another:
If you want to print from inside the file, put this line at the end after the function definition as suggested in the previous answer.If you want to print from outside the file, navigate to the directory and type:This will load your function into the interpreter. You can then print the value.
