I have two lists.Say,I would like to map the two lists together to get this output:I am getting an output of something like this: <map object at 0x7f639461efd0>I know my problem lies in this line:I think it's because of Python 3. Just not too sure how to fix it and get the output I want.
Use itertools.zip_longest():Note that you don't necessarily need to coerce it to a list to use it, it's just convenient for printing.
If you are not allowed to import external modules, then this may help:
inline if else could work - but this relies on knowing the shorter list from the startactually a 'one-liner' list comprehension but with line breaks in hope of improving readabilityedit: it can be generalized to treat the inputs symmetrically
