Consider the following Python command-line program.  It doesn't work because it is incomplete, but I think it illustrates the problem:Thus, the problem is that this scripts needs user input while it's launching expensive parallel processes.  But then there is the moment when user interaction is not needed anymore.  Then, I ask the user to background this process with shell actions.However, can this be achieved also by the program itself?(Side note: The core of the problem is the entanglement of user input with firing the “expensive computations”.  Therefore, I cannot separate both in two scripts, and letting one spawning the other as a daemon.)
The command screen may help you.Use screen -L to create a new session and run you application. After inputting some data, you can press "Ctrl-A" and then press "D" on your keyboard to detach the session.Now, your application is running in the background.If you want to do some other things or input more data, you can use command screen -r to reattach to the previous session.screen is just like a virtual screen, so you can switch your program to the background or foreground according to your needs.
