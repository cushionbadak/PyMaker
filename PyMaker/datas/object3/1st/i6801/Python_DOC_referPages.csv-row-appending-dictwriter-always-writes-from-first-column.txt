Input file:Expected CSV output (Sum columns cat1, cat2 and cat3 and append the sum.):Code:Actual Output:Question:The csv.DictWriter is not appending row with correct column alignment. I understand that I have 5 columns but I am providing values for only 3 columns. But I thought as this is DictWriter, it will append values to only a matching column header. If I open my Actual Output CSV, it is quite visual that columns are not aligned:
You should include the column names for the first two in fieldnames:Blank values will be written to the first two columns if the keys are not available in the dictionary.
You can declare you writter like that:So you don't have to specify all the missing keys : for all the missing keys, restval char will fill with the value you chose. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter
