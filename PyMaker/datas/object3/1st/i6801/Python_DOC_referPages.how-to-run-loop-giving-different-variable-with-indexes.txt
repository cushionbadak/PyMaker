I have a result list i.eI can access each element byNow i want to run a for loop on this result list to save each output in different variable aswidth1,top1,height1,left1,width2,top2,height2,left2How to do so?
And now you can access each value by index like width[0]
Since you have the concept of "Rect" here, you could define a data structure to represent it, for instance a class or a tuple.It is straightforward with a namedtuple:You get:
As @jedwards pointed out in a comment, this is almost certainly a bad idea.However, you can use operator.itemgetter to return a tuple of values. This would let you express your idea somewhat compactly:Of course, this assumes that you know how many results there are, and that there are always the same number, and that you need to deal with them all at the same time.You're probably much better off dealing with them one or two at a time, and using a variable as a reference to just the faceRect dictionary:
Similarly to @ingvar's answer you could use a list comprehension instead of a map with lambda, and this could be run in both Python 2 and 3.So, again, if you wanted to use the 2nd result's width afterwards for example, you would access it with width[1] since indexes start counting from 0.
