When I write following code:I get output: [' f ', ' friendly ']But when I provide extra space between f & fast, I get following output which I expected from the previous one.Code is as followsOutput: Can anyone tell me why I am not getting later output in first case (without inserting extra space between f & fast)?
Because your pattern ends in \s. Regex matches are non-overlapping, so the first match ' f ' matches the trailing space, making the rest of the string begin with 'fast' instead of ' fast'. 'fast' does not match a pattern starting with \s
The space is consumed by ' f ' after it is matched. Now the next search starts from 'fast and friendly dog'. But now fast does not have a leading space and thus does not match.If you want the space not be consumed then try a positive lookbehind search.
