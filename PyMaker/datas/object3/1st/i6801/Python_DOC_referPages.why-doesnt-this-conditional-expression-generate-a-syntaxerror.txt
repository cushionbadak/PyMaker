When "if" is combined with "or", which one Python prioritize first:for example:is it (a == b) or c  or is it a == (b or c).I assume the correct logical form should be the former one but I accidentally used:and to my surprise, it did not generate any errors and did the purpose.  
From the documentation:The following table summarizes the operator precedence in Python, from  lowest precedence (least binding) to highest precedence (most  binding).So, to answer your question,Is equivalent to The code if gender == "m" or "M" will work like this: Is gender == 'm"? If yes, the result is True. Otherwise, test the "truthiness" of "M". Is "M" "true"? If it is, the result is true. To understand how this works, you should know that all objects have a truthiness associated to it. All non-zero integers, non-empty strings and data structures are True. 0, 0.0, '', None, False, [], {} and set() are all False.For more details, visit How do I test one variable against multiple values?
