when i run this, it doesn't print anything because i dont think its going through all the sublists. how can i get this to work?
You can use itertools.chain.from_iterableHere you have a live example
in is not recursive. It tries to find the item in the list itself. If the item is a list, in won't go down in the list to look for the string.In your case, you couldcheck if the list has at least 2 itemsperform in on the second itemlike this:of course if the structure is more complex/not fixed, you have to use a recursive approach which tests item type, like this: Python nested list recursion search
you can also use this function. It will be helpful to print 1 in all cases of nested lists. Just pass your list object to this function.
you can also check it by count. len(each)>1 checks the number of list item.each[1] is the second sublist of your given list. and .count("Sheet A") returns occurrence number of Sheet A.
