You can use glob.You can use regex if you want to look in different sub-directories. Use 'filepath/*/*.xlsx' to search the next level. More info here https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html
Use glob with its recursive feature for searching sub-directories:Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html
