stat.py has a helper function to go from the st_mode (integer) as reported by os.stat into the familiar "stringy" format (I don't know if this representation has a proper name).Is there a helper function to go the other way?  This is what I tried, but it's producing wrong results.  That's not treating the first character denoting file type correctly, and not handling sticky bits etc
Python is open-source, you can just read the source code for the stat module and write the inverse function.See: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/stat.py#L112Note that I'm being "naughty" and accessing private members of the stat module. The usual caveats apply.Also note that the documentation for stat.filemode is incorrect anyway, since 0o100000 is technically not part of the file mode, it is the file type S_IFREG. From inode(7):POSIX refers to the stat.st_mode bits corresponding to the mask        S_IFMT (see below) as the file type, the 12 bits corresponding to the mask 07777 as the file mode bits and the least significant 9 bits (0777) as the file permission bits.
