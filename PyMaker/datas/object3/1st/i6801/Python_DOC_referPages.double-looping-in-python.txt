Please help me with this.For example, if I have a = [2, 5, 8, 4] and b = [1, 3, 6, 9].how would I used "for" loop to pick an element in 'a' and its corresponding element in 'b' to use in other function? For instance, pick 2 in 'a' and pick 1 in 'b' then next pick 5 in 'a' and 3 in 'b'. 
What you want is the zip() function:Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.You can use it like this:You get:You can also use map() function:Return an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable, yielding the results.Your function should return a value:You get the same result.
The situation you are facing is called "Parallel Arrays".  Wikipedia has a great explanation and example code.
If you know the lists are the same length, just use zip:If your lists might be different lengths, zip will give you a sequence the length of your shortest iterable. Use itertools.izip_longest if you need a sequence the length of your longest iterable.
Can't you just access one element after another using the same position in one for loop defining a function?number: is the number you want to search
