I am in an introduction to Anaconda class and I need to write a program to determine how many times a dice roll(s) land on a certain amount of faces. However, I cannot get it to print my answer correctly.
Your problem is your print statement. You try to print a string then something called end then another string, and so forth. I think you want that end to be an end-of-line character.Instead of printing something likeuseNote that "\n" is the end-of-line character in Python. My code also uses a feature of Python where you can combine string literals by placing them next to each other. Let lets you see the individual lines more clearly. Your code failed because you tried to do this with a string variable, namely end, and you did not even define that variable.
From Python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#printprint(*objects, sep=’ ‘, end=’\n’, file=sys.stdout, flush=False)As you can see, the end is one of the parameters for the print() function, and by default, end=’\n’. So to use it correctly, you just have to change the end variable (which may not be directly applicable to your code)Here are some examples:And also, if I am understanding your logic correctly, the same code can be re-written as such. P.S. Rather than attaching an image, please copy and paste your code next time, so that we can copy n paste to test.
