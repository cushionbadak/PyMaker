Natural Text
I gave the input 0 1 5 , the answer should be 5 but it is not showing me ...,help me out with the syntax
Your loop will run twice for i = 3, and i = 4.The first run:The second run:Now ans is 2. It's not clear why you think it should be 5.
As per Python 3, print command syntax is print('your text')print(variable)print('your text ans: ',ans)Without semi-circular brackets print won't work.Refer: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html
I think this is what you are trying to do:Note that for i in range(2,c) i will be 2 then 3 and then 4. It will not be 5 (=c) it stops at c-1.Edit: if you just want the loop to run c times you can say for i in range(c). This way it will run for i=0,1,2,...,c-1.
