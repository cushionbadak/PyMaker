Is there a regex alternative for rsplit? Or is there a  better way to achieve what I'm trying to do overall?Example content from info string:number of name servers is presumed unknown, and they Must be scraped using regex.
You do not need to split anything, but to search lines starting with "Name Server:".The right tool is re.findall:Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.Here is the regex I use. It looks for stuff that starts with "Name Server: and followed by multiple occurences of a non-breakline character.The lookbehind expression (unfortunately no direct link, but go to the documentation and hit ctrl+f -> "lookbehind") (?<=...) says that I don't want that part in the results.Output:Additionally, it's generally better to compile the regex before using it, because re will compile it anyway.Compiling it beforehand and calling the functions as methods of it might save a lot of time in loops for example.Here, it also allows you to specify flags, such as re.IGNORECASE:Although such flags could be passed to the functions as well:
