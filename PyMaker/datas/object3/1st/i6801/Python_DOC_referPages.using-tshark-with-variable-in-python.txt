I am new to python and I need to use a variable in the os.system command, here's my code so farthen i want to use the varable s in an os.system command so I was thinking something like os.system("shutdown -s -t 10 -c" 's')I don't want answers for that specific command I just want to know in general but if you are going to use an example use shutdown
then i want to use the varable s in an os.systemUse string.format function.
You can use os.system to execute the particular command, in which case you can join the two strings either by using the + operator, string formatting (.format()), string substitution or some other method.However, consider the case when the user enters the command 5; rm -rf / or some other malicious command.  Instead of using os.system you might want to take a look at subprocessIf you use subprocess you might find the following example handy:
os.system takes a string as the argument, so you can use anything that modifies a string. For example, string formatting:
Use subprocess.check_call, pass a list of args and you can add the variable wherever you like:
Passing place-holder "%s string alongside os.system" should work.os.system() will execute the command in shell.
The plus sign joins two stringsNo quotes are used around s.  That way you get the value the user entered and not just a literal "s".
