In my python function I want to use (read,query (if statement check) and then perform other statements) on a global variable within a function.To do so within the function I have to declare the variable as global.I want to pass the function a variable then use the passed variable to declare the correct global variable as global.Any help would be greatly appreciated :)
You do not need to create the global state var in your function; you can just change its value,
The comment by Hugh is right, but if you still want to do that you can:See docs here for python 3.6EDITFor python 2.7 see here
