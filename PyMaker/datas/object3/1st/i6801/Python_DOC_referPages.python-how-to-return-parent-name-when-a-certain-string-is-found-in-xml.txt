I have a xml file and i am searching looking for a specific string in it. when that string is found, i want to return it's parent name. here is my xml:I want to search for "unfinished" and return "Capacity" as "source" and "AccuCapacityApp" as "Main".i tried this but it prints nothing:
You are iterating all message nodes using tree.findall('context/message') but you need the translation nodes (they hold the type attribute). So this will work as a subsitute to your code:It will iterate the message nodes caontaining a child translation with attribute type that equals to undefined. For more guidance please read about XPath in Python docs. Notice I used iterfind which is more efficient.Next, for achieving what you want you will need to use message in order to extract source:In order to get the name tag you will need to get the parent of message. For that see this SE question. Or just get the that tag from tree (tree.find('./name')).Good luck.
