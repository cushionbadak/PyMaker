I am encountering a wide variety of error codes while scraping through a list of urls.Heres a outtake I have currently encountered:However I cannot find any clear documentation on how to avoid these errors.Errno -2 is caused by invalid cert chain, but I cannot find how I can fix this issue on my machine.Errno 113 is connection refused or no route to hostThe other errnos are not very well documented.My question is: How can I find the documentation that describes these error codes and additionally how can I handle them the best way ?
aiohttp has no specific error codes, you are observing standard OSError exceptions from python internals.https://docs.python.org/3/library/errno.html could help. Or even better google query like errno 101 return comprehensive list of articles.
