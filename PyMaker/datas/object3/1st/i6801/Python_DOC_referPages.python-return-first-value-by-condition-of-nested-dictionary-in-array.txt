Have some array with nested dictionaries:data = [{'id':1, 'name':'test'}, {'id':2, 'name':'test'}, ....., {'id':N, 'name':'test'}]Trying to return first id value where name=test:  val = [x['id'] for x in data if x['name'] == 'test'][0] expected result: val = 1But having exception: list index out of rangeWhat's wrong?
Your code works fine for me using your (slightly edited) sample data:However, if there is no dictionary containing a name that matches the target string:This is because the list comprehension will create an empty list because there are no dictionaries with d['name'] set to 'blah'. Indexing an empty list results in the IndexError exception. It's the same as doing this:A simple way to fix this is to check the list before indexing it:here it is assumed that None can not be used as the value for an id.Another, more efficient way, again assuming that None is not a valid id is to use next() with a default value:This uses a generator expression which avoids generating a whole list containing the matched dictionaries. Instead it will iterate over the data list only until the first match is found, or the data list is exhausted.
Above program will give outputMatching ID:--> 1Matching ID:--> 2
