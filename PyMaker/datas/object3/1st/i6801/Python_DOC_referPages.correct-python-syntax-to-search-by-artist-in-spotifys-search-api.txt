What is the correct python syntax for searching by artist with Spotify's API? Maybe I'm missing something obvious (been staring at this for way too long)  Per documentation, header 'authorization' & param 'q' and 'type' are required.https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/ What I've tried:  Then I thought, maybe the parameters has to be sent as a list?:But:
A list is a list, not a hybrid of a map and a list, such as in PHP. The list() builtin accepts either 0 or 1 positional argument, which should be an iterable. I'd highly recommend you go through the official tutorial.You're probably using the python-requests library. In order to pass query parameters such as the q parameter, you'd pass a dict of parameters as the params argument:Note that the headers argument must be in its plural form, not "header".Finally, you might be interested in spotipy, a simple client for the Spotify web API.
@Ilja's answer is good. Alternatively, you can embed the params in the URL (since you have only two of them and both relatively short), example:
@Ilja's and @alfasin's answers provide good guidance but don't seem to work anymore as is. You have to change to the headers params to authorization and add the string Bearer. This works for me:
