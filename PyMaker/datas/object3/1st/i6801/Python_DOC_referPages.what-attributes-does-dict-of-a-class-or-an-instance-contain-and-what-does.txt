For the attributes of a class:The attribute __dict__ of a class or an instance doesn't include __base__, __name__. What attributes does __dict__ of a class contain, and what doesn't?How can I get all the attributes of a class?For the attributes of an instance:The attribute __dict__ of   an instance doesn't include __class__.What attributes does __dict__ of an instance contain, and what doesn't?How can I get all the attributes of an instance?Thanks.
__dict__ excludes:Any attributes (or descriptors) defined on the type (or any type in the mro).Any attributes declared as part of a type implemented in C.Any attributes declared in __slots__.The best you can do for listing all attributes is dir, but it is often unreliable.
dict is interesting. What you need to understand is how Python looks up attributes, methods, etc. Thing like name are stored in dir(instance), which is not part of the standard getattr of your class. Only explicitly defined attributes and methods are part of A.dict, the other stuff is part of a complex look-up system, the rest is looking at the class, at the subclasses, etc, until you get to 'object'.
