I am writing a tool which accepts user configuration via a json file. One piece of this config is a python regular expression and some optional regex flags. Currently the configuration for the regex flags is an array of integers which will all be run through a bitwise or (|) and sent to the re compile method.My question is how can I validate these integers to ensure that they are valid re flags?EDIT: Or potentially another solution to my problem... Is it possible for the user to specify the actual re flags in the JSON? I.e., [re.DEBUG, re.IGNORECASE] etc etc and then somehow translate those from the JSON file in my python script?
You can define a dictionary of all possible flags (they are really few, see re 6.2.2. Module Contents), and just get the value by the corresponding key.A Python demo:If you still want to go with numbers instead:
