While it would seem logical, the documentation does not explicitly state it:Interact with process: Send data to stdin. Read data from stdout and stderr, until end-of-file is reached. Wait for process to terminate. 
From looking at the source I think the answer is yes:when timeout is None, communicate() calls self._stdin_write(input)https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/subprocess.py#L826-L827otherwise _communicate() calls self._stdin_write(input)https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/subprocess.py#L1078-L1079in each case _stdin_write() calls self.stdin.close() after self.stdin.write(input)https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/subprocess.py#L793
