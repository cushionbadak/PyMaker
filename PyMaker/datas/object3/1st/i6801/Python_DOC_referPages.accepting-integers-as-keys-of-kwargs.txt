Keywords have to be stringsBut by some black magic, namespaces are able to bypass thatWhy?  And how?  Could you implement a Python function that can receive integers in the kwargs mapping?
Could you implement a Python function that can receive integers in the kwargs mapping?No, you can't. The Python evaluation loop handles calling functions defined in Python code differently from  calling a callable object defined in C code. The Python evaluation loop code that handles keyword argument expansion has firmly closed the door on non-string keyword arguments.But SimpleNamespace is not a Python-defined callable, it is defined entirely in C code. It accepts keyword arguments directly, without any validation, which is why you can pass in a dictionary with non-string keyword arguments.That's perhaps a bug; you are supposed to use the C-API argument parsing functions, which all do guard against non-string keyword arguments. But SimpleNamespace was only designed to be the object holding sys.implementation data*, and wasn't really designed for other uses.There might be other such exceptions, but they'll all be C-defined callables, not Python functions.* The time.get_clock_info() method also runs an instance of the SimpleNamespace class; it's the only other place that the type is currently used.
