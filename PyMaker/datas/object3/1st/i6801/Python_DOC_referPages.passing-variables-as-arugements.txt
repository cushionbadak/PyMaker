Im passsing two varibales to another python file, in this manner. Refer the above example:File 1.pyMain.pyIt PrintsAs you may have noticed the 'boo' part is missing. Why is it missing and how can i fix this?PS.The reason im using os.system instead of sub process is because i need File 1.py to continue its duty without have to waiting for Main.py to complete
"boo" is sys.argv[3], because you used string formatting with no escaping to build your command line string, resulting in the callRather than using os.system, it's much safer to execute subprocesses with the subprocess module:but considering that the other program is also a Python program, it sounds like you're using separate scripts to organize your code when you should probably be using modules and functions, so launching separate processes with any tool is probably not how you should go about this.If you don't want to wait for the worker to finish, you can use subprocess.Popen instead of subprocess.run. os.system would never have given you that behavior; os.system also waits for the worker to finish. It may be better to use threading or multiprocessing, though.Also, backslashes should be escaped, as in "F:\\Main.py", not "F:\Main.py".
This happens because OS split argument by space. For managed, it needs to put a variable in "name boo". In your case:
