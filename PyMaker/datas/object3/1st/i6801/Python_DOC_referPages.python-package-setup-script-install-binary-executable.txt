I have a package awesomepkg with setup.py. I'd like to install a binary executable awesometool to the command line along with the package itself when users run pip install awesomepkg. I have compiled different OS versions for awesometool, which lives in a bin/ folder beside setup.py.  However, I can't find a good way to configure setup.py. I have attempted the following:Use the scripts=[] keyword in setup(). Unfortunately, the "executable" must be a python script.So I try to wrap the binary in a python script using os.system('bin/awesometool') to delegate. It also fails because the wrapper script is copied somewhere else by pip, so it doesn't know where the relative path bin/awesometool is. Another potential solution is the data_files keyword. However, for some reason the data files are not copied over to site_packages installation dir, even though running python setup.py bdist_wheel says they have been copied.

I just ran into this issue myself. My solution was three-fold.I added the program, e.g. awesometool, to my package structure so I could add it via the package_data keyword:package_data={'awesomepkg': ['awesometool']}.This causes it to actually be copied into the same folder as the main init.py during installation.I made a python script similar to your step 2. However, instead of the relative path, I first import awesomepkg and use awesomepkg.__path__ to get the absolute path to the installation folder for the package. This would look like:I also used subprocess instead of system, but the result should be the same.I added this script to the scripts keyword of setup()
