Attempting to run simple Text mining from twitter with sentiment analysis and can not figure out this error: TypeError: '_csv.writer' object is not callableIt roots from this section of my code: In whole, my code looks like this. Am trying to do some data visualization with the result, but first just want to be able to see something happen when I run it. After all, I did pull most of this fro ma tutorial. 
The code should correctly look like:Note that in this code the third line was changed to csv_writer.writerow("Tweet", "Sentiment"). In your original code you try to use the csv_writer object as a callable object whereas you need to call the correct method on the object.You can find the documentation for csv.writer and examples at https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects.
