I'm having the following Problem. I want to implement a web crawler, so far this worked but it was so slow, that I tried to use multiprocessing for fetching the URLs.Unfortunately I'm not very experienced at this field.After some reading the easiest way seemed to me to use the map method from multiprocessing.pool for this.But I constantly get the following error:I found very few cases with the same error and they unfortunately did not help me.I created a stripped version of my code which can reproduce the error:I would be very thankful about any help or suggestion!
Question: But I constantly get the following error:The Error you'r getting is missleading, the reason are Move the Queue instantiation Outside the class TestCrawler.This leads to another Error:NotImplementedError: pool objects cannot be passed between processes or pickledThe reason are:Both Errors are indicating that pickle can't find the class Members.Note: Endless Loop!  Your following while Loop leads to a Endless Loop!  This will overload your System!  Furthermore, your pool.map(... starts only one Process with one Task!I suggest reading The Examples that demonstrates the use of a poolChange to the following:This Example starts 5 Processes each processing 10 Tasks(urls):Tested with Python: 3.4.2
