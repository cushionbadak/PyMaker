I tried:Is there a better code than this:Consider any iterator, I'm using islice in place of iter.
In python-3.5, you can use iterable unpacking:This works since:Notice the asterisk (*) in front of both a_list and iter(b_list). Furthermore a_list only has to be a finite iterable/iterator. So you can simply construct a list that concatenates finite iterables together.
You can generally use itertools.chain to join iterables:
The existing answers already address the workaround. Additionally, this line:Does not throw an error, because it calls list.__iadd__ which supports the addition of iterators.
You can use __iadd__() which is the real function trigger by the syntactic sugar += (That's why it doesn't create an error).ProduceThis is fun but not really good in term of readability to be honest. Prefer other answers :)EDIT:Of course to produce new_list, you have to make a copy of list_a has you did in your question.
