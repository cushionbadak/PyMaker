I am reading Fluent Python. Code 1-1, here it constructs a class with namedtuples and implements __len__ and __getitem__. but later the author uses random.choice to choose a card from deckhow is this working? I don't think deck is a sequence.
Implementing __getitem__ makes your class iterable. Watch:If a class does not have an __iter__ method but a __getitem__ method, Python, when forced to do so, constructs an iterator from an instance that tries to access its elements via __getitem__. It starts at index 0 and ends as soon as an IndexError is thrown.However, since LegacyIterable instances don't have a __len__ method, they formally don't count as sequences yet and random.choice would complain withHowever, once we give it a __len__ method instances count as sequences, and that's all that random.choice wants according to its documentation.choice(self, seq) method of random.Random instance      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
random.choice takes a random element from a non-empty sequence. If you implement __getitem__, python can use that to treat your object as a sequence by indexing and that's what it does. 
deck is indeed not a list, but as stated by documentation, any object whose class implements __getitem__ can be treated as a list-like object, e.g. a sequence. Since implementing __getitem__ allows you things like deck[i], you can call choice(deck) because what choice(deck) does is it generates a random number i betwen 0 and len(deck) and returns deck(i).
