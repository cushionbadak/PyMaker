I need to get a Queryset in Django and make a copy of it as a variable in the form of a list of dictionaries. I thought this is what Querysets were, I guess I'm wrong.Gives me an error when I try to perform a simple algorithm with it.I don't want to interact with the database- I need to copy that Queryset as a list of dictionaries, so I can display modified versions of the lists without actually changing the data. How do I do this?(Trying to get a list of entries in this join table, which should be a list of dictionaries with dictionaries for some of the key values)
To make a list from a query set just pass it to the list function list_a = list(queryset). That will return you a list with the objects from the queryset. If you want that as a dict you can call the values() method on the queryset before passing it to the list: list(queryset.values())
Both values() and values_list() return a queryset object, which should be fine for most cases. But if you do want to have a list, then as the previous answer states you will have to typecast it to a list using the function list(queryset)Typecasting to queryset to a list will remove some performance gained just by using the queryset.
