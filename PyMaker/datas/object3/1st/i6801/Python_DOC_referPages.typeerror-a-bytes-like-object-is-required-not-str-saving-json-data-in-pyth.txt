Natural Text
I am getting data from twitter in json format and storing the same in a file.But I am getting the below error:
From the json.dump() documentation: The json module always produces str objects, not bytes objects. Therefore, fp.write() must support str input.You opened the file in binary mode. Don't do that, remove the b from the file mode:It's better to use an absolute path rather than change the working directory, and if you used the file as a context manager (with the with statement), it'll be automatically closed for you when the block is done. That helps avoid errors like forgetting to actually call the file.close() method.And if you are going to write multiple JSON documents to the file, at least put a newline between each document, making it a JSON lines file; this is much easier to parse again later on:Alternatively, put everything into a top-level object like mapping or list, and write that single object to the file to create a valid JSON document.
Don't store separate json objects. Append each one to a list, and then dump at once.Should also note here that you shouldn't open the file in binary mode if you want to write text to it.
