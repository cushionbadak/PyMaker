I have a problem launching a npm command via a python script.from Run npm commands using Python subprocess I found that the following should work:and it does (!).From documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html), I read that subprocess.check_call is equivalent to run(..., check=True)As I previousely used subprocess.run to launch an external application (newman) with success, I tried the following:but it ends up with an error:Any idea of why I can't use subprocess.run ? (nor check_output, by the way ...)
The correct execution issubprocess.run(['start', 'npm', 'run', 'features:chrome:server'], check=True)subprocess.check_call('start npm run features:chrome:server', shell=True) works because you invoked the shell. Further information you could find here. subprocess.run("start npm run features:chrome:server", check=True, shell=True) should also work.
