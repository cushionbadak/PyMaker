I am developing an application with Python and a QT GUI.I need to import a file to a DataFrame. I use a QFileDialog.getOpenFileName to get the path and filename to open it with pandas.read_csv method.Everything works well until I get a path with special characters like "รณ". The pandas.read_csv doesn't work and crash the app.I try to reproduce the error in console and have the following results:the output of show_versions() is:As I read in this post Encoding with pandas.read_csv when file name has accents the problem was fixed in pandas 0.14.0. Any recommendation to solve this problem?
Looking in deep, this behavior comes in a combination of Python 3.6 and pandas.read_csv only in Windows systems. Python 3.6 change Windows filesystem encoding from "mbcs" to "UTF-8". See Python PEP 529. Use sys.getfilesystemencoding() to get the current file system encodingI get some solutions around this:1.- Use this code to change all the app to works with the prior Python <= 3.5 encoding ("mbcs")2.- Pass a file pointer to the pandas.read_csv
you can try those lines of code in your notebook/ipython  before reading with utf-8 encoding :and then when reading your file use those line as suggest in the comment
