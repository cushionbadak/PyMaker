I am comming from the java world and I really have a hard time to understand the following piece of code.What exactly does this line do cItems=[i[j:k] for i in cItems for j,k in ((0,len(i)/2), (len(i)/2,len(i))) if len(i)>1]? How would you write this in java (or scala or groovy)?EDIT Thx to Reblochon Masque i was able to understand this! If one is interested, translated into groovy the statement would be something like this: 
What does this line do?It partitions each inner lists contained into cItems into two sublists of half the size (containing each half of the elements), except when the sublist contains only one element, then it is ignored.
