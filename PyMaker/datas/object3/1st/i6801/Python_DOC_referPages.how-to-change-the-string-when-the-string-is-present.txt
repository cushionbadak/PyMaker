I need some help with my code. I have a trouble with changing the strings.I am checking with the strings if the variable getTime3 have a string 30 then I want to replace it with 00. On my code, it will find the string 30 to replace it with 0030 which is wrong. It should be 00.Here is the code:What I am expect for the two special cases, when the program finds the :, it will check if 30 is present then change the current hour to the next hour and make a new string with AM/PM label, example: change from 8 to 9 and replace 30 with 00 to make it to show 9:00PM. If the ending is 00 then I want to change 00 to 30 instead. I want to add 30 in the minute section and again preserves the AM/PM part. If the getTime3 have the string 11:30AM then I want to change it to 12:00PM.Can you please help me with how to fix the 0030 to make it to show 00 instead and add the next hour?
With Python, slice like x[a:b] in the slice starting at a (inclusive), and finishing at b (exclusive).So: getTime3[:ind] is the slice from 0 to ind exclusive, which is the hours without the ":".And indexes are absolute index, not relative. So getTime3[+2:] is the same as getTime3[2:], which correspond to the substring starting at index 2.What you want is:Example:EDITIf you want to do some calculation on time, you can use the datetime module.Is the format used to represent time like '09:30PM', where:%I Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.%M Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.%p Localeâ€™s equivalent of either AM or PM.How to add 30 min:If you want to set the minutes to 0, you can do:
Please don't use the wrong tool for the task. You are manipulating times, yet using strings to do it. Start with this to turn 11:30PM into 12:00AM:Adding timedelta(minutes=30) makes the intent perfectly clear.
