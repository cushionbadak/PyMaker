I would like to test the following statementI tried It complains that write is never called, which makes sense. In this case, what is the proper way to check the content for writing?I also tried to use f.write(str(['abc', 20])) instead of the print statement, which passes the test. Is it just a bad idea to use print?
Python 3.6:If you inspect the mock object you can see that the thing you are looking for is there..write() is being called a second time with '' because of the end argument you passed - you can verify this by playing around with that parameter.How to test?  You could use assert_any_call() :or, if you want to validate the end argument, assert_has_calls():You asked Is it just a bad idea to use print? | Maybe someone else can chime in but in my limited experience I have never consider using print() to write to a file.
