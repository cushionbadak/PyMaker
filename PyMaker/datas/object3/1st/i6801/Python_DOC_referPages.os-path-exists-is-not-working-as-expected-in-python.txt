I am trying to create a directory in the home path and re-check if the directory exists in the home path before re-creating using os.path.exists(), but its not working as expected.Output for the first time:Output for the 2nd time:Its not going into the else loop though the directory is existing. Am I missing something ? Share in you inputs !Updated Working Code With Suggestions Provided: Using $HOME directory and os.path.expandusr
The tilde symbol ~ representing the home directory is a shell convention. It is expanded by the shell in os.system, but it is understood literally in Python.So you create <HOME>/<DIR>, but test for ~/<DIR>.
As mentioned by VPfB, the tilde symbol is understood literally by Python. To fix this, you need to get your actual home directory.Now, on different platforms, there are different paths for the home directory.To get the home directory, os.path.expanduser will be useful.
