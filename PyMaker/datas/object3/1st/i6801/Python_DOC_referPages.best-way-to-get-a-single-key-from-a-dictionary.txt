Having a python dictionary and knowing it is made of just one key/value pair, what's the best way to retrieve that single/unique item?So far I know I could use one of these two ways:list(mydict.keys())[0]next(iter(mydict))As far as I understand, list performances are worse than iter ones so the latter approach should be better, right? Which ways is best? There's something that's even better than the two way I indicated? Please let me know.
Which way is best? I recommend using next(iter(d)) over list(mydict.keys())[0] to retrieve a key from a dictionary. As you suspected, using next(iter(d)) is much better in terms of efficiency.The efficiency difference can be observed by timing each method:The choice of using next(iter(d)) over list(d.keys())[0] becomes very, very obvious as the size of the dictionary increases:next(iter(d)) performs so much better than list(d.keys())[0] mainly because it avoids creating a potential huge list of all of the dictionaries keys in memory, when it really only needs the first element.
To get the "first" key-value pair from a dictionary, you will have to use an OrderedDict:
