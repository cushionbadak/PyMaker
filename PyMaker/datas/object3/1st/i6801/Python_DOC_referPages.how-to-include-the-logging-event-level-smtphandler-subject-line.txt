The SMTPHandler requires a "subject" to be included when it is initialized.How can the subject line include the level of the event that generated the email? For example:How to make the subject list for logs.info('Info Test') be INFO: class_name and logs.Error('Error Test') be ERROR: class_name?
To do this, you need to subclass SMTPHandler and override the getSubject method, which says:If you want to specify a subject line which is record-dependent, override this method.
