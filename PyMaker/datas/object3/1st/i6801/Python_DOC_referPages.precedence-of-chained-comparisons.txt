I'm wondering how Python parses:It seems to interpret this as:as opposed to (not a) < b < cThis question explains grouping vs chaining:Python comparison operators chaining/grouping left to right? but what are the rules for the precedence of chained comparisons?It's strange to me that not, < and > have the same precedence, but not a < b < c parses as not (a < b < c) while -a < b < c parses as (-a) < b < c.I tested this by evaluating not 2 > 1 > 2 in Python 2.7.
Python has an Abstract Syntax Tree module to show you what's happening:It gives (cleaned up a bit):And indeed, the documentation says that not has lower precedence than <.
