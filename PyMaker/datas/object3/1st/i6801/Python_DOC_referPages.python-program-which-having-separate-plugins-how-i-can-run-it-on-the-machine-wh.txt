Let I developed a program in pycharm not only using  the default python library,but also import different different  plugins to pycharm. But I want to run this program in another  machine which doesn't have any other separate plugins except default python. How can I run this program on that machine?
You could use a requirements.txt file in which you can note down your dependencies either manually or through using pip freeze > requirements.txt over the command line. The easiest way to accomplish this is probably by using PyCharm's embedded Terminal. After putting your requirements in a requirements.txt, you can use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the requirements you specified. Here is some further information from the pip documentation: https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.htmlIt's recommended to use a virtual environment. The standard library has a built-in module for this, about which you can read here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
