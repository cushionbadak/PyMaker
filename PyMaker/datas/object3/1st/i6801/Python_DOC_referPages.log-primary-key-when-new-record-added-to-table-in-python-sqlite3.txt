So I have a function which creates a new object instance to represent an account, and add the account to an accounts table in a database with SQLite3. The database table has 3 columns, one of which is a primary key accountID column, which is set automatically by SQL. My object instance needs to know this accountID so it can find itself in the database in the future, but I'm unsure how to do this. My code:The issue is passing the accountID into the Account initialiser; I don't know how to acquire this without querying the database for the record I just created using the name and balance I have, which sounds like a rather messy solution. Any work around ideas? 
The sqlite3 Cursor object has a lastrowid attribute:This read-only attribute provides the rowid of the last modified row. It is only set if you issued an INSERT or a REPLACE statement  using the execute() method. For operations other than INSERT or  REPLACE or when executemany() is called, lastrowid is set to None.If the INSERT or REPLACE statement failed to insert the previous successful rowid is returned.Changed in version 3.6: Added support for the REPLACE statement.So after your execute():
