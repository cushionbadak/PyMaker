Natural Text
I have a very very simple code (getting some content from Twitter)I have installed Python 3. When I run the program through Sublime and Terminal (in my Mac) it works fine. On the other hand when I run it on Atom I get the very usual error:where line 30 is the print(tweet.text). I have looked at similar question but I have not managed to solve the problem (since I am a rookie in programming and Python).Since I have Python 3 should the program not work also on Atom too since it works on Sublime? And, of course, how can I resolve it?
on terminal run these three lines to set encoding 'utf-8':echo "export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" >> ~/.bash_profileecho "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8" >> ~/.bash_profilesource ~/.bash_profilequit from atom then open it again. or on your codeprint(tweet.text.encode('utf-8'))
