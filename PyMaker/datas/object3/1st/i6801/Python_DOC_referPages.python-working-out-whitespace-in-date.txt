Natural Text
I have a log file file.txt and it has the date format as '%b %_d %H:%M:%S'.When the day of the month is between the 1st and 9th, it pads out the field with a space.I'm just wondering if my code is the best way to check if this includes a space or not as I'm just trying to pull out the date/time from each linefile.txtCode: 
If you want your output field to be padded with spaces, you can use python string formatting spec.{1:>2} means that field 1 should be right aligned and at least 2 characters wide. Missing characters will be padded with spaces.In python 3.6+ you can also use f-strings to make it more self-explanatory.
