I have a program that insets a CSV file into a mysql database using Python.Once the rows / columns of the CSV file have been inserted, the Python program creates a log file, calculates the number of rows and columns contained in the CSV file and logs this data.As shown belowIs there a way to add a Date or a timestamp to the log file so when the next CSV file is loaded into the database, the logfile is overwritten?
If my comprehension is correct, you want to timestamp your file name in order to not overwrite it ? to generate a timestamp, you shall use datetime modulethen generate a timestamp when you create your log fileFor the different possible options, you may have a look to https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
use datetime module to add timestamp
