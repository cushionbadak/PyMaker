I often find some functions defined like open(name[, mode[, buffering]]) and I know it means optional parameters.Python document says it's module-level function. When I try to define a function with this style, it always failed.For exampledef f([a[,b]]): print('123')does not work.Can someone tell me what the module-level means and how can I define a function with this style? 
"1. if we can define optional parameters using this way(no at present)" The square bracket notation not python syntax, it is Backus-Naur form - it is a documentation standard only.  A module-level function is a function defined in a module (including __main__) - this is in contrast to a function defined within a class (a method).
Is this what you are looking for?
Up to now, I still don't get an answer expected. Initially, when I saw this way of expression open(name[, mode[, buffering]]), I really want to know what does that mean. It means optional parameters obviously. At that moment, I found it may be a different way(different from normal way like f(a,b,c=None,d='balabala')) to define a function with optional parameters but not only tell us it's optional parameters. The benefit of this writing can help us use optional parameters but no default value, so I think it's a more clear and more simple way to define optional parameters.What I really want to know is about 2 things: 1. if we can define optional parameters using this way(no at present) 2. It will be nice if someone could explain what does the module-level function mean?I am really appreciated for the above answers and comments! THANKS A LOT
