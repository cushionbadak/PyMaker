When using plt.cm.Spectral in python, I got some confused.After checking the type of plt.cm.Spectral, I regard the var Spectral in module plt.cm as an instance of class LinearSegmentedColormap.However, I also see that code colors = plt.cm.Spectral(np.linspace(0, 1, 10)) could be executed without error. Here is the point confusing me, why an instance of a class could be called, i.e. followed by parentheses with params inside?Thanks!
Python objects are callable if they implement __call__:object.__call__(self[, args...])Called when the instance is “called” as a function; if this method is defined, x(arg1, arg2, ...) is a shorthand for x.__call__(arg1, arg2, ...).LinearSegmentedColormap inherits from Colormap that implements __call__:https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/colors.py#L433This makes an instance of LinearSegmentedColormap callable.
