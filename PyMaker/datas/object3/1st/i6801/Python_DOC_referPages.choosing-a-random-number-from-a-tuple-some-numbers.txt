I have a tuple of numbers, and I want to choose a random number from my tuple in addition with a certain number. For example:and I have the number 4. I want to choose a random number from the numbers 1,2,3,4 (without changing the tuple of course).I tried:I'm new to python. I tried converting the tuple to a list, and then performing the random function.The code above didn't work. Got the error object of type 'NoneType' has no len()Would love some help.
list.append returns noneOnce converting to a list as you have done, appending will modify that list but return none so that is the source of your error.To get round that you can either convert the tuple to a list then append 4 to it, then use random.choice, or in just one step, you can concatenate a list of [4] with the + operand. This approach is much simpler:Hope this helps and clears some things up! :)Update:If you want to just randomly select from the tuple without the last item, then just slice the list with the normal syntax:
The method list.append alters the provided list and returns None, which explains the exception you got. To get the desired result, you can implicitly use the tuple.__add__ method, which will return a new tuple.If you want to remove values in a concise-ish fashion, using a set might be appropriate.
You can try:Where (*my_tuple, 4) creates a new tuple with the unpacked content of my_tuple and 4.
