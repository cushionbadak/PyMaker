This is my GAE datastore:When I run this part of code:my terminal says that is missing in object Search attribute getDo you know why?
Running keys = Search.query(Search.city == city).fetch()fetches a list of model instancesso fails because instances don't have a get method.You need to do:keys = Search.query(Search.city == city).fetch(keys_only=True)to fetch a list of keys, or treat keys as a list of instances rather than keys, and omit the key.get() call.
Maybe because key object doesn't have get() method:Use python dir() function, it helps me a lot
