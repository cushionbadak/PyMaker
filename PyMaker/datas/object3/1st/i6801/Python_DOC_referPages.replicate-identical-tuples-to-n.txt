This question already has an answer here:How do you create a list of repeated tuples in Python?                    2 answers                I have identical tuples of (0, 1) assigned to define limits for 3 input values:Is there a Pythonic way to assign same tuples for N inputs? For example:
You can multiply a sequence to get N shallow copies of its contents:This is fine for tuples of ints or other immutable data structures containing only immutable types, but will cause surprising behavior if you use it for mutable data structures like lists - you get a sequence of n references to the same list, because it's a shallow copy. In that case, a comprehension is the most idiomatic way to create n independent objects:
Works for any iterable, BTW: '1111' == '1' * 4.
itertools.repeat() alternative:The output:
You can use the multiplication operator (*) on lists of tuples. For example:yields:
