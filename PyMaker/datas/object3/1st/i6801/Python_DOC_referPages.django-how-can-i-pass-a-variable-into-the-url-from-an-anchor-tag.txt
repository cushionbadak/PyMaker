Django again...I have seen only one way to do this but I am getting an error.I have the url:and the view,but the anchor tag in my template is causing me a NoReverseMatch.What is the correct way to pass the variable  into the url? Is anything wrong with the regex in my url or am I writing this wrong in the template tag? both?EDIT:changed the template tag tobut I still get the error (after clearing the url to just /wish_item because the regex gave me an error also):
It's getting longer than comments allow, so:The argument is part of the path, not a query param: {% url 'wish_item' id=x.id %}Your regexp is (very likely to be) wrong.This accepts exactly one digit followed by exactly one hash sign. Probably you meant this?That is, one or more digits?For reference, you have the full regex syntax over here. By the way, if you just have a numeric id, I suggest sticking to this:The difference is \d will also accepts other characters marked as digits in unicode, which you probably won't handle later on.
