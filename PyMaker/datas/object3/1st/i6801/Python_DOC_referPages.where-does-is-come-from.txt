We can test if two objects are the same, i.e. share the same memory location:by obj1 is obj2. "is" seems not a function from module builtin. What is it, and where does it come from?I seem to see is in Python in a Nutshell, but now can't find is in Python in a nutshell. Which topic (section or chapter) is is likely discussed?Thanks.
is is a comparison operator, it tests if two expressions resolve to the same identity, so it is called the identity comparison operator:The operators is and is not test for object identity: x is y is true if and only if x and y are the same object. Object identity is determined using the id() function. x is not y yields the inverse truth value.So in Python in a Nutshell, you find it in the Expressions and Operators section; search for identity test.
