Your problem is with line=line.replace(line,String_Replace). Take a look at the documentation for str.replace()To test your code, you could have written a separate script with only the part that seemed to be failing.That lets you focus on the problem and makes it easy and fast to modify then test your code.  Once you have that functionality working, copy and paste it into your working code.  If that part of your code actually works then you have eliminated it as a source for errors and you can test other parts.As an aside, no need to test if your search string is in the line before attempting to replace.  If the search string isn't in the line, str.replace() will return the line without modification.
