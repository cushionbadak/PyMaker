if i have a simple list objects:How can i quickly check if a shape with value square exists? I know I can use a for loop to check each object, but is there a faster way?Thanks in advance!
Look ma, no loop.If you want to retrieve the index associated with square, you'd need to iterate over it using for...else:Performance
You can do this in one line with the builtin function any: This is equivalent to the for-loop approach, though.If you need to get the index instead, then there is still a one-liner that can do this without sacrificing efficiency:However, this is complicated enough that it's probably better to just stick with a normal for loop.
You can try this, using get for a more robust solution:
Using list comprehension you can do:Using filter():
Checking only if it exists:Getting first index (you will get StopIteration exception if it does not exist).All indexes:
