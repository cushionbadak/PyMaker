While converting a panda object to a timestamp, I am facing this strange issue.Train['date'] value is like 01/05/2014 which I am trying to convert into linuxtimestamp.My code:And I get this error:
The method to_datetime will return a TimeStamp instance.  I'm not sure what you are hoping to accomplish by the lambda function, but it appears you are trying to convert some object to a TimeStamp. Try removing the apply section so it looks like this:Train['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(Train['date'])
You're looking for datetime.timestamp(), which was added in Python 3.3. Pandas itself isn't involved.N.B. .timestamp() will localize naive timestamps to the computer's UTC offset. To the contrary, suggestions in this answer are timezone-agnostic.Since pandas uses nanoseconds internally (numpy datetime64[ns]), you should be able to do this even with Python 2:Or be more explicit wtih something like this (from the datetime docs):
to_datetime seems to be deprecated. Use to_pydatetime() instead...
