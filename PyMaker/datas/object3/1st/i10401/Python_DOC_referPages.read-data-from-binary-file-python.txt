I have a binary file with this format:and i use this code to open it:And I take this:Any idea how can open the whole file?
I agree with Ryan: parsing the data is straightforward, but not trivial, and really tedious. Whatever disk space saving you gain by packing the data in this way, you pay it dearly at the hour of unpacking.Anyway, the file is made of variable length records and fields. Each record is made of variable number and length of fields that we can read in chunks of bytes. Each chunk will have different format. You get the idea. Following this logic, I assembled these three functions, that you can finish, modify, test, etc:
The data structure stored in this file is hierarchical, rather than "flat": child arrays of different length are stored within each parent element. It is not possible to represent such a data structure using numpy arrays (even recarrays), and therefore it is not possible to read the file with np.fromfile().What do you mean by "open the whole file"? What sort of python data structure would you like to end up with?It would be straightforward, but still not trivial, to write a function to parse the file into a list of dictionaries.
