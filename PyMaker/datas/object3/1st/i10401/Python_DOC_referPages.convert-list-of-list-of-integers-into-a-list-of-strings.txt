I have a list of strings:I want output to look like I've tried using   I get output for print (string1) as:What am i doing wrong here?
You actually don't have a list of list, you have a list of str. Therefore you can use ast.literal_eval to interpret each string as a list, then convert to str and join.
If you want to use built-in functions only (without imports), you can define a function that parses only the numbers and map that function to your list.
