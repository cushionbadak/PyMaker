I'm trying to take a file with .bin suffix, encode it and then to send it to someone(sending it as .bin is not supported)...the problem is that when i use the command :I got an error messages So i thought about a workaround which is converting the file to .txt and then to send it.I tried to copy a binary file to a text file, the code that I used isand the .bin file contains lines like this:But the results are a file containing rubbish.I tried also to decode the bytes as utf-8 format but i got this error message:The code that I used to decode to 'utf-8 format is :Am I doing something wrong ? Is there another way to do this ?
It's not clear what you are trying to do. Either you are trying to copy an existing file myfile.bin to a new file newfile.txt or you're trying to convert the binary file to a human readable format.Assuming it's your goal to copy the file myfile.bin to newfile.txt you might have a look at the module shutil from the Python standard library. This contains high-level file operations such as copy, move, delete and more.If it's your goal to decode the content of the file into a human readable format and your only information about the file is its .bin ending you might have a problem. The binary file could encode any information such as images, texts or videos. Without knowing the type of the encoding the content is more or less useless to you.
