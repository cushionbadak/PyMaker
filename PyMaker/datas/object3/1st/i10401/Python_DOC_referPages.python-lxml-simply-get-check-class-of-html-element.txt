I use tree.xpath to iterate over all interesting HTML elements but I need to be able to tell whether the current element is part of a certain CSS class or not.The overall structure should remain the same.What is a fast way to check whether or not the current div has the exampleclass class or not?In above example, item is of lxml.html.HtmlElement class, which has the property classes but I don't understand what this means:classes  A set-like wrapper around the 'class' attribute.Get Method:unreachable.classes(self) - A set-like wrapper around the 'class' attribute.Set Method:unreachable.classes(self, classes)It returns a lxml.html.Classes object, which has a __iter__ method and it turns out iter() works. So I construct this code:But I'm hoping there is a more elegant method.I tried searching for similar questions but all I found were various "how do I get all elements of 'classname'", however I need all divs in the loop, I just want to treat some of them differently.
There is no need for iter, if "exampleclass" in item.classes: does the exact same thing,  only more efficiently.  The difference is calling iter on a set makes the lookup linear so definitely not an efficient way to search a set, not much difference here but in some cases there would be a monumental diffrence:You can also use css selectors using lxml:Depending on the case, you may also be able to use contains:
You can elegantly use the membership test operator in:For user-defined classes which do not define __contains__() but do  define __iter__(), x in y is true if some value z with x == z is  produced while iterating over y.
