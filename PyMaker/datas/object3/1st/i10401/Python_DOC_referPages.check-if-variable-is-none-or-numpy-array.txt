I look up in a table if keys have associated arrays, or not. By design, my table.__getitem__() somtimes returns None rather than KeyError-s.  I would like this value to be either None, or the numpy array associated with w.Only if I go with the above code, and the first lookup is a match, I get :and if I go with value = table[w].any() or table[w.lower()].any(), then if it's a mismatch, I expectedly bump into :I must be missing the correct way to do this, how to do ?
IIUC this should work:
Though the above would work, I would suggest to keep signatures simple and consistent, ie table[w] should always return numpy array. In case of None, return empty array. 
Use dict.get.Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.So if table[w] is not there you will get table[w.lower()] and if that's not there you'll get None.
The question is answered, but other folks who encounter this error may want a general solution.  With the idea of being explicit in mind we can use the function isinstance.  Here is a working example.So in the context of the question
