I'm doing a binary to decimal converter in python 3.4.4 and it's pretty much finished except for the fact that I would like to check that the binary number entered by the user is indeed a binary number (check if the string is only made of o and 1) but I'm unsure what to do.here's the program:hopefully someone can help me <3
Follow the EAFP approach, try to convert it to decimal via int() and handle the ValueError:
If you must avoid using int(binary, 2) and handle the exception, you could use the all() function with a generator expression:all() with a generator expression will bail out early and return False when a non-binary digit is found.If you are already looping over all characters anyway you could just raise an exception in your loop:Rather than use an index, your code could just loop over the reverse of the string, using numbers generated by enumerate() as the power:
Use all()
Maybe all(x in "01" for x in binary).
Following is for 2.7.9, just look for a 3.4.4 parallel:
You could check if the sum of  occurrences of '0' and '1' is equal to the length of the string.
I suppose checking the input string for correctness is best done with regular expressions. The code that would help you is the following:The regular expression determines whether the binary number only contains zeros and ones. Also, I took the opportunity to shorten the code a bit, using result += ..., which is equal to result = result + ....
