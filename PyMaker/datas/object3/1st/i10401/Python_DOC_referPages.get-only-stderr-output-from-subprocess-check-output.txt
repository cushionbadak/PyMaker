I want to run an external process in python, and process its stderr only.I know I can use subprocess.check_output, but how can I redirect the stdout to /dev/null (or ignore it in any other way), and receive only the stderr?
Unfortunately you have tagged this python-2.7, as in python 3.5 and up this would be simple using run():With check_output() stdout simply cannot be redirected:Use Popen objects and communicate() with python versions less than 3.5. Open /dev/null using os.devnull in python 2.7:Communicate sends input to stdin, if piped, and reads from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached.
I found a simple trick:This will filter out the stdout, and keeps only the stderr.
