I resolve my problem with this code:
The issue is that os.listdir() returns a list of files contained in the directory that you give it - in this case "C:\test".Later on, when you then try and concatenate source with the individual files, you are therefor attempting to combine a list with a str. This is why you are getting the TypeError.If all of the files are contained directly in "C:\test", then you can drop the os.listdir() and do:Note the use of os.path.join() also as a better solution for building filepaths up.
