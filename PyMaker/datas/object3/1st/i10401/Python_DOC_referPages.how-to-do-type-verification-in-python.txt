(Maybe b/c I'm from a C++ world)I want to verify some python variable islist(string) or list(dict(int, string)) or SomethingIterable(string)Is there a simple and unified way to do it?(Instead of writing customized code to iterate and verify each instance..)I emphasize that I understand in Python list can have elements of different types, which is exactly the reason why I ask how to verify a list which are composed by just a certain type e.g. string.
In Python lists can be composed of mixed types, there is no way to do something like setting the "type" of a list. Also, even if you could, this "type" is not enforced and could change at any time.
It seems that you are looking for an array (array.array), not a list:As you get more and more comfortable with Python, though, you will gradually learn how to structure your code in such a way that type-checking becomes unnecessary. Personally, I've never had to use an array.array in Python (except in cases like this, where I'm specifically working with that module).
Use the typing moduleTypically:
