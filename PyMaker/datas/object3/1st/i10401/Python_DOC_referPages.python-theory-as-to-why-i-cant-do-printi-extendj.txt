This question already has an answer here:Python extend with an empty list bug? [duplicate]                    2 answers                Python Theoretical Question I'd like to learn theory behind why "print(i.extend(j))" DOESN'T work.It's OUTPUT is: "None". print(j) DOES work (It's OUTPUT is:  "[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]")
The answer is simple - extend doesn't return anything, and any function that doesn't return a value is taken to have returned None.
