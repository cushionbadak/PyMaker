Imaging following filesThe kind of object is always the first part (before the first dot) the quality property is somewhere in the name.My resulting table should look like this:This is what I did so farI managed to read the files sorted in a dict:But fail by generating the html table. How can I build the html table as shown above? Where Objects are written to the first first column of a row and the filename in columns depending on their quality property?
You have to iterate all combinations of fruits from your dictionaries and states, and then create one line (instead of one column) for each fruit. Then just iterate all the files matching that fruit and filter those that contain the current state and join those in one cell.Result:Update: If you have state expressions that are part of other states, like bad and medium_bad, then just using in won't work. Instead, you can use a regular expression to get the best match. You could use this code then:Alternatively, you could also restructure your dictionary to have another "layer" of states, i.e. {"kiwi": {"good": ["kiwi.goog.svg"]}, ...}If you want to wrap the filenames within image tags, you can put another format within the join:
