I declare a C function as Python prototypeNow I want to add it into a dynamically loaded moduleHow to convert C function into PyObject callable ?
You need to construct a new PyCFunctionObject object from the MyFunction. Usually this is done under the hood using the module initialization code, but as you're now doing it the opposite way, you need to construct the PyCFunctionObject yourself, using the undocumented PyCFunction_New or PyCFunction_NewEx, and a suitable PyMethodDef:Again, this is not the preferred way to do things; usually a C extension creates concrete module objects (such as _mymodule) and mymodule.py would import _mymodule and put things into proper places.
