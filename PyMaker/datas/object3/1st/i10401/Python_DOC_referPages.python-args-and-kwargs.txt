I have seen the previous stack overflow posts on this topic, but I am still unable to create use these two commands when I try to run my function. I have coded a demo example of a simple moving average that I would like to run through the args,kwargs command.Just running this function works as expected.However the second I try to add args and kwargs it breaks down.What exactly in the *args **kwargs logic am I getting wrong? Ive tried inputting both a tuple and a dictionary but neither of those seem to work.
Pass the *args and **kwargs to your function not the argument(s) and named argument(s):
In your example using *args and **kwargs:data, lookback and SMA are no longer defined. It could be:orThe Python tutorial has a section that might help: Unpacking Argument Lists
Your function now has two local variables, args and kwargs. One holds the positional arguments that were passed in (as a tuple), the other the keyword arguments (as a dictionary).Here you use three variable names (data, lookback and SMA) that don't exist in your function, so you get an error.You could have doneBut then your test1 function will only work with an exact call like test1(data,lookback=7,SMA=True). A call like test1(data, 7, True) won't work, as then the parameters are all in args, none in kwargs).Your function could also pass on the parameters exactly as it received them:That works, but there's no benefit to the test1 function, it just calls moving_average and returns its results, why not call moving_average directly.
You can understand args and kwargs in python at PyMentor. Hope it helps you understand.http://pymentor.in/understand-args-kwargs-python/
