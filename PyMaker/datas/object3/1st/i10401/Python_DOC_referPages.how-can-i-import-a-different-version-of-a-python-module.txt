I need to run my python script under sklearn v0.17 and on the server they have sklearn v0.15 installed.So I downloaded the scikit-learn-0.17 package into /home/mydir/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ and installed the package.However when I goto other directories and tried to run python and import sklearn the version is still 0.15.I created ~/.startup.py and put the following codethen I pointed to ~/.startup.py in ~/.bashrc with But it does not help.I am wondering how to fix this. Thank you!The following files/dirs are in site-packages/
Python Virtual Environments were made to fix this problem. Create a virtual environment by navigating to the directory of your project and enter the pyvenv ./Env command. Activate the environment on a linux system with source ./Env/bin/activate. Now you have a sandboxed python environment, whatever package you install now will only be scoped to this environment. So you can pip install scikit-learn-0.17 you will only point to THAT package. All other packages that are not in this virtual environment are ignored unless you explicitly add them via methods like pip.There are many other benefits to virtual environment, high reccomend reading more about them here.     
General advice here would be to use virtualenv, it allows you to have isolated environments for all your python projects.So each of your project can use different scikit version. Tutorial: https://www.sitepoint.com/virtual-environments-python-made-easy/
