Natural Text
In the below part of code v   is a list of characters. My output looks like    I want to map all the characters of my input into an integer, so that instead of a table with characters i get a table with numbers. I tried to use the built in function ord() but it doesnt work, since it only accepts single characters as input and not lists. Can you help?
