I've to ask 1 question about python and dll functions which I'm a bit frustrated about.   The question is - Can I load dll functions from windows using python? I heard of Ctype to do that, but I can’t find good tutorials for this.  Is there another way to use dll files from windows to get extra functionality? I want to call some dll to work with mouse events. I used pyautogui but it is not that useful for me. I wonder if python is good for windows applications? I know it runs on Windows however there are good dll function that can provide better functionality for windows then python original libraries.  Well that’s my opinion what I think. Anyways, is it worth to work with dlls with python after all? Or I better study C# for that because I love python for simplicity and don’t  want to  move to C# yet.
Yes you can. The ctypes library is indeed what you need. The official doc is here https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html . Loading DLLs pretty straightforward, but calling the functions inside can be a pain depending on the arguments types. Handling old C style error return codes is also cumbersome compared to the exception handling and general low overhead code style in Python.99% of the time it is way easier and better to use an appropriate existing module that either implements what you need or wraps the appropriate DLL for you. For example search in PyPI which is the central repository of Python expternal modules. That's my advice.
