I'm reading through the Python Docs, and, under Section 8.4.1,I found the following __init__ definition (abbreviated):The part I don't get is the self.elements = lst = [] line. Why the double assignment?Adding some print statements:Declaring one:As expected, they both point to the same PyObject.Is brevity the only reason to do something like this? If not, why? Something to do with reentrancy?
I'd call this a case of premature optimization; you don't save that much by eliminating the dot, especially for large input iterables; here's some timings:Eliminating the dot:While, with the dot (i.e replace lst with self.elements:As you can see, as we increase the size of the input iterable, the difference in time pretty much disappears, the appending and membership testing pretty much cover any gains.
