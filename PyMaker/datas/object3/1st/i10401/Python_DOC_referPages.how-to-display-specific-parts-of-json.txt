Can someone help me with this python api calling program? So with this piece of code I'm trying to get information from the weather api it prints it properly but when I want to select certain values only I get this error.
.json() is a built into requests JSON decoder, no need to parse JSON separately:
alecxe is correct with using the json library, if you want to know more about referencing specific values in a json object, look into pythons Dictionary data types. That is what json essentially converts them into.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionariesThe link above will show you how to use them!! Dictionaries are 'key-value' data structures where keys are unique and must not be hashable, and values are any type.python Dictionary quick example: The print statement will output, 'valueA'
