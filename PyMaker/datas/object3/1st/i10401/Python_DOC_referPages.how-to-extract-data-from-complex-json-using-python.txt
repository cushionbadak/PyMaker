How can i retrieve formatted_address,Lat and Long under geometry>Location etc. from json. Most of the json tutorials are explained with simple json file.Kindly help me on this and help  me find some good tutorials
Actually, simple JSONs and complex JSONs are not that different. You can say that a complex JSON has many simpler JSONs inside, so if you know how to get data from simple ones, you end up knowing how to get data from complexes Anyway, think of JSON objects as dictionaries and JSON arrays as lists. To get data from dicts, use the key for a value. To get data from lists, use the index (position) of a value.So, in your case:andNotice how the navigation through keys occur, and how you get deeper as you retrieve values from its keys
You can follow the documentation for json library from the links: python2 or python3If you have any spesific questions, you can define traces or code parts to find correct answers.
