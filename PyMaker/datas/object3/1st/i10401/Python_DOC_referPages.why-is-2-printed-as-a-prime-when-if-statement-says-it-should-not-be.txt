I know 2 is a prime number, but when this code is ran it doesn't match the if statement condition if n % x == 0. but 2 % 2 == 0 so it should be a equal:    
From the Python documentation of range()For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.A range object will be empty if r[0] does not meet the value constraint.So when n = 2, range(2, n) is an empty range, because r[0] is 2 and that doesn't meet the constraint 2 < 2. Therefore for loop never runs, so it never breaks, and as a result, the else: block is executed and reports that it's prime.
