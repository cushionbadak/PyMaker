Natural Text
Python 3From an arbitrary text I want to select words only. Investigating the problem, I have discovered that sometimes a hyphen is inside a word. Or a number may be as well (9-year-old, canyon-like).My regex is regex = '\W*^\s^\d*-'. Take all non-alphanumeric character; exclude all whitespace charactes, which are necessary for split method; exclude all numbers that are not followed by a hyphen.I should also exclude hyphens that are not in words.The result is:: ['(CNN)Meaalofa', "Te'o", '--', 'Buemi.', 'Canberra,']The documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.htmlI thought that points, commas, hyphen, brackets and apostrophe should match \W. Questions:1. I can't understand why: brackets, points and commas, and apostrophe are still present.I would say that I excluded the apostrophe. I need it, and it is present in the result, it is Ok. But I can't catch how it occurred there. Could you help me understand how apostrophe happened to occur in the result.Well, "--" is definitely an error here. How to cope?Could you, please, suggest me a better regexp.
With your rather vague definition of a "word", you could come up with:See a demo on ideone.com and on regex101.com. You might redefine what a "word" is.
