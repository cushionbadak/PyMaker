Prompt: Write a program that adds all the digits in an integer. If the resulting sum is more than one digit, keep repeating until the sum is one digit. For example, the number 2345 has the sum 2+3+4+5 = 14 which is not a single digit so repeat with 1+4 = 5 which is a single digit.This is the code I have so far. It works out for the first part, but I can't figure out how to make it repeat until the sum is a single digit. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to nest the code I already have with another while statementthis is a sample output of the codeInput an integer: 987656789123988 + 9 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 888 + 8 = 161 + 6 = 7
This should work, no division involved.It basically converts the integer to a string, then sums over the digits using a list comprehension and continues until the number is no greater than 9.
you can try this solution, if n=98 then your output will be 8
You don't need to convert your integer to a float here; just use the divmod() function in a loop:By making it a function you can more easily use it to repeatedly apply this to a number until it is smaller than 10:
You could utilize recursion.Try this:
I'm not sure if it's anti-practice in Python because I know nothing about the language, but here is my solution.Again I am unsure about the recursion within a function in Python, but hey, it works :)
If you like recursion, and you must:
