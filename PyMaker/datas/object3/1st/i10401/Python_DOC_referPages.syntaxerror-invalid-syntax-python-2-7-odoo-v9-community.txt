I have this code which checks if there's a provider specified, and a pem key, in order to send over an xml to a server:On this line: _logger.info(_("Token is: {}").format(token)) is throwing me SyntaxError: invalid syntax this is my traceback:I've checked for missing parenthesis, and stuff like that, but I still cannot figure it out.Any ideas on this?Thanks in advance!
Logger needs to be tabbed over, to be in the try block.
