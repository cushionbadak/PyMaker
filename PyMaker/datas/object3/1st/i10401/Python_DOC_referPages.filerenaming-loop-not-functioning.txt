I'm having trouble understanding why my code doesn't work.I want to rename each file in a particular folder in an order like this:Foldername_1Foldername_2 Foldername_3 etc...The code I wrote should increase the 'num' variable by 1 every time it reloops the for loop.However I'm getting this Error:FileExistsError: [WinError 183] Cannot create a file when that file  already exists: '90' -> 'Foldername_1'
You are setting num to 0 for each iteration. Move the num = 0 out of the loop:You don't need to format the name variable again; "{}".format(name) produces the same string as what is already in name. And rather than manually increment a number, you could use the enumerate() function to produce the number for you:Take into account that os.listdir() doesn't list names in alphabetical order; rather, you'll get an order that is based on the on-disk directory structure, which depends on the order files where created and the exact filesystem implementation. You may want to sort manually:
