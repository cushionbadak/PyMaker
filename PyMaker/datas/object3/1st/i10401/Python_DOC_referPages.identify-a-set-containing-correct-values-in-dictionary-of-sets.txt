I have a dictionary of sets, and two values to test. I need to identify the set containing both values (there's only one correct set) and return the key of that set. I thought I could get away with a one-liner like that below, but no success this far. The desired output here would be: True, "set1"The "v for k, v in d.items()" part doesn't do the trick. Nor does simpler "x in d.values()" What would work? Or will I just need to construct a proper for-loop for this? Thanks for your help!

You can use set.issubset (which uses the <= operator) by combining your needle characters into a set.You could roll it into a function with your requested output like:
You could slightly change the logic in your function to achieve this:Calling next on the generator will return the first k (set name) if one exists and a default value of False is assigned if the value is not present. Then you return accordingly. This yields the following results for different runs:
You can filter the sets for which the set composed of value1 and value2 is a subset:
