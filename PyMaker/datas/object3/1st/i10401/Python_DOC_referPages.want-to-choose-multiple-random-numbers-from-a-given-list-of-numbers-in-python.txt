In Python how can I choose two or more random numbers from a given list,such that the numbers are chosen in the same sequence they are arranged in the list they are chosen from?It seems random.choice selects only one number from the list per iteration and as stated earlier random.sample does not give satisfactory answers.for example:The code gives me the following result:But I want the answer as:or
Looks like you want four consecutive values starting at a random offset, not four values from anywhere in the sequence. So don't use sample, just select a random start point (early enough to ensure the slice doesn't run off the end of the list and end up shorter than desired), then slice four elements off starting there:You could factor it out to make it a little nicer (allowing you to one-line individual selections):
Answer for original version of question:To get two samples randomly, use random.sample.  First, lets define a list:Now, lets get two samples randomly:Sampling is done without replacement.
