I have a function which merges two sorted lists (a, b) into one sorted (c). If given lists have different lengths I need to insert the rest of the longest into the list c. But the way I did it - it gives the result with brackets inside the list c (for instance if a = [1,3,5] and b = [2,4,6] then the function returns [1,2,3,4,5,[6]]. How can I get rid of those brackets?here`s my code
you would have to add each value individually like this:
You should use .extend() in your last lines:because a[i:] and b[j:] are going to be listsBut I don't understand why you won't you use existing methods to your end result:Won't that workÂ ?
