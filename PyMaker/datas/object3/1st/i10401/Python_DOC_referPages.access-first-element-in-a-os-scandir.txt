This question already has an answer here:there's no next() function in a yield generator in python 3                    2 answers                I am using os.scandir for getting the list of files in a folder:I want to get the first element.I am trying img_list2.next()So I tried:So just like in list we can get the first element value, can we get it from os.scandir?
os.scandir() returns an iterator containing the directory entries for a given path, see help(os.scandir):To get a value from it call the built-in next on it:This will return values from the iterator until it is exhausted (and StopIteration is raised).You can also wrap it in a list call which create a list out of all entries and make it indexable but if you only require the first element that is overkill. iterator.next() was removed as of Python 3.0 with PEP 3114; a dunder iterator.__next__() method replaced it along with the built-in next() that calls it.
next() would give you the next item from the img_list2 iterator:
