I'm trying to make a calculator but little bit different.I'm thinking if a get input as operation like:At the moment, the program needs to make a problem with user's input. For example, if user types 3 for first number, + for first operation, 2 for second number. I can only write those inputs like 3 + 2, but I want to solve after print answer.
Grab the operations from the operator module and create a dictionary of the available operators:After doing this you can use first_operation as the key on ops, get the corresponding function for the operation and supply first_number and second_number as its arguments:Let's say we enter 5 and 10 and +, then:Note, the numbers are wrapped in int before supplying them to the operator since they behave differently when of type str.As a simple alternative, you could use literal_eval from the ast module, supplying it an expression as input:Here you don't need to change anything to int, you just join all arguments and make a string of the overall expression and feed it to literal_eval for it to do its thing.In essence your call will look like:With a result of 15, again.
