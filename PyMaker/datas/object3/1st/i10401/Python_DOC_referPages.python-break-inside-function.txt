I am using Python 3.5, and I would like to use the break command inside a function, but I do not know how.I would like to use something like this:I know that I could just use this code:And if you don't care about the print('Continue') part, you can even do this one-liner:while a != 0: a = int(input('Number: '))(as long as a was already assigned to something other than 0)However, I would like to use a function, because other times it could help a lot.Thanks for any help.
Usually, this is done by returning some value that lets you decide whether or not you want to stop the while loop (i.e. whether some condition is true or false):
A function can't break on behalf of its caller. The break has to be syntactically inside the loop.
You want to use return, not break. break is used to stop a loop. The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the smallest enclosing for or while loop.return is used to exit the function and return a value. You can also return None. 
The break keyword is meant to be used as in your loop example only and must be inside the loop's scope.Update your function to return True or False only instead:Then in your loop, simply use like this:Your stopIfZero function is also somewhat overloaded (i.e. has more than just 1 responsibility) because it does more than just check if a value is zero or not. For example, it:converts the arguments into an int,prints a message, andis not re-usable in other parts of your programTake those reasons into consideration to improve your code.
