I have a csv file of data from a LiDAR sensor that looks like this, but with a bagillion more lines:This is data from a planar sensor. So Scan_0 is a list or "radial" coordinates for the specific scan at a time stamp. My plan is to:Read the CSV file into a listCreate Separate Array's for each scan (columns)Turn each element of the scan array into a xyz format like the example below.Write the array of xyz coordinates to a new csv file with one coordinate per line'eventually use a trajectory instead of timestamp for the z coordinate from another csv file.I tell you all of this, so you have some context for my motivation. To start this little project, I've decided to simply try and read the csv file into a list and output each of the lines to another csv file... start small right?here is what I have so far:This creates an empty csv file. What am I doing wrong here? I feel like an ant climbing mount Everest. Any help, advice, and guidance is greatly appreciated.  
When running your code, I get the following error: Are you sure you are not getting the same kind of error? Because based on the documentation of csv, the method seems to be writerow instead of write.So, like Rob Davis already seems to have answered, thedatawriter.writerow(row)
I am not sure why this isn't blowing up on you.  csv.writer objects don't have a write function.  Try thedatawriter.writerow(row) instead.
