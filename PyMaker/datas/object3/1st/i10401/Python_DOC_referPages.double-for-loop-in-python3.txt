There is list named L.Which contains others list: L=[A,B,C,...N]I want to for-loop, where B is no equal A (see #2)Something like: for B is not A in L:How can I do that?
Just access the rest of the list by index:
You can use an if statement to filter out the cases you don't want:
Better solution using itertools, either with permutations or with combinations:Either one of these is significantly faster than using nested loops that require indexing (and bonus, requires only one level of indentation, reducing "arrow patterns" in your code).If the body of the loop was print(A, B, sep=',', end=' ') and L = [1, 2, 3], the output of the permutations loop would be:For combinations, you'd get:so choose whichever matches your desired behavior.An additional benefit of using the itertools functions is that they'll work just fine when L is a non-sequence collection (e.g. a set), or when it's an iterator that can only be traversed once (they'll cache the values internally so they can produce them more than once). Other solutions require explicit conversion to list/tuple or the like to handle the "L is a one-use iterator" case.
