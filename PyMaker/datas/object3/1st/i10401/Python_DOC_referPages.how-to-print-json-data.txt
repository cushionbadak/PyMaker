I have following json file and python code and i need output example...json filepythonout put exampleany ideas how to do that?
This doesn't have anything to do with JSON. You have a dictionary, and you want to print the keys, which you can do with data.keys().
Here's a working example (it's emulating your file using io.StringIO):As you can see, the answer to your question is using keys() method
For the sake of completeness:Works in any version of Python. If you care about order:Though in all honesty, I'd probably do Jim's approach:
Simply unpack the keys with * in a print call, this provides the keys as positional arguments to print; use sep = '\n' if you want each key on a different line:This will print out:As noted by @WayneWerner print(*data, sep='\n') is in effect like calling data.keys() and achieves the same result.
