I'm making a python server running on my computer and java socket client running on my phone. the minute the java tries to connect, the app freezes. Not saying anything in the logcat. I have no idea why...python 3.5.1:java:but actually, logcat never prints "connected successfuly". just "trying to connect".
This line is wrong:Servers don't call connect(). Servers call listen() and accept(). Only clients call connect().Since your server calls bind() and listen(), but not accept(), any client will hang trying to connect to it.Resources:https://wiki.python.org/moin/TcpCommunicationhttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.htmlhttp://beej.us/guide/bgnet/
