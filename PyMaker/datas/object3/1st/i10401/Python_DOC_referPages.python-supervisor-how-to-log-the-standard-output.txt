ok...python output is buffered,use this after printor ( python 3 )or better https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html
You can also install a stdout friendly version using pip install supervisor-stdout. Find the usage instructions here.UPDATE:you can also update your supervisord.conf to point the output to stdout.
