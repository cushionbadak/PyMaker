Here is my code and error message, anyone have any ideas why there are such exception? Thanks.Source Code,Error Code,
This is expected behavior: tf.app.run() passes the result of main() to sys.exit() (to make it easier to set an edit code), and sys.exit() raises an exceptions.SystemExit exception.It's important to mention that using tf.app.run() is completely optional. Many TensorFlow scripts include it because it is more compatible with the Google Python coding style. However, if you need to customize the logic in your script, you are free to omit tf.app.run(). (The same applies to tf.app.flags.)
It's coming from the sys.exit() call, about which the following is said:Since exit() ultimately “only” raises an exception, it will only exit the process when called from the main thread, and the exception is not intercepted.In your case, sys.exit seems to be called from the function run() unconditionally, so avoid intercepting SystemExit. If you want to handle all kinds of application-relevant exception, try catching Exception instead of the bare except, since SystemExit:...inherits from BaseException instead of Exception so that it is not accidentally caught by code that catches Exception. This allows the exception to properly propagate up and cause the interpreter to exit.
