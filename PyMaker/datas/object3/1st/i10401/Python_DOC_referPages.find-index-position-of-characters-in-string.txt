I am trawling through a storage area and the paths look a lot like this: storagearea/storage1/ABC/ABCDEF1/raw/2013/05/ABCFGM1 I wont always know what year is it. I need to find the starting index position of the year Therefor I am looking for where I find the following in the file name (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 etc...) I have set up a list as follows:and I can find if it is in the file nameBut how do I find the character index of the year in the absolute path? 
Instead of using a generator expression (which has its own scope), use a traditional loop and then print the found word's index and break when you find a match:
I'd suggest joining those years to a regular expression using '|' as a delimiter...... and then using re.search to find a match and span() and group() to find the position of that match and the matched year itself:
Python string.index
