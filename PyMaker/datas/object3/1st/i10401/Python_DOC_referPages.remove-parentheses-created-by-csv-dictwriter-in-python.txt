when i'm saving a dictionary representing a graph with the format:and save it with the csv.DictWriter and load it i get:How  can i avoid the added quotation marks for the value lists or what code do i have to use to remove them when reading the file? Help would be appreciated!the csv file opened in editor looks like this:
You haveThenThis writes a list to the file -- it is converted to str.Do, for example
You're trying to "serialize" this data using CSV, which might be appropriate if you want to analyze the file outside of Python. If not, your problem will be solved more easily with the pickle module.If you must use CSV, make sure the values you save as "edges" to the file are all strings. Then when you read them back from the file, turn them back to a list.That gives {'a': [], 'b': ['a', 'c'], 'c': ['a'], 'd': []} as requested.
CSV is not intended for nested data structures; it has no meaningful way of dealing with them (it's converting your list values to str for output).You either need to use a more appropriate format (e.g. JSON or pickle), or use horrible hacks to convert the repr of the values back to their original values, e.g. ast.literal_eval (except that won't work properly if some of the original values were supposed to be strings).
