Natural Text
I have a list of string elements like user_contract = ['ZNZ6','TNZ6','ZBZ6']I have a data set which has nested list structure like data = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]I want to assign each of the user_contract strings as variable names for each of the data nested list, in the respective order. I know I can do this manually by typing ZNZ6, TNZ6, ZBZ6 = data. I don't think this is flexible enough, and I would have to manually change this line every time I change the names in user_contract.Is there a way where I can make use of the user_contract variable to assign data to each of its elements?
This code can help you: It creates a dictionary from the two lists and prints it:
You can use exec to evaluate expressions and assign to variables dynamically:
You can use a dictionary comprehension to assign the values:Then you can access the values like so
