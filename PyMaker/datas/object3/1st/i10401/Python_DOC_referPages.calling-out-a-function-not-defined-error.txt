I'm new to making classes and I'm trying to complete exercise 9-1 in my 'Python Crash Course' book where the last part of the question asks me to call back my method but I end up getting'not defined error' for describe_restaurant().Here is my code:I thought that describe_restaurant shouldn't need to be defined though because I'm calling it out as a function to use?
Try:You need to create a class instance and call it's functions. In addition, as mentioned in the comments, you need to pass self to the instance methods. A short explanation of this can be found here.
