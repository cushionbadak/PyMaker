I'm new to python (and coding in general), I've gotten this far but I'm having trouble. I'm querying against a web service that returns a json file with information on every employee. I would like to pull just a couple of attributes for each employee, but I'm having some trouble.I have this script so far:The JSON that it returns looks like this...You can see that with the script I can return the name of employee in index 1. But I would like to have something more along the lines of: print j[**0 through len(j)**]['name'] so it will print out the name (and preferably the phone number too) of every employee in the json list.I'm fairly sure I'm approaching something wrong, but I need some feedback and direction.
Your JSON is the list of dict objects. By doing j[1], you are accessing the item in the list at index 1. In order to get all the records, you need to iterate all the elements of the list as:where j is result of j = json.loads(the_page) as is mentioned in your answer
Slightly nicer for mass-conversions than repeated dict lookup is using operator.itemgetter:If you needed to look up individual things as needed (so you didn't always need name or phone_number), then regular dict lookups would make sense, this just optimizes the case where you're always retrieving the same set of items by pushing work to builtin functions (which, on the CPython reference interpreter, are implemented in C, so they run a bit faster than hand-rolled code). Using a generator based map isn't strictly necessary, but it avoids making (potentially large) temporary lists when you're just going to iterate the result anyway.It's basically just a faster version of:
