I have the following utility:However, if the --foo option is used, the --bat option should be disallowed, and conversely, the --bat option should only be used if --bar and --baz are present. How can I accomplish that using argparse? Sure, I could add a bunch of if / else blocks to check for that, but there's something built-in argparse that could do that for me? 
You can create mutually-exclusive groups of options with parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group:, but for more complex dependency graphs (for example, --bat requiring --bar and --baz), argparse doesn't offer any specific support. That'd be going too far in the direction of the inner-platform effect, trying to rebuild too much of the full generality of a complete programming language within the argparse subsystem.
