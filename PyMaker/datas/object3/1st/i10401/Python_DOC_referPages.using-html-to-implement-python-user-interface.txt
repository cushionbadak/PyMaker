I've just started learning a bit of Python and I'm currently trying to implement a Python UI through HTML. Is there anything in vanilla Python that would allow for this, similar to how you can create UI's with Java and XML with JFX or will I have to use a framework such as Django? I'm reluctant to use Django as there are many features that I do not needThanks,Michael
In vanilla python wsgiref is very helpful for building the server-side of web-applications (possibly with str.format or string.Template and/or json) but if you want it more direct communication I would suggest XML-RPC (there are good js-clients out there).It is also possible to execute Python Scripts right in your Website with Brython or (with strong constraints) IronpythonFor Windows you can build HTML Applications with Ironpython (have not tried but in theory it should work) or Brython (if you dont want to require the user to have ironpython installed)You can also use Pyjs to build applications but while it uses html and javascript, i think it you dont see much of it.There are HTML things in some ui-libraries like in wxpython (I am quite sure you will find them in many libraries)
