I have a working piece of code in Python 2.7:I'm trying to get it working in Python 3.5  I swapped xrange with range but the character shifting at the bottom doesn't work anymore and returns TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'.  I haven't been able to figure out what changed in Python 3 to cause that.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
Got it working correctly.  chr() was replaced to return the byte equivalent of the character.  Had to change the md5hash initialization to an empty byte variable instead of a string.  Then just .decode() it at the end to return a nice string.
