I am trying to create the concrete class Val15 class with the Mixins, MyCollection, Val5, Val10. Val15 is trying to inherit values from MyCollection. When Val15 is instantiated, I am trying to call both Val10's and Val5's  value and add them to Val15, values. However, it turns out that Val15 will inherit only Val10's value and all the classes will call Val10's value. How exactly can you overturn this problem?
This is the interesting part:To get the sum of parents' values, you have to call each of them:Alternative solutionAnother approach is to define that value always returns the sum of all inherited values, whatever they may be, without knowing which parent classes' value to call:This solution does not make any assumptions about the way inheritance is going to be configured.Remarks:The answer assumes that this is Python 3, because of the super() syntaxgetattr(super(), 'value', lambda: 0) returns the bound value method of the parent class, if such exists, or defaults to a function which returns 0.
