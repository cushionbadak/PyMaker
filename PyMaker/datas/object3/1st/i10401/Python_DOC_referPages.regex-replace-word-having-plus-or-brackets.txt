Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Escaping regex string in Python                    4 answers                In Python, I am trying to doto replace a word with some text. Using re rather than just doing text.replace to replace only if the whole word matches using \b. Problem comes when there are characters like +, (, [ etc in word. For example +91xxxxxxxx. Regex treats this + as wildcard for one or more and breaks with error. sre_constants.error: nothing to repeat. Same is in the case of ( too.Could find a fix for this after searching around a bit. Is there a way?
Just use re.escape(string):It replaces all critical characters with a special meaning in regex patterns with their escape forms (e.g. \+ instead of +).Just a sidenote: formatting with the percent (%) character is deprecated and was replaced by the .format() method of strings.
