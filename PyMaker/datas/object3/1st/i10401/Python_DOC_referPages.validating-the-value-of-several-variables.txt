What I am after: The user is allowed to input only 0 or 1 (for a total of 4 variables). If the user inputs for example 2, 1, 1, 0 it should throw an error saying Only 0 and 1 allowed.What I've tried so far:Problem: When I use such a statement, I get either the result even when I input for example 5, or I get 'only 0 and 1 allowed' even though I wrote all 1 or 0.I found this which seemed to be what I was after, but it is still not working like I want it to:This code basically gives me the same result as what I get with the first code sample.
Use any:of course, if you use a list it will look even better
This is due to the operator precedence in python. The or operator is of higher precedence than the and operator, the list looks like this:orandnot!=, ==(Source: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence)So, python interprets your expression like this (the brackets are to clarify what is going on):Which results in a different logic than what you want. There are 2 possible solutions to this, the first one is to add brackets to make the expression unambiguous. This is quite tedious and long-winded:The other approach is to use the in-built all function:
I'd break it down into the two parts that you're trying to solve: Is a particular piece of input valid? Are all the pieces of input taken together valid?
