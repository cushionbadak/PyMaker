If I have a list of items e.g words=['Hi','I'm','a','computer']. Is there any way I can get the item with the index so it would look something like this...Input:print(words.index(2))Output:I'mSo in conclusion i am looking for a way to reverse the index() function and use the index to search an object rather than an object to find the index.
You could just use the following syntax to access a certain element of your list:Output:Note that the index starts with 0.
Lists in python are like arrays in Java, C or other languages. Just index them.
