Natural Text
Very new to Python and I'm now learning by trying to write a program to process data from first few lines from multiple text files. so far so good - getting the data in and reformatting it for output.Now I'd like to change the format of one output field based on what row it sits in in the csv file. The file is 15 rows with variable number of columns.The idea is that:I preload the CSV file - I'd like to hardcode it into a list or dictionary - not sure what works better for the next step.Go thru the 15 rows in the list/dictionary and if a match is found - set the output to column 1 in the same row.Example Data:For example:returns BITQuestions:Is a list or dictionary a better for search speed?If I use the csv module to load the data does it matter that number of columns aren't same for every row?Is there a way to search either list or dictionary without using a loop?My attempt to load into list and search:Would this work for searching for matching code searchcode?
I think that you should try with two-dimensional dictionaryThen you can search for the element and print it.
you can use "index" to search for an item in a list. if there that item in the list it will return the location of the first occurrence of it.you can catch the error with a "try" "except" and keep searching.
