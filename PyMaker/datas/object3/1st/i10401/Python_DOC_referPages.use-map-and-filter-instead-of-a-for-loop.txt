How do I write an equivalent of the code below using map and filter?This is the expected result:Here's the code I wrote, but it doesn't seem to work:
You can write it as (in Python 2.x):This also uses a list comprehension.In Python 3.x:
You don't even need map and filter, you could do the whole thing in a list comprehension
An alternative, you can make use of the fact that odd or even numbers can be captured by using the 3rd step argument of range:
You need to use product method from itertools, which produces cartesian product of input iterables.Output would be [(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
