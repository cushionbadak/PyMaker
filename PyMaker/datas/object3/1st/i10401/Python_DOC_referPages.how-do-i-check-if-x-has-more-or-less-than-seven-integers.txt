At the moment I'm getting this error:    b = len.x() AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no  attribute 'x'Sorry, I'm quite new to python, thanks for all the help!
You can checkout the solution given in the below thread if you are dealing with date and time.Getting input date from the user in python using datetime.datetime
Python'a len() is a function. It does not work like you think it does. What you doing is incorrect. Instead of this:b = len.x()Do this:b = len(str(x))You seem to be confused about the len() function. I suggest you read the Python documentation about it.
