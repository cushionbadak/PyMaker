The answer by teivaz is correct, but maybe incomplete. The way you are using the ConfigParser object is almost correct in Python 3 (docs), but not Python 2 (docs).Here is Python 2:And Python 3:Note: Python 2's ConfigParser.set() won't complain if you give it a non-string value (e.g. config.set('Testing', 'age', 10)), but it will throw a TypeError when you try to retrieve it. Python 3 will throw a TypeError when you use the set() method with a non-string value, but it will quietly convert values to strings with the __setitem__ access. E.g.:
You are simply not using it right. Here you can find examples.About the error you are getting you can read here:object.__setitem__(self, key, value)  Called to implement assignment to self[key].
