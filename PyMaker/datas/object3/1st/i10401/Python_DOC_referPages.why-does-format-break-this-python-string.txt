Natural Text
gives me : Key Error: Hello\\I want to print the output: {Hello} 42
You need to double the {{ and }}:Here's the relevant part of the Python documentation for format string syntax:Format strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces {}. Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {{ and }}.
You escape it by doubling the braces.Eg:
The OP wrote this comment:It's pretty common that the "escaping braces" issue comes up when dealing with JSON.I suggest doing this:It's cleaner than the alternative, which is:Using the json library is definitely preferable when the JSON string gets more complicated than the example.
Try doing this:
Try this:x = "{{ Hello }} {0}"
Python 3.6+ (2017)In the recent versions of Python one would use f-strings (see also PEP498).With f-strings one should use double {{ or }}produces the desiredIf you need to resolve an expression in the brackets instead of using literal text you'll need three sets of brackets:produces
Although not any better, just for the reference, you can also do this:It can be useful for example when someone wants to print {argument}. It is maybe more readable than '{{{}}}'.format('argument')Note that you omit argument positions (e.g. {} instead of {0}) after Python 2.7
If you are going to be doing this a lot, it might be good to define a utility function that will let you use arbitrary brace substitutes instead, likeNote that this will work either with brackets being a string of length 2 or an iterable of two strings (for multi-character delimiters). 
Reason is , {} is the syntax of .format() so in your case .format() doesn't recognize {Hello} so it threw an error.you can override it by using double curly braces {{}},  or try %s for text formatting,
