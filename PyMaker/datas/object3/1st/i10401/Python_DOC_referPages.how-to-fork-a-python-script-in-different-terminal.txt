I want to fork a new process in a script, but how to interactive with the subprocess in a new terminal?For example:The script should print a/b and ask for a new value. But these two process share a same terminal, and that makes it confused.How can I open a new terminal and let the subprocess run in the new terminal?I've thought about to use subprocess.Popen('gnome-terminal',shell=True) and communicate with the new terminal. But gnome-terminal will open bash on default, how can i open a terminal only for input and output?
Its probably bad practice to open a new terminal like that from a command line application, but gnome-terminal has an -e flag. E.g. gnome-terminal -e python will open a python interpreter.
I finally implement it in a(maybe ugly) way.Inspired by https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/256480/how-do-i-run-a-command-in-a-new-terminal-window-in-the-same-process-as-the-origiI'v solve most of the problem:The only problem is that the prompt: 'b?' will still show in the former terminal. So the new question is: where does prompt belongs?Despite that, another way to solve this prompt problem:I'm a little strange and, mad... I know...
