I want to control running process/program by script in Python. I have a program `linphonecÂ´ (You can install: apt-get install linphonec).My task is:Run linphonec (I'm using subprocess at the moment)When linphonec is running it has many commands to control this and I want to e.g use proxy list (command in linphonec).Simple flow:How can I do this?
There are actually 2 ways to communicate:Run your program with myprogram.py | linphonec to pass everything you print to linphonecUse subprocess.Popen with subprocess.PIPE in constructor via keywrod-args for stdin (propably stdout and stderr, too) and then communicate for a single command or use stdin and stdout (stderr) as files
