So I have start working with Curses in Python.I have got this source code to start with and slowly I will make some updates to it:The thing I want to do now is to make sure that when I can't hit the border of the screen. But I'm not sure what function in the this I can use for that.I have read in the python docs but can't find anything I think will work.
You know the valid range. From 0 to to y1 inclusive. (0 to x1 respectively). So just add tests to ensure the coordinates stay within the range:and similar for the x.
