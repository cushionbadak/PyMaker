Hi I am new to Python and I am struggling regarding how to print dictionary.I have a dictionary as shown below.How can I print dictionary in one line as shown below?I want to print keys and values in one line but could not figure out by myself.I would appreciate your advice!
With a dictionary, e.g. You could try:Resulting ina1c2b1If order matters, try using an OrderedDict, as described by this post.
If you want a string to contain the answer, you could do this:This uses the join method on an empty string. Dict's are not ordered, so the order of the output may vary.
