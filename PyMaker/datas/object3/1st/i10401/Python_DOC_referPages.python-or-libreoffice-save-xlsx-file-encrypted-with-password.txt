I am trying to save an Excel file encrypted with password. I have tried following the guide on https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Protecting_Content_in - and works perfectly. However, this is in the GUI, but I am looking for a solution using the command line interface in headless mode.I have looked at the man libreoffice, but I could not find anything in there. Likewise I have looked at the documentation of the Python 3 library openpyxl, but I did not find anything useful there either.Is it possible to save an Excel 2007+ file encrypted with a password on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 using the command line (or Python library) that do not require any user interaction or X session?
There is solution using Jython and Apache POI. If you want like to use it from CPython/PyPy, you can use subprocess module to call external Jython script.I assume that you have Java JRE/JDK installedCreate non-encrypted xlsx file with Excel/Calc or use xlsxwriter or openpyxl and save it as test1.xlsxDownload standalone JythonDownload Apache POIExtract Apache POI in same dir where is standalone Jython jarSave following Jython script as encrypt.py:Call it from console:Where:encrypt.py - name of scripttest1.xlsx - input filenametest1enc.xlsx - output filename12345678 - passwordFinal encrypted xslx should be in test1enc.xlsx.
