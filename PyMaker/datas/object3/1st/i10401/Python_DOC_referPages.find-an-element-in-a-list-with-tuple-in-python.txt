I have a little complicated data and want to find specific element with key tuple. target tuple is a little different from key, because it has an id property. So I cannot use key in target.So what's the best way to implement smart searching in this case?I want to implement find method to extract expected slot like below.
If the key-value pairs must match exactly, you can use Dictionary view objects to treat the key-value pairs as sets. You want to find a strict subset:This finds the first match only.You could turn this into a one-liner:If you must produce all matches, you can replace return with yield in the above method to turn it into a generator, or you could use a list comprehension:The above uses Python 3 syntax. In Python 2, dictionary views are available through the special .viewkeys(), .viewvalues() and .viewitems() methods, so add in view to the method name:Demo (on Python 3):
