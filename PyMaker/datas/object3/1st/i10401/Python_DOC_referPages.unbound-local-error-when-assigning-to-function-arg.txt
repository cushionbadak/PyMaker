gives me:-Why is init not visible inside accumulate? 
That's because during parsing the inner function when Python sees the assignment init = init + part it thinks init is a local variable and it will only look for it in local scope when the function is actually invoked.To fix it add init as an argument to accumulate with default value of init:Read: Why am I getting an UnboundLocalError when the variable has a value?
Since you declare init inside accumulate, Python interprets it as local and therefore referenced before assignment. (Note that I removed the init = part). I am definitely not an expert about this, but got the hint from these posts : Here and Here.I guess someone could explain it better...
