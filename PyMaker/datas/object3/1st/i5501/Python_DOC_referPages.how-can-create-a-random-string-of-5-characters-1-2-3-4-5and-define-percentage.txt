How can create a random string of 5 characters? (1,2,3,4,5) and define percentage-wise of this characters.I'd like to define how many times in % should be every character from ["1","2","3","4","5"] in new random_charfor example: is 50% from 100 it should be 50 characters of '1' is 20% from 100 it should be 20 characters of '2' is 10% form 100 it should be 10 characters of '3' is 15% from 100 it should be 15 characters of '4' is  5% from 100 it should be  5 characters of '5'No more than 100 %, of course.
Function random.choices is new in python 3.6, but you can easily to implement it with random.shuffle:Sample output:
If you always want that fixed proportion in a 100-char-long string, you can simply shuffle a string with what you want:That gives you something like:'1112213241213121114254411211141541342111141411411152423322114133124141512212211521213131111111311214'If you want it to be random and have any length, then you can use choices instead.Which gives results like:'5514232551'
I'm not sure I understand your question, but here's a guess:Sample output:However, as I said in a comment, using random.shuffle() would be more efficient and straightforward:
