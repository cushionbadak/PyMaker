got a problem with my code here. I am trying to get a script working that can make an ePub file. They are compressed zip files that are deflated (i.e. without compression) and have to be done in order. This current script will create a .zip but it is unusable a creates errors both in Python Shell and on the Terminal app when running the zip -t command.The error in question is as follows on the Python shell:The error in question on the Mac Terminal (though I am sure the output would the same wherever I ran zip -t:Python source code:JSON file I used:
The problem lies somewhere inside is_zipfile. Although it is stayed that "filename may be a file or file-like object" (13.5.1. ZipFile Objects: zipfile.is_zipfile), it fails with the seek error.A possible solution is to close the file and reopen it just to check:I also found that that check is extremely basic and will return True even if you manually damage some bytes. It takes some effort to actually make it fail.Interestingly, the apparent more thorough zipfile.ZipFile.testzip function needs that zf again â€“ but it also fails if called before zf.close(). And there is no zf.flush() ...Luckily, checking the created ePub file with zip after running the script reveals it contains no errors:(which does not tell you, by the way, that it is a valid epub. (It is not.))
I suggest you try closing before validating.  Doing whole-file operations on files which are still open for write may not give valid results.
