This question already has an answer here:Is it possible to access current object while doing list/dict comprehension in Python?                    4 answers                list comprehension is very useful.I want to know how to write a self-reference in the python list comprehension.for example -how to write the part of itself[i-1]?ADDSorry, my explain is bad...I want to get the list by a high-speed way.input listlist_a = [0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]output listlist_c = [0, 0, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9]like a saw tooth list.
List comprehension is meant to be a compact expression for the most straightforward use cases. You cannot reference the list itself in list comprehension, for that just use a regular for-loop:You can also rewrite that loop in a more efficient way:
You cannot reference a list before it is created. However, you can use this hacky reduce approach if you desperately want a one-liner:And in Python > 3.2, you can use itertools.accumulate:
You can access list_a from your comprehension:
