This a chat-respond program and the problem I am currently facing is that I try to make it exit if the input answer does not match one of my answers, but since all the answers of the three of the questions were put together as Response so even the right for the question it randomly chose was inputted, python still thinks it is not right because it does not meet the other two and then it will exit. Please tell me how can I take a different approach on this programs.Thanks for the help1

Python provides nice flow control structure for this using elif. See the official documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html So the idea is that all statements are evaluated as a unit.Now the statements will run until one is True. If all are false, it will default to the else statement. 
Instead ofdo this:
You should group the prompts and the expected answers and replies by the chatbot, e.g. as tuples in the form (prompt, expected_answer, [some, possible, replies])This will also make it easier to extend your chatbot with more question/answer pairs or also to provide different chatbot replies to different user-answers.
Don't understand your code, but you can do something like:
