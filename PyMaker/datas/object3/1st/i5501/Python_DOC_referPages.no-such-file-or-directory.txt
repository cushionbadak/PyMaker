I am trying to read a lot of excel files from a directory. When I run the following code, it gives me this error:Code:this way, I was reading from the local folder, which is why it couldn't find the file. Thanks. 
Like it says, 35TP2_TR1.xlsx is not a file or a directory, because the script can't find it from the relative path (i.e the script is not located in the same folder than the .xlsx file).You could try os.path.abspath(file[s]) to get the absolute path of the file.
