I write a python script, which needs a list of all hexadecimal characters.Is it a good idea to do list(string.printable[:16]) to get ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'] ?
The simplest way would be a list comprehension of all numbers from 0 to 15 formatted as hex:User GarbageCollector suggested a nice alternative in comments, which must be adapted to remove the redundant, uppercased chars:to get a list:the fact that the order of the characters remains the same in string.hexdigits in future python version is however unknown. Still nice to know that string has some many useful characters groups.
How about doing list('0123456789abcdef') to make it explicit?If you don't want to spell it out, [f'{i:x}' for i in range(16)] should also work.
The answer to your question is: it is not a particularly good idea.From the Python docs:string.printableString of ASCII characters which are considered printable. This is a combination of digits, ascii_letters, punctuation, and whitespace.An implementation of Python could follow this definition, but choose to provide the characters in a different order, which could break your code.Even if the order were defined, it would not be obvious without being familiar with the definition, what result the code would produce.There is a string.hexdigits constant, whose value is strictly defined as '0123456789abcdefABCDEF', so taking the first 16 digits of that would definitely be a better choice, but I would still say that just giving the exact string itself would be clearer.Also note that '01234567890abcdef' is actually two characters shorter than string.hexdigits[:16] anyway.
