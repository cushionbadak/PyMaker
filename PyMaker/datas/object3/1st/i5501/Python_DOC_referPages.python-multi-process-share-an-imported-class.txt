I got an issue on Python multiprocessing sharing imported Class. The troubled part is like this:file A:file B:But the program runs with errors that for each process, the Meta class is not initialized and every attribute is None. I know the reason why, that the Meta class is only initialized in the memory of the main process, and each child process will have its own raw class Meta independently.But is there any way that I can share this class with both parent process and child processes? Thanks!
Have you considered using the initializer and initargs parameters of multiprocessing.Pool?I modified your code slightly to do this and be able to run. It seems to do what you want.File_AFile_B
