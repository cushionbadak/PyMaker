I am trying to change the colours of a countries using GeoJson polygon colour features. This is the code that gives me an error. The last two lines result in the following error message:Since I am new to coding, I on't know what this means.
Looking at [GitHub]: (master) folium/folium/features.py:343 (as it is at this point), looks like folium.GeoJson constructor can only handle (for your scenario) either a:File namePython dictionarySo, the simplest way to solve this, is to just pass the file name:Of course, you could read the file yourself into a dict (using the [Python]: json â€” JSON encoder and decoder module), but it's just what the above file does ~20 lines below.
I solved the exact same problem above with the code found in the following code blockI had to create the following line as a str function to get my code to workin reading the world.json file correctly. The example in the course was notworking for me. I had to therefore import the json Library and read in the filefirst with the encoding and then pass it on the GeoJson methoddescribed further down in the codeI was not able to use the line as explained in the course which was:fg.add_child(folium.GeoJson(data=open('world.json', 'r', encoding=utf-8-sig)))So I defined data_json as mentioned above in this code as a str to be read belowby folium.GeoJson.
As user9608587 has posted it helped me to get an idea how to get this doneI imported 'io' module and used io.open() function.Final code, you can just copy and paste it, it will work.
