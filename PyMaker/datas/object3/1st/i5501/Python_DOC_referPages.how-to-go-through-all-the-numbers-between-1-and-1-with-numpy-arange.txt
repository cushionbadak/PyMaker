I am trying to write a code for random walk, and in the direction part, I met this problem. I want the direction to be any degrees, what I do is try to use py.arrange to generate as many numbers as possible between -1 and 1. I want to ask is there any better solutions to go through all the numbers between -1 and 1? Thanks!Here is my code:
Well, since you asked for "a better solution": the random walks do not have to be simulated (even though this might be cool). You can get the matlab code of the original publication on Leo Gradys website, this might helt implementing something similar in python. If you just want the random numbers, I'd refer to the comment of Patrick Haugh and use random.uniform(-1, 1).
