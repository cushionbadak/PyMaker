If I want to take a number as input, would I also need the .strip() method? Like this:Instead of just coding:I know .strip() returns a copy of the string in which all chars have been stripped from the beginning and the end of the string. But I wonder why / if it is necessary.
It isn't necessary when you cast it to an integer with int because int already handles (ignores) leading and trailing whitespaces*:It's mostly important to strip the whitespaces if you use sys.stdin.readline (which contains a trailing newline character) and you don't know if the function that uses that value can handle additional whitespaces.* Just FYI: The types float, complex, fractions.Fraction, and decimal.Decimal also ignore leading and trailing whitespaces so you don't need to strip the strings if you use any of those.
