Natural Text
I want to code a class called LexicalAnalyzer and within this class I have to code the following functions based on a folder directory.gettop100words: returns a dictionary of the frequency of the overall top 100 words found in the text files of the said folder, not caring for CAPS.get_letter_frequencies: returns a dictionary of frequency of the letters (a-z)How do I write this LexicalAnalyzer ?
Just do for loop inside of the file(text file ofc) and add every word and how many times it occurs and return the dictionary. To split words just add the whole text of the file in one string amd use split function to separate the words into list and loop through it and do the dictionary thing i told you at the begging.
Use in fileinput to iterate over filesUse in collections.Counter for counting objects(words, letters)ExampleEnvironment:Data:Snippet:Output:
