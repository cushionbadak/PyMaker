Natural Text
I'm working with the XML file in this link (Downloadable file of 40MB). In this file, I'm expecting data from 2 types of tags. Those are: OpportunityForecastDetail_1_0 and OpportunitySynopsisDetail_1_0. I wrote the following code for that:Then etree.iterparse(f, tag = _tag) is returning an object which is not iterable. I think this occurs when the tag is not found in the XML file.So, I added name spaces to the iterable tag like this.Now, it is creating an iterable object. But, I'm not getting any text. I tried other namespaces in that file. But, not working.Please tell me the solution to this problem. This is a sample snippet of the XML file. OpportunityForecastDetail_1_0 and OpportunitySynopsisDetail_1_0 tags are repeated n number of times in the XML file.
First, when you are parsing XML that contains namespaces, you must use those namespaces when looking at tag names.Second, iterparse doesn't take an argument named tag, so I don't see how your code could have worked as posted.Finally, the elements returned from iterparse don't have a member function called xpath, so that can't have worked either.Here is an example of how to parse XML using iterparse:As I said in my comment, the Python documentation is helpful, as is the Effbot page on ElementTree.  There are lots of other resources available; put xml.etree.elementtree into Google and start reading!
