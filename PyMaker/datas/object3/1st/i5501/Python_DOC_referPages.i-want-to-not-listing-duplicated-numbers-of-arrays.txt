set() it!Just use set() on the list you want to remove duplicates from. Then list() it to cast it to a list.
You can use list comprehensions in python to achieve this. Suppose you have multiple lists, and want to put all of the unique elements from these lists into one array, you can code it this way.This would return: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
This is a rather unclear question, but to remove duplicates from a list:And to only get uniques from several lists:Edit and answerTo get only unique sets of numbers:Using sets is not required, but will ensure you have no duplicates inside the original lists and things will be easier in other ways as well.
