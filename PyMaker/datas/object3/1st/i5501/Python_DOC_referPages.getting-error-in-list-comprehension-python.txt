Getting an error with this code(SyntaxError: invalid syntax)Result:but same code working fine when i use it without list comprehension method.result:
You are missing the for a. Also, you should use == to test ints and strings for equality because is checks object identity:You could also shorten the == 0 to a bool check and generally consider to use endswith for more robust suffix checking:See the docs on list comprehensions.
The problem is the yield part of the expression:You want to add a*a to the list, so:But the code is very inelegantly. You use is which is reference equality. Although most interpreters cache characters, and small integers, it is a bit risky to rely on it: the more assumptions that have to be satisfied for a program to work, the more can go wrong.Furthermore you can detect whether a*a will end with 0, by checking (a*a)%10 == 0. Since 10 is a multiple of 2, we can even drop the first check then. We can check for an integer i being zero with not i (this is True is i == 0).So a more safe and shorter solution is:This then produces then:
