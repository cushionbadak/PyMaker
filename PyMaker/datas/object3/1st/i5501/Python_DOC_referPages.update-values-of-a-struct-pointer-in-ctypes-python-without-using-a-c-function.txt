I'm having a C function that returns a pointer to an struct:This function is called from Python in the following way:The struct has some values such as:The examples I see on the internet shows that I need to use a function that receives a pointer to alter the values, for example in python:And in C:Is there a way to change the value bind_port directly without using a C function?
Yes. This is why ctypes supports defining your own structs, and defining prototypes for functions.You'd need to make a Python level definition of your structure, e.g.:Then, before calling your C function, you set its restype correctly:Now you can use it by dereferencing (done with [0] since Python lacks a * pointer dereference operator) and setting attributes on the dereferenced struct directly:
