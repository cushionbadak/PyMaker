Natural Text
With Python 3.6 and the Turtle module, I would like to know how to print the coordinates of the turtle on screen.My questions are: How do I print text on the screen, and how do I make that text the player's coordinates?Here is my code.Thank you.Edit I tried write, but it throws a name not defined error.
Here is how you can write the turtle position on screen: the write method from the turtle module, must be called on a Turtle object.
The way I approach this type of problem is to dedicate a turtle to each fixed label on the screen.  That way you can permanentely locate a turtle at that position and simply do undo() to clear the old text followed by write() to write the new.Here's a dynamic example where you can drag the turtle around the screen with your mouse and the current position will be written to the center of the screen:
Use the functions xcor() and ycor() to get coordinates.  Use the function write() to write on the screen.See documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
Maybe this will help:Ok. Here's the explanation.So I defined a function writing the position of something (in this case, the turtle).When I do:I:Lift the pen up andMove backward some steps, so I can center the text.I then do:Which:Puts the pen down andWrites (or outputs) the positionAfter that, when I do:I:Pick the pen upMove it back to the original position andPut the pen down againEDIT:I just realized that you can do it a much more simple way of using write like this:It writes the turtles position, it doesn't move, and it still writes the text but with the canter as the place where it aligns.EDIT #2:I already figured out the problem.Your using write directly and not actually calling it from the object. You should call write like this:
