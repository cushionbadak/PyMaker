How would I go about generating a random float and then rounding that float to the nearest decimal point in Python 3.4?
Assuming you want a float between 0.0 and 1.0, you can do it with:(Note that the division is by 10.0 and not 10 to force the float operation)Output:0.2  0.6  0.8  ...
Method 1:You need two things: The random module and the builtin function round().First you need a random number. This is as easy as:This will produce a number between 0 and 1.  Next use round() to round it:The second argument in round() specifies the number of decimal places it rounds to in this case 1 which means it rounds to 1 decimal place. and your done.Method 2:The other way you can do this is to use random.randint() this will produce a whole number within a range that we can then divide by 10 to get it to one decimal place:and your done
