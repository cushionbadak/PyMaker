I am trying to run this program:and I keep getting this error:I already installed the package using pip more than one time and nothing changes.What am I missing?This is the source of this code.
That error might be due to having multiple python installations on your computer:https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#work-with-multiple-versions-of-python-installed-in-parallelPlease add the following lines somewhere to your script (or to a new script) and run it once from Spyder, and once from the console and compare the output:Buildingspy has to be installed using pip, I would recommend to install it using the command:Anaconda adds an Anaconda prompt to the Start menu, use that to make sure the path to python.exe is correct.Once BuildingsPy is installed correctly, you will run into the problem that on Windows multiprocessing will not work from Spyder (or, from IPython/Jupyter), please also read this issue:https://github.com/lbl-srg/BuildingsPy/issues/179You will have to run your script from the command line.
