I generate an image with Python, and I need to convert this Pil Image into a Base64, without saving this one into any folder... I have some data, and I get RGB img with the line below:What is the simple way to convert this PIL into base64 ?(I can't open a file image because I must not save the img) ?Thank you for your helpWith Node JS, I can get the correct base64 with these lines :But I have to save the file if I use NodeJS... this is the code to generate the matrix from the image, you don't need to know what is in data ;)
You can use base64 library like this:See tobytes() method of Image object.
I found the solution. Hope this helps !
Or you can use something like this:Just pass path of image in get_thumbnail function and image_formatter to display it in HTML.
