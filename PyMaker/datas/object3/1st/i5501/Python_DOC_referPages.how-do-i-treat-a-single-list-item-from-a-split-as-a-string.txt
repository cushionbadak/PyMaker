This is the first time I've written any Python. I have a string similar to the following:Certificates (n): 389429732C9805 36124C3CF2C18 F2C187AA389429n is how many certificates are included (just for humans to read, I don't parse it)I want to split the string, first removing the label and then separating each certificate. So this is what I have working (note that this is one segment of a longer string I have already split):Although it works, it seems stupid to have the outer loop when I always have only one item but I also don't want to split at a fixed position as the n value can differ in length. I also noted that using item.split("): ")[1:][0] takes each letter individually when I try to do it as one line (which is not what I want).The following attempt failed:How can I use just the last element and drop the outer loop? Can I do it with the inner loop all in one line?
If example format is correct you can split by spaces one timeresultdemo
How did exactly your attempt fail? I've copypasted the code from your post and it works:
You could also use str.partition to break up the string into ('Certificates(n', '): ', '389429732C9805 36124C3CF2C18 F2C187AA389429'), then you could split the last string with split():Which Outputs:
