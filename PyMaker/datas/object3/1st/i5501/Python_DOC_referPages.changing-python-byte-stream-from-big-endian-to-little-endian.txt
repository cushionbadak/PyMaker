I have a byte stream, or more specifically an RTP packet. How can I change it from big endian to little endian?
I found out a solution. Place my data into a byte array, and simply reverse it. In hexadecimal, reversing pairs will change it from big-> little, little-> big etc. Therefore reversing a byte array, where each index is two hex pairs, the same applies.Example, 0000 1F40 (Big endian) -> 401F 0000 (Little Endian)If each each two hex numbers represent a byte, i.e 1F or 40 are equal to one byte therefore reversing a byte array is equivalent.
