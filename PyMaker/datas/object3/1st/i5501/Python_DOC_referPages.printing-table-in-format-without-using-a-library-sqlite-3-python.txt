Natural Text
I want to print data from my database in a better format, this is for a game  I made. This is the code:The output is:How can I align them and have a column heading? I would like not to use any library.
Use the string formatting capability:Output:NoteIn this approach, we hard-code the width of the columns. In order to dynamically adjust the columns width, we will have to do a good deal more works. I hope this will work for you.UpdateIn order to dynamically adjust the widths, we need to pass through the data twice: The first time to determine the maximum width for each column, and the second to print.Output:Once you are happy with the result, you can delete the DEBUG lines. They are there to show how the code works.
For the heading, just select the text you want, likeTo format the data, use the printf() function (see https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#printf), like(Adjust as necessary.)
