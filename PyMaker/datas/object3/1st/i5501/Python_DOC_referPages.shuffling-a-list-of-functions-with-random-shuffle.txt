I have some functions:I'd like to put them in a list, shuffle them, and call each of them in succession: My idea was to call each function like this:But this throws a What am I doing wrong, and how can I get this to work?
You have a task to choose one of these functions at random. Here's a small demo does what you're doing, but correctly.Or, if it's only one function you want, there's no need to use random.shuffle at all. Use random.choice instead. Why Your Error Occursrandom.shuffle performs an inplace shuffling, as the docs mention. So, when you call the function, expect nothing in return. In other words, expect None in return. Further, calling () on an object invokes its __call__ method. Since NoneType objects do not have such a method, this errors out with TypeError. For an object to be callable, you'd need - As an exercise, try removing __call__ and rerunning the code. Calling f(20) should give you the same error.
