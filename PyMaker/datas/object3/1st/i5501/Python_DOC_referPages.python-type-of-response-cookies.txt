I am using the requests module of python. In one of the post calls I am getting response cookies. I wanted to read them so I did: then I did : print type(response.cookies). This gave me <class 'requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar'>then I did: print response.cookies. This gave me <RequestsCookieJar[<Cookie a=asdasdd for v.n>]>The type says it is of type Class. The printing of the variable gives a list and I am able to access it like a dictionary. Please explain the print response.cookies syntax.
I'm not sure why you think there's a contradiction here. The RequestsCookieJar class implements the dictionary interface by subclassing collections.MutableMapping, so you can access items by key.
