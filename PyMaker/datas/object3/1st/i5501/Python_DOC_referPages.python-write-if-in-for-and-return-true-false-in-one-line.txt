This question already has an answer here:Check if a Python list item contains a string inside another string                    15 answers                I have a code that checks if a string is in a list of strings like,if a string is found in the list, return True and False otherwise. I am wondering if it can be written in one line of code.
You can use any to iterate through a sequence and see if any item matches some particular condition.
