I want to make this code much more elegant, using loop for getting user input into a list and also making the list as a list of floats withot having to define each argument on the list as a float by itself when coming to use them or print them...I am very new to python 3.x or python in general, this is the first code i have ever written so far so 'mercy me pardon!' 
Since you are saying you are new to Python, I'm going to suggest you experiment with a few methods yourself. This will be a nice learning experience. I'm not going to give you answers directly here, since that would defeat the purpose. I'm instead going to offer suggestions on where to get started. Side note: it's great that you are using Python3. Python3.6 supports f-strings. This means you can replace the line with your print function as follows.Okay, you should look into the following in order:for loopsList comprehensionNamed Tuples functionsZeroDivisionError
Are you looking for something like this :output:
By using a function that does the input for you inside a list comprehension that constructs your 2 numbers:The rest is from your code, changed is the list comp to handle the message and input-creation:Output:Links: try: ...  except:Lists & comprehensions
