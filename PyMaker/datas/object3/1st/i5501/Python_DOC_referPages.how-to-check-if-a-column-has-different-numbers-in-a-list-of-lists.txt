I am trying to identify all the columns that contain different numbersfor example if the list is f = [[3, 5, 6, 7], [7, 5, 6, 3]]I would like to obtain col 0 and col 3 but I am getting: "list index out of range"Any help would be apreciatted.
Using zip can achieve a better solution:zip(*f) gives you:And now you can easily compare the "columns".If you're a one-liner guy:
You swapped the indices. So j is 0,1,2,3 and when it hits 2, the error happens in your if clause. Remember, the first index is giving you the index of the sublist and the second one the index of the item in the sublist.This is correctly yielding 0 and 3:
you can use zip:the expression zip(*f) iterates over a 'transposed' version of your list f.
