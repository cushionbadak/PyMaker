Natural Text
I have a TEXT FILE that looks like:etc etc. They are usernames that is why their names contain numbers occasionally. What I want to do is check each of their numbers (the ones after the ":") and get the 3 names that have the numbers that are closest in value to a integer (specifically named targetNum). It will always be positive.I have tried multiple things but I am new to Python and I am not really sure how to go about this problem. Any help is appreciated!
You can parse the file into a list of name/number pairs. Then sort the list by difference between a number and targetNum. The first three items of the list will then contain the desired names:
You could use some regex recipe here :output:
