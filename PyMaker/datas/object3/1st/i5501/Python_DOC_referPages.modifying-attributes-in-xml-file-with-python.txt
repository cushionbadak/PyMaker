I am very, very new to Python so please be kind!I have created a test file in XML which has a list of fake customers and their associated telephone numbers. This was manually produced and took a fair while! I'm hoping to create an automated solution in Python to replace the first digit of the customer_ID (stored as an attribute within the XML) and generate a new XML.After a few hours reading and developing here is my code;So far I can isolate the list of Customer IDs as Cust_ID and replace the first digit as required. My issue is writing these new values in my output.Given how junior I am to this code I'm not 100% I'm on the right path so any pointers to a more complete solution (if there is one) would also be appreciated.Many thanks
These day most people use libraries you have a number of choices.2 I've usedLXmlCElementTreeHere are some useful documentation linkshttp://lxml.de/tutorial.htmlhttp://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htmhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlBe aware xml.etree.ElementTree isn't secure
