I use various methods in Python to fetch data, process data, and store data. The fetch method calls the process method upon return, and the process method calls the store data method on return.However, if one method fails, e.g., because the data is not available, the program crashes. Is there a way to make the program more robust, by returning somehow that an error occurred, which halts the program and instead provides an argument to a loop that the data is not available, and the loop should continue with the next task?
Use Python's Errors and Exceptions for that. If you are using modules, you should use the modules errors and exceptions. It sounds like you are a beginner python programmer, if so first study python.
