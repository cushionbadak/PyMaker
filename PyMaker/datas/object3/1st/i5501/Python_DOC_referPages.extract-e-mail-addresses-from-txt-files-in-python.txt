Natural Text
I would like to parse out e-mail addresses from several text files in Python. In a first attempt, I tried to get the following element that includes an e-mail address from a list of strings ('2To whom correspondence should be addressed. E-mail: joachim+pnas@uci.edu.\n').When I try to find the list element that includes the e-mail address via i.find("@") == 0 it does not give me the content[i]. Am I misunderstanding the .find() function? Is there a better way to do this?
The standard way of checking whether a string contains a character, in Python, is using the in operator. In your case, that would be:The find method, as you where using, returns the position where the @ character is located, starting at 0, as described in the Python official documentation.For instance, in the string abc@google.com, it will return 3. In case the character is not located, it will return -1. The equivalent code would be:However, this is considered unpythonic and the in operator usage is preferred.
'Find' function in python returns the index number of that character in a string. Maybe you can try this?
Find returns the index if you find the substring you are searching for. This isn't correct for what you are trying to do.You would be better using a Regular Expression or RE to search for an occurence of @. In your case, you may come into as situation where there are more than one email address per line (Again I don't know your input data so I can't take a guess)Something along these lines would benefit you:You would need to adjust this for valid email addresses... I'm not entirely sure if you can have symbols like +...
