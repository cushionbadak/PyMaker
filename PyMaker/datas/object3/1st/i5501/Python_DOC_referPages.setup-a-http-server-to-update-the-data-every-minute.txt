I want to build a http server to broadcast the temperature  and update every 1 minute. I used microhttpd in C, now I want to write in Python. Which module should I use? Hope to have your suggestions.
Python comes with the http server module which would be perfect for something like this.You could get started with this tutorial - I just looked it up so I haven't read it closely but it looks like it would cover most of what you need.
