Say I have a hypothetical list that lists down some csv files:And I would like the print to be like:Doing a simple for loop prints only the first string three times. I thought I would specify the indexes for python to 'recognise' which file I'm referring to, like so:This too however prints out only the first string. How do I customise what is printed for each index?
Job for enumerate:enumerate(example_list, 1) enumerates the list with setting starting index as 1print('This is file number {} for {}'.format(idx, st.split('/')[-1])) prints in desired format, with st.split('/')[-1]) getting the last member of the / split-ted list.As / is the directory separator in POSIX systems, no filename can contain /, so split('/')[-1] should works the same as os.path.basename. But, it's better to use os.path.basename BTW.Example:
enumerate your list, print a formatted string. You can get the base-name of a file with os.path.basename.
You need enumerate (to get indices while iterating) with os.path.basename (to get filename from the filepath) to achieve this. Here's a list comprehension expression as an example:
