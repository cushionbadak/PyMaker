This is similar to this here.I am trying to do other actions during an input for a chat system i'm working on using sockets, but the method in the link doesnt seem work in python 3, with this slightly modified code:And output:I have no knowledge about threads, but would like to have some useful foresight on threads, if anything.EDITchanged code:output:
In Python 3 you can use threading.Thread with your getinput function as target parameter:(The start_new_thread method you're trying to use is not available in Python 3's threading module as that's a higher-level wrapper around the _thread API.)
