But I want notification for particular word appear and all the details regarding this.Thank You.EDITFor example,if source code containsWhich tag contain word "GST" is not fixed. what I want is to search for element which has that word and the value contained within tags.for example,The notification stipulates that manufacturers who have opted for composition scheme will now have to pay 1 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) as against 2 percent earlierGST council said that the e-way Bill system will have to be made ready by January 16 for trial runs.Thank you
with selenium first, you can find the elements that you want to check with find_elements_by_xpath method and get the text out of it with .text and iterate through that text.right click on element and inspect than on inspection find XPaththen you can iterate through text_to_check_for_keyword to check if that keyword exists and you can create a while loop with time.sleep to set checking time for your own code above.edit:first of all, think of XPath as the path of that HTML element,so every element under the same category has similar paths.for example, India times have many sections on their webpage right?but you can iterate through all sections XPath by using *for example in the middle there is a TOP News section with a list. xpath of  the let say 6th element is so in order to reach every element in that section you usethat * gives you all elements of that area. after that, you do that for every section like Comments, Market news, and others and iterate.
