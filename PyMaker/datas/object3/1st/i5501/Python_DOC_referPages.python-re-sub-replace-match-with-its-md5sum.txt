Natural Text
I'm trying to parse such a string:<@Something> there is some regular text <@something_else> and even more <@foo> <@bar> textAnd replace all <@tokens> with theirs md5 sums.Is it possible with python re.sub? How can I pass @token to a function and the function's output to re.sub?So far I've tried the simplest approach with:Without success. The fun function works as expected outside re.sub(), but not within it.
With hashlib library:The output:https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html
Yes, as the documentation shows, the "replacement" parameter to re.sub() can be a function which takes a match object and returns the replacement.
