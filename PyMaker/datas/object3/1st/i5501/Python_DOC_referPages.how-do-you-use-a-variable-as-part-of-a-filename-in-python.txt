I'm creating a Python program which will send me a top ten list of my favorite Subreddits' posts. Currently this is the code:I'm trying to DRY the code as I'll add more and more subreddits but I'm quite stuck with this code:How will you fix this? Specifically the for loop as I'm 80% sure that's the problem.
As I alluded to in my comments above your code seems a bit haphazard and I've also noticed that you say you get a top ten list, and then you use 10 elements of x in your output, but you are breaking the for loop after 6.The function below should do what you are actually asking. And calling print(reddit('AskReddit')) returns
The problem here isz()['data']['children'] in the method reddit(subreddit)z is a string and you are using it as a callable object.From what I understand what you need to do is,z = todayilearned.json()If you are able to get the data from the url and the if the json has data and children attribute and also x should be initialized, this should work
