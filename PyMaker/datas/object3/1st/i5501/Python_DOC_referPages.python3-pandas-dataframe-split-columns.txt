I have a column on my dataframe that contains the followingI am having problem to capture it using regex so far my regex works for first 2 lines:  How do I split the column to 4 additional columns? i.e. Column1 = Company Name, Column 2 = City, Column 3 = State, Column 4 = Zipcode.Example of the output is shown below:  
The names are probably the trickiest part, but if you know that the structure of city, state, zip will always be the same (i.e. no extra commas) you could use rsplit to split the strings. Similarly pandas has a str.rsplit method as well.
