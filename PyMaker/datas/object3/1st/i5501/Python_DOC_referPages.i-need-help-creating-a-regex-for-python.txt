I need a regex for capturing _0x263E9[digit] specifically.I do not want to replace anything else, does anyone have any idea of the best way to tackle this. I have used regex101 for help but I can't seem to do it
Thank for @cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ and you already got the point.try re.findall : return a list of groups.regex for capturing _0x263E9[digit]:or retrieving the digits only
