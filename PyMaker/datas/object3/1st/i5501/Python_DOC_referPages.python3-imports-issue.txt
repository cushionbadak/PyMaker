So... I am attempting to teach myself Python.In such, I am attempting to build something that I appear to have no clue about...I have a "workingdir" structure such as:In myfile I am simply attempting to "import" the file install by using:import classes.installWhich fails with: ImportError: No module named 'classes.install'I have attempted the following as well, and all end the same way, with the same error:import .classes.installAs well as putting an empty __init__.py file inside the classes directorythe file install simply contains:What am I doing wrong?  I've searched and searched and searched, everything I see points to the same solutions I've attempted, and none of them work.
Python looks for files with a .py extension when importing modules. So a file named myfile will not be recognized simply by the command import myfile. The pythonic way to ensure that the interpreter will find the module is to ensure it has a .py extension. Renaming myfile to myfile.py and install to install.py and then changing the import command toshould solve the problem.
Create __init__.py inside install directory. Explanation: You can import from a file that is in your current directory or from a package. A package is a directory with __init__.py inside. In fact, a package can contain only this single file.You can read the documentation for further information.
