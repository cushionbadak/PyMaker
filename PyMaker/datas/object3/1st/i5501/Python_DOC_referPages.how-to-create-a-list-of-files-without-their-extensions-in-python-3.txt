How to get the filename without the extension from a path in Python?
Getting the name of the file without the extension :
Just roll it:

A readable version, using Pathlib in Python 3.4+Will print :fileIf the path can be a symbolic link, then add resolve()
For completeness sake, here is the pathlib solution for python 3.2+:
If you want to keep the path to the file and just remove the extension
os.path.splitext() won't work if there are multiple dots in the extension.For example, images.tar.gzYou can just find the index of the first dot in the basename and then slice the basename to get just the filename without extension.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.htmlIn python 3 pathlib "The pathlib module offers high-level path objects."so, 
But even when I import os, I am not able to call it path.basename. Is it possible to call it as directly as basename?import os, and then use os.path.basenameimporting os doesn't mean you can use os.foo without referring to os.
@IceAdor's refers to rsplit in a comment to @user2902201's solution.  rsplit is the simplest solution that supports multiple periods.Here it is spelt out:my.report
Thought I would throw in a variation to the use of the os.path.splitext without the need to use array indexing. The function always returns a (root, ext) pair so it is safe to use:root, ext = os.path.splitext(path)Example:
import osThis returns the filename without the extension(C:\Users\Public\Videos\Sample Videos\wildlife)Now you can get just the filename from the temp with
A multiple extension aware procedure. Works for str and unicode paths. Works in Python 2 and 3.Behavior:
On Windows system I used drivername prefix as well, like:So because I do not need drive letter or directory name, I use:

We could do some simple split / pop magic as seen here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/424006/1250044), to extract the filename (respecting the windows and POSIX differences).

the easiest way to resolve this is to this saves you time and computation cost.
For convenience, a simple function wrapping the two methods from os.path :Tested with Python 3.5.
