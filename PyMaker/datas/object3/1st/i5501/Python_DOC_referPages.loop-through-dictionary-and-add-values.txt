I am trying to add values for duplicate keys in a dictionary. I am not sure why my code isn't working.I would like to get a list with the added values as result at index 3 and 0 for an index that doesn't exist:My code: I am making list of zeros and adding dictionary in a loop.It's throwing an error:TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strAppreciate your help.
you don't even need a dictionary here (but I'll leave it in). just zip indices & values and add to your zeroed list. Also the length of your result list is incorrect. Compute it using max of the indices plus one:result:
This loops over the items at the top-level of d: first key='inds' and val=[0, 3, 7, 3, 3, 5, 1], and then key='vals' and val=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0]. But you're looking for key to take on the values 0, 3, 7, 3, etc., and for val to be 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.To loop over the indices in d['inds'] and the values in d['vals'], use zip. It will pull one item at a time from each sublist in parallel.
Using a shorter, though not as effecient, list comprehension:Output:
