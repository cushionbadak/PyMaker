i'm fairly new to programming. I've tried MySQL before, but now it's my first time using SQLite in a python flask website.     So maybe I'm using MySQL syntax instead of SQLite, but I can't seem to find the problem.Does this mean I can't use the name, email username & password in an HTML file?How do I solve this? Thank you.
Your cursor 'c' is not created in the same thread; it was probably initialized when the Flask app is ran.You probably want to generate SQLite objects (the conneciton, and the cursor) in the same method, such as:
Where you make your connection to the database add the following.
In my case, I have the same issue with two python files creating sqlite engine and therefore possibly operating on different threads. Reading SQLAlchemy doc here, it seems it is better to use singleton technique in both files:  It does not solve all cases, meaning I occasionally getting the same error, but i can easily overcome it, refreshing the browser page. Since I'm only using this to debug my code, this is OK for me. For more permanent solution, should probably choose another database, like PostgreSQL or other database    
Works for me
