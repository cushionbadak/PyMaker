As part of a function, I get the input of date and time plus time zone in the format "[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[HH]:[MM]:[SS]+[XXXX]" (with XXXX being the difference to UTC in HHMM) and need the date and time as a Unix time stamp.I'm currently using time.mktime([CONVERTED TIME]) but end up with TypeError: function takes exactly 9 arguments (6 given). It seems like a lot of effort to program something for the arguments of 'weekday' etc. for time.mktime, so I'm sure there's a better way which I just didn't find yet.How else can this be done?
This is a ISO 8601 compliant timestamp.  There are various libraries which can help with these.  But is your case, for a fixed format, you can use Python's dt.datetime.strptime and datetime.timedelta to calculate the seconds since epoch like:Code:Test Code:
