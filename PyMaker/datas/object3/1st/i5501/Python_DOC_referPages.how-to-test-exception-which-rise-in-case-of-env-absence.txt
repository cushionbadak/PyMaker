I have some code like:When I try to test it like:But it gives KeyError instead of passed test. What should I correct?
That's not the way you should be testing if an exception is raised. There is a specific assertion called assertRaises, which can be used as a context manager (helps to then get the error message to check as well):Note that the ability to use assertRaises as a context manager is available in Python>=3.1.
