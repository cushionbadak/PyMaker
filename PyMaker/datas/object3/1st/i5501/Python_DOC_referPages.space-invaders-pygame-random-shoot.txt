I am making the game Space Invaders in Pygame and I want to let the enemy shoot randomly at the player. At this moment I only can let the enemy shoot at the player by pressing the tab button. But it should do this automatically and with a randomly interval. How can I get this working, without needing press tab.Thanks.     
You need a random timer variable which you can decrement by the dt (delta time) each frame. When it's below zero, create a bullet instance, add it to the group and reset the timer. I use the random.uniform function here which gives you a float, but you could also use random.randrange or randint if you want ints. To get the delta time (the time since the last tick) just assign the value that clock.tick(fps) returns to a variable.
One way to do it is to create a custom event and trigger it based off some conditions, such as time.You can use pygame.event.Event() and pygame.event.post() to trigger an event manually instead of using the Tab key. To setup this event on time you can use pygame.time.set_timer(myEvent, time). After that your main loop just needs to check for the event with pygame.event.get().There is a good example of how to use custom events in pygame here: PyGame Custom EventThe author's example is even a Space Invaders type game so it will be useful to look at how it is written.
