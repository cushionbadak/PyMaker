Natural Text
I'm trying to split the below html string (example is shortened) into a list of options. (The html string was sent from the frontend via ajax using innerHTML on the select)However when I use str.splitlines() I still get left with empty string and spaces.Input:output:Is there a better way to split up string into a list of options?(note I do have the option to change the front end too if that's the simpler approach)
Yes, str.splitlines()  will not remove empty lines. The method documentation includes an example that illustrates what happens:The \n\n double newline separates 3 lines, one empty in the middle.If you must split on lines and remove empty lines, leading and trailing spaces, use a regular expression:The extra str.strip() call removes the initial and trailing whitespace entirely, as you'd otherwise get empty strings at the start and end.Demo:However, for parsing HTML, you probably want to look at a library like BeautifulSoup instead.
