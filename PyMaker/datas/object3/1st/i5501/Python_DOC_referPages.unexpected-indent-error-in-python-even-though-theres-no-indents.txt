When I run this code, I get an Unexpected indent Error but there are no indents where it says there are. I am using python 64-bit and Python 3. I have tried unindenting all the code and reindenting it but I get the same error. I am trying to create a GUI where a user can sign up and log in.Here is the code:
The error is not in same but in previous line!In function sign_up() (the function before log_in() function), there is try but not except:Python is expecting an indented except: statement. Hence, the error.Other truely indent errors also exist in this code, which will become apparent once this error is corrected.Maybe Python should give a "missing except" error rather than "indent" error.
