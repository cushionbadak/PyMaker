I have written a simple python script to import data into elasticsearch using bulk API. This comment helped me on writing/using set_data method.Unfortunately I get this exception:I can insert this data into elasticsearch successfully using index API:But the issue with index API is that it's very slow; it needs about 2 seconds to import just 50 records. I hoped bulk API would help me on the speed.
According to the hashlib documentation, the digest method willReturn the digest of the data passed to the update() method so far. This is a bytes object of size digest_size which may contain bytes in the whole range from 0 to 255.So the resulting bytes may not decodeable to unicode.The hexdigest method will produce a string as output; from the docs:Like digest() except the digest is returned as a string object of double length, containing only hexadecimal digits. This may be used to exchange the value safely in email or other non-binary environments.
