Natural Text
I want to get the bytes representation of an ip address (big endian, 4 bytes).I'm using Python 2 and I am using this module: https://github.com/phihag/ipaddressIf I want to get the bytes representation of 127.0.0.1, I get the expected result.But for 52.4.20.183, I am getting this result:This format looks odd to me, especially the leading 4. I was expecting it to be \x34\x04\x14\xB7. But apparently, both are the same:Why is the format for 52.4.20.183 4\x04\x14\xb7 and where can I find more information about it?
The characters '4' and '\x34' are equivalent. Both represent the value 52.
