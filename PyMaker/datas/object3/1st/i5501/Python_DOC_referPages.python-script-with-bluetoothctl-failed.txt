Currently working on a project, I am trying to communicate with my RPi 3 to a BLE device (only reading information from the device). I am using bluez and bluetoothctl. I succeed in connecting the RPi to the device, and can select the attributes and read the characteristics, but I would like to do it with a python script (no need to write the commands).My issue is, when I ran my code, it seems that it got stuck at the first command. This is my code :  and here is the resultDoes anyone have a solution or another way to read the characteristics of the device? (and potentially get it back in a file)
I'd advise you to take a look at the subprocess module's docs and especially the subprocess.Popen() function. I'm not sure if bluetoothctl is a program that takes arguments on launch, or if it has to keep running in order to listen to incoming commands. If it's the second some untested dummy-code could look like something as:Then, all you have to do is Google on how to write the content of a variable to a file in Python. (Which really shouldn't be too hard to find).
