I have a class called LineString that consists of a list of Point objects. For example;I want to write a function under LineString class that checks each point coordinate and returns (minimum_y, minimum_x, maximum_y, maximum_x). Here is my Point class:And here is the LineString classI couldn't write the correct code to return the function minimum and maximum x,y values. When I run this, I get that:
The cause for your error is the fact that you are attempting to access coordinates using point[...] which does not work on objects of user defined classes which do not implement the __getitem__ magic method.So, start by adding a __getitem__ method to your class.Note to readers - raise ... from None is supported from python3 onwards. For older versions, use raise ValueError("Invalid Index").Now, your existing code should work.As an aside, you should seriously consider the use of namedtuples here.Your LineString.bounds method is also flawed. My guess is you want to find the min/max across all points. If that's the case, you're supposed to first get all the coordinates, and call max/min outside the loop.
You have not made the point class so that you can index into it.Either you fix that (see coldspeeds answer), or access the values as they are in the point class.
