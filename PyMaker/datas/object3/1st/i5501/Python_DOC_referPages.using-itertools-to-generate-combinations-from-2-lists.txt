This question already has an answer here:Get the cartesian product of a series of lists?                    11 answers                I have two lists [1,2,3] and [4,5,6]. I'd like to generate a list of all combinations as follows using itertoolsResultingList = [[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[2,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]]So far I've only investigated the itertools.combinations function which seems that it can only handle something like this:Which outputs an incorrect result. How can I generate ResultingList above?Thanks
Use product:For general understaging:As stated in the docs, product is the equivalent of:((x,y) for x in A for y in B) where A and B are your input lists
if you are not importing product from itertools , then you can use this way also
You can do simply :output:
