This question already has an answer here:What are the differences between bool() and operator.truth()?                    1 answer                In Python, operator.truth and bool can both convert an object to a boolean value.What's the difference? When should I use each of them?
The documentation for operator.truth() is quite clear:This is equivalent to using the bool constructor.So there is no difference. The only reason that operator.truth exists is for the module to be complete. Use it when it is more convenient for your code than bool; for example, when your code already switches between various operator callables dynamically (say, based on a string mapping).  
From the official documentation:operator.truth(obj) Return True if obj is true, and False otherwise. This is equivalent to using the bool constructor.So both operations are equivalent.
