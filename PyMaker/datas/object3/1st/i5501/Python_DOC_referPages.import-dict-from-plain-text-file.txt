Natural Text
Let's say I have a dict in text file but I've lost the python code which created it.Is it still possible to query info from python to this dict? What about creating a python script capable of reading the text sintaxis and create the dict structure? The file is huge, but it contains a correct python dict (of list, dicts and tuples)Example:Is like a pickle dict, but human readable.

Assuming you have some file dict.txt that has a plaintext dictionary and nothing else, you can use pprint, the pretty-printing module
