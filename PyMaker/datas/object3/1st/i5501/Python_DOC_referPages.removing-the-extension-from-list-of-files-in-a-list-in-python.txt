Natural Text
I am using the following to get a list with all the files inside a directory called tokens:Output:I want to remove the extension .py from each item in this list. I managed to do it individually using os.path.splitext:I'm sure I'm overdoing things, but I can't figure out a way to strip the file extension from all the items in the list with a for-loop.What would be the proper way to do it?
You can actually do this in one line with a list comprehension:But if you want/need a for-loop, the equivalent code would be:Notice too that I kept the os.path.splitext(x)[0] part.  This is the safest way in Python to remove the extension from a filename.  There is no function in the os.path module dedicated to this task and handcrafting a solution with str.split or something would be error prone.
