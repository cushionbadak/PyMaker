Natural Text
I am trying to go through a long list of words, and print both the lowercase word and the uppercase word (default) to the screen in the same line. Here is my code: However, this has the output (showcasing only two words): I have not been able to get rid of the newline between word1 and WORD1. It does not appear to happen for the last word I try and print. Any ideas as to why, and how to overcome this?
Here's an example to reproduce your issue: Notice the trailing newline. One of your list elements has those. You can remove it using str.strip.You can also use str.rstrip, (r => right) if there's only the possibility of trailing whitespace chars (not leading ones).On a related note, I'd recommend taking a look at Rubber Duck Debugging.
