Natural Text
I want to rename multiple files in a directory, if they start with "#", for example:#222_message_split ->               222_message_split#013_message_split2 ->                 013_message_split2     edit: I tried this:edit2: with the help of pstatix I got the code to work, now checking subdirectories for "#_____" files as well.
You were close, although your indentation was off:Original Question:os.listdir() doesn't return the full path even if PATH was a full path; only basenames are listed. So you must provide a full path for os.rename() to function correctly; done using os.path.join().Comment Requested Update:Take a look at the docs and this post for information.
