I'm trying to use a simple code that tries to use numba and list generator and I get an error executing the following code. When I execute the above code I get a ValueError, however, when just use the decorator @numba.jit, I get a a LoweringError. Please help me to perform this simple search using generator (or otherwise). Thanks in advance
What you haveis a generator expression, which is not supported by numba at the moment.If you use square brackets instead, like:then it is a list-comprehension and numba can support it.  With that change, gen is a list and you can index it (i.e. gen[0]).EDITED: The following code is a suggestion from the user sklam in gitter, that I'm updating here. If you do the above way, you will be able to do with a generator (so gains in memory and time) since generator-expression is currently not supported by numba.
