The following line of code is executed in my Python script:This line may either fail or succeed, depending on apparently random conditions (It is due to an extension that is being loaded, but that is not relevant here).The problem is that even if this line fails, and raises a WebDriverException, an instance of Chromium will still be spawned, eventually flooding my entire desktop because I am running this line in a while loop until it works.The following block of code does not work because driver is not defined.How to do this in a clever way?
As you mentioned you have the following line :And this line may either fail or succeed. So there are 2 usecases which can be addressed as follows :Success : Incase the above mentioned line of code is Success we will use driver.quit() straight away as follows :Failure : Incase the above mentioned line of code is Failure we will use the taskkill command from os module to force-kill the chromedriver process straight away as follows :TriviaThrough the command webdriver.Chrome(CHROMEDRIVER_PATH, chrome_options = chrome_options) irrespective of whether Chromiumsession is spawned or not, a separate chromedriver session will be always spawned which we have taken care in our code. If you want to kill the Chromiumsession as well, you have to add the following line as well :
