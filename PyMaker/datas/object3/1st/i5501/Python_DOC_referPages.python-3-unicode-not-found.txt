I'm aware that unicode was changed to str in python 3 but I keep getting the same issue no matter how I write this code, can anyone tell me why?I'm using boilerpipe for a specific set of webcrawls:error:
The error message is pointing to a line in boilerpipe/extract/__init__.py, which makes a call to the unicode built-in function.I assume the link below is the source code for the package you are using. If so, it appears to be written for Python 2.7, which you can see if you look near the end of this file:https://github.com/misja/python-boilerpipe/blob/master/setup.pyYou have several options as far as I can see:Find a Python 3 port of this package. There are at least a few out there (here's one and here's another).Port the package to Python 3 yourself (if that is the only error, you could simply change that line to use str, but later changes could cause problems with other parts of the package). This official tool should be of assistance; this official guide should, as well.Port you project to Python 2.7 and continue using the same package.I hope this helps!
