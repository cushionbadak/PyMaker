"reload" function cannot delete variable which have loaded into memory if you delete it in your module before reload. In another words, even if you delete the variable before reload, it will still exist.According to the (DOCS):When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the moduleâ€™s global variables) is retained.Here's a simple example:ex1 module's content before reload:Then delete x and reload ex1 and we will find that x is still in the dir(ex1)So, my question is how can I get a dict in which x is not in the dir after delete and reload?
You did not read far enough, after the sentence you quoted comes:Redefinitions of names will override the old definitions, so this is generally not a problem. If the new version of a module does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old definition remains.So, the sentence you quoted only applies to variables that were defined in the old version of the module, but are not defined in the new version of the module.So to your Question:So, my question is how can I get a dict in which x is not in the dir after delete and reload?The answer is you can't.  You can however do:After the reload.
