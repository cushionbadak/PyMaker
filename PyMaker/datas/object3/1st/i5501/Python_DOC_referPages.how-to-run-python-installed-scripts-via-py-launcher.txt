Using the Python Launcher works fine: py.exe -3.5 helloworld.pyThis also works fine to run the corresponding pip (which is also not in PATH): py.exe -3.5 -m pip.Is there a way to make this also work for installed scripts? Background: This allows installing multiple Python versions in parallel, and using them easily even when they are not in PATH. But for example I can't run pyinstaller.C:\Python35\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe works.py -3.5 C:\Python35\Scripts\pyinstaller-script.py works, but still requires me to know the installation path.py -3.5 -m pyinstaller does not work. It just prints C:\Python35\python.exe: No module named pyinstaller.py -3.5 -m pyinstaller-script does not work. It just prints C:\Python35\python.exe: No module named pyinstaller-script.Is there a way to do this anyway?
I believe the module name is incorrect.  This works for me:You can see the module names via pip.  For exampleon my workstation shows:Note the case of PyInstaller in the list.
