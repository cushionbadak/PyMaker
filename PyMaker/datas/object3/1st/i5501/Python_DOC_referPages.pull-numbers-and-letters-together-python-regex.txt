Natural Text
I am looking to delete any text from a string in python that matches something along the lines of "\nPage 10 of 12\n" where 10 and 12 are always different numbers (looping through 300+ documents that all have different page lengths). Example of some text that is in my string below (and then what i would want the output to be):I am trying the code:But I can't get it to work. I tried to refer to this link Python: Extract numbers from a string for help but I can't seem to combine numbers and letters together.I'm new to regex in python and any help would be great. I have been able to get regex to work when it is just letters or just numbers, but running into problems when combining them.Thanks in advance
One way might beWhich yieldsSee a demo on regex101.com.
I'm not sure about the context, but instead of specifying line breaks (\n) and spaces you can use \s. With + you say regex one or more.With \d you choose numbers, With \s you choose space characters (space and \t, \n, \r, \f, \v). It may be useful to use re.IGNORECASE.
