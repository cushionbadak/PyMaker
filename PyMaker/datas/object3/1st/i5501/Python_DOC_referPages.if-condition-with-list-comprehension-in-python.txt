i have a list contains some values.I want to check if any of the element is presented in another list with if statement.I have done something like if condition with list comprehension this but not working as expected.my code is If my input is like delete file.how to get the correct keyword.
You’re close to two different solutions here! One is to make a list (well, an iterable) of true or false values indicating whether each item of fileop is in tokens, then check if any one is true:The other is to check if the set intersection between the tokens and the operations isn’t empty:The former is more typical, but this might have been what you were going for with the second in tokens.
If you want to know the tokens corresponding to file operations in the input, we can do:operations = [token for token in tokens if token in fileop]operations will be a list containing all tokens that represented a file operationFor example:tokens = ["open", "move", "rename"]operations will contain ["open", "move"]If you want to print the list:for fileop in [token for token in tokens if token in fileop]: print fileopHope this answers your question.
