I am trying to create a function, which returns a vector and then integrating it element by element. This is what I have so farThis works if I type something likeHoweverdoes not work, or any reasonable variant I can think of. How can I get it to work?either i get TypeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'getitem' if i leave out the b or ValueError: invalid callable given if I have it in.
The first argument of quad must be a function, something that call be called. Something that you can put (0.1) after and it will make sense. Does int1(b)[2](0.1) make sense? To me neither. The form quad(int1, 1e-16, 1, epsrel=1e-20)[0] is syntactically correct but quad only allows scalar outputs of the function, so it won't work with your int1. Instead, you need to make a new function that uses int1 but then returns only one of its components. Instead of having another def somewhere, it's better to make such a function right where it is needed, using lambda syntax:This says: take b, put it in int1, keep the index-2 entry of the returned array.
