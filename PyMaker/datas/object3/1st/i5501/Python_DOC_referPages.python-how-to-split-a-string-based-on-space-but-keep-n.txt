Performance wise, you should consider using list comprehensions (as is mentioned in Ursus's answer)  with str.split(' ') as:However if you are interested in functional approach, you may use filter as:Here a.split(' ') will split your string based on space as separator and filter (with bool) will filter out your empty strings from the list. Issue with your codeAs the Python's str.split document says:if separator is not passed:or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns [].if separator is passed:consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings. Splitting an empty string with a specified separator returns [''].
