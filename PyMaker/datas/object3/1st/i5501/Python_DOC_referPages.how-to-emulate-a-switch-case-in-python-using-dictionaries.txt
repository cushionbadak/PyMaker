I am trying to emulate a switch-case statement from the validate_input2 function below.This is what I basically did but it doesn't work correctlyEven though I find this emulation less readable I would like to better understand it in order to improve my python skills.Can someone help me simplify this code?
(Not an answer to the question, but maybe a better approach to the actual problem.)It seems like you are replicating part of what the Python slice builtin does. So you could just create a slice from the args and get the start, stop, and step from that.This also takes care of handling the error cases:
Here is a solution that builds upon what you have done:Example outputs:Edit: The TypeError wasn't working correctly in the original post. You can't return a TypeError as the not-found value in get() in this case, since the code is expecting 3 values to be unpacked (in python 2.x at least AFAIK). I've updated the code to handle the case where len(args) > 3. One could also add a check for the case where args is None or empty.
I would try something like this..
