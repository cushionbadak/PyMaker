I made a chess board, but I need help with coloring the different squares. I only have white squares but I need black squares. Here is my code.I already know I violated PEP 8.
You can do it like: I changed your coord-manipulation to benefit directly from the given range values not using a mult inside it. Color is flipped on each rect drawn and also on line-change to get alternating row colorings:
You can also use itertools.cycle, pass an iterable with the colors and then just call next to cycle through them. I'd create the background surface when the program starts and then just blit it in the while loop. If you need a background with extra lines, just draw them on the same background surface as well or create a copy.
