This for loop should take the entered input and convert the character into an integer.The problem is that at the end the output is equal to "[1]".I need it to be an int to multiply it.
The ord() method returns an integer representing Unicode code point for the given Unicode character.In your case, you have your input as 'a', which is represented by the number: 97Hence, when you subtract 96 from 97, you get 1.It already is an int ....Lastly, if you want to multiply it, change your operator from ' - ' to ' * ' ...
My answer assumes that the input is a number but in string format and that you want to iterate over it. Because in case it is a small number you can do:I would need more explanation to clarify my answer. Hope this helps.
