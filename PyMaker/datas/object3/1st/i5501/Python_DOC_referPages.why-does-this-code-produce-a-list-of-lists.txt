I have a function:and call it with:The contents of fruit.csv is:The value of fruitList is a list of lists:Why does this code produce a list of lists and not just a simple "flat" list, like this:
The reader produces rows from a CSV file. See the documentation:Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.It doesn't matter here that your file only consists of 1 row; list(reader) produces a list of all the rows, be that 0, 1 or 20 million. So a file with just 1 row gives you a list containing that single row as a list.If you only ever expect one row, iterate one step with the next() function:next(reader, []) tells the function to return an empty list if reader doesn't produce anything at all.
