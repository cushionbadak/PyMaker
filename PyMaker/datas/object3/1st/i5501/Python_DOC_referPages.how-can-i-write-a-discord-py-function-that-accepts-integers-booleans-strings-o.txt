Natural Text
I'm trying to write a function in discord.py that accepts integers, strings, booleans or None as a parameter.This is my code so far:I would like to be able to do something like ;post 1, ;post maxindex() or ;post. The commands with an integer or nothing will post that amount or one image (if None). The command with the 'MaxIndex()' string will allow to see how many "usable" images are in the folder.If I'm not clear enough, please do ask me to clarify.
(Eh, got too long to write my answer.)What I'm looking for is a way to allow Integers, Strings, AND Boolean into a parameter for a function.You can just check if your value is what you expect it to be !Outputs :My parameter is None !My parameter is an Int !My parameter is a List !Eh. Not something I want.
