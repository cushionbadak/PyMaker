I'm looking at the python documentation and came across 'type()' under the built-in-functions section. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.htmlHowever, when I look at the actual details, I see it as a class which takes 1 or 3 arguments. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#typeIf it's not a function, why is it listed under builtin-functions section.? Am I missing something.?
Python has a number of objects that are callable.  Some are used more like functions, even though they are actually classes or types.  The distinction isn't really that important, more of an implementation detail.For example, list() gives you a new list.  That's because list is a type.  But if you want to think of it as a function that makes lists, that's OK too.
