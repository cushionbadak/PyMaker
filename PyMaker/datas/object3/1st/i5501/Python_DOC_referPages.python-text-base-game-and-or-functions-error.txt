I am creating a prison escape and in a specific puzzle, the player is supposed to mutilate a hand, soap the hand, then wash it in order to get access by a scanner in a different room. The first time the player chooses to mutilate the hand, in the inventory it is added as a 'bloody hand', and when the character uses soap to clean the hand, I replace the 'bloody hand' with 'soapy hand' and then after washing it completely I replace from 'soapy hand' to 'hand' in the inventory. My problem is that no matter what I do, if the player decides to mutilate the hand more than once, the inventory keeps adding 'bloody hand' despite the fact that the player already has this in their inventory. I want to prevent from any additional 'bloody hand' to add to the inventory while the player has either 'bloody hand' , 'soapy hand' or 'hand'. I hope I explained this thoroughly enough, and that I may get good feedback that may help me fix this error. I have already tried the (and) and (or) functions, but neither of those worked.

You want to check whether any item in the inventory is in the set of hand types:
