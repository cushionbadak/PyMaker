I have a this list in the Python.I want to subtract values from this list. For example [6,15] is [month,day] so I want to subtract 15 to 10. I want to get [6,5], well this operation will repeat after that I want to get [5, 26] like this. How can I do this code?
You probably want to use the builtin datetime and 3rd-party dateutil modules for this. Note you will need to specify a year, since some years have months of differing lengths (i.e leap years) -parse will assume the current year:
You should be using inbuilt datetime.datetime and datetime.timedelta objects to achieve this in simplified way as:PS: You shouldn't be even storing your initial and final list as "[Month, Day]" format. Simply store the list of datetime objects, and use it where ever you need. new_datetime_obj.month yields the month and new_datetime_obj.day yields the dayNote: You must consider about the year in your code. It is necessary in doing your computation and calculating the days. For example, the calculation for February for leap year and non-leap years yields different results.
