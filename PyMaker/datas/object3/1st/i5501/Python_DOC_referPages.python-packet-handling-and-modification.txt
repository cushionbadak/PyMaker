I have a stream of incoming RTP packet and I have two goals to accomplish which I am finding difficult in a high level language like Python.1 ) Strip away the header from the rtp packet, i.e remove the redundant section of the rtp packet that isn't audio2 ) Once I have the data, change it from big endian to little endian.Note : I have been told about struct.pack , but that deals with a section or one number. How do I change the entire data?
Ending up just chucking it into a bytearray, indexing it and then doing bitwise opreations.
