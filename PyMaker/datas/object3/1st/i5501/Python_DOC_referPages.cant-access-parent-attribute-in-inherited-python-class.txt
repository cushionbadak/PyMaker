This is my parent class,This is my inherited object,This throws up the following error,What am I doing wrong here.
It should be super(SendOTP, self), not super(BaseResource, self).Also, if this is Python 3, you can simplify it to just super(); if Python 2, you also need to change the declaration of BaseResource toto get a new-style class.
If it is python 3 you have to use: Super()._init_() instead of super(BaseResource, self).__init__() andsuper().log("[FAILURE]..unable to read") instead of self.logger.log("[FAILURE]..unable to read")If it is python 2 you have to use:BaseResource.__init__(self) instead of super(BaseResource, self).__init__() andself.log("[FAILURE]..unable to read") instead of self.logger.log("[FAILURE]..unable to read")
In super you should put your class type
