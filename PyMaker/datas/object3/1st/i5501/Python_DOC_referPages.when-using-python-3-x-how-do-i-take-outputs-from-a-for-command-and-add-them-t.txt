How would I take the results from the following code and assign a variable to it?For example, if the results came out to be 100,101,102,103 how would I get a variable set to "100,101,102,103" without manually entering every number into a variable. Also, I know that it says "your encrypted string is" and I know that that's not really encrypted, but I just got into this so I was just playing around.assuming I have ASCII codes set to their appropriate valuesThanks to many people (most notably yukashima huksay and ZYYYY) I have my final code here:Assuming all ASCII codes set as variables.
You should do this:Please note that you can use any string instead of ',' for example ', ' or '\n' or basically whatever you can store in a string.You can also put a function of x instead like [foo(x) for x in word] or (2*x + 1)And finally you can also use in-line if/else statements like:And also:The error you are getting is because you are adding a number to a character perhaps what you want to do is:result: è,Ö,á,Ö,â
str.join(iterable) would give you what you want.I don't think eval() is a good practice here. word = input("somethin") is enough for python3.Also you may want to know about list comprehensions which makes code more concise.eval(exp) is to use to parse and evaluate exp as a python expression. For exampleI think you may want something like
