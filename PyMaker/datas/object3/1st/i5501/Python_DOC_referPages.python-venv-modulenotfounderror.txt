(Before marking me with duplicate question votes, please note that everything that I can find on this question has to do with virtualenv, not venv)System:Ubuntu Server 16.04Python 3.6 installed, Python 3.5 nativeBackground(Contrived example, so might have a typo or two, but the idea is the important part)I have a project in the form of:in fileb.py, I have an import statement such asI create a venv by; then I runThis will give me an error: Attempts to address: Add the path to "Project" and "project" to $PATHModify $PYTHONPATH in the .venv/bin/activate script so that sys.path now points to "Project" and "project"Completely read the docs hereVerified that os.sys.path shows Project and project pathsQuestion: It must be possible to do module imports using venv or it would be of zero value -- so what am I fundamentally missing in my setup? (With viritualenv, I just used 'add2virtualenv')[Edit - Showing more detail][Edit2 - adding packageA to PYTHONPATH Works]If I add 'path/to/packageA' to my PYTHONPATH, the import works. To use this, I would have to add each subpackage to my project -- less than ideal for large projects.
It's a somewhat murky situation IMHO. My solution to this is: create a setup.py for your project (beneficial anyways), and with activated venv do a "python setup.py develop".That will add your project to a PTH-file, and thus you can import.Example for a setup.py, taken from the interwebs:
This linefails because the import path is messed up, it includes the project folder but it should notproject is possibly not in your PYTHONPATHTo fix itStep 1) fix the import statement in fileB.py, replace your import withStep 2) Confirm for yourself whether you added project to PYTHONPATH by checking your bash environmentIf not temporarily fix it(Note changes to $PATH  are irrelevant to Python package/module searches, so that was a wasted attempt).Then when you run your script, it will not fail:By the way it is better to call your python scripts with python:Finally, permanently update your virtual environment by editing the activate script in your virtual environment's bin directory. Add the PYTHONPATH export above somewhere near the top.
