I'm using sqlite3 through python 2.7. I have a table where I would like to multiply values in column C where column B is the same. If these values were in different columns it would be a lot more simple I could just useSELECT B, C1 *C2 FROM table1;But I am lost when it comes to multiplying within a column.For example if this is original tableThen where the entrys in column B are the same, their values in column C are multiplied together, so my output would be 
As pointed out in the comments, it is very difficult to create an aggregate function for multiplication in SQLite. However, you can work around it by using itertools.groupby to perform the combination and multiplication operations and then create a new table. This answer utilizes a context manager and property decorators to create a clean class call:Python3 requires functools for reduce and is not compatible with lambda tuple unpacking.Python3 version:
Using just Python, have a look at this answer. You can sort your query by column B, and then use itertools.groupby to group the results of your query into packets which you then process using the reduce built-in:
Here's a way by using group_concat() with a convenient delimiter:
