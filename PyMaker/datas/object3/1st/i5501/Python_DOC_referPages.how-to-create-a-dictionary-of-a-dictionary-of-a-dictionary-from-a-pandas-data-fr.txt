I have a pandas dataframe that looks like this:The data frame is made of 3 copies as in the first column. Each of these copies contain the same elements, i.e they have 2 sequences each, which are in turn made up of 3 different types: A, R2 and R3. How can I create a dictionary of a dictionary of a dictionary that looks like this:So that for example if I say:It should print out a dictionary (shown below) where all the ntv values have been sorted indicating which copy number has the lowest or highest ntv value for sequence 1 of type R2. Also, I look forward to your suggestions if you have better ideas on how to go about it. Thanks in advance! 
You can do sth along these lines, using a collections.defaultdict:
First, make a dictionary then sort the df_dict
