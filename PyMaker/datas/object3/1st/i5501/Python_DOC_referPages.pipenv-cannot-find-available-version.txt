Warning: I'm new to python and pipenvI'm trying to create a reproducible DC/OS test setup using shakedown with pipenv. I think what follows is more of a pipenv issue.I first installed: pipenv install dcoscliand if I do pipenv shell & pip list I can see:Then, I attempt to install dcos-shakedown and it complains that it cannot find dcoscli==0.5.7Despite of the error message, dcos-shakedown seems to be installed and working.My Pipfile after the failed install looks like this:I also tried to explicitly install pipenv install dcoscli==0.5.7 but I get the same error message as above.I did try a "plain" pip install within the virtualenv (pipenv shell) of both dependencies and it doesn't give me any issues. (I did clean up the virtualenv directory between trials to avoid polution)Am I doing something wrong or am I facing some bug? 
So this runs fine for me. If I start from scratch on MacOS or UbuntuNow looks like your might be running pipenv from an already sourced venv or https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/I would start from vanilla shell. Or check that the PATH variable on your shell doesn't make it point to a 'different' python binary on your system
