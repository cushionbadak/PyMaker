Natural Text
Using the below code, I am able to fetch "soup" without an issue. My goal is to ultimately fetch the title within the soup object, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to do it. In addition to below, I've also tried various iterations of soup['results'], soup.results, soup.get_text().results .. etc and not sure how to get to it. I can, of course, do soup.get_text() ... (some kind of search function for the string "title," but feel like there has to be a built-in method for this.Code
Take a look at what p.read() returns. You will find that it is not HTML, it is a JSON string. You can't use a HTML parser to successfully parse JSON, however, you can use a JSON parser such as the one provided in the json package.Following this response will reference a dictionary. You can then use dictionary access methods to extract a particular piece of data:Note here that response['results'] is itself a list so you need to get the first element of that list (at least for the example that you've shown). response['results'][0] then gives a second nested dictionary that contains the data that you want. Look that up with the title key.Since the results are contained in a list you might need to iterate over that list to process each result:If some results do not have title keys you can use dict.get() to perform the lookup without raising an exception:
