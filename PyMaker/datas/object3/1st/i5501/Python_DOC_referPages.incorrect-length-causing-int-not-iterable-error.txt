I am attempting to loop through a matrix, called lattice, randomly using the randrange function. My matrix is an 8x8 and prints fine.  However when I attempt to randomly loop through each element of this matrix I am getting the error 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable'Due the upper limit of the range, len(mymatrix). I'm unsure as to why this is. I have not used randrange in a loop before, is it perhaps that it can't be used the same way range is used? I've also tried to set the range as: I thought maybe the length was one too long but to no avail.
You are correct. randrange() returns a single element from within the given range. On the other hand, range() returns a list of elements, and is therefore iterable.You could try something like this:
The method randrange does not return a range, but a randomly selected element instead as can be read in the doc.random.randrange(start, stop[, step])Return a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step). This is equivalent to choice(range(start, stop, step)), but doesnâ€™t actually build a range object.That is why you get a TypeError, you are indeed trying to loop over an int.I would not recommend looping in a random order over your lists, but if it turns out to be necessary, I would use shuffle.Note that in Python3, you would need to cast your range to a list first.
