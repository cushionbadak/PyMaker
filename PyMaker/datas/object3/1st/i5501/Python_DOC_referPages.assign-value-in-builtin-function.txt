I am using Pandas(python).I want to write this lineBut bymistake I write it asWhen I write correct syntax it gives errorTypeError: 'list' object is not callableBecause it assign list pd.Series =[1, 2, 3]How to remove this list from pd.Series?
You can simple re-assign pd.Series to the correct value:This only works if there is a reference to the original function/class still around (in this case there is pd.core.series.Series). In case you overwrite something that isn't references somewhere else this won't work.Just to give another example (based on a question in the comments), suppose you overwrote list, you can use the builtins module (or the __builtin__ module in Python 2):However often it's much easier to restart the Python interpreter (which should also work) and in some cases it might only be the only option (in case nothing else references the overwridden value.
Use the reload buildin function to reload the module. Showcase:
