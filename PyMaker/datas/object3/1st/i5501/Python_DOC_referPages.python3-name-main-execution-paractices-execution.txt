I have FTP code which I'm testing with __name__ == '__main__' method which works in certain condition and fails on other. This is basically doing FTP to a site with user name password and then traverse into a Directory where we need to inlist the files using ftplib module. Along with I have kept the exception handling if could not find the Files in the Dir path then come with a error.When I execute this without main() which I have hashed in the code then it runs fine.If I will run this code with main() then it will produce the Error for 'NoneType' object as follows:Please advise best practice to use with  __name__ == '__main__' method while using with functions and calling main().What i see there is no need of the second function... after editing it  works as expected
I got it corrected another way using through return keyword in the main function FtpMirroList and lastly calling it through if __name__ == '__main__': and that works as expected.
