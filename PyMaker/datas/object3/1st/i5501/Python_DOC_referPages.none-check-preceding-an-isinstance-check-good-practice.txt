Is it good practice to test for not None preceding an isinstance check in Python? For example: Or can I do without and is this sufficient?
To answer your question, doing a is not None check is unnecessary, because - Meaning, if x is None, then the isinstance condition would return False anyway, making the x is not None check redundant. So, in summary, Works just as well.Furthermore, if you want to test whether an object is numeric in nature, a simpler way to do so would be using the numbers module - Note that numbers.Number tests all numeric objects from the very root of the hierarchy. This also includes complex numbers, so if that isn't what you want, you can test with numbers.Real to numbers.Rational instead.
It raises no error, so I would actually prefer the version without the 'is None' check, as it is just less code.
