I have a string like this search = 'hello' and I need check all array to see if any contains hello.For example:I need something like search for my codelist_all_files_in_google_drive - it my all file name arrayfilename - name file, which need to check if exist in google drive or notmy code doesn't work because it works like this:and I need it to work like this:UPD:I checked operator in and it does not output true
Just go through each string in the list with a simple loop, and check if 'hello' exists with the pythons membership in operator:Which outputs:Or if you want to check all() the strings in lst at once:Or if you want to check if any() of the strings in lst at once:Both of which will output:Note: Using list as a variable name as shown in your question is not a good idea here, as it shadows the builtin function list(). Also returning a boolean True or False here is fine, not need to return a string form of these. 
Replace '==' with 'in'

You can use list comprehensions as shown below:output:Another solution is to have a own function as follows:output:
'in' operator is good solution , You can also try regex :output:
