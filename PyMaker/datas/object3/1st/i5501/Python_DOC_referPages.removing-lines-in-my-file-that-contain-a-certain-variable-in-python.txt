My test.txt looks likewhat im trying to do is take the first line of it, which is bear and find and lines that contain it then delete them, the problem here is when I run my code all it does is delete all of the contents of my output file.
What you want is in-place editing, meaning read and write at the same time, line by line. Python has the fileinput module which offers this ability.NotesThe calls to fileinput.input() includes the parameter inplace=True which specifies in-place editingWithin the with block, because of the in-place editing, the print() function (by magic) will print to the file, not your console.We need to call print() with end='' to avoid extra line-ending char(s). Alternatively, we can omit the from __future__ ... line and do use the print statement like this (note the ending comma):UpdateIf you want to detect the presence of the first line (e.g. 'bear') then there are two things more to do:In previous code, I did not strip new line from must_delete, so it might looks like bear\n. Now we need to strip off the new line in order to test anywhere within the lineInstead of comparing the line with must_delete, we must do a partial string comparison: if must_delete in line:Putting it all together:Update 2
You read a variable must_delete, but you parse with mustdelete.You walk through the output file (i for i in f); I think you want to scan the input.You truncate the file at the given location; are you sure that's what you want to do inside the loop?
