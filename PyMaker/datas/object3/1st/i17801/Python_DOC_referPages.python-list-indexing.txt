This question already has an answer here:Understanding slice notation                    31 answers                Im sure this is a repeated question, however I have no idea how to phrase it.What does pythons[1:3] yield?I know now the answer is Eric and Terry, but why?
Think about it like this:As it was pointed out above, we start counting at 0 in python, and our ranges are not inclusive on the top end. So, when we say [1:3], we are saying "Grab all of the elements in this list from indexes in the range (1,3). So we split up the list like thisSo, a new list, ['Eric', 'Terry'] is returned. This same principle applies with strings too. 
List are ordered according to data entry, every time you append something this will be the last item of the list:indexes starts from 0 and you can imagine the index number between the elements:So pythons[1:3] select the elements between 1 and 3, Eric and the first Terry.pythons[3] select the element that start from 3Python Lists tutorial
pythons[1:3] yields Eric, Terry because 1 brings back the 2nd element in the list, because you start counting at 0. And 3 is the highest limit of the range, but is not inclusive so it brings back 2. That is why you get Eric, Terry.
