Using Python, I'm trying to write object that it's access would be like this:(the 'record' has some fields).the object should be exported to json string and of course import from json (currently unwrittten), so I've added the toString() method.The point is the code is very "clumsy".  Is there way (using python) to make more "comely" code?my code:
You could use dict itself to make it a bit easier:As the objects are now subtypes of dict, serializing it with json is simple. Only for deserializing you would have to write your own encode handler.
To serialize your object to json:To create your object from json:You could easily implement the methods:Example:You could define from_json, as_json methods if you'd like using the one-liners
