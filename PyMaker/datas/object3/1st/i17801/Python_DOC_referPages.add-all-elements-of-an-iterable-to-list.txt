Is there a more concise way of doing the following?This is what I have tried so far: I would prefer to avoid passing in the list in the parameters.
Use list.extend(), not list.append() to add all items from an iterable to a list:oror even:where list.__iadd__ (in-place add) is implemented as list.extend() under the hood.Demo:If, however, you just wanted to create a list of t + t2, then list(t + t2) would be the shortest path to get there.
stuff.extend is what you want.Or you can do
