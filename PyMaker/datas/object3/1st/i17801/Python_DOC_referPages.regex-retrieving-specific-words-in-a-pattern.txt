On Python, suppose that I have a string, that represent a pattern of strings, like that:Where [...] means a sequence of -arg and value.How can I extract a specific content from the string? For example, I would like to extract the words:Where ... means ... you know what means!I think the best way to retrieve that is using RegEx, right? Another way is spliting using both '//' and '-', but I think this is not an ellegant way to do that.So... How can I do what I want?
I'm sure there are other solutions, but if you want to use regular expressions, a pattern like this would workThis will match any sequence of one or more 'word' characters. (see the official documentation for a precise definition)For example:To handle any other special characters that might occur within the parameters, you might want to use something like this:This will match any character that's not a whitespace character, hyphen, or forward slash, followed by zero or more non-whitespace characters.For example:
Regular expressions are a possible solution, but I'd probably choose one of:http://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#module-shlexhttp://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse
