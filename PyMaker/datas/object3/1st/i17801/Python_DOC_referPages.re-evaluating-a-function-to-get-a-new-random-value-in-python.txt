Natural Text
here is the code that I am having a problem with(simplified to make it clearer). It is for a text based game just to help learn things.I would like to know how I can make self.moveset[0] = Punch() rather than being equal to the output of Punch() in this block of code. So that everytime i run it in a while loop it will re-evaluate the output of Punch() rather than evaluating Punch() once and assigning that to the 0th index of self.moveset[0].
You could assign a function to self.moveset[0] instead of its result (using functools.partial()):Then later, in your while loop, just call it:self.moveset[0]() calls punch function with level parameter set to self.level (its value at the time of partial call).It works because functions, methods are first class citizens in Python. You can pass them as parameters to other functions, return from functions, bind to a different name, append to a list, etc.
