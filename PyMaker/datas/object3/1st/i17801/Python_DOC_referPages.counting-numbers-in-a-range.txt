I have to write a Python script that will allow the user to enter a set of positive numbers and then count how many are equal to 50greater than 50less than 50Use appropriate output to prove that your program is working.
Just for example's sake, let's write a function that counts how many numbers are above 50, then one for equal to 50, then one for less than 50. Disclaimer: this is not the only, or even the BEST way to accomplish what you want to do, this is just the best teaching aid :). Also, some of the nomenclature may change if you're not using Python 3.x.Now we have our functions that will return the values we need. Again, this is not the only or even the best way to do this, but it's the way I'm using because it teaches a lot of basic strategies like writing modular programs (each function is performed by its own bit of code) and using functions rather than straight code to perform your task. Unfortunately, on their own, this code doesn't do anything. It just defines functions that we'll leverage to solve the problem at hand. In essence -- we've made our hammer, nails, and saw, but now we have to cut the lumber to size and nail it up. Let's do that.We still haven't actually DONE anything, though, since all we've done is define functions that do what we want from start to finish. our greaterThanFifty function is our hammer, our lessThanFifty function is our saw, and our equalToFifty function is our nails. Now we've added a main function, which is our handyman. Now we need to tell him to work. Luckily that's easy :)That's it! We're done!For comparison purposes, this is how I'd write all that:You'll get there, young padawan :)
This is a very basic program ! You should start python's beginner tutorial here
