Natural Text
I have this simple class, with 3 atributes Name Surname and Birth year, and as I define an object of this class, instead of receive the Birth Year I want the age of the person.I want to subtract the current year to the birth year, using this import date from datetimecurrent_year=date.today().year
I think this is what you were trying to do:Keep in mind though, that this won't take into account some nuances like "it's now January 2014 and  was born in October 1985)
Do you want property ?printsBTW, the code is mixing use of lower_case_with_underscores, mixedCase for attributes. Choose one. See PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code -- Descriptive: Naming Styles.
