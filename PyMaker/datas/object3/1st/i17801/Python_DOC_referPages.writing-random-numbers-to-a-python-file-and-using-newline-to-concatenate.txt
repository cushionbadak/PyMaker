Natural Text
This program generates a user defined amount of random numbers and then writes to a file. The program works fine as written, but i want the text file use \n to concatenate. What am I doing wrong?#This program writes user defined    #random numbers to a file
Add "\n":
You could also make use of Python 3's print function's file keyword argument:
file.write() simply writes text to a file. It does not concatenate or append anything, so you need to append a \n yourself.(Note that the type would be called _io.TextIOWrapper in Python 3)To do this, simply replacewith This will append a newline to every random number.
