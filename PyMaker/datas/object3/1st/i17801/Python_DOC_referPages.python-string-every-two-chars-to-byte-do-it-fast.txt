Got a binary blob string like:Every pair "AB", "02", "CF", "4A", "FF" constitute a byte.I'm doing this:Works ok, but with large binary blobs this becomes unacceptable slow and sometimes event throws a MemoryError.struct.unpack comes to mind, but no luck thus far.Any way to speed this up?
Use binascii.unhexlify:(In Python 2 you can decode with the hex codec but this isn't portable to Python 3.)
Give input.decode('hex') a try :)Always a good idea to use built-in solutions
How about something like this?You could speed it up quite a bit by making chrToInt branchless by using binary operations, and you could also modify hexToBytes to say exactly how many characters it should read if you decide you want to use something bigger than bytes (so it returns it in groups of 4 for a short or 8 for an int).
