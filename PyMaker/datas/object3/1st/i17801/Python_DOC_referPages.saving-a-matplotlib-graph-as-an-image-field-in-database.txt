I just started learning matplotlib and I want to use it in one of my django apps. So I wanted to know how I can save the graph generated in an image field of my models, so that I can retrive whenever needed. 
matplotlib.pyplot.savefig accepts file-like object as the first parameter. You can pass StringIO/BytesIO (according to your python version).Then, use django.core.files.ContentFile to convert the string to django.core.files.File (because FieldFile.save accepts only accept an instance of django.core.files.File).
