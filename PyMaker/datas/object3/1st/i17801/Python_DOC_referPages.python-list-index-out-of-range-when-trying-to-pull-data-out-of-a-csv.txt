This program pulls data out of two .CSV files, which are linked here:https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1SjPejhqNU-bVkzYlVHM2oxdGs&usp=sharingIt's supposed to look for anything after a comma in each of the two files, but my range logic is somehow wrong. I'm running a traceback error to line 101:"line 101, in calc_corr: sum_smokers_value = sum_smokers_value + float(s_percent_smokers_data[r][1])IndexError: list index out of range"I assume it  would do the same for the other times [k][1] shows up.many thanks in advance if there's a way to fix this.the program so far is:
The values in each row of your data files are not comma separated, but rather tab separated. You need to change the ',' delimiter character you're splitting on for '\t'. Or perhaps use the csv module and tell it that your delimiter is '\t'. You can read more about the csv module in the documentation.
