I am just learning Python and I can't figure out how to solve an error. The Python code below writes some messages on the Raspberry Pi 16x2 Screen. On the 3rd set of messages #AVG SPEED if I use print print avgspeed it works correctly but when I output it to the screen I get this error AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'center'Traceback:Someone can help me with this?Thanks
Clearly at some point you're calling lcd_string with something that's not a string, but a float. So, when it does this:… that fails, because float objects have no center method.The fact that it's failing in the center case means it must be one of the places where you call lcd_string(<something>, 2). My first guess would be lcd_string(avgspeed,2), because avgspeed sure sounds like something that would be a float rather than a string.(Now that you've posted the traceback, it tells you directly what I had to guess. The line that fails is exactly the one I said it would be, and the line that called it is exactly the one I suspected would be calling it. And this is why you should always look at the tracebacks, and paste them to your SO questions—otherwise, you have to scan the code and guess.)The reason it seems to work if you replace that with just print message is that the print command automatically stringifies its arguments, so even if you pass it a float, it will print out that float.If you want your lcd_string function to work the same way, you can do that pretty easily by adding one line to the start of it:Alternatively, change your code to never call lcd_string with anything else. So:… or, if you want more control over the formatting, something like this:Since any developer is bound to screw that up sometimes (at least I would, and you obviously would too), and you have a hard time debugging those screwups yourself, you might want to add a line at the top of the function to give you better error messages, like:
