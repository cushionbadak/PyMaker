I wrote a code that gets n functions and composites them together. If the function doesnt recieve any input it returns the "x" which we called the lambda functions with.(example- compose()(3) # will return 3)this is my code, i simply cant seem to see the problem:
Let's say you have three functions:Then we have a function compose:We can use it like this:It will print out:Hope this is what you want.
The usual way to implement functional composition is this:However, in order to fix your code, you might do this:
i think you are talking about assuming I understood what you are asking
Function composition can be elegantly achieved using reduce. You can use the initializer argument to achieve your no-input condition too:
I think a better way to implement this is:Which will return a new function that is the composition of the list of functions passed to it. If you don't care about kwargs, you can do:Example:Note: In python3, reduce has been moved out of the stdlib into functools, so you will need to do from functools import reduce
