How can I change the code below to prompt the user for the column number and csv filename instead of stating it in the code?
You could use the input() function:or you could accept a command-line argument; sys.argv gives you a list of command-line parameters, where index 0 is the script name, and anything beyond that are values the user put on the command line:The Python standard library includes a argparse module to make handling command line interfaces more flexible and powerful.
