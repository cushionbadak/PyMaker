I have a function:And some i and k instances:How can I zip over func of pars without knowing the length of pars? Like this:I imagine some combination of map, zip, lambda, *?
You are looking for itertools.starmap():Here starmap() applies an arbitrary length pairs as arguments to func, which you can then pass to zip() as separate arguments. You can't use map() here, as it only supports callables with one argument.This presumes you are using Python 3 zip(); on Python 2 you'd obviously need to use itertools.izip() to handle the infinite sequence of tuples produced by the func() generators as an iterable:
Although this probably reads better as two lines:
