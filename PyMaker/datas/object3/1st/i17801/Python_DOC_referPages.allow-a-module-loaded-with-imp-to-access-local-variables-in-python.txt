I'm trying to make a dynamic module-loading system in python using the imp module. I have two files, x.py and y.py, and I want to load y.py from x.py and have y.py be able to access variables declared in x.py. Is this at all possible?From a code point, this is what I have:x.pyy.pyBut I can't update x.py's global_var from y.py.
The module x and y have separated namespace. Changing module-level variable in y does not affect the namespace of x module.How about following approach?UPDATE response to the comment.You can use exec or execfile (Python 2.x only). not recommended:
