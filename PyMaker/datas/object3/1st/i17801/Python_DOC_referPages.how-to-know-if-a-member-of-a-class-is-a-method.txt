What's the most pythonic way to know if a member of a class is a method? Note: I had only the name of the (posssible) method (could be a class method, an instance method or a static method).Currently I'm comparing the type of the object in the dictionary of the class with <type 'function'>:I really don't know if this will work on all the cases.The type(lambda x:x) part is just for getting the type <type 'function'>, Is there a better way to do that?
On Python 2, use inspect.ismethod():For Python 3, unbound methods are gone, and you'd use inspect.isfunction() instead.You can also use the types.MethodType type object to test against:Both tests work for @classmethod methods and regular methods. By design these tests fail for @staticmethod methods; those are just functions that resist binding (cls.staticmethod.__get__(instance, cls) returns the function itself). You can test for functions with inspect.isfunction(), or use isinstance(obj, (types.MethodType, types.FunctionType)) to catch all 3 in one test.If all you wanted is to test if something is callable, you could use the callable() function. It'll work even if the object is an instance with a __call__ method:Using callable() works on all 3 method 'types' as well as custom objects such as the above. Note that classes, being factories, are callable too.
Use callable on it.Example:
