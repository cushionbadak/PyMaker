I want to catch an exception, but I don't know its fully qualified name. I would like to figure it out experimentally without digging thru documentation.Let's say I have code that looks like thisAnd it runs and I get an exception message that saysSo I add a handlerbut it doesn't work, because error is not in the current namespace. (I know the answer to this particular question, it happens to be curses.error). How I figure out the namespace of an exception object (i.e. curses. so I can add a handler for that exception?
You can get the module from most classes (including Python-defined exceptions) from the the __module__ attribute:In Python 3.3 and up, you can also use the qualified name:to get a more detailed name for an object (a path within their module). For top-level classes this won't make a difference, but for nested objects the qualified name is a lot more interesting.
