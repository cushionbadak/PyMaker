I have three lists that contain x,y and z positions. For example:I want to create a list using these that looks like:These lists are huge (1 million entries).What is a good way to do this?Thanks! 
You're looking for the zip builtin function:This produces a list of tuples. If you absolutely need a list of lists, coerce those tuples manually:Note that in Python 3, zip returns a lazy iterator instead of a list (the same as itertools.izip in Python 2). If your lists are that big, that may actually be preferable, but remember that iterators aren't subscriptable.
For Python 2.x you can use izip:This iterates across the lists instead of copying their data.
This is a manual way of doing it (if you're interested): Hope this helps!
