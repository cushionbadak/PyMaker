The line causing the error is contri[0][5] and [6] are strings that contain numbers formatted as 1,000.00.  I'm removing the commas before I cast the strings as floats in order to add them to totalR, which is a float.  (Created as totalR = 0.0)  I also tried using Decimal, but the error happened there too.  I did "import string".  The program fails with error:
Methods in the string module have been deprecated for years. You should call replace directly on your string, or contri[6].
It is now on str.replace on Python 3.Looks like the same thing renamed, have the same signature and a docstring with the same meaning.
If you made changes to your module, just exit python shell and enter again and import your module again
