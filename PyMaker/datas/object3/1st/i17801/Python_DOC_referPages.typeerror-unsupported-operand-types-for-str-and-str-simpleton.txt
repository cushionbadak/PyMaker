This is so simple that none of the messages that I have found so far deal with my low level problem but here is my code.The error:I don't understand why is it unsupported?
You cannot substract str object. (input in Python 3.x returns str object unlike input in Python 2.x)Convert them into int or float first.
You need to convert the strings to integers first which can be done using the built-in int() or float() functionsSo Try this instead:Note:In python, You cannot perform mathematical functions such as division or subtraction  on a string without converting it to a integer first However string addition and multiplication can be performed, However for your case neither string addition or multiplication will workExample:
You are apparently using python 3. The result of input is always a string, so you must convert them to integers before you can do arithmetic. (In python 2, input will interpret what you type in as python code, so your code would have worked as intended). etc.You can "add" strings together with +, but there's no corresponding subtraction operation. And if there was, given the way string "addition" works, subtracting "25" - "5" would have given you "2"! So you you must convert to integers to get the intended result (a corresponding program about gaining weight would not have triggered a python error, but would have given very worrisome results).
