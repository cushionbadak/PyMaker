I would like to download a large archive file with python and save it, but urllib is not working for me. This is my code:Note that the link I used in this example is not a large archive. I am only using it as an example. It links directly to a .txt file, so it should work. I am getting this error:It seems to me like urllib is somehow broken and missing the "request" method. I am using Python 3.3. Should I be using another module or is it actually a Python problem?
No, it is not broken.  The urllib.request documentation is pretty clear on how this works:Edit: If you need to write the file directly to disk rather than process the data, use urlretrieve.
To download an url into a file, you could use urlretrieve() function:
The urllib2 module has been split across several modules in Python 3.0 named urllib.request and urllib.error. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to 3
