I'm new to Python and Programming as well. I know from Google's python class how to run external command using: (status, output) = commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)   if status:    ## Error case, print the command's output to stderr and exit     sys.stderr.write(output)     sys.exit(1)But I perceive that commands module is going obsolete. I want the status and the output, so I can print the output using sys.stderr.write() if there is any error. So, is there any equivalent command in subprocess module? I'm currently using:subprocess.call(args,shell=False) now.Thanks!
There is subprocess.getstatusoutput() in Python 3 that could be implemented as:Both return status that is different from the original commands.getstatusoutput(). See Python Issue: Document & unittest the subprocess.getstatusoutput() status value.
It's also possible to do this, with a bit less code
Popen is a nice and easy way to do it:
What getstatusoutput does is gather both stdout and stderr output interleaved in one variable. This will quite closely replicate the actual behaviour of getstatusoutput on those where it does not exist (getstatusoutput and the whole commands module was removed on Python 3 completely), excepting the newline behaviour. The resulting data is in bytes.This function returns bytes on Python 3 on purpose, as the Python 2 version returns str
