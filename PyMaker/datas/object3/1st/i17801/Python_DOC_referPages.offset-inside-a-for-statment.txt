I having been trying to offset inside a for statement so i can evaluate changes in the data sequence. Wondering what i am doing wrong here. maybe to for statement isn't the best method, so tried using next inside an if statement as well. this will be used large data sets.can anyone help with what is missing in this? thanks
It's not entirely clear as to what you mean by d[-n] or data[n].  But I'm guessing you mean the previous value in the list (or the current position - n back).Here's a simple solution to the problem of finding elements that are larger than the previous one.  Just save that previous value in a variable.Another approach is to step the indexOr use enumerate to get the index
It sounds like you want a sliding window that moves over your data, so you can compare each element to one n before it?You can use a collections.deque (http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#deque-objects) for this:(Using maxlen means that the append pushes the leftmost element out of the fixed-size deque.)Then you can use it to look at the first and last items in the window with:Access to each end of the deque is quick - O(1).
