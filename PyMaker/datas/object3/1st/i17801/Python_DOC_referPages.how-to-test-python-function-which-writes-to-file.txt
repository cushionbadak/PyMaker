This question already has an answer here:How to do unit testing of functions writing files using python unittest                    5 answers                I have a Python function that takes a list as an argument and writes it to a file:How do I test this function ?
Call the write_file function and check whether testfile is created with expected content.If you don't want test case write to actual filesystem, use something like mock.mock_open.
First solution: rewrite you function to accept a writable file-like object. You can then pass a StringIO instead and test the StringIO's value after the call.Second solution: use some mock library that let you patch builtins.
