How can I find the current mouse position in Python that can be integrated into turtle?I would prefer if you did not use any non-builtin modules (downloadable modules)Any answers would be appreciated
We can reach down into turtle's Tk underpinnings to enable the '<Motion>' event.  I cast the function to set/unset the event to look like a method of the turtle screen but you can call it on the singular screen instance turtle.Screen():My code includes an example motion event handler that makes the turtle follow the cursor like a cat chasing a laser pointer.  No clicks necessary (except for the initial click to make the window active.):
According to the turtle docs you can use:Oh, wait -- you asked for mouse position... researching...Looks like the closest thing is:which obviously only works if you click a mouse button.
