I'm new to Python and trying to convert some vendor suppplied code from python 2 to 3.  This function appears to check if an instance of the class is already created so it doesn't create a bunch of new instances but I'm not sure how to convert it to python 3.  The type class check vs an instance statement especially needs mondified since the old vs. new types in pythong 2/3 but I'm not sure how to do that.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
