Natural Text
This question already has an answer here:Normal arguments vs. keyword arguments                    9 answers                In Python, these two examples do the same thing:I think Label is a class, and when I try to create an instance of that class, I always do the same thing as in the last code example. I feel strange about the meaning of text='Hello'. Could anyone please tell me about that?
text='Hello' means you're explicitly passing the value 'Hello' to a keyword argument text in the function arguments.Label(None,'Hello') means 'Hello' is passed to the second positional argument in the function definition(no matter what the name of that variable is)With keyword arguments the order of calling doesn't matter, but all keyword arguments must come after positional arguments.Here first gets the value 'foo' because of it's position, while second and third got their values because they were passed those values by explicitly using their names.For more details read docs: http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#more-on-defining-functions
I feel strange about the meaning of text='Hello'. Could anyone please tell me about that?It is a named argument or keyword argument.Named arguments allow to pass arguments to functions in any order by not only passing the argument value, but also the argument name.
As others said, this is a keyword argument. Pragmatically, the difference between specifying or not the argument is simply which argument is going to be used.For example, if you had a function with 3 arguments, and only passed one, or two of them, you'd have to specify which argument you were using, in case they were not the first ones in your definition.
text in this case is a keyword argument, which means that it is optional. If you don't supply it explicitly, a default value will be supplied automatically.
