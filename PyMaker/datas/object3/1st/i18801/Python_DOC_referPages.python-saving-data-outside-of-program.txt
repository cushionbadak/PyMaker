I am somewhat new to python, and I was making a username+password login system for fun. I am using a dictionary to store the username+password. I am going to make it so you can add an account to the dictionary, and I want some way to save the dictionary for the next time the program runs. How would I do this?
There are many option for persisting data, one easy way is using shelveYou can save data using:Then you can recover your data easily:Other options are using files, CPickle databases like SQLite, MySQL, etc
Depending on your needs, you can either save the information to a text file or use a database. Saving to a text file doesn't require any encoding, however two popular formats/libraries for python are json and pickle. If you want to use a database instead I would recommend looking at either mysql or sqlite.
There are many options. You can start with learning how native Python's input and output works.Then you could try sqlite.And finally use a proper database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
The shelve module, as suggested by jabaldonedo, is a drop-in replacement for dictionaries. However, when your values are all strings, even shelve is overkill; you can just use dbm.Either way, you only need to change one line:The advantage of dbm is that you can use other tools to read (and edit) the database. For example, if you do this:With dbm, the database will hold the string 'def'. With shelve, it will hold something like '\x80\x03X\x03\x00\x00\x00defq\x00.'.
