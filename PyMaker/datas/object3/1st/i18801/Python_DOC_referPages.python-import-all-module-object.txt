I have the following files:,,,I don't know why lib.lib is defined, it's not a variable in the lib.py file.Any ideas?
The lib.lib object is the nested lip.py file inside the lib package.Once you have imported the sub module, it also becomes available as an attribute of the package (unless you also included a lib name in the __init__.py file. The Python 3.3 module loader (which is implemented in Python) simply sets a nested module as an attribute on the parent:This behaviour is more or less implied in the Python packages documentation:All modules have a name. Subpackage names are separated from their parent package name by dots, akin to Pythonâ€™s standard attribute access syntax. Thus you might have a module called sys and a package called email, which in turn has a subpackage called email.mime and a module within that subpackage called email.mime.text.
