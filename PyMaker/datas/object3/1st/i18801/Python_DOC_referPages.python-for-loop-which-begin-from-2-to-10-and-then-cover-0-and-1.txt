I am looking for simple solution for the following problem.Do we have a for-loop for this kind of usage in python?I have an implementation using a while-loop:
.........
You can use range:Or using itertools.chain(works in both py2 and py3):
try using
Due to the overhead of the print statement/function I changed every occurrence of print to pass, but here are the timeit results for the different approaches, run 10000000 times each:Using itertools.chain:Using modulus:Appending ranges:Literal expressions:Depressing how the most efficient method is the literal expression of the numbers through which to iterate, but, it involves the least allocation and the least arithmetic.
Using the built-in range function and the modulo operator:In Python3 you can boil it down to one line using a list comprehension and the print function`:In Python2 prepend that with:Or if you only want the list:
