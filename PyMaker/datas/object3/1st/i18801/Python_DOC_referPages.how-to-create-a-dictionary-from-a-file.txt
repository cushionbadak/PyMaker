Natural Text
I'm trying to write a Python code that will allow me to take in text, and read it line by line. In each line, the words just go into the dictionary as a key and the numbers should be the assigned values, as a list.  the file 'topics.txt' will be composed of hundreds of lines that have the same format as this:and so on..i need to create dictionaries for each wordfor ex:Ideally, the name "grain" would be a key in the dictionary, and the values would be dict[grain]: [5,6,..].similarly,"cocoa" would be another key and values would be dict[cocoa]:[1,..]Not much,but so far..
http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdictvalue, *keys = ... is Extended Iterable Unpacking which is only available in Python 3.x.
