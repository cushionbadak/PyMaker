This question already has an answer here:Need help to sort processed mdb file in Python on Linux machine                    1 answer                I have a table extracted from database. Lets call it table. I need to perform the following operations and I got a bit stuck:Extract the just last (latest) row of each cycle or, more advanced, sort the cycleby time and extract the row of the cycle with the latest time. Asyou can see, last row does not always have the latest time due toour testing machine glitch, but usually does. But the bigger thenumber the later the time. Extract all the rows for the last five cyclesExtract all the rows from cycle 4 to cycle 30.I tried various methods, like creating and sorting dictionaries and lists based on my limited Python  knowledge but none of them resulted to the desired output. It just drives me nuts. Thanks a lot!
This is not so hard, but you have to take it step-by-step:
You can easily done your job with pandas and pymdbWith pandas, you can handle your time series data with no pain.Just take a look at pandas.DataFrame. That's all you need.
First, let's read the file and convert the values found into ints for the cycle col and floats for the rest:Prints:Now you can create a group dictionary based on the cycle col list in the list of lists just created:Prints:Now you can get your last N rows of each cycle directly:If you want one of that group sorted by the latest time:EditDownloading the linked dropbox file, you have a csv file -- not space delimited.Here is how to read something like that:Once you have it in memory, you can sort by a certain numerical column:
