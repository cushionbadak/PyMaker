In python there is a method on the type int, namely int.from_bytes. It's not a method on a particular int, instead it's a method on the type. E.g.How do I define something like this? Let's say a class called "point" is defined, how do I define something like? (Assuming points are initialized by some different method.)
You want classmethod, which is normally used as a decorator:This is sometimes called the "alternate constructor" idiom. If there are multiple different ways to construct your type, instead of putting them all into one __init__ method with a mess of optional parameters or varags, put them all into separate classmethods.
You can use a classmethod, such as the mocked up example whose init expects ints, but also provides a convenient from_hex that tries to take strings and convert them to integers...The from_hex knows which class it is associated with, so by calling cls(...) you're able to construct a type of MyClass as though you'd written MyClass(a, b) with valid integers yourself.
