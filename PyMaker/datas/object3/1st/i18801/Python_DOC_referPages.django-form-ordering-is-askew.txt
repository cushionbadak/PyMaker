I am trying to create a form using django form library, yet when viewing the model populated by the form, the values are out of order..for no apparent reason.Here is my view:here is my template:here is the resulting html form (note that it is in order):here is my form class:Yet here are is the resulting populated model via admin:as you can see...they are out of order, along with an extra position that should not be there..is this a bug?(EDIT: the csrf token is passed into the dict as well, easily ignored) But the ordering is still a mystery!Thanks!EDIT: Upon further investigation I decided to output the dict itself and see if it was broken and it was, no idea why though ):I even tried to explicitly set the ordering of the fields:But this makes no difference whatsoever...it seems the ordering is correct, but the processing of the data into the POST dict is somehow getting messed up, any insight would be greatly appreciated!
You can't rely on the ordering of the fields in Django's POST dict I'm afraid - it's essentially a dictionary so there is no set ordering.If the ordering of the posted data matters, Django provides request.raw_post_data to get that.
Python dictionaries are orderless.  Because the Django response is a dictionary, it is going to be in an arbitrary order that can not be relied on. 
It's because QueryDict is dict type, so it returns its keys in arbitrary order.It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value  pairshttp://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
