This question already has an answer here:What's the u prefix in a Python string?                    7 answers                Just wondering what the significance of the 'u' before every line of my code is and how I would be able to remove them? I'm working in python. 
u is used to create unicode strings:You can convert a unicode string using str:However, this is only possible if the characters in your unicode string can be represented using ascii:You can read more about Python's unicode strings at http://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html
u means it's an unicode string, if the string contains only ASCII chacacters then there's no need of conversion to normal str as:But you can't compare a unicode string with a byte string that contains non-ASCII characters:The comparison can be done only if you convert the byte string to unicode(with proper encoding):Docs : Unicode HOWTONed Batchelder's ppt: Pragmatic Unicode : How Do I Stop the Pain?
The lower case u in front of a string means it's an unicode string.It's only the encoding, and therefore is no harm at all.Unicode strings are able to represent wider variety of characters (such as Â£) than normal strings and the u won't be shown in prints:You can learn more about unicode strings from python documents: http://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html
To remove the unicode, use type casting.
