I have been confusing Python 3's difference from Python 2 about import. If I have such a directory like this...And I want to import hello module from lib/mad.pySo I wrote code like this..lib/mad.pyAnd I call python lib/mad.py ,but it happend ImportError.I don't know why it happen like this.Do you have any idea? I want to solve this question.Sample repository is https://github.com/okamurayasuyuki/module_test/tree/master/lib . ##Thanks in advance. 
Your problem is that by running mad.py from the module_test directory, you guessed that Python would use your current directory as base for finding module b. To prove that it doesn't work, do the following:Edit your mad.py script and add the following to the beggining of the script:This will just print the search path Python uses to find modules you try to import and then exit.Open the terminal, go to folder /module_test and run the following:Now you should see the path dumped to the terminal. Note that the first entry in the list is the folder 'module_test/lib' not 'module_test' as you would have thought.So, how do you solve the problem? Simple: you just have to tell Python the correct directory it should be using to look for your modules. To do that, you must set the PYTHONPATH enviroment variable:Now if you try to run your script, it should import a.hello as expected!PS: You should read the official Python tutorial, specially chapter 6 which explains the concept of modules and packages:http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.htmlThat should give you a basic understading and help you solve your problem.
