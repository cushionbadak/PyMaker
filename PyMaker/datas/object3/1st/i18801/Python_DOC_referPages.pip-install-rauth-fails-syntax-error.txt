I just installed Python 3.3 and then I tried to install rauth by issuing the command:pip install rauth and I get this error:ata\local\temp\pip-build-pipul\rauth    Storing complete log in C:\Users\pipul\pip\pip.logSimilarly installing oauth2 also fails. But installing selenium succeeds. Now what could be the thing that is causing this failure?Thanks in advance.
Like many packages, rauth currently does not support Python 3.  However, it looks like there is a branch where they are working on it.  See here.In general, you may have more luck installing packages if you use Python 2.7.
