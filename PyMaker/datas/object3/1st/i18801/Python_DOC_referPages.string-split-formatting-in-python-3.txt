I'm trying to format this string below where one row contains five words. However, I keep getting this as the output:I love cookies yes I do Let s see a dogFirst, I am not getting 5 words in one line, but instead, everything in one line. Second, why does the "Let's" get split? I thought in splitting the string using "words", it will only split if there was a space in between? Suggestions? 
As a start, don't call a variable "string" since it shadows the module with the same nameSecondly, use split() to do your word-splittingFrom re-module\W      Matches any character which is not a Unicode word character. This is the opposite of \w. If the ASCII flag is used this becomes the equivalent of [^a-zA-Z0-9_] (but the flag affects the entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit [^a-zA-Z0-9_] may be a better choice).Since the ' is not listed in the above, the regexp used splits the "Let's" string into two parts:This is the output I get using the strip()-approach above:The code could probably be simplified to this since counter==0 and the else-clause does the same thing. I through in an enumerate there as well to get rid of the counter:
That's the basic concept, split it using the split() methodThen slice it using slice notation to get the first 5 wordsThen slice off the first 5 words, and loop again
