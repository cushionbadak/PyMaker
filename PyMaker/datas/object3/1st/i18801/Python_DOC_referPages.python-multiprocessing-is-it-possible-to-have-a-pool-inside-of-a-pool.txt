I have a module A that does a basic map/reduce by taking data and sending it to modules B, C, D, etc for analysis and then joining their results together.But it appears that modules B, C, D, etc cannot themselves create a multiprocessing pool, or else I getIs it possible to parallelize these jobs some other way?For clarity, here's a(n admittedly bad) baby example. (I would normally try/catch but you get the gist.)
is it possible to have a pool inside of a pool?Yes, it is possible though it might not be a good idea unless you want to raise an army of zombies. From Python Process Pool non-daemonic?:Outputconcurrent.futures supports it by default:It produces the same output.Is it possible to parallelize these jobs some other way?Yes. For example, look at how celery allows to create a complex workflow.
