I am having some problems. I have lists within lists that looks something like this:So if:Is there away I can use the first value in each list (i.e 'bread') to become the variable for that list. What I want in the end is:I am new to python so please explain things carefully or I won't understand what you are saying. Also, the list structure is the way it is set up so I can't change it, or at least, hoping not to. 
You don't want to do this. Use a dictionary:But if you insist...From the docs:Note The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.Also, list is a built-in type. Please don't name lists that.
