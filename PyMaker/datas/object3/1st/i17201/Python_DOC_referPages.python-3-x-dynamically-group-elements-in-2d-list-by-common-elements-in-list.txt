I will have a list that is equal to that, and I need to group then such that there is groups of elements who all start with the same ID tag (2040bl, 202kon, etc) will be in their own sublist.So the sub lists starting with '2040bl' will end up in their own group, all within the same list. The resulting list will have a resulting length of 7, as there is 7 unique ID tags (first element in each sublist)I'm on python 3
You can use itertools.groupby method. With your data it seems it will work out of the box. For example:Will output:Important: When using groupby the data needs to be sorted by the group key, which in your example they are. Otherwise you can add a sorted(l, key=lambda t:t[0]) before grouping.
