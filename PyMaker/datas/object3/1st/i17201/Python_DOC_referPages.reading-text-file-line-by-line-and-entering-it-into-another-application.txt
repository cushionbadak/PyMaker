Natural Text
Suppose I have a text file containing lines of data. I would like to be able to read each line of this file into memory, and then enter it into another application. For example, let's say I have a text file containing different numbers. I also have a calculator application open. I would like to be able to create a program that reads each number from the text file and remembers it, and then enters the number into the calculator application, pressing + after each number. I've done a bit of Python 3 programming, but nothing this complicated. I'm guessing cursors would be involved, and also loops, but the specifics (even where to start) are what I need help with. Is this possible?
Your question isn't precise enough. What is your platform and what kind of application are you thinking of. What you ask is very easy as long as you can feed data on the "standard input" of a program, which is easy to do on Linux/Unix systems with "pipes". See here: http://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.htmlBut you have to give more details.
