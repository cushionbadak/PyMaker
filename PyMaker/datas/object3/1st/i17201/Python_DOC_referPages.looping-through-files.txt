I have 100 files in  folder named 1.htm - 100.htm.I run this code to extract some info from a file and place the extracted info in another file final.txt. Currently, I have to run the program manually for 100 files. I need to construct a loop which can run the program 100 times, reading each file once. (kindly explain in detail with exact edits I need to do in my code)Below is the code for the file 6.htm:
And then the rest of your code goes there.Also consider (best practice)So you don't forget to close those file handles, because there is a limited amount of open file handles allowed in your OS, this will make sure you don't fill it by mistake.Making your code look something like this:Also NEVER replace global variable-names such as str:There's also no need for ; at the end of your code-lines, this is Python.. we code in a comfy manner!Last but not least..Should be:Unless you modify c along the way ofcourse, which you don't.. So switch!Shit i just keep finding more horrible things about this code (which you clearly have copy pasted from examples from across all galaxies...):You can condense all the above if/elif/else into one if-block:And also, skip ( ... ) around your if blocks, again.. This is Python.. we program in a comfortable manner:
perhaps some structure that looks like this:
os.listdir lists all the files in a particular directory.As @Torxed has pointed out, the best practice is to use with clause (so that file handles are closed).You can look for .htm files in like this:
