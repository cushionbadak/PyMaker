I am executing a script which prompts for 2 values one after the other. I want to pass the values from the script itself as I want to automate this.Using the subprocess module, I can easily pass one value:But passing the 2nd value does not seem to work. If I do something like this:
You should use \n for the new line instead of /r/n  -> 'y\npassword'As your question is not clear, I assumed you have a program which behaves somewhat like this python script, lets call it script1.py:It asks for confirmation ("y"), then wants you to enter a password. After that it does "something useful", finally prints the password and then exitsNow to get the first program to be run by a second script script2.py it has to look somewhat like this:The output of script2.py:A problem can most likely appear if the program uses a special method to get the password in a secure way, i.e. if it uses the line I just commented out in script1.pyThis case tells you that it is probably not a good idea anyway to pass a password via a script. Also keep in mind that calling subprocess.Popen with the shell=True option is generally a bad idea too. Use shell=False and provide the command as a list of arguments instead:It is mentioned a dozen times in the Subprocess Documentation
Try os.linesep:In Python 3.4+, you could use check_output():Note: the child script might ask for a password directly from the terminal without using subprocess' stdin/stdout. In that case, you might need pexpect, or pty modules. See Q: Why not just use a pipe (popen())?
