I am trying to create a program that factors quadratics. I was mostly successful, but I am having trouble with the quadratic 5x^2 -13x + 6 in which one of the roots is 0.6, or 3/5. I want to write it as a fraction, but it is not working correctly. It is giving me the following:5(x - 2)(x - 5404319552844595/9007199254740992)This is the code I used after importing from fractions:Anyone know why this may not be working correctly? Or an easier way to factor the quadratics would be useful too.
Quoting the Python manual:Note that due to the usual issues with binary floating-point (see  Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations), the argument to  Fraction(1.1) is not exactly equal to 11/10, and so Fraction(1.1) does  not return Fraction(11, 10) as one might expect.The suggested treatment for a case when you know the numerator and denominator must be small is to limit the denominator. Here is an example:The first one prints the fraction you mentioned, the second one gives 3/5.
0.6 can't be represented exactly as a binary float. See Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations. This is not a Python issue, it's an issue with how floating point numbers work.
