Or may be I am calculating it wrongAny idea what is wrong? How do I find out which one is causing problem.UPDATE:-Below error I got - 
There is no error in your json text.You can get the error if you copy-paste the string into your Python source code as a string literal. In that case \n is interpreted as a single character (newline). You can fix it by using raw-string literals instead (r'', Use triple-quotes r'''..''' to avoid escaping "' quotes inside the string literal).
The control character can be allowed inside a string as follows,You can find this in the docs for python 2, or the docs for python 3If strict is false (True is the default), then control characters will be allowed inside strings. Control characters in this context are those with character codes in the 0â€“31 range, including '\t' (tab), '\n', '\r' and '\0'.
Escape your newlines.Works for me.  Also, if you get an error like this in the future, a debugging technique you can use is to shorten the string to something that works and slowly add data until it doesn't.
