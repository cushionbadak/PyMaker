I'm using tk for a project's GUI. I have some very strange behavior with it, but only as a built executable on windows. Essentially I have a function launches a new process and needs to update some GUI elements after it completes. This works fine on OS X and Windows running interpreted. It works fine as a OS X binary. But as a Windows binary, the code causes a second main window to appear for unknown reason.The app is launched via:whereThen sometime later a user clicks a button which causes this to run:The callback loop eventually completes via the elif isinstance(obj, Implosion) clause. Then those functions are all called. Something that they do causes a second Toplevel window to appear which is essentially a clone of the main window. The UI operations are applied to the clone. The __postImplosion__ method is just:it just has to loop over some check boxes and enable them. I'm pretty baffled since this is only a problem with Windows binaries. Any thoughts?Update: Some more troubleshooting: The extra main window appears immediately after p.start() is called. So this seems to be some weird behavior. Why can't I launch a process without an extra Tk window appearing?
OK, as usual, the solution is that I should have RTFM. According to the docs there is a magic function that must be called to fix weird problems with multiprocessing when frozen on Windows.
