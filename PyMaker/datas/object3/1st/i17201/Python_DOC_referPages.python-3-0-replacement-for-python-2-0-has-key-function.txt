My program works in Python 2.0 but I need it to work in 3.0 or higher. The problem is that the new Python does not have the .has_key function anymore. I need to know how to fix this so it will work in the new version.
Use in for key testing:and replace .iterkeys() with .keys(); in this case a plain sorted(dictionary) would suffice (in either Python 2 or 3).Your code, rewritten a little more compactly with more current techniques, replacing dictionary with a collections.Counter() object:although you could also use Counter.most_common() to list keys in order by frequency (high to low) instead.You may want to read the Python porting guide if you are porting code from Python 2 to 3.
