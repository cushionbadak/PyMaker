the following code opens a file searches for a word or phrase, then opens the file in an array, it then adds two new objects after the word or phrase and then re-writes it to the file, the with statments do not work, when compiled it produces a syntax error saying the file = open(...) the '=' is not valid but it is the assignment operator. help?    
You need to use the as keyword:Here is a reference on Python's with statement.Also, these two lines are unncessary:Using a with statement to open a file will cause it to be closed automatically when the with statement's code block is exited.  In fact, that is the only reason why you use a with statement to open files.
