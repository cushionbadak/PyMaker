I am trying to set up a logger that writes to a new file every day. I would like to log to a file in /log/name_YYYY_mm_dd.log but it seems that this is done initially.Is there any elegant way to rotate the filename? }
You forgot 'when': 'midnight', and possibly a wrapper if you log from multiple instances. Try this:The system will save old log files by appending extensions to the  filename. The extensions are date-and-time based, using the strftime  format %Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S or a leading portion thereof, depending on  the rollover interval.
Django logging is just a thin wrapper of the Python logging module, you can use that to override Django settings if needed.Rotating logs in Python:Bypassing Django might also avoid parent loggers not receiving events from disabled children.
