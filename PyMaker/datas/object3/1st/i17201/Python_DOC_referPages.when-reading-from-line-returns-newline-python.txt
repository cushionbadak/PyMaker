Call the .strip() method on line.Note the argument to strip specifies what characters to remove. By default .strip() removes spaces and tabs as well... not sure if this is what you want.

Your question seems equivalent to one asked here.Summarizing the above thread, you can use print "text ", line.rstrip("\n"), " here". line.rstrip("\n") will return remove any "\n" contained in the string line.Or you could use for line in fp.splitlines(). .splitlines() returns a list of the lines WITHOUT newline characters. Personally, I'm a fan of splitlines. If you want, you can do something likelines = fp.splitlines()for line in lines:    [code goes here]
