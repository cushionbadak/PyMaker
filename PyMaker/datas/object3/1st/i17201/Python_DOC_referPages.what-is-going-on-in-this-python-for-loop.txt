I know you can use syntax like for i, val in enumerate(a). To me, it looks like tag, *args is being used here to create a tuple, such that the code is effectively for tuple in records. But that is just an uneducated guess.
records is a list of tuples, which the for statement iterates over. On each iteration, tag is assigned the first element of the tuple (the strings 'foo' and 'bar'), and *args sets args to a tuple consisting of the rest of the tuple (e.g. (1, 2)). These are then spread as arguments when calling do_foo and do_bar.
means taken each element in the iterable records. That element will be iterable.Put the first element of that element in tag, and put the rest in a tuple named args.means pass of the members of args to do_foo as arguments.So the listcauses
This is a feature available in Python 3+.Similarly,The python interpreter creates a list of appropriate size for the variable beginning with *. I hope the purpose of *args in the above loop is now clear.
