scandir.walk() is a better alternative to os.walk().I want to replace all instances of os.walk() with scandir.walk(). However, I also want to make sure all future devs will be using scandir.walk(). This will be hard to enforce, and so I am wondering if it is possible to override the default os.walk() functionality.
Python 3.5+os.walk is now scandir.walk. Citing PEP 471:As part of this proposal, os.walk() will also be modified to use scandir() rather than listdir() and os.path.isdir(). It isnow implemented using os.scandir(), which speeds it up by 3-5  times on POSIX systems and by 7-20 times on Windows systems.  [...] The implementation of this proposal was written by Ben Hoyt (initial > version) and Tim Golden (who helped a lot with the C extension > module). It lives on GitHub at benhoyt/scandir.Older PythonJust patch it:becauseThe API for scandir.walk() is exactly the same as os.walk()(from the GitHub page)
If you really want permanence it may be worthwhile to actually modify os.py file in your Python installation.  To avoid a hassle if you ever want to revert,  I would recommend this sort of thing in that file:I think this will work, but I'm not entirely sure and I'm too paranoid about messing up my company's python install to test it.  So you may have to do some playing around, but I think modifying the actual os module is what you want.  Hope this helps
