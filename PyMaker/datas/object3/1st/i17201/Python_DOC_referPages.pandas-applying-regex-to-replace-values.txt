I have read some pricing data into a pandas dataframe the values appear as:I want to strip it down to just the numeric values.I know I can loop through and apply regex to each field then join the resulting list back together but is there a not loopy way?Thanks
You could remove all the non-digits using re.sub():regex101 demo
You could use Series.str.replace:yieldssince \D matches any non-decimal digit.
You could use pandas' replace method; also you may want to keep the thousands separator ',' and the decimal place separator '.'
You don't need regex for this. This should work:df['col'] = df['col'].astype(str).convert_objects(convert_numeric=True)
