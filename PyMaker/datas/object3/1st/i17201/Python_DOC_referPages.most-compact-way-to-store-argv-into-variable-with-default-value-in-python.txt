Perl has the following syntax:So when the code has no argument it will automatically take defaultfile.txt as the value for $filename.What's the Python way to do it?
You are asking for the most compact way and the Python way.For a compact way, I'd useBut I think the Pythonic way is to do it right immediately, and use a module like argparse to parse arguments. It seems slight overkill for a single argument but it gives you a usage message and an obvious way to expand the code when you want to add options, extra arguments, and so on.You get some helpful functionality immediately:
I'd say the Python way would be
For this specific case, you should do something like what Remco suggested.But the literal translation of my $filename = $ARGV[0] || "defaultfile.txt"; (as far as I can tell; I don't know Perl) is filename = sys.argv[0] or 'defaultfile.txt'. This will set filename to sys.argv[0] if it's non-empty (or rather, truey), or else to 'defaultfile.txt'. Note that it will raise an exception if sys.argv itself is empty.See the docs for more information on truth value and Python's Boolean operators.
You can create simple function to make it more compact:Then:
