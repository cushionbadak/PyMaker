I need some help figuring out how to get left and right fit into h. Thank you! what i am trying to do is to get Sprites to fall diagonally down left and right Randomly.This is the error:and this is my code:
Using randint(a, b) requires that a <= b.However, in your case, bmin is -1 and bmax is -5, so the relation isnâ€™t true: -1 <= -5 is false.You need to exchange the values, so bmin contains the actual smaller number.
