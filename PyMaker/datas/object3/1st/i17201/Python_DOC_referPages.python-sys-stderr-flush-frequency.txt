How often does sys.stderr flush its buffer, and is this standard among different environments?I see that it is just a standard file type, but I don't know what value of buffering it's supposed to be. dir() does not seem to yield any useful information either.
On Python 2, I can't find where in the documentation sys.stderr's buffering is specified. I'd expect the same behaviour as  stderr in C that is unbuffered (except Windows) and I don't know whether c99 standard mandates it. The standard error stream is not fully buffered in POSIX. -u option forces standard streams to be unbuffered in Python 2.On Python 3:When interactive, standard streams are line-buffered. Otherwise, they  are block-buffered like regular text files. You can override this  value with the -u command-line option.-u command-line option:Force the binary layer of the stdout and stderr streams (which is  available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O  layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or  block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file.
