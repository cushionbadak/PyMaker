Please see the code,why list(w) properly display  ,and h display nothing ?
In Python 3, zip returns an iterator1.Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.An iterator remembers to where it has been iterated; at the h=list(w) line, the iterator is already "at the end" and thus results in an empty list/sequence.Try with w = list(zip(x,y)), which would force the iterator to a list once.1 The zip from Python 2 returns a list, and thus this behavior is only exhibited in Python 3.
