Natural Text
I have a function that takes the items in multiple lists and permutates them. So if I have the lists child0 = ['a', 'b'] and child1 = ['c', 'd']:I'm running into problems with saving the output into a text file. I can't assign a var to the print statement because the output will change every time it runs through obviously, and writing the permutate() function to a text file does nothing. Doing a return instead of print won't run the permutation properly.... any tips on how to print all the permutations to a text file properly?
You need to build a list and return that list object:What you are doing is creating the cartesian product, not the permutations.The Python standard library has a function to do just this already, in itertools.product():would produce the exact same list:
Pass a file object as an argument, and use file argument of print function.
