I want to store a time value in a mysql table, it is 1345 hours and 55 minutes. What type should column have?And if I want to pass a time variable from python to this column using mysqldb module, which time type should i use in python? datetime.timedelta?
Generally speaking, one can use MySQL's TIME datatype to store time values:MySQL retrieves and displays TIME values in 'HH:MM:SS' format (or 'HHH:MM:SS' format for large hours values). TIME values may range from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.Obviously, in your case, this is insufficient for the range of values required.  I would therefore suggest that you instead convert the value to an integer number of minutes and store the result in an 4-byte INT UNSIGNED column (capable of storing values in the range 0 to 4294967295, representing 0:00 to 71582788:15).
