i created a test c dll, which export one function i would like to expose to python bindings. I used the latest version fo SWIG for that. After successful compilation, SWIG leaves me with a x.py and a x.dll file.Now i am supposed to "import" the "package". However, no matter where i copy those files, when i type "import x" in python i get "ImportError: No module named 'x'".So how do i load such a custom created package in python?I am running windows 7 x64, with python 3.3 and latest SWIG.thanksedit: we are getting somewhere! I did some path trickery, now the module is found, but:where pt1 is my test module.edit2:I have uploaded all the files here: (40kb) rghost.net/53170317
Assuming you have foo.py and x.py and _x.dll, try putting them all in the same folder. Then, python.exe foo.py (where foo.py is module that imports x) from that folder. Post what happens in your question. Update: just noticed the .\_pt1.py import. Can you find where that module is and see if it contains an import x or other suspicious looking code that could cause recursion.
