When I update certain packages in my Python installation using pip I getI get this error for certain packages and not others, and have asked about ways to work around it (ideally while continuing to use pip) in the specific cases where I encounter it; but the question here is what the error means in the first place and what might be the likely cause.What does this error mean and what could be causing it?
This is caused by having two different versions of setuptools: one in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7 and another in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages. Somehow, setuptools.dist.Distribution.fetch_build_eggs in  the newer version calls pkg_resources.working_set.resolve from the older version. The old version of resolve doesn't support the replace_conflicting argument.On my OS X Lion machine, I was able to fix the problem like this:That is, I used the old version of easy_install to upgrade easy_install and then used that to upgrade pip.This fixed the problem on my system because it modified sys.path so that the new version of pkg_resources under /Library/Python loaded before the old version which can still be found under /System/Library/Frameworks. An alternative workaround might be to modify sys.path temporarily using the PYTHONPATH environment variable, see the Python manual.
