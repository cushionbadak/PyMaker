Looking at the Python SAX documentation I only see reading XML using SAX. But I would like to write it. I figured out how to do that in Java a while ago:What would be the Python equivalent? I checked an answer on SO using ElementTree - but that is rather the DOM way to do things (and problematic for really large output). Another question is un-answered. Or: what is the better approach writing out XML in Python?
https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.handler.html and for an example of Bible in OSIS XML take a look at this script.
I don't know of a direct SAX-like way in Python; but I wrote a library for this that might perhaps be useful to you. It provides methods to open and close elements, make pis, comments, doctypes, etc. It has a fair range of higher-level features, like keeping track of what elements and inherited xml:lang values (if any) are in play, doing all the escaping for you (even %xx escaping for URIs in attributes), and things like "closeToElement(type)" etc. I find it makes it much easier to produce WF XML from Python.
