I am a python newbie and have a question. Why can a if allow a brackets and not for. if (1==2):for (i in range(1,10)):while (i<10):First one and third one are valid syntax but not second one.
Because for (i in range(1,10)) isn't syntactically correct.Lets assume (i in range(1,10)) was parsed anyway, it would return a boolean. So then you're trying to say for True or for False, and booleans can't be iterated, and it's invalid syntax.The reason why your other examples work is because they expect a boolean, which is what is returned from 1 == 2 and i < 10
if expects a value (True of False). You can put parenthesis around any values: (1) + (1)for VAR in LIST is a fixed syntax which does not expect a value single value, but rather two inputs:a variable namewhat you will iterate overSo why would the Python language allow extra parenthesis there?As someone had pointed on a now deleted answer (why?), this is the syntax for the for statement: http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement :
