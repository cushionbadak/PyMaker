Is it possible to use a Python loop not to print a list of values but rather to create a list of values to use in another loop? For example, let's say I want to run a loop of code through multiple time frames, with shifting date ranges. Until now, I have entered manually or copied and pasted my sets of dates in a dictionary for the loop. But can I create a function that where I give a start date for the first time frame and then tell it to create the values for an additional 7 or 27 time frames, shifting by 3 months each time? Furthermore, my main code may require not one date variable, but a set of variables, each needing to be produced for the appropriate number of loops.Thank you for any assistance.Alan

One possibility is to do it with list comprehension:The other possibility is to do it with a normal loop:
