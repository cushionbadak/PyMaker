I am trying to write a function to see if a number is odd by using a % operator but get an error saying TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting When I switch %, for *, I don't get any error.
input returns a string in Python 3.x.  Meaning, you need to explicitly convert the input to an integer:The second example does not throw an error because multiplying strings by integers is perfectly legal:Also, you need to do num % 2 to check if num is odd:num % 1 will always return 0, regardless of the value of num:Finally, x = num % 2 should be placed inside the function:Otherwise, you will not be checking the argument num passed into the function.
