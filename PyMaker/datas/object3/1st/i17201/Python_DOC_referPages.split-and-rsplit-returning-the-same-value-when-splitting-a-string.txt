I have several strings in the format of (10, 12), (7, 3) etc that I want to break apart into two strings of the format string1 = 10, string2 = 12, string1 = 7, string 2 = 3 etc. I am using the following code to do this:However in the above examples 'uva' and 'uvb' would both resolve to the string after the ',' and I', not sure why.Can anyone see what I am doing wrong? I've tried a few variations on the variable 'uva' but i'm not getting anywhere.Thanks
I think you want simply:For example:As there is only one comma "," in each string, split and rsplit give the same result: ["10", " 12"]. You can access these values by index:(note zero-based indexing and the use of negative indices to count back from the end)or simply unpack as I have done above. map converts both values to integers using int.
Index 1 is the second string, but you donâ€™t really need to do any of this.Depending on what this format actually represents (something from repr?) you might consider ast.literal_eval instead, which will get you a tuple of integers.
Python uses 0-based indexing.  You meant
