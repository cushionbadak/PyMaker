I'd like to count the amount of items in an array before a consecutive amount of zeroes which is inputted by the user. For example, if the user inputs 3, there are three items in the list before a consecutive amount of three zeroes.At the moment my code checks for the amount of consecutive zeroes and returns based on that - how can I change this to also gain the value of items before the consecutive instance?

This is much easier if you first convert the list to string:Once in string form, it is easy to search for a block of seats:Here is all the code in a single function:If you want to stick with your original itertools.groupby approach, then you need to track both the position and values as you loop.  This is a job for enumerate():Eventhough groupby() can be made to work for you, it is tricky to use with a stream of tuples (such as that generated by enumerate()).  If you're aiming for clarity, it is something better to skip the functional programming composition tricks and just look normally.Here is a straight-forward, non-functional approach:
