i am migrating an application that embeds python, from version 2.7 to version 3.3. The application makes functions available to script, by calling Py_InitModule() with the appropriate data. Just to annoy poor guys like me, the api was dropped in python 3 and replaced by PyModule_Create, which takes a fairly complex structure.When i use the python2 api, everything works fine, when i use the new v3 one, the api loads fine (returns a valid pointer), but using the exposed functions in a script will yield an error://ImportError: No module named 'emb'Where emb is my module name. Very annoying! I have included the two version, maybe someone can help.I followed the porting guide here:http://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.htmlwhich does exactly the same thing as me. Why the api was changed is beyond me.
Based off this issue it seems they have changed the way to import modules has also changed. Here is what should hopefully work for you:
