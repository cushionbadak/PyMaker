I have a dictionary named "location" like this:I want to convert to a dic that the value is a float, so it looks like:I tried it gives me an arror that "float() argument must be a string or a number"how can I fix that?
Your problem is in here:  float(location[key][0,1])
You can use dictionary comprehension to construct a dictionary which has the values converted to floats, like thisAs suggested by @Grijesh in the comments section, if you are using Python 3,
You can use a list comprehension within a dictionary comprehension. Since you need both keys and values, use dict.items to iterate key-value pairs:map works more efficiently with built-ins, so you may wish to use:Or, since you have coordinates, for tuple values:The problem with your logic location[key][0,1] is Python lists do not support vectorised indexing, so you need to be explicit, e.g. the verbose [float(location[key][0]), float(location[key][1])].
