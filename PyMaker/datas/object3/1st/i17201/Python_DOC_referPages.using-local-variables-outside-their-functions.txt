I understand that functions are useful for code which will be used multiple times so I tried creating a function to save myself time and make my code look neater. The function I had looks like this:However, I am not sure how to return these variables as they are local(?). Therefore, I can not use these variables outside the function. I am just wondering if someone could help edit this function in a way where I could use the drawnCard and drawnCardValue variables outside the function?
Use return:Note, you could also write drawCard this way:These two functions behave differently if cardDeck contains duplicates, however. cardDeck.index would always return the first index, so drawnCardValue would always correspond to the first item which is a duplicate. It would never return the second value (which in theory could be different.)If you use adPos = random.randrange(len(cardDeck)) then every item in cardValue has an equal chance of being selected -- assuming len(cardValue) == len(cardDeck).
