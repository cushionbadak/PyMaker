I'm trying to use logging.basicConfig to log everything and logging.hanlers.RotatingFileHandler to have a maxBytes=1000000 and backupCount=5.The problem is that when I use RotatingFileHandler it'll log some duplicate outputs as well.I tried removing basicConfig and only using RotatingFileHandler but it didn't log every message I wanted.example:I changed that to remove basicConfig by:The above didn't work as RotatingFileHandler didn't log every message that I wanted. Why?
The logger that you get from logging.getLogger('') has its logging level set by default to logging.WARNING. You need to set the desired level on the logger itself as well as on each handler you associate with it to ensure you log the desired messages. Your second code snippet sets the level for the handler but not the logger.https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.setLevel
