Natural Text
I have written two python codes. Code 1 is showing error of 'numpy.ndarray' object is not callable. But when I comment some section which is in code 2, program runs successfully. I am new to this language so I can't figure out what the problem is. Is there some syntax error? Can anyone resolve this issue? Code 1:Code 2:
You have this line near the beginning of the first script:That shadows the builtin function sum, which you try to call here:You have redefined sum to be a numpy array, and you are now trying to call sum().  That generates the error, because numpy arrays are not callable.  For example,To fix it, change the name of the sum array to something like total.
