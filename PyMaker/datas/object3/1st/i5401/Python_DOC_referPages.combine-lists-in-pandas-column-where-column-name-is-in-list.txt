I have three Pandas columns where element are list. For combining these lists, I can do by explicitly write the name of column and + them togetherHowever, if I have too many column names to write each of them, is there a way to do it by looping (or not looping) the list of column name: columns = ['allmz','allint','allx'] instead?
Option 1Slice on the columns and call sum along the first axis. Option 2Another option with np.concatenate:
You can use Python's builtin sum function.
If you are having a large set of column's name then an easy way to solve this problem is shown below :where "allint" is the start column name and "allx" is the end column nameThis will give you the same result you got after writing the name of each columns.
