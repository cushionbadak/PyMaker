I'm new to python and using command line args or switched in python. I'm trying to write this code which generates base path to create a directory. My code:So my question is how can I generate the same path using command line switches by running the script like below instead of passing them as what I did in script ? and also it script should be able to look for existing path if provided instead of generating one.Or can someone shed some light or help me on generating the base path by running like this in command line.Apologies if my question is vague...Thx,yaar7002
