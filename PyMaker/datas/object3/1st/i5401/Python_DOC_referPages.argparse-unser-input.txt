I am building a Network for predicting. In which, user need to puts 2 input to get the predicted values.Currently, I used this command:Density = float(input("Density Ratio (%): ")) # User inputRa = float(input("Surface Roughness- Ra (um): ")) # User inputThese values were put during running cmd /...script.pyHowever, I want to use the Argparse pack to input the mentioned values at the begining, like cmd  / ... script.py 10, 20, for example.What should I do for that purpose?This is my code, required values locate at line 42, 43: https://gist.github.com/TonyS0n/66c8205be2e421fa0bee8d07112ec2f9Thank you
So you can simply use argparser for it. 
The easiest solution for such a simple use case would be to use sys.argv.After from sys import argv you can access the argv object, which is a ordered list of all script arguments starting with the script name as the first argument.
