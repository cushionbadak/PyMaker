Natural Text
As title, I have been trying to read text from file, convert to int and store it in a list. My text file look like this:I want to read this file, put each pair of numbers into a list m, and store those lists in a bigger list lis. Here is my attempt:I expect the lis to be like this:But instead, it is:I have tried insert instead of append but it seems like that's not where it has problems. I need some help - thank you in advance!
You are reusing the same list m in each iteration of the loop, each time overwriting the values set in the previous iteration. In the end, lis holds many references to the same list.Instead, assign a new value to m as a whole in the loop:Or shorter:Or even shorter, using map:Or even more shorter, using a list comprehension:

In lis all index reference to one list m. If any update in m is takes place, m is update every where   Try thisOutput[['1', '2'], ['3', '4'], ['5', '6']]
Use csv.reader object instead which uses ,(comma) as default field separator:The output:https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html?highlight=csv#csv.reader
