So if we run the above code and an exception occurs, the database is locked. So what should we do ?EDIT: I am aware that this is vulnerable to sql injection. I've posted this example simply so that I can quickly ask the question.
This is a great use case for with:With works on context objects. These objects define behavior for cleaning up in the event of an exception. In this case, the cursor will be released and the database will be unlocked if an exception occurs.Note that we need closing from contextlib. This is because sqlite3 doesn't make its cursors contexts (even though it should, and other db's like mysql and postgres do this for their db bindings). closing allows the with to know what to do with the cursor when you leave the with's block.A similar pattern is the correct way to handle files in Python:As @IljaEveril√§ mentions in the comments, the connections themselves are also context managers and you should definitely use them this way to ensure that connections are properly cleaned up:
