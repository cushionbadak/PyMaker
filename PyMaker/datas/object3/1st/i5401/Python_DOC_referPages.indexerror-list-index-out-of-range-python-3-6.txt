You have empty lines in the file, if you split a empty line on ; you do not have an index of 1 in the resulting item. Error tells you as much.Your code is missing crucial codeparts (f.e. the user dict):Try this:Output:Accessing the parsed lists by row:Output:If you want to create keys into dictionarys, you can leverage dict.setdefault(key,defaultvalue):is roughly equivalent to:This creates the key with an empty list if it does not yet exists. The value is returned by setdefault and extend(...) adds to it your current data. If the key exists, setdefault simpley returns the value and also extends it. Win-Win: your list grows.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict   or    this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3483652/7505395
