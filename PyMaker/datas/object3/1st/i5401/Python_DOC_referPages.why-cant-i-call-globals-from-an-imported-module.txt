let's say I have a module, spam. In spam, I put this code:Then, from any old python script, I import spam. From this I would get the following error:But, however, when I do this inside of the script importing spam;and I repeat the same code with one difference;I get the result I hoped for, which was a list of all the globals in __main__. Why can't I just call it normally? I don't want to have to codein a variable to hold globals() every time I import "spam". I'm sure others could benefit from this, I tried it with other builtins from __main__ like abs but same error. By the way, I'm trying to get __main__'s globals so that I can get the names of functions of whatever is importing spam. I need it so that I can also access variables from __main__.
The global variables in a module are the contents of the module object's __dict__, not an attribute named globals. You can access the __dict__ of any object using the builtin function vars:I'd also suggest you use importlib rather than exec and eval with import statements:
