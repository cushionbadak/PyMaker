I'm trying to write a python script to get the number of url used in a particuler web page:This is the code:I know this maybe has a simple solution but I really can't figure out what I am doing wrong, this is what I'm writing to practice.
In this case, the error message itself is pretty self-explanatory:You've created a new function mining_webpage that expects two arguments url and list. That means that each time it is called, you will need to pass it two arguments. E.g. Alternatively, you may want to redefined mining_webpage so that it takes fewer arguments, or has default values that will be used if the function is called with fewer arguments than expected. An example with default values might look like:Of course, setting default values in this way only makes sense if there are "default" values that you'd expect to be used frequently.As a final note, it's not obvious that list is actually used for anything at all, and I'd really avoid calling any variable list at all since this is already defined in the Python standard library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list). This second argument appears to be used as the value in the assignment of a new variable word_list, which is then never referred to again.
