I would also has to be consider total length of the list. It might be an even number.
All you need is list slicing starting from index 1 and then you need to jump by 3 indexes:General syntax of list slicing is your_list[start:end:jump] where:start: is the starting index for slicing the list. Empty value means start of the list i.e. index 0end: is the index till which you want to slice the list. Empty value means end of the listjump: is used to jump the elements from start such that you'll get values in the order start, start+jump, start+2*jump, so on till your list reaches end. Empty value means 1As mentioned by Mr. cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ in comment, for large lists one should prefer itertools.islice which returns iterator object and could be used in this case as:
