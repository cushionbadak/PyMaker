Natural Text
I'm using partnumber = get_txt(soup, 'Part Number') however occasionally Part Number is in the plural Part Numbers which breaks my script. How can I get around this so that if the text Part Number is matched then I can get_txt ?and here is the error whenIt makes sense that I get an error since the is no text Part number but instead, the text Part numbers so to solve it I manually change the text I'm looking for but I would like to avoid having to do it manually.
How to use get_txt to match only part of text instead of exact textThe answer to this is regex.  You can add regex search for text in your get_txt function.  You can see that I've changed text=key to text=re.compile(key). This will match Part Number with Part Numbers or any other text that has Part Number in it.
