I have code with Popup, which containts TextInput. Form code in example is working, but with using TextInputPopup constructor is falling down after using Popup.open() (version with costructor is in the note).What must I repair for using constructor?Parameter from TextInputPopup is used in function TextInputPopup.next_step(). Can I use this parametr in function SaveAs.on_call_popup(), which call TextInputPopup? How do I it?Example:
You must call the initializer of the parent class (__init__), for that use super:If you use __init__ in your class derived, you are re-defining parent constructor, which would normally run the initialization of the base class. super is used to run the parent __init__ without an explicit call to the parent class and allow you to  pass parameters to it.In principle, whenever you overwrite __init__ in a daughter class you should call the __init__ of your parent class with the necessary arguments to be properly initialized.
