Lets say I have the following string,and I only want butter from the string (I have done the following so far),EDITIs there a more efficient way of doing this in Python 3? What I have shown is just one example of the string that I am processing. There are many more strings with different words that I need to remove such as cups,cup,tablespoons and teaspoon. I am using the same approach to eliminate the words from the string, so is there a better way of doing this?
You may want to use regular expressions.
Regular Expressions are super useful for parsing through strings. With them you can search for all the times your desired string(s) are matched and make a new string just out of those.
