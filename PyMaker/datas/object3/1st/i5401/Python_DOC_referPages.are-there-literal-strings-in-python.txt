This question already has an answer here:How to write string literals in python without having to escape them?                    6 answers                In F# there is something called a literal string (not string literal), basically if a string literal is preceded by @ then it is interpreted as-is, without any escapes.For example if you want to write the path of a file in Windows(for an os.walk for example) you would do it like this:"d:\\projects\\re\\p1\\v1\\pjName\\log\\"Or you could do this(the F# way):@"d:\projects\re\p1\v1\pjName\log\"The second variant looks much more clear and pleasing to the eye. Is there something of the sort in python? The documentation doesn't seem to have anything regarding that.I am working in Python 3.6.3.
There are: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literalsYou can use r prefix.
https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.htmlTL;DR use little r
