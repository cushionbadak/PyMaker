I think my question is very easy and stupid, but I read a lot of materials and can't imagine how to do what I want.So, I use websockets library, and I have this algorythm:2. inside start I create second websocket to pass requests from ws and receive answers to send them to wsThe problem is, I need to use one websocket server connection for multiply ws clients, and I need to pass to everyone the same answer from ws_server. Now I get only one response, due to .recv() returns value only for one of the 'subscribers'.How to fix this? Please note, that I use while True and async
Here is a very simplistic example for a pub/sub websockets serverAnd an example subscriber client (run a few of those):and a publisher:
In other words, I need to run .recv in the same loop and thread with multiple consumers. In RxPy I could just stream.emit(recv_result) and consume items like thatstrem.subscribe(callback_fn), but this is callback way, I need asyncYour subscribe method can accept coroutine functions, i.e. functions created with async def. Once something is emitted, they can be instantiated and their coroutines spawned using create_task:
I'm not sure I understood correctly, but isn't gathering multiple coroutines is what you want?
Thanks for suggestions, they might work. I made it through queues.
