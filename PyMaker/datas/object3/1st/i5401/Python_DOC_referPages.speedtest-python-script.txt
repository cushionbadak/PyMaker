Hello there i'm new to python and I'm trying to do speed testing using python getting data from (speedtest.net). I have been looking through git hub and found the speedtest-cli. But it has a lot of features I don't need. I just want to make a simple script that will run 3 times. I found some API but I'm not sure how to modify it to loop three times. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance
