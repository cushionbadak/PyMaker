I have been looking for a graceful way to dynamically format strings (URLs) in Python while looping... This is for when I want to request using different query parameters for each.For example, this is what I've been resorting to at the moment (assuming I have 3 URLs):This is just ugly and I don't want to imagine what I'd do in the scenario where I have more links to request to.Isn't there a solution simpler/more graceful like this for example:Any help would be highly appreciated
You can store strings with format in list as you said:Also in python 3.6 you can use f-strings
Thanks to help from @luminousmen and the rest of you guys... I found a solution. Apparently you CAN just add placeholders and not do any operations on them :'D :
