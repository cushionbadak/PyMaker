The code below gives me an error that int has no length even though I cast it into str. Where is the problem there?Code:The output I get:
You assign an integer to x in the loop:so the next iteration of your while loop now passes that integer to the len() function and you get your exception.Convert the value to a string instead:I'd set mult to 1 inside the loop to simplify it, and test for more than 1 digit:The loop can also be done using the functools.reduce() function, together with operator.mul() function for speed. The map() function can be used to turn the characters of x back to integers to multiply with. We can use itertools.count() to produce the counter:
while loop check the condition after all code, right after counter+=1 in your code. At that time, your x variable is a product, (maybe int?) as mult, and then python interpreter try to apply __len__ in the int object, so it raise a TypeError.
