Natural Text
Here is a response I am getting from server I am trying to parse this string into JSON using However when I try to read the 'price' using json_data[0]['price'] the output is 2.6e-07I tried parsing data as json_data = json.loads (req.text, parse_float=Decimal) but still no difference. 
This is the way python shows floatsoutputs: 2.6e-07you can print it this way if you want to see it normal:ouputs: 0.00000026
Your value is parsed as a Decimal, it's just shown in an exponential form because it's more compact:You can see that the precision is preserved, though, unlike with a float:So everything works as expected.
