Natural Text
I am trying to pass None keyword as a command line parameter to a script as follows, if I explicity mention Category=None it works but the moment I switch to sys.argv[1] it fails, any pointers on how to fix this?so I tried as below which still didn't workCommand line passage:
just an FYI. You can use ast module to convert sting 'None' to None typeEx:orFaster and better solution. 
As Stephen mentioned, None is not a string, so when comparing a str type to a NoneType type, the result will always be False.If I just put " around None on the right-hand-side of the comparison, we get:Resulting in:argparse instead?However, I recommend using argparse instead, if you're in a position to do so. I use it all the time.The above code could be replaced with:Which will also tolerate no parametersAnd it auto-formats some help text for you!
I think more appropriate way to do this would be to check if there's any parameter passed or not. If not then set category to None, otherwise set the value that is passed.Ex:So if you just call script.py, category will be set to None.If you call like script.py Value, category will be set to Value.
