I am trying to create a password generator that consist of 3 parts. I am able to generate a randomized string (tYVb for example) however when I try to store it as a variable 'mod' and attempt to print it, the value had 'None' attached to the end of it (tYVbNone). How do I ONLY store the string to my variable so I can further manipulate it? 
I think the cleanest way to write the code you are looking for would be to do something like this:then you can call the function like so:producing an output that looks like: zWAGjUyhEZ
This is how I would do it (based on what you have provided so far):
There are several errors OR omissions in the code as presented. I offer some comments in the code below to highlight potential improvements to the code OR to highlight some additions.As mentioned by Charles Duffy, random.choice() is a better solution and makes the code more Pythonic:random.choice()This function randomly picks from a sequence of items (and under the hood, strings are considered sequences).This snippet could be inserted in the above code to help clean it up.
Your function doesn't return anything and putting a number into it serves no purpose unless one of the variables is global. I'm not sure if you can print on the same line as you define something. Running the code doesn't seem to return anything. Try adding a return statement.
