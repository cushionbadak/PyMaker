Natural Text
I'm trying to turn a datetime, taken from a CSV file, and parse it into it's component date and time aspects. '11/06/2017 17:59' should become '11/06/2017' and '17:59' respectively. What I've got so far is: when I run it though it errors out saying "ValueError: time data '11/06/2017 17:59' does not match format '$m/%d/%y %H:%M'" That looks like it is the same format. Am I missing something?
The correct format is %m/%d/%Y %H:%M (note, no $, the Y is capitalised to indicate 4 digit year format).For more information on various legal datetime formats, visit the datetime documentation.For your second bit, use dt.date and dt.time to grab individual components.You can call str on the result after, for a human readable output.
