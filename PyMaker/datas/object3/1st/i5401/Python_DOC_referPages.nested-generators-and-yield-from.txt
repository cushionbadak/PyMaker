I have an nested object, a, and want to apply some type of filter on each of its sub-containers:A function to keep the nested structure but filter to only even elements would look like:But I would like to create an equivalent generator that uses some form a nested yield to maintain the nested structure of a.This, for illustration, is exactly what I do not want because it flattens a:My understanding was that yield from, introduced in Python 3.3, might allow for nesting that retains the structure of the passed object.  But apparently I am misinterpreting:So, is there any way I can use two generator functions (i.e. not create intermediate lists) so that calling the generator would give me this:
You want your nested_generator to return a list of sublists.  In this case, you cannot get around creating temporary lists at the inner level.So, your best option is to yield the filtered list:If you want to use a second generator to filter your sub-list, you can convert the iterator returned to a list and yield that as well:
