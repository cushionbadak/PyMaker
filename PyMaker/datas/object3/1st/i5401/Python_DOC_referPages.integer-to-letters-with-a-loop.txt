I'm trying to create a program on python that will take 3 integers and convert them into letter's using their ASCII but I'm not sure what is wrong with this program. Can you help me?
I think your issue is just that you only have two closing parens for three open parens in the third line of the loop. Making the change, your code seems to work for me.Also, since you're doing the append inside the loop, there's no reason to use num[x] instead of numx directly. Unless you're using it for something else, you can get rid of num entirely. And your call to str is unnecessary.
To convert ASCII numbers into a string, you could do the following:For example:letters is a list of the numbers converted to letters, and the join() is used to concatenate them all together (without adding anything between them).
