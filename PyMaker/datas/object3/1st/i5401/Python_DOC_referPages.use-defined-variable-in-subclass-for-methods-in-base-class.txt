Natural Text
I have a base class and two different subclasses (they are in 3 different modules).In the base class I have test methods which I use for the subclasses.I want that the test methods in the base class to use the defined variables from the subclass. But I cannot access to the variables from the subclass, when I run the test methods in subclass.Can someone help me to resolve this problem?P.S.: I cannot use a __init__ constructor (cannot collect test class)!Code:So, when I run the tests in the class SubClass1, I want that variable table_name on the BaseClassExample to take the value Pacer from the variable in subclass SubClass1.
Use self.table_name:Explanation: Python has a few namespaces â€” global, local, class and instance. You cannot access table_name because Python looks it up in local and global namespaces and fails. You can access self.table_name because it's instance namespace which also has access to class namespace if the name is not shadowed in instance (in self).
