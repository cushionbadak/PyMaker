On Successfully POSTing to a form endpoint I redirect back to the same endpoint with some URL params that my client side code can interact with.But I ran into some issues trying to write a test for this code as I can't figure out how to test that those URL params are on my redirect URL. My incomplete test code is:I've tried a few different methods to test this. With and without the context manager and I've dug deep into the Flask and Werkzeug source on the test_client and test_request_context.I just want to test that the URL params for success and id exist on redirect after a valid POST.
Here's a super simple yet inclusive example of patching Flask's url_for method (can be run as-is in a Python interpreter):However, the above example will only work if you're importing Flask directly and not using from flask import url_for in your routes code. You'll have to patch the exact namespace, which would look something like this:For more info, check out Where to Patch in the mock documentation.
You could use mock's function patch function to patch url_for capturing the provided arguments and then test against them.
