I'm starting to use logging to an output file but can't see how to log the head of a data-frame.  Is it possible?I've tried debug (logger.debug("snaptable", snap_date.head())where snap_table is a data-frame, but I can't see any output when I interrogate the output file...Could someone please let me know the type of logging to see a data-frame pleaseThanks
snap_date.head() returns pandas.core.frame.DataFrame object:You should convert it to str, because logger.debug arguments (msg and *args) must be format string and string arguments. Try pandas.DataFrame.to_string:
