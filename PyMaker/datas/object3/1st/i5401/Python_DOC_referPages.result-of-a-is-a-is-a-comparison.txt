This question already has an answer here:Chaining “is” operators                    4 answers                Why does `False is False is False` evaluate to `True`?                    5 answers                Result:I know it is not normal to use two "="s and "is"s in the if sentence. But I would like to know how the Python interpreter intereprets the if statement.Is the expression lie is lie is lie interpreted simultaneously, or short-circuit way?
What you've happened across is called operator chaining. From the documentation on Comparisons:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is  equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once  (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be  false).Emphasis mine.So, this would mean lie is lie is lie is interpreted as (lie is lie) and (lie is lie), and nothing more.More generally, a op b op c op d ... is evaluated the same as a op b and b op c and c op d ... and so on. The expression is parsed according to python's grammar rules. In particular;
This question has many answers already, but consider the function split into bytecode:This suggests that all lies are being checked to see if they match, in a linear fashion. If one fails, it should break/return.To confirm, consider:
It will be interpreted as:
