I am little bit new to Python and I got stuck a bit in this moment:it gives me error:Error: TypeError: file  line 39: coercing to Unicode:  need string or buffer, int found #Question is how to put variable c = 5 inside second bracket so it will be 7? 
Avoid string concatenation when you can. This is a good use case for str.format.Which works assuming c holds the value of an integer to begin with (otherwise, the c + 2 step fails).
Python does not automatically convert an integer into its string representation like some languages. You need convert it explicitly yourself with str(), format(), or an f-string.
In Python, you can't concatenate str and int.
