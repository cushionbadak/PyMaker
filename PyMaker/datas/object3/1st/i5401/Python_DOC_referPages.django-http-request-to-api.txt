So i been trying to get this to work but at the same time i do not understand some of these code means. I'm sorry for making the question so long but i want to understand how these works.I am trying to make a HTTP request to another API to do POST and GET method using django. Based on the website code example, which is this url: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/build-your-own-pokedex-with-django-mms-and-pokeapi.htmlAs i wanted to use HTTP Request on my API to call other API, therefore i wanted to get a better understanding of how these works and how to use it.The code is at the bottom of the website. But i will just provide the code here so it is easier for you.website codeMy question is:i have read about the request.POST and request.POST.get but i still don't get it. Isn't request.POST = POST method/create function ? what does body.lower mean ? Cant seems to find anything about it.I am very confuse about this part is pokemon['sprites'] refers to the sprites field in the api ? What does this even means ?request.POST.get('From', '') Isn't POST where user enter data ? Where does 'From' come from? And what does this means ? if '+44' in frm: if +44 is found in frm ?
ALL The questions are based on very basic python concepts, I recommend you go through python docs here Python DocsDiff in request.POST and request.POST.get()body.lowerThis method returns a copy of the string in which all case-based  characters have been lowercased.check this link  lower()pokemon['sprites'][0]['resource_uri']this is serching in pokemon (which have dictionary values)Ex. pokemon = {'sprites':[{'resource_uri': 'res_value'}, 1, 2, 3 ]}    so pokemon['sprites'][0]['resource_uri']  will give 'res_value'frm = request.POST.get('From', '')  same as i said in 1st pointif '+44' in frm:this will return True if string '+44' is substring in frm variable(string)
