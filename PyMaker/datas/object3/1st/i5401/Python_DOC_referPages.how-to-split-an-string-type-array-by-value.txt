Say I got an array of str:And I want to split it by value, in this case by '\n', so it becomes:I don't want to enumerate every element since it's time consuming when input has a large scale. So I wonder if there are some functions or python tricks that can easily achieve this. P.S.I've saw this question but it doesn't help much. Mainly because I don't quite understand how np.where() works with np.split(), also because I'm working on str type.Another thing might be helpful is that my final goal is to generate a matrix of numbers (maybe float type), so I'll also be glad to know if there's any numpy function can do this. 
You can use itertools.groupby which, of course, does iterate the list, but is highly optimized:Or, with float conversion:
Using numpy:Alternatively, if we're sure to be dealing with a matrix, you could simply search for the first occurrence of '\n', reshape, and slice using that.This might be faster.
I made a thing for this once upon a time. A chunking module. It's made to work similar to str.splitThenThere's also chunking.iter_split, which is a generator variant of that.
