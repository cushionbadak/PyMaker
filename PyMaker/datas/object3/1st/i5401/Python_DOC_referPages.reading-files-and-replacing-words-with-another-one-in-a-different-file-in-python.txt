I have two text files, hostname1 and command_file1.Hostname1 would be:command_file1 would be:What I need to do is:I need to replace [1] in Command_file1 with dfwm2 and then print the following lines like 'edit,run show,exit, etc' then again replace the [1] with dwm1-su2 and print the next lines.What I did is: I first read the Hostname1.txt and saved it in a dictionary:The o/p that I am getting is Any idea how to do it?Thanks.
Since you didn't use the headers in the host file, I simply ignored lines that start with '[' in this code and return a list of values instead of a dict. If you do need the keep the headers from the file it would not be hard to change this code to support that.The key here really is just using the str.replace function. If you have control over the format of the input files you might have more success using str.format or string formatting.
