I started to study class object with python (never done before)the program should get from a list (harvest list) the info that the class apple need to count the grams of apple if the quality is high then they go on the good barrel if it's not then on the bad barrel, I want to implement a counter that counts how many barrels I have used the code that is in bold and italic should count how many barrels are usedtotApple should be the total grams of all the apples and countBarrel should use totApple to check if it is >=100 gr, if so then a new barrel should be counted and used but these codes are not either in relationship with the rest of the codeIf you run the code without the "italic bold part" should work, This is the output: "Harvested 2 high-quality apples with a total weight of 230 g Harvested 2 cider apples with a total weight of 219 g"what I am looking for, it's to get an output that says how many barrels is used, like if it is filled up then a new barrel should be usedI have been googling this topic (class and object) but any good resource (except python API) what I'm looking for is something more practical
You could use your Barrel class to store the "finished barrels" - the Storeroom idea of @Coled would be a better fit class-wise, but it demonstrates how it works:I modified your self.barreln to barrels - and added the "see if it fits into current barrel, if not make a new one" - logic into your addApple(...) function. You would have to adapt this a bit to fit yours fully:Output:If you wanted to go for a Storeroom-Class, easiest would be to inject it into your barrel - class and each time you need a new barrel you call a self.storeroom.addBarrel(float(self.weight),int(self.count)) - your storeroom would then hold that list of weigts/counts and the print function. You just have to make sure to "finalize" the last, not yet full barrel into your storeroom before printing.
