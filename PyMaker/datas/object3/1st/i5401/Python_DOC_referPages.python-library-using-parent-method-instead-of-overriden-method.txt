I have extended the Parent class with the Override class. I have have overridden the method() method to fix a bug that occurs in the Parent class. I fixed the said bug and this fix has been tested in the Override class.I use the Override class through an External class. By testing the External class to see if the previous bug is fixed, I discovered that it is not and that the traceback does not go through the Override class.It seems to me that the External class uses the Parent.method() method instead of the Override.method() method. Any clue on how to fix it or on where this problem comes from?I'm a beginner and have not been confronted inheritance a lot so, please, forgive my ignorance and my lack of experience.EDITTest that fails in External :Overridden method :read_string() in https://github.com/thefab/configparser_extended/blob/master/configparser_extended/ecp.py line 573Parent method :read_string() from configparser(https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser.read_string)test.iniError :
Your code is not a complete working example, but it should do as you suggest.Here is an example you can run to prove the point:That prints 'child', proving the Child class has overridden method(self).
