To launch a python script from terminal, I have to use the following bash commands: Those parameters after .py are important, otherwise, the script will run with default settings and in my case, the script will not launch with default settings. The problem arises when I need to launch my script from another python script, (instead of using bash commands on terminal). To launch one of my python script from a parent script. I wrote into my script:in my parent script But on terminal, I got an error stating:Could I get some advice on how I can incorporate these parameters with the import module?
Do you really want import module to have parameters, You can use python class instead. I would suggest you should not have multiple entry points in your project i.e.(main). Other way is make your parameters global.
import does not work with parameters but i can suggest using the os module to call the script. Simply do os.system("foo.py -parameters").
