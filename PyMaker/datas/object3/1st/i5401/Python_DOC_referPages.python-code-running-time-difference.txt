I was practicing on Leetcode, I want to ask 3 questions about the codes running time.I noticed that on Leetcode, even the same code will have quitedifferent running time if submitted multiple times. And thedifference is huge, is that normal? I have seen the difference asfirst times beats 26%, but second times beats 51%. That really isconfusing me, while I am trying to figure out where I am and howgood the codes are.The actual codes: Leetcode p21, remove elementthis is to remove all elements of one value from a list of int, without creating a new list, and return the length of the new list.You can see that I wrote two functions that will work, and the second one is so much shorter than the first one, but somehow the first one appeared to be faster. And I wonder why.What is the best way to find out if one set of codes is faster than the other one without have to submitted to Leetcode?Thanks,
For those who is interested, I tried to use timeit to evaluate the two functions. The result is quite interesting, I found that as the list length goes longer, the efficiency of the two functions are changed:When the list is short, first one is much slower than second one:However, if I create a extremely long list:The second function is much slower now.
