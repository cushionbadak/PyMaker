I basically want to run multiple python scripts. There were many ways of doing this but basically preferred the following one:However, fileA runs, but fileB doesn't. Only after closing the first, the second starts. I tried with os.system, but same happens there too. Please help. I need both files to run simultaneously.
The comments are correct - this is still run sequentially due to the Python script in which subprocess is embedded.What I think you're looking for is the Python 'threading' module. This will allow you to set up your threads (subprocess of fileA.py and fileB.py), then execute them at the same time.Note that this is not multiprocessing (which is a lot more complex), and because of this, your main script will not continue until all threads are complete.
