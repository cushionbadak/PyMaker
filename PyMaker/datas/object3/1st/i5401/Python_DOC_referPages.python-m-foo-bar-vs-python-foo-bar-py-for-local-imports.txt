I'm trying to run a python file interactively. The file imports other local modules. E.g., I have foo/bar.py and foo/baz.py. I want to run foo/bar.py interactively, and in foo/bar.py I have from foo import baz.From foo's parent directory, I can run python -m foo.bar, and the import of baz works fine. But when I want to run interactively with python -i foo/bar.py, the import no longer works (the same is true if I do python foo/bar.py).Why is that? Can I invoke python differently to get this to work? Am I organizing my code in a strange way?
When using the -m option, the current directory will be added to the start of sys.path.  In your case, that's the directory which contains foo.  This allows the import statement in bar, i.e. from foo import baz, to be resolved correctly.When not using the -m option, the first item in sys.path is the directory containing the script that was used to invoke the Python interpreter.  In your case, that's one dir deeper than before - it's the directory /path/to/foo itself.  This does not allow the import statement from foo import baz to be resolved correctly.  Can I invoke python differently to get this to work? This should work:Am I organizing my code in a strange way?Not really, but you'll need to get the parent directory of foo onto sys.path somehow.  The best way is to write a setup.py file and then "install" your code with:
