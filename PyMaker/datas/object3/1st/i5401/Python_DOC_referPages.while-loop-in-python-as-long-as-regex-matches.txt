Ok, I'm aware that it's probably not the best way to edit a string with regex expressions in loops. Just for the sake of interest: How would I have to build a loop, that executes a regex pattern as long as it matches, run in a loop and stop when it doesn't hit anymore? Im doing this in python.
match is not None, since match returns None in case of no match, according to the docs. But you're not updating match in the loop. Did you mean something like:(Note that search takes no repl argument)
