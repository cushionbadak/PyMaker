This question already has an answer here:Creating a leaderboard for offline game in Python                    1 answer                I have my score in a while loop in pygame, so it looks something like this.How would I get my program to store a new high score every time the player beats his old high score. And how do you even store a score? I want the score to be the same if the user closes the program and opens it later. If this is possible can someone explain it. 
In essence, you want to store data in a way that can be retrieved after the game has ended.This can be done by writing the relevant data/variable content to a file with either a predetermined format(JSON) or your own simple format. Either way you should be able to correctly parse the information when the game starts.How to do this:Identify the point in your code where you should open the file and write the new high score to the file.Check if a new file must be created. If so, then create it.Implement the code which will write the high score to the file.When the game starts up again you must open the file in "read-only" mode and retrieve the information.Note: Make sure you close all files that you open to prevent memory leakage.I hope that this answer helped you and if you have any further questions please feel free to post a comment below!
