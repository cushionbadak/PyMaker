What i want to do is have the result of logical OR for two bit-strings. For example:The error i encounter most of the time is when I convert 'b' from string to binary it removes leading zeros. Others methods i have used convert 'a' and 'b' to integers. Generally nothing is working and help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance
Here are a couple of alternative methods.Third-party bitarray library:Python strings:-
You can convert them to integers with int specifying the base to be 2. Then, perform a bitwise OR operation and convert the result to a bit string with bin.If you want to print the result as a bit string, use str.format. If you're on python-3.6, you can also use f-strings.To capture leading zeros with respect to a/b, use str.zfill -
You should convert to int objects and do numerical operations in the numerical data type. Then you use string-formatting when you need to see it. If you have Python 3.6, using f-strings makes this trivial:Read the string formatting spec's. You can make them do whatever you desire. Using a fill value of '0' and a width of '6':And this is cool too:
