You set your handlers to filter on the WARNING level:andthen logged an INFO level message. INFO is a lower, less severe level from WARNING, so is filtered out by the handler.You need to log at WARNING level or higher (so WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL, or a numeric value of 30 and up), or configure your handlers to handle lower levels (so INFO, DEBUG, or NOTSET, or a numeric value of 20 or below).For example, logger.warn(logTime) causes data to be added to your log file. And if you used logging.INFO for the second argument to create_logger(), the logger.info() call would also have the same effect.From the Handler.setLevel() method documentation:Sets the threshold for this handler to level. Logging messages which are less severe than level will be ignored. When a handler is created, the level is set to NOTSET (which causes all messages to be processed.Bold emphasis mine; also see the Logging levels section for their ordering and numeric values.Note that creating a log message with a timestamp in the log message is rather redundant, as your log format already includes a timestamp:
