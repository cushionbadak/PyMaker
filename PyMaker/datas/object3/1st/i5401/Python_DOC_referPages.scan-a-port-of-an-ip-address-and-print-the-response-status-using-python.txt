I am trying to hit a port of an IP address and print the status code (i.e 200 OK , 502 Bad Gateway etc). Suppose, let's say port 80 is open at ip address xx.xx.xx.xxx . So, xx.xx.xx.xxx:80 should give us 200 OK. In my code, I am using port 811450 , which is definitely not opened and no application is running there. But it is not showing any error.What is the recommended way to achieve it.
