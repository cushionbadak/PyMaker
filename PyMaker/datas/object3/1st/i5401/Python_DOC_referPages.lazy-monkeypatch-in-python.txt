Natural Text
I'm writing a tool for live coding in Python, and I want to monkeypatch matplotlib if the user imports it. It's kind of slow to import though, so I don't want to import it and monkeypatch it when the user doesn't import it.I read through the import hooks documentation, and I got this working in Python 3.This works fine for Python 3, but not for Python 2.7:My tool runs on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, so how can I lazily monkeypatch a module in both versions?
This is ugly, but it works. Hopefully someone can suggest a better option.Now it works in both:
