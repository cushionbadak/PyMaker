Natural Text
I've seen that ::-1 can be used to reverse a string, but I thought it would be of interest to find the explicit integers i:j:k that would do the job.I found the documentation common-sequence-operations, but can't get it to work. This code test comes up short:Here is the output:It looks like you can't do this with an explicit formula, s[i:j:k].Usually I can figure out simple programming by trial-n-error, but that is not working here. Maybe a careful read of the documentation will get me over this!
You would have to do it like this:Or, as pointed out by Terry Jan Reedy in the comments, the following way of writing it illustrates nicely the length of the slice as (stop - start) / step:The issue is that negative indexing starts at the back, so the negative indexes correspond the following "real" indexes:0 or -len(s) is not enough since the stop index of the slice is exclusive, so you have to get one lower.
