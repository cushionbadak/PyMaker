I am getting this error.
You're definitely over-complicating this - to the point where it is not obvious as to what your strategy actually is.Here's a simple algorithm you could try and integrate:Get the length of list2Iterate through list1, accessing slices of the list of length list2 (eg the first slice would be [1, 3, 8], then the next would be [3, 8, 10]Check if the slice is equal to list2 - if it is then return True (or add 1 to the counter)If you reach the end of the list - end
You can test all the list1 slices of the proper length for equality with list2. You can then use sum to get the number of occurrences:
Here is one possible way to do it:Which Outputs:The approach of the above code:Convert list1 to a collections.deque object, which can pop objects off the front in O(1) time. This is items in the code.Store a count of identical lists found equal to list2.Check if the current sub list, the first n elements in items as a list, is equal to list2. Increment the count if it is equal.Pop the first item from items with popleft(), getting ready for the next sub list. So if my list is [1, 2, 3, 4], After processing [1, 2, 3], pop 1 from items, and the next sub list to check is [2, 3, 4]. Keep doing this process until no size sub lists can be extracted. Then you can just print out the count at the end.
