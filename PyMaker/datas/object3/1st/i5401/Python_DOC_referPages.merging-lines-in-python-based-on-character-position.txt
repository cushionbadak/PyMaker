I've a file with alternating lines, chords followed by lyrics:How could I merge subsequent lines in order to produce an output like the following, while keeping track of the character position:From How do I read two lines from a file at a time using python it can be seen that iterating over the file 2 lines at a time can be done withbut how can the lines be merged so that line 2 is split according to character positions (of chords) from line 1? A simplehas no position information andgives separate characters, not the chords.
You could use regexp match objects for extracting both position and content of chords from the 1st line. Care must be taken at the edges; the same chord may continue on the next line, and a line may contain chords with no matching lyrics. Both cases can be found in the example data.The edges could be handled differently, for example by testing if the 1st chord begins at 0 or not before the loop, but I feel that the single for-loop makes for cleaner code.Trying it out:produces the desired format:
