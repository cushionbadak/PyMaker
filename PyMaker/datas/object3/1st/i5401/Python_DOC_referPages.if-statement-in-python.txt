I have the code below (attach). What I want to do is to prompt a user to enter a ticker from Quandl website (financial/economic data) so that the dataset is retrieved. One condition, the data should be of 1-month length starting from the time when a user enters ticker.Let'say if the program is run on 22/01/2018 so the data should be from 22/12/2017 till 22/01/2018 (That is the first thing I am struggling with). Second, I want to make sure that the ticker is entered correctly, so I want to make a condition such that "if the command "quandl.get("ticker", start_date=trim_start, end_date=trim_end)" does not retrieve the data- re-enter the ticker" Please, advise me this issue.
To answer the first part. You can use the datetime module. Like thisI'm not familiar with the quandle API. I will have a very brief read of the documentation for you.UPDATE Here is how I experimented to try and solve your problem. You can see I just try to get something I know will fail. I import the correct exceptions and handle them in a try except block. I hope this helps.
