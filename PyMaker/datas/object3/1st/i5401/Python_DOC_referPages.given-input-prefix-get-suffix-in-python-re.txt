I have a function that takes in a string and a prefix word. I want to use re.findall to get a list of suffix words that follow the given prefix.For example: My implementation is However, I am getting [] returned. Can someone suggest how I can implement this, using re? 
Building on top of other answers here is a 1 liner
Several issues here, first the range separator inside a quantifier is a comma not a hyphen, so: {4,15} instead of {4-15}.Second, you need to match both my and My, so the match should be case insensitive (re.IGNORECASE).Third, if you use a capturing parentheses group (the round brackets) with finditer then you don't need to hack off the prefix.Try this:Gives:Depending on needs, \b (word boundary) might be better than a space to separate words.  For example:  "my, and your, stuff" would not match using a space.
Since @cdarke covered your main issues with your problem, another way would be to split string into a list of words with re.sub(), and if a word in the list is equal to any case of prefix, get the previous word and add it to your resulting list. Here is an example:Which Outputs:Note: In order to check if any case in the words list match with prefix, you can convert it to lowercase first with lower(). 
That's where you need   Positive Lookbehind :Here we go:output:
