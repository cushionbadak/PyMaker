I get an output for the very last line where it has a comma. For exampleInstead of:How to go about fixing the code? Do I use join? (something I haven't learned about in class yet)

You can do this easily
Yup, you should use str.join in this case. It is the built-in way to achieve this:It is important to note that you can only join str objects. You will have to convert the elements of the iterable you want to join to str. You can use either map or a comprehension to achieve that.
Yes. Since the result is a list, you can create a string from a list by using join:
No idea why everybody's joining...
