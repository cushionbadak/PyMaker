This question already has an answer here:How to zip two differently sized lists?                    8 answers                I have following two lists to combine. I'm trying to use zip() but header_list runs out for obvious reason.The result should be a tuple in the following format:
If you use itertools you can use cycle to repeat the shorter one:zip will stop once the shorter iterable ends. cycle returns an iterable that never ends (constantly repeats header_list), so data_list will be shorter (and it will stop zipping when data_list ends).
Assuming you want the shorter list to simply wrap, you can iterate over the indices of the longer list and mod the current index by the length of the shorter list:Or, to be more Pythonic:
how about something like this?
