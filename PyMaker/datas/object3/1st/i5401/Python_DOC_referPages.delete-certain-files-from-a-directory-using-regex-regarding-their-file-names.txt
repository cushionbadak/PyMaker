Here I am making attempts to create a code what would delete files in a folder according to the mask. All files what include 17 should be removed File name format is ??_????17*.*, where ? - Any symbol 1..n,A..z, _ and 17 - are in any files (others contain 18, as well) and its extension doesn't matter. Certain example of a file AB_DEFG17Something.Anything - Copy (2).txtThere are a few mistakes, as well. File "D:\Python\Test_folder\Remover v2.py", line 14, in     matching(r'\w\w[_]\w\w\w\w[1][7]\w+[.]\w+', testfolder) # matching the file's mask  ï¿¼ File "D:\Python\Test_folder\Remover v2.py", line 9, in matching    match = re.search(r, s)  File "c:\Program Files (x86)\Wing IDE Personal 6.0\bin\runtime-python2.7\Lib\re.py", line 146, in search    return _compile(pattern, flags).search(string)I'm a beginner and with amateurish approach would like to get experience in PY, parallel learning details. What am I doing wrong? Any help would be useful. Thx
Don't reinvent the wheel, rather use glob() instead:
Using glob.globUsing os.scandir and re.match
You can use the following command directly from your shell:cd $PATH; go to the folder in question$(ls -il AB_CDEF17*.* | awk '{print $1}') will print all the inumbers of the files in your current directory, I am using this detour since it looks like there are spaces inside the filenames, therefore rm command will not work properly on them.find . -type f -inum $inode -exec rm -i {} \;; find the files based on their inumber and delete them by asking you permission.if you are sure about what you do and you really want to embed it in some python code:Watch out: by putting rm -f the files will be deleted without asking your confirmation 
You can try glob solutionFor example,these are files in folderMy codeYou will getI forgot to add remove solutionOnly two files will stay
