I have three threads : main, t1, t2. t1 and t2 are spawned from main. There is a while loop in t2 in which some processing is happening. t2 consumes a bool variable set by t1. I want that the control to exit the while loop in t2 as soon as t1 sets the bool variable to true.t1:t2:I am checking for q.get() in t2 but that is not solving the problem as I want the control to skip the rest of the lines in the loop if lets say the value of 'flag' is set to true by t1 somewhere when control in t2 is  inside the while loop.Is there a way to achieve this? 
You can use Event Objects from threading.You'll need to set an event object in your main method and use it as argument:And your threading logic should be something like thist1t2Here's another real, non-pseudo examplenot flag yet  not flag yet  not flag yet  GOT FLAG !Hope that's helpful and clear.
