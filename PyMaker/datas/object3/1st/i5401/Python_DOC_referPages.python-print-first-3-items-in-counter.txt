Below is my counter, how do I only print the first 3 I have tried doing that however it becomes an errorI just want to print
A Counter() representation shows the contents in sorted order from most to least common (so highest to lowest count). Use the Counter.most_common() method to get the top N key-value pairs in the same ordering:If you wanted a regular dictionary with just those top N elements, pass the output of Counter.most_common() to dict():Just take into account that prior to Python 3.6, dictionaries do not retain order and so the exact output order may differ, but it will contain the top 3 results.Demo:The Counter.__repr__ representation method uses the same Counter.most_common() method to produce the output order you see.
