I have a simple list that I am splitting and concatenating. My code uses for loop and if condition and ugly. Can you suggest a better way using list comprehension?My codeI am getting the below result and exactly the way i want    ['10.10.10.1','10.10.10.2','10.10.10.3','10.10.10.4','10.10.10.5','10.10.10.6']
I agree with @juanpa.arrivillaga. However hope we can avoid that second looping since he is checking for empty values returning while splitting

Not a comprehension, but good anyway, I think.
You can first just split each string on ',':Then if you want to flatten it, you can use itertools.chain.from_iterable:
