So I feel like I could make my code drastically shorted if I update the name of the empty list, but I'm not sure I how do this? Here's what it would look regularly. The purpose of the program is to sort by range.I would copy and paste the for loop for each list. This is fine until I get larger lists, and code is here to save that time!So if I could make the list name update each time I could solve this easily. Here's what I got so far. With the same 'x' list as aboveTheoretically that would be all the code I need (in addition to the lines needed to update the name of the lists ofcourse). Is this possible? I'm still a little new to programming so if I messed up anywhere or if you have ways to make this even better, let me know! 
Build a dictionary and then you can get it's values as you want
Now your lists variable is a dictionary that maps (min, max) pairs to a list of values in that range:Of course you don't need both the lower and upper bounds in the key - you could store them just by lower bound since you know how wide the ranges are:    import collections
If you want to use dict this is one of the solutions:Now you can use solution['list_1020'] to get data you need.
You could always use itertools.groupby() to group the sorted numbers by their lower range:Which Outputs:Then you could insert these lists into a dictionary:Or even a one-liner:
Perhaps you could simply use Python Dictionary since you need to have named containers with names like: list_1020, list_2030, etc. Plus, this gives you some kind of space since it would be dynamically generated as Dictionary Keys. Here's what this idea could look like in Code:As a reusable Function:
You can do something like this by finding distance of int from 10,20,30output:
