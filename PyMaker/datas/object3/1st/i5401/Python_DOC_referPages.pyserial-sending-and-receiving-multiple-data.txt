Natural Text
I have a question about sending and receiving multiple data using the pySerial Python library. According to what I understand, serial port communication works with byte variables.How do I send four different variables with method write and then with method read receive two different variables?As an example:What should I do to send the four variables with write differentiated by some character and then separate them for the respective use of each variable? (applying the same for the two variables received with read) Also, what can I do to send the variables asfloat and not generate conflict with the reading in byte?
If you are transporting text, the easies way is to pick some character to separate individual strings, it can be \n(newline), comma or anything.  Reading of text in python will be like this:On arduino, you will read the string like this(primitive example):Or if you don't mind using strings on Arduino(you most likely don't), you might be better of using readStringUntil function:In python, you can even convert numerical values into text: On Arduino side, you can receive numbers as a string like this:If you need to transport structured binary data, python has a module called struct, that is the recomended way to do it in python. On arduino side, you will most likely have to shuffle bytes manualy. For example, int16 would be received like this:
Using mutex(Lock) in threading library for avoiding send/receive conflict, such as following code:
