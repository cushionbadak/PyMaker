The below block of code works however I'm not satisfied that it is very optimal due to my limited understanding of using JSON but I can't seem to figure out a more efficient method.The steam_game_db is like this:and my Python code so far isInstead  of looping through the entire app list is there a smarter way to perhaps search for it? Ideally the elements in the data structure with 'appid' and 'name' were numbered the same as their corresponding 'appid'i.e.appid 570 in the list is Dota2However element 570 in the data structure in appid 5069 and Red FactionAlso what type of data structure is this? Perhaps it has limited my searching ability for this answer already. (I.e. seems like a dictionary of 'appid' and 'element' to me for each element?)EDIT: Changed to a for loop as suggested
The most convenient way to access things by a key (like the app ID here) is to use a dictionary. You pay a little extra performance cost up-front to fill the dictionary, but after that pulling out values by ID is basically free.However, it's a trade-off. If you only want to do a single look-up during the life-time of your Python program, then paying that extra performance cost to build the dictionary won't be beneficial, compared to a simple loop like you already did. But if you want to do multiple look-ups, it will be beneficial. Also think about caching the JSON file on disk. This will save time during your program's startup.
It's better to have the JSON file on disk, you can directly dump it into a dictionary and start building up your lookup table. As an example I've tried to maintain your logic while using the dict for lookups. Don't forget to encode the JSON it has special characters in it.Setup:Usage 1:That's the way you have used itUsage 2: That's how you can query a key, using getinstead of [] will prevent a KeyError exception if the appid isn't recorded.
