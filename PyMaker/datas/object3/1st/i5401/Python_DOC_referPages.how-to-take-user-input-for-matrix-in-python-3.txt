Natural Text
I wrote the whole code, just in the place of x and y, this has to take input from user:
Since you already know the shape of matrix and only need two elements, you can input them individually.You have to typecast accordingly, if they are integers.
You can take the input value from the user in python as ,similarly for y ,But this takes the value of x & y as string . so if you want to take the input in integer you must typecast the input as,similarly for y ,
Why not do something like this :-Where (x,y) is the shape of the matrix, needed to be initiated before this.
