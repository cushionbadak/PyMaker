I have a CSV that I am working with in Python REGEX. I need to extract values in the final field of the CSV, but I am having trouble with it in regex101.com (fantastic page, by the way).A couple of example rows:I need to capture the final "MEMO" field on the end with this regex:What I am getting is:It doesn't seem much, but how can I get the regex to trim the trailing spaces in the CompanyName, so that I get the following instead, please?Thanks in advance,QuietLeni
Change your regex to:Adding \S basically means that after the last non-whitespace character there have to be no more whitespaces.
One approach might be using a lookahead to "short-circuit" a wildcard (non-greedy), like so:whole pattern:(Depends on the possibilities inherent in your data of course, here I'm assuming that the company name can't end with an isolated number)https://regex101.com/r/reT66g/1/
Unless I am missing something, just adding a question mark to this thing should do it (?P<CompanyName>[^\s].*) (making the quantifier non-greedy)e.g. (?P<CompanyName>[^\s].*) -> (?P<CompanyName>[^\s].*?)
Just to put my two cents in - you could useSee a demo on regex101.com.
