Natural Text
My code is:I want to print the results in a text file but I get this error:
file should be a file object, not a file name. File objects have write method, str objects don't.From the doc on print:The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it  is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used.Also note that the file should be open for writing:See more about the open function here.
