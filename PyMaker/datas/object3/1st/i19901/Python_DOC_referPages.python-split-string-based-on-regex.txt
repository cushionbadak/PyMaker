What is the best way to split a string like "HELLO there HOW are YOU" by upper case words (in Python)? So I'd end up with an array like such: results = ['HELLO there', 'HOW are', 'YOU']EDIT: I have tried: It doesn't seem to work, though.
I suggestCheck this demo.
You could use a lookahead:This will split at every space that is followed by a string of upper-case letters which end in a word-boundary.Note that the square brackets are only for readability and could as well be omitted.If it is enough that the first letter of a word is upper case (so if you would want to split in front of Hello as well) it gets even easier:Now this splits at every space followed by any upper-case letter.
You don't need split, but rather findall:
