I have this much already i just don't understand how to make it read an unspecified number.
For "read on unspecified number of scores", maybe you want a loop and the user hits ctrl+D to stop?  You can do this by catching EOFError from input().Output:As mentioned, eval is dangerous and you should avoid it.  DO NOT ATTEMPT THE FOLLOWING:
Your question is awkwardly phrased, but I think by 'read an unspecified number' what you are looking for is generating a random value - in which case, you want random.randint().Also note that you don't need to do so many loops to achieve what you are trying to do. If you are looping over a range of indices in python rather than looping over the list itself, you are doing something wrong. In this case, it's far easier to use the built in sum() function.Here I have also used list comprehensions and generator expressions, which are useful for these kind of operations.Alongside this, eval() is a really bad way to get a number from a string. Use int(some_string) instead.
You need to clarify what you mean by unspecified. If you want it to be user determined, you can pass it in as an argument, egor with an actual argument parsing package like argparse. Or you can prompt the user for a number of scores before reading in the scores. @Lattyware has a great answer for the random case.
