If i want to convert the string 'ABCD' to a list ['A','B','C','D'] what could be the simplest way?
Simplest one I can think of:Ref:Python 2 Built-in Functions: list([iterable])Python 3 Built-in Types: class list([iterable])
Depending on your use case, you may not even have to do that - a string is already iterable:prints
