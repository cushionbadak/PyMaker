Natural Text
I have a set of data, but I need to work only with utf-8 data, so I need to delete all data with non-utf-8 symbols.When I try to work with these files, I receive:My code I recive error here yield[file_name,body.read()] and  herelist_of_emails = mailsrch.findall(text), but when I work with utf-8 all great.
I suspect you want to use the errors='ignore' argument on bytes.decode.  See http://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-howto and http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode .for more info.Edit:Here's an example showing a good way to do this:Using os.path.join, you can eliminate your add_slash method, and ensure that it works cross-platform.
