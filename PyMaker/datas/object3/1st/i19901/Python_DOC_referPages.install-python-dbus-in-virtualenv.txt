I am running an application in a virtual environment that needs access to DBus (to interact with the Network Manager, mainly).I tried to install Dbus-Python with easyinstall and pip, but both fail. When I try to do this:Pip yells at me with:I've had some issues with the python dbus bindings and their "accessibility" from my Python modules in the past, so I don't really know what may be the best way to set Dbus-Python in a virtual environment. Has anyone successfully achieved this? Or does anyone have an idea on how to do this?Thank you in advance.
When pip tries to install a package, it looks for setup.py, which dbus-python doesn't have, so you'll have to download the source and compile it manually. Shouldn't be too hard:then you can move the compiled files to your virtualenv.edit: starting with dbus-python-1.2.2 (released 2016-02-22) dbus-python has a setup.py, so pip should be able to install it
My suggestion is to install the system package for the Python DBUS bindings and then create the virtualenv with the --system-site-packages command line option to enable access to the system-wide Python packages (including the dbus package) from the activated virtualenv. For example on Debian/Ubuntu (or a derived distribution):To use the built in Python 3 venv module instead of virtualenv:
Another workaround is to just manually copy the dbus files/libraries directly to your virtualenv:
The OP appears to have opened a ticket on freedesktop.org for this, which remains open; however there is a patch attached to that ticket that could be applied to most any version of python-dbus and then repackaged as a new tarball.
@TheMeaningfulEngineer thank so much, i have being having a few problem to install dbus through pip and that was what i needed i hope you have a good day wherever you are ;)to check if there is in local - sudo apt list --installed | grep pakage-namesudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev libdbus-1-devand after this line i did install dbus and networkmanager without any errorsthis is exactly what i did, and before that i checked out all my dbus version and networkmanager after do what  @TheMeaningfulEngineer said is working, if i am doing something wrong in this comment try to explaind me what or why  , and so sorry for my english. 
Go to your Venv follow this 2 steps :verify with:if installed properly you will see:     dbus-python==1.2.8
For Python as dbus-python is now obsolete, you should be using pydbus:This have worked for me.
