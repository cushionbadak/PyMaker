So, what i am trying to do is LS Mimic in Python code.I have completed most of the commands, but i have one thing that i cant find the solutionSo, if the ls command gets this command line,ls test1It should find the test1 directory and then do the ls in that directory.However, since I can only find ways of creating arguments that needs a keyword before the actual usage, I cant find the way of doing this..it cant be something like this ls -move_dir test1it is fine if for the program to think if there is no command, it will treat as above way.( it will find that directory and run ls ) Please help me !!
