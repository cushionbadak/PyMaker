map itself does not directly provide a way to do that.  However, you can do it by using functools.partial to pre-specify the static argument:However, as @jamylak suggested in a comment, there's little reason to do this.  If you don't want to store the result, just do a regular for loop:
You're looking for functools.partial, which is used to implement partial application:Note that in many cases, a list comprehension or generator expression is more readable:
You shouldn't use map() for this but a list comprehension:Another option would be a lambda. But don't do that:
