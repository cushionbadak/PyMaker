I need to read in a file of sets of coordinates using Python. The first line will have a number, n, which is the number of coordinate sets that need to be read. Following the first line will be n lines, where each line contains a single coordinate pair. Example (in this case, n =4): The catch is that there will be multiple sections in the file. So the first n might be 10, with 10 sets of coordinates, and the next n might be 20, with 20 sets of coordinates following it.As of right now I'm just reading the sections of coordinates in separately, but I would like it if I could any number of sections of coordinates in the file I'm reading in.
You can use open() to open a file for reading, readline() to read file content line by line, and int() to convert from a string to an integer.Here's an example implementation using these parts:
Look into using generators. You could read the first line via the generator and then it will tell how many lines to yield, until the next read:
If I understand you correctly, you are currently reading in different files with the leading n value followed by the n-number of coordinates. But, you want to do this with a single file.What you could do is create a nested list, and append a list of coords to a main list, based off of your formatting.Note: that you may still have to convert these '(x,y)'s
