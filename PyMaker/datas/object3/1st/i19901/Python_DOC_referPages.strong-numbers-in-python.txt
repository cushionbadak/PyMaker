A number is strong number if the sum of the factorials of the individual digits is equal to the number itself.For example: 145 = 1! + 4! +5!I wrote the following code in python for this:but the interpreter never returns??What is wrong with this code?
Your reduce input is wrong, the you shouldn't compute the factorial of p. In fact, it is easier to just use sum:The functools.reduce function can be  considered as:So, for instance, if x == 145, then your reduce part will computeThe interpreter doesn't finish likely because of needing to compute the factorial of an extremely large number (consider (2 Ã— 9!)!...)If you still need to keep the reduce, you should change it to:
What is Strong number?Strong number are those numbers whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the original number.For example:145 is strong number. Since, 1! + 4! + 5! = 145
You are not properly decomposing the number into its component digits. You need reduce to operate the lambda over a list of integers, and str(x) does not produce a list of integers.
