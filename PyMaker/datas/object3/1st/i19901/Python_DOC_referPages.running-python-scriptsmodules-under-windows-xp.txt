Problem is with running Python scripts(modules) under Windows XP. Yesterday I installed Python 3.3.0 version for Windows. The problem is that I CAN use command line and IDLE to calculate (it works without errors in output), but if I try simple print "Hello." , output in command prompt, and in GUI IDLE shows me:Path variable is set to default directory "C:\Python33\", and again I can use it for calculation, but running examples from online resources or that simple stuff is currently for me impossible. 
you need to use something like print("hello") in python 3.xprint has been converted to a function in python 3.x. read this :`Print is a function
