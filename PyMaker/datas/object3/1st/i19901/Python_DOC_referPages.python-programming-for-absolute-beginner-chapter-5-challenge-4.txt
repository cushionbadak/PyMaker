Challenge is to improve a previous challenge, "Who's Your Daddy" (see my successful code: http://pastebin.com/AU2aRWHk) by adding a choice that let's the user enter a name and get back a grandfather. Program should still only use one dictionary of son-father pairs.I cannot get this to work. My entire code so far can be seen at: http://pastebin.com/33KrEMhTI've obviously made this WAY more difficult than it need to be and am now trapped in a world of complexity. Here's code I've F'd up:After choosing "2", my output:Obviously temporarily trapped in a small loop and it doesn't work. All other code works as expected. Help!
You loop over each entry in the dict, and match the value, and if it doesn't match, then for each key-value pair you print that it doesn't match.It is the equivalent of the following simplified loop:Use the else: clause of the for loop instead, it'll only be invoked if you completed going through all the values; use a break if you find a match:A small demonstration of how the else: clause works when used with a for loop:In the first example, we broke out of the loop with a break, but in the second example we never reached the break statement (i never was equal to 5) so the else: clause is reached and Through is printed.
