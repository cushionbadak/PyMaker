I have a sample doctest like this one.When I execute this code, I got this error.This error is caused by accessing 'f' which was not accessible when testing hello() method.Is there any way to share the object which is created before? Without it, one need to create object all the time when it's necessary.
You can use testmod(extraglobs={'f': initFileGenerator('')}) to define a reusable object globally.As the doctest doc says, extraglobs gives a dict merged into the globals used to execute examples. This works like dict.update()But I used to test all methods in __doc__ of class before all methods.
To obtain literate modules with tests that all use a shared execution context (i.e. individual tests that can share and re-use results), one has to look at the relevant part of documentation on the execution context, which says:... each time doctest finds a docstring to test, it uses a shallow copy of M‘s globals, so that running tests doesn’t change the module’s real globals, and so that one test in M can’t leave behind crumbs that accidentally allow another test to work. ...You can force use of your own dict as the execution context by passing globs=your_dict to testmod() or testfile() instead.Given this, I managed to reverse-engineer from doctest module that besides using copies (i.e. the dict's copy() method), it also clears the globals dict (using clear()) after each test.Thus, one can patch their own globals dictionary with something like:and then use it as:
