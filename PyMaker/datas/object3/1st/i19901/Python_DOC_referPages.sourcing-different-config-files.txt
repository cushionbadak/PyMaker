I need to read a certain path from three different possible places in two config files:A global one, /etc/program.confA local one, ~/.config/program/configThe local one has a [DEFAULT] section and may or may not have a per case specific section, say [case]. I'd like toRead the path given by the case-specific section of the local configAbsent that, read the path given by the default section of the local configAbsent that, read the path given by the global configAbsent that (!), provide a default pathI'm using configparser in Python. This is actually not a difficult problem, but the solution I've come up with strikes me as inelegant and clunky. As this is, I think, a fairly common situation, I thought I'd ask more experienced programmers for better solutions. The code I have is this:How may I improve this? What's the usual way of sourcing different config files?
configparser seems to provide support for what you're trying to implement, specifically multiple config files and a DEFAULT section.Does this do what you want?The only difference I see is that will allow (and consult) a DEFAULT section in the global config file (which seems desirable).
