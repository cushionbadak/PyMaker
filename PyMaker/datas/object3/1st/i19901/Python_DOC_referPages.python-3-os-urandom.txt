If you just need a random integer, you can use random.randint(a, b) from the random module.If you need it for crypto purposes, use random.SystemRandom().randint(a, b), which makes use of os.urandom().Example
Might not exactly be on topic, but I want to help those coming here from a search engine. To convert os.urandom to an integer I'm using this:Note: The range of the index here is up to that of a 4-byte integer. If you want more, change the 4 to a greater value.The idea was taken from here: https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/generate-a-192-bit-random-number/
