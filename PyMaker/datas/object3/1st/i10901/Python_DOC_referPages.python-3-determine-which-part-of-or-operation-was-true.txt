I have a functioning piece of code that suits my purposes but I wasn't sure if there was a better way to meet the end I am looking for. Here is my code : What this is doing is looking for one of two images and then clicking on whichever ends up being true. Is there any method or function I can use that can determine which of the conditions around the "or" returned true without running a subsequent set of "if" operations? Even if the answer is "No, you need the if statements" I'd appreciate it so I am not going on a wild goose chase for no reason.Thank you for your time!
I'd probably do something like this. You create an infinite loop that repeatedly tries one image, then the other, breaking once one of them suceeds.If you prefer a while loop to a for loop,Or, you can do more with itertools to avoid an explicit loop altogether.(I'm mildly surprised you can't use None as the predicate to dropwhile, similar to how you can with filterfalse.)Update: actually, since filter and map already return iterators in Python 3, there's no need to use dropwhile and imap:Bonus content!To take the functional approach to an extreme, you could write the following in coconut:
A v2.7 example of @tobias_k's comment to your question.  In Boolean Operations, the value of the True espresion is returned.In this example, c1 is assigned to current_image because it evaluates to True and its name is printed.
