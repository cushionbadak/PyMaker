Say now my working folder is . and my supporting python files are in ./supporting_files/, I want to call a function func in the a.py file under ./supporting_files/, what should I do? I tried calling from supporting_files.a import func and that does not work. How am I suppose to do that without changing the actual working directory?
Add an __init__.py file (it can be empty) to the supporting_files directory, and python will treat it as a package available for imports. More details are available in the Python documentation.
There are two ways you can do that I'm aware of.Wrong wayRight wayThen
