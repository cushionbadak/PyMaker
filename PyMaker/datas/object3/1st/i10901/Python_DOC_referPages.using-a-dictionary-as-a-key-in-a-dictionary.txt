Is there any way to use a dictionary as the key in a dictionary. Currently I am using two lists for this but it would be nice to use a dictionary. Here is what I currently am doing:Here is what I want:But this does not work and I'm not sure if there's any way around this.
As other answers have noted you can't use dictionaries as keys since keys need to be immutable. What you can do though is to turn a dictionary to a frozenset of (key, value) tuples which you can use as a key. This way you wouldn't have to worry about sorting and it would be more efficient as well:Output:
A dictionary key has to be immutable. A dictionary is mutable, and hence can't be used as a dictionary key. https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#why-must-dictionary-keys-be-immutableIf you can guarantee that the dictionary items are also going to be immutable (ie. strings, tuples, etc), you could do this:Essentially, we are converting each dictionary into a tuple, sorting the (key,value) pairs to ensure a consistent ordering within the tuple. We then use this tuple as the key to your dictionary.
I guess this will help you
