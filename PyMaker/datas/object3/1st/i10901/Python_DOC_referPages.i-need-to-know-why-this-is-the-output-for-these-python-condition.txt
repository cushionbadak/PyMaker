Why is 1, 64, 343 the answer?
This is equivalent to the code:You are checking if the remainder obtained when the cube of a number from 1 to 10 is divided by 3 is equal to 1. If it is, you are adding it to a list and printing it.
The meaning of **  ex: 2**3= 2*2*2 #this means 2 to the power 3 = 8The meaning of %  ex: 5%2= 1 #the sign means module, that means the remaining value after divide 5 by 2, it is one.in your way, the correct path to write the for each is so the result is :bit explanation inside the for loopfirst get the i = 0, at this point value = 0*0*0 = 0, then value%3=0then get the i=1, at this point value = 1*1*1 = 1 ,the 'value%3' means 1%3 = 1, so the answer i 1.... like this see about other conditions also. hope this will help to you.
first i is in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]then if (i*i*i) rem 3 is equal to 1it selects (i*i*i)and for [1,4,7]:  (1*1*1)%3==1, (4*4*4)%3==1 and (7*7*7)%3==1:1*1*1=1 and 1/3=0 :remainder=14*4*4=64 and 64/3=21 :remainder=17*7*7=343 and 343/3=114 :remainder=1 so the output is:[1*1*1, 4*4*4, 7*7*7] which is  [1, 64, 343]your code:  and this code:  output this:
