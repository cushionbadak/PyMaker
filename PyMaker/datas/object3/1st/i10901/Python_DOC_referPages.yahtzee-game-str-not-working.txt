I realize I've been pretty much spamming this forum lately, I'm just trying to break my problems down since I'm supposed to create a yahtzee game for assignment. My code is currently looking like this:My goal is that its gonna look something like this: https://gyazo.com/26f997ed05c92898d93adaf0af57d024If you look at my method "welcome", I do want to print my self.spelarlista, just to see how its gonna look, but all I get is "Player object at 0x7fac824....", I realize something is wrong with my str, how should I change it? 
If you are getting Player object at 0x7fac824 or anything similar, it seems that you are calling the repr on the object (indirectly), which in turn calls the object's __repr__ method.Since there is no __str__ method defined, __str__ will also default to calling __repr__.__repr__ returns a string representation of the object (usually one that can be converted back to the object, but that's just a convention) which is what you need.
When you print a list of objects python doesn't call the objects __str__ method but the container list. If you want to print them all you can call the __str__ method by applying the built-in function str() on them using map() or a list comprehension and join them with str.join() method.Or as another alternative approach you can define a __repr__ attribute for your objects, which returns the official string representation of an object:
