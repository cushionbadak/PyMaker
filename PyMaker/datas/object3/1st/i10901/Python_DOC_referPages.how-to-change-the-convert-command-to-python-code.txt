I'm using Imagemagick for image enhancement in my project. As I'm a newbie to Imagemagick, I have started it with using command line argument for this package. For further processing, I need to change the below command into python code.I think it is possible using wand package. But is it possible to convert all the arguments using in the above command. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks
You can use os.system() to run terminal commands from Python.If you want to use the paths dynamically, you can also use the .format() method:
Another option is Wand, an ImageMagick binding for python to convert the command mentioned above. Please refer the below link for more details:wand docs
