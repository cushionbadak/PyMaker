I wish to compress a given string with a pre-existing header retrieved from an already compressed file in an archive (a local file header). I have attempted to look at zlib and while their compression/decompressing works nicely I can not find an option to set the compression header. I want to avoid  decompressing a file, add a string to the file, and then re-compress the file. Instead I simply want to "append" a given string to a given compressed file.I have made attempts using the existing Zipfile module in Python, here I have tried to modify the Zipfile module to deal with a pre-set header, however from this I can conclude that the Zipfile module relies too heavily on the zlib library for this to be possible. While my attempts have been in Python I am happy using any programming language.
What you want to do is more complicated than you think. However the code has already been written. Look at gzlog.h and gzlog.c in the examples directory of the zlib distribution.
