Natural Text
I have a particular problem with json files. The following code reads json, and writes to a txt file. I have shortened the code for readability, in my real code it is hundereds of fields and write statements.The problem is, sometimes a field is not in json, and it produces a KeyErrorWhile I can trap this with a try: except KeyError. It would mean that I need to put this try around every field in my writefile function.Is there a way that without changing the f.write() statements, that upon KeyError it will write an empty string ? (so I do not have to capture this in hundereds of try blocks)So this is a dictionary problem, I have no problem with the json itself. I cannot control which fields are in my input, so one file may have field1 and field2. The next could have all three, or only one. The json part works, just that I will be missing some fields, sometimes. 
Use dict.get:get() returns the value for key, or given default or None.
More simpler is str.join with dict.values.f.write(' '.join(d.values())) or if values are not strings use genexps likef.write(' '.join(str(value) for value in d.values()))
