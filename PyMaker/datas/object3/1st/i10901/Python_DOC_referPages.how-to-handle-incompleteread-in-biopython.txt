I am trying to fetch fasta sequence for accession numbers from NCBI using Biopython module. Usually the sequences were successfully downloaded. But once in a while i get the below errorhttp.client.IncompleteRead: IncompleteRead(61808640 bytes read)I have searched the answers How to handle IncompleteRead: in pythonI have tried top answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/14442358/4037275. It is working. However, the problem is, it downloads partial sequences. Are there any other way. Can any one point me in right direction.Thank you for your time.
You will need to add a try/except to catch common network errors like this. Note that exception httplib.IncompleteRead is a subclass of the more general HTTPException, see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.IncompleteReade.g. http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython/2011-October/013735.htmlSee also https://github.com/biopython/biopython/pull/590 would catch some of the other errors you can get with the NCBI Entrez API (errors the NCBI ought to deal with but don't).
