I have the following Python code that has 1 command line optional parameter (c) that has an argument and 2 options (a and b) that do not have an argument:When I enter python readwritestore.py -a I get:This is what I was hoping for if the commandline argument is -a. However, if I enter python readwritestore.py -a csvfile_name, then I get:This is not what I intended for. In this function, c is the only option that rquires an argument. If I enter a with an argument,the code should give the error message that I set upThis does not happen for a or b. It is allowing the argument to be entered without raising an error.If the options that do not require an argument are entered with an argument, then I would like it to raise an error. python readwritestore.py -a textand python readwritestore.py -b text should raise the error Error in usage - a does not require an argument.Is there a way to specify this? Is getopt() the correct way to do this?Additional Information:I only want python readwritestore.py -c text to work with the argument. For the other 2 options, a and b, the code should raise the error.
checking the size of sys.argv (the list of argument supplied when calling the script) can help you checking that : I know it's not what you asked (argparse) but here is how you could do it with argparse :It will raise an error is to many argument are supplied. (also python readwritestore.py -h will display the help just like man in unix)
