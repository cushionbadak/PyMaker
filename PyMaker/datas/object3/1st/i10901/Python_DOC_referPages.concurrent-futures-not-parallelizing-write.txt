I have a list dataframe_chunk which contains chunks of a very large pandas dataframe.I would like to write every single chunk into a different csv, and to do so in parallel. However, I see the files being written sequentially and I'm not sure why this is the case. Here's the code:Any clues?
One thing that is stated in the Python 2.7.x threading docs but not in the 3.x docs is that Python cannot achieve true parallelism using the threading library - only one thread will execute at a time.You should try using concurrent.futures with the ProcessPoolExecutor which uses separate processes for each job and therefore can achieve true parallelism on a multi-core CPU.UpdateHere is your program adapted to use the multiprocessing library instead:You can monitor the jobs with this shell command in another window:(Replace 12345 with the pid emitted by the script.)
