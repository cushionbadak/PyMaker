I am trying to perform a binary search on a list in python. List is created using command line arguments. User inputs the number he wants to look for in the array and he is returned the index of the element. For some reason, the program only outputs 1 and None. Code is below.Any help is extremely appreciated. 
Well, there are some little mistakes in your code. To find them, you should either use a debugger, or at least add traces to understand what happens. Here is your original code with traces that make the problems self evident:You can immediately see that:you search in a sub array that skips avg-1 when you are below avgas you search in a sub array you will get the index in that subarrayThe fixes are now trivial:That's not all, when you end the loop with min == max, you do not return anything (meaning you return None). And last but not least never use a name from the standard Python library for your own variables.So here is the fixed code:
In Python2 and Python3 you can use bisect as written in the comments.Replace your search with the followingAlso, the AS SortedCollection (Python recipe) could be useful.The following code (from here) performs the binary search and returns position and if the item was found at all.Will return (2, True) if used in the example above.
The reason you aren't getting correct result is because in every recursive call your code is sending sliced array. So the array length keeps reducing. Ideally you should work out a way to send original array and work with only start, end indices.
@Serge Ballesta 's solution is undoubtly the correct answer to this question.I am just going to add another way of solving this:
