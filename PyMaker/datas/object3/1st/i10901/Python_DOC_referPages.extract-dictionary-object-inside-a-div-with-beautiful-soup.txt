I have the following sample: I would like to extract :the href link the dictionary "data-option".What is the best way to do this? Moreover, let's say that I only wanted to extract specific keys from the "data-option" dictionary, how would I do that?Many thanks in advance.
The idea would be to iterate over the links, get the href attribute values, then find the inner option list items and use json.loads() to load the data-option value into the python dictionary:Prints (printing href values and option ids for demonstration purposes):
