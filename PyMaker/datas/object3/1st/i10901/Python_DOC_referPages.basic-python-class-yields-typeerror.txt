I'm fairly new to Python. Here, I'm creating a class to represent a blob-like structure. However, my code yields the following error:TypeError: add() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were givenWhat am I doing wrong here, and how am I giving 4 inputs, when I supply 3?Note: The error results from the "test1.add(0, 0, 12)" line.
Your instance methods are missing the self reference:The first parameter passed by an instance method is a reference to that instance of the class. So your add method should take 4 arguments but you will only be required to pass 3 when the method is called from an instance of the class. Python passes the reference to that instance for you.More so, you are referencing your attributes from the class itself as Blob.some_attribute, you should instead use self:This modifies those attributes only on that instance of the class which is what you intend with __init__. The same should apply to the other methods.
in a class, the first argument of a function is self. When in your main, you call test1.add(0, 0, 12), python call test1.add(test1,0, 0, 12), so now he has 4 argument.
The first argument to a Python class method needs to be self i.e. def add(self, x, y, newCorrel): instead of def add(x, y, newCorrel):.Self is implicitly passed to class instance methods when they are called, hence why 4 arguments are being passed instead of just the 3 you explicitly pass.N.B. Non-instance methods (static methods) don't require self as their first parameter. See here for more details.
