I'm struggling to align some data after iterating it through a for loop. I'd like to have each for loop output a separate column but failing to figure out how to accomplish this. I've tried ending with end='' for new lines but does not bring the next column back top.  Can you please help?  Below is a testable example of the code I am trying to build. Your help is well appreciated.Current Output:Desired Output:
Learn to use the .format method (of a format string). You can specify field length, left/centre/right justification, decimal places and/or leading zeros of numeric values, and much more. https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspecAn exampleQuite a bit going on there. fs is a format string. {...} in a format string mark items to format. Inside the braces the thing before the : identifies what to format and the stuff after, how to format it. 0[0] and 0[1] are the first and second elements of the first (here only) argument of the .format method (which has to be subscript-able). >10s means right-justify a string in a field-width of 10. 6d means decimal integer in a field width of 6. Finally '    '.join( [ fs.format(kv) for kv in kvp ] ) creates a list of formatted elements of kvp (i.e. strings) and concatenates them all with four spaces between them (but no four leading or trailing spaces).(Yes, this is a partial answer. Someone else can answer putting the right entities in the right order to format into the desired lines of output, if I mis-interpreted "align" in the question)
