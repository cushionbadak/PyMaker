Python's for loop accepts three arguments in the range of the for loop. How could I manipulate the third argument to be a factor?Now I realize this will go up 2 every time, but how would I make it to where the first value is going to be multiplied by factor_of each time and that is stored in the i value?The desired affect would be (assuming first_value is set to 10) And yes, I know this makes more sense in a while loop.
I would use a while loop as suggested by @Delgan. Nevertheless, if you still prefer to employ a for loop, here's the solution I came up with*:my_func returns the desired list. The ith element of the list comprehension is computed as first*factor**i, where the index i varies from 0 to n - 1, being n the smallest integer number that satisfies:Demo:As a final note it is worth pointing out that this approach could be affected by the round off errors associated to floating point arithmetic.* I'm assuming you use Python 3. To get the code working in Python 2 an additional import sentence is needed to avoid integer division errors: from __future__ import division
You cannot do such a thing using the built-in range(). However, you can define your own generator, like this:
