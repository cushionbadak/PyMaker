i'm having this "issue" (for lack of better word), whenever i run my python script with arguments, i can't use the tab completion function of Unix consoles. For example when i want to put a file in the script execution.Hope this examples illustrate better my issue.Case 1Case 2Ideal caseHope i made myself clear, and someone can explain this to me, i'm guessing python won't allow this, or needs to be configured in someway.I'm using argparse in my script with the usual code..I've already tried with type=argparse.FileType('r') but is the same.I want to achieve this because of the files i'm currently working have long names, and it was requested to not write the files names every time.Anyway, thanks for reading.
Ok, for a work around this. Using python 3.5 i can achieve what i wanted, autocomplete name of files in bash when executing a python script.so withand with python 3.5this pages lead me to some valueable answers too.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.htmlhttps://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Thanks again.
