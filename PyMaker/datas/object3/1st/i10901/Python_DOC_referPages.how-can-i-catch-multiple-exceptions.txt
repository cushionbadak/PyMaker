This question already has an answer here:Catch multiple exceptions in one line (except block)                    7 answers                I'm usually fairly good at catching exceptions but this group has me perplexed.  Here is the code I'm working with (it uses pywinrm):Here is the current word vomit of errors I'm receiving:As you can see in my current code, I tried catching the socket.timeout first.  I also tried changing it to except Exception as e, thinking a catch all would even be better than what I currently have, but that failed as well.  I tried editing transport.py to add an exception for requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout, but this isn't catching it either.  Is there something special that needs to be done since its multiple exceptions occurring?
You can add as many different exceptions as you want:Or if you want to catch all exceptions, since all exceptions are subclasses of the Exception class, you can do this:Of course, the first approach is generally considered to be better - you might be catching NameErrors or other silly mistakes with the other format.
To answer your first question: How to catch multiple exceptions?You can simply nest exceptions like so:(From the python documentation. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions)First if there is no 'myfile.txt' The first exception will be thrown. It will look like: IOError [Errno2] No such file or directory: 'myfile.txt'Then if there is such a file but no content then the second exception will be thrown and etc..However to help you with your second problem of socket.timeout error not being thrown, it looks like you should change your exception to be of type socket.timeoutSo changing your code to:That should solve your problem.
