For example:I want to do:I have tried using the operator.div function but it doesn't seem to give the correct result. By the way, I am fairly new to python.
You can use reduce. Apply function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of sequence, from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.The code can be demonstrated as which is equivalent toAs truediv has already been demonstrated by the other answer, this is an alternative (the other way is preferred) for Python2
You can use reduce() and operator.truediv:Note: In python3.x you need to import the reduce() function from from functools module.
Why not just use a loop?
