Pandas uses numpy's datetime dtypes called datetime64 which is different from the datetime types in python's standard library module datetime.  When you are accessing df_tradeDate['date'].dt.date, pandas returns a datetime.date object back which is a generic object in pandas world. Hence you see the dtype difference. Note that while numpy has units such as datetime64[D] to represent dates, pandas converts all such units to nanoseconds. Hence the only posible datetime dtype in pandas is datetime64[ns]. This does not really lead to any issues in practice.
