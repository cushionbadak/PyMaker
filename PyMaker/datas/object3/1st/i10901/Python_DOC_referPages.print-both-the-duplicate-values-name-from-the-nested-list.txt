I'm trying to solve a task and i'm new in python.I am not getting what i want can anyone explain me how one can do it 
One option would be to group the values into a defaultdict(list):
I would do it like that:Explain:I grab an object from the original list students. Object is i_x and its ['Ash', 85.25] on the first iteration for example.Then i slice the list students[:i] + students[i + 1:] to create another one in memory that contains all the elements of the original one apart from i_xI check to see if there is any item in the newly created list that has the same [1] index value as that of i_x. If yes, i append the i_x[0] value to a third list that holds the results.I do this for as many elements as there are originally in the students list.Can anybody provide a list comprehension for the above?
