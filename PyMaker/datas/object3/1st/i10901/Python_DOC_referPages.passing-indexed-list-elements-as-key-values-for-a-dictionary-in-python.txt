I am new to python, and am trying to make use of string.format() to pass indexed elements of a list as the key values for my dictionary. This will then be used in a request.To be more specific, the overarching idea for this is that the input for the list will be chosen/spoken by the client. This list, which will vary with spoken utterance, will then have it's elements passed to fill parameters for a request.get. This gets information that it will then send to a database, so it needs to be flexible; this is why I do not want the passed string elements to be explicitly specified, and would rather use their indexed placements in the list. I include this because there might be a way other than with requests that I could do this, but I'm just not sure how. Here is what my code looks like:Because I know where the issue lies, I've tried inputting print(intent) underneath intent to get a look at what's going on but that doesn't help; I get nothing upon execution. Is there an easier (and legal) way to do this?
Your intent is a dictionary which doesn't have a format method. What you want to do instead, is format every value in that dictionary to map to the right query field. Try this instead:As a matter of fact this could be further simplified with zip:Where the order of keys ['string1', 'string2', 'RelString'] must correspond to the order of values inside query.
If I understand your question correctly . The following should be the desired output value for "intent" after formatting:You can actually convert dictionary into string  and then back to Dictionary through tuples as I did edit your "intent" dictionary to match the formatting results.
