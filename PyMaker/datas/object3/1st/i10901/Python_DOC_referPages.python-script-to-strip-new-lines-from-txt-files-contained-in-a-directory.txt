Natural Text
I have a list of .txt files contained in a directory. Each file may have multiple lines. What could be the Python script to strip off all newlines from all the files contained in that directory? The resulting files should have exactly one line containing all the texts.
Use glob.glob() to find the files of interest, i.e. those that end with .txt. glob() returns a list of matching filenames and also leaves the path intact, so you don't need to change directories.Process the files in place with fileinput.input():If you are using Python 2 it might be worth passing mode='U' to fileinput.input() to ensure that universal newline processing is enabled, as is the default for Python 3. With that enabled you can be sure that \n will match newlines regardless of the platform on which your code runs.
This will also create a backup of all files it edited, just in case.If you don't want the backup remove , backup=".bak" from the 7th.
