I see two ways to specify timeouts in concurrent.futures.as_completed()wait()Both methods handle N running futures.I would like to specify an individual timeout for each future.Use Case:Future for getting data from DB has a timeout of 0.5 secs.Future for getting data from a HTTP server has a timeout of 1.2 secs.How do I handle this with concurrent.futures? Or is this library not the right tool?ConclusionAFAIK the solution by mdurant is a good work-around. I think I will use a different library the next time. Maybe asyncio has better support for this. See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.sleep
How about implementing your own:(or a while loop with sleep/check or wait with short timeout)
