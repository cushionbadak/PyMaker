When I introduce to the command line "--debug" argument I need to set variable "debug", from my python script, to the value 1.I've tried something, but I have to write "--debug=1" to the command line to set variable.When I run the command:my variable "debug" should have value 1.
If you're interested to know whether a certain command line flag has been passed to your script, you'd set the action argument of Argument.add_argument to store_true.Then parser.parse_args().debug will have the value of True if --debug was present and False otherwise.
