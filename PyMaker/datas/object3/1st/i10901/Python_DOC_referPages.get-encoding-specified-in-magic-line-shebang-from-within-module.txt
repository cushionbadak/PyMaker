If I specify the character encoding (as suggested by PEP 263) in the "magic line" or shebang of a python module likecan I retrieve this encoding from within that module?(Working on Windows 7 x64 with Python 2.7.9)I tried (without success) to retrieve the default encoding or shebangwill yield:sys.getdefaultencoding(): asciishebang: None(same for iso-8859-1)
I'd borrow the Python 3 tokenize.detect_encoding() function in Python 2, adjusted a little to match Python 2 expectations. I've changed the function signature to accept a filename and dropped the inclusion of the lines read so far; you don't need those for your usecase:Like the original function, the above function reads two lines max from the source file, and will raise a SyntaxError exception if the encoding in the cookie is invalid or is not UTF-8 while a UTF-8 BOM is present.Demo:
