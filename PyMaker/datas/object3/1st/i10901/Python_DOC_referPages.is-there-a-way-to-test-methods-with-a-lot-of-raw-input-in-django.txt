I have found this URL here: python mocking raw input in unittestsand it answers my question somewhat, but what about the case when there is a lot of raw_inputs? something like this...
Simple answer: wraps each call to raw_input() in distinct object that you can easily mock.
If I understand correctly, you wanted to mock each and every raw_input method but set different return value. unittest.mock comes up with side_effect properties. that can be helpful in this case.https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#quick-guidePython Mock object with method called multiple timesThe key point here is the paramater of the raw_input function.Example:Here 'First', 'Second' 'Third' are the actual string of the raw_input used in the method.So the only thing you need to modify is to replace the 'First' with 'do you want to play a game?: ' and so on.And Assuming my_method returns the concatenation of the response of the raw_input method.Please note that code is not properly tested.
