Is there a means in IPython to import the contents of a notebook cell as if it were a separate module? Or alternatively get the contents of a cell to have its own namespace.
@Mike, as mentioned in the comment you can follow the well documented steps in the following link to import a Jupyter Notebook as a module:Importing Jupyter Notebooks as ModulesIn the link they will mention the work done in Python to provide users with hooks (now superseded with importlib and import system) to provide better customization of the import mechanism.As so the recipe they propose is the following:load the notebook document into memorycreate an empty Moduleexecute every cell in the Module namespace, and they offer their own implementation for the Notebook Loader (unnecessary if the code is all pure python):Also here is the implementation for the Notebook Finder:And the final step being the registration of the new module:All of this is, however, a direct quote from the first link given in this answer. The document is well built and provides answers for other stuff such as displaying notebooks or dealing with packages.
