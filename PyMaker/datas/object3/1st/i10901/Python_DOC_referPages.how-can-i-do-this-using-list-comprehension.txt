This is printing this OK!!!! :But How can i print this ? :
You can use:This means i will get the following values:(as the list comprehension loops over i). This means that range(0,len(a) - 1,2) starts at 0 and in increments of 2 it'll increase until it reaches the highest value but no more than len(a) - 1. There is a longer explanation in the Python 3 documentation about range() which can be helpful to read.This means it'll slice a into the desired segments (the notation a[i:j] means it'll take the slice from i to j of a). It'll first take the slice a[0:0 + 3], then the slice a[2:2 + 3] and lastly the slice a[4:4 + 3] which are the strings that you're looking for.We're subtracting 1 from the length of a as otherwise we don't end up with the result that we want:

Using list comprehension here might actually be counter to the zen of Python ("simple is better than complex").Though the other list comprehensions answers are correct, it takes a while to understand why they work.On the other hand, a code like the following isn't hard to figure out at first glance:
