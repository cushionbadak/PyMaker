I want to print all the running processes in my computer. One of my processes is called 哈哈.exe.This is my code:I get the output ??.exe for the Chinese process. Does someone know how to display the process name correctly?
Maybe try doing a format like this?
encode is the wrong method for this: The result of encoding is a binary value, ready to be output to file. What you are thinking of is the  decode function, which converts a binary value (back) to a string.If the string doesn't display properly without encoding (or decoding), then you'll need to figure out which encoding is used, convert the name to a bytestring, and then decode it from the correct type.Like many languages, Python is starting to conceptualize string handling the right way: textual data has no (true) encoding, or byte-semantics. The interpreter uses whatever encoding it wishes, and presents the user with characters. You have to encode it to send it to file (But, there is a default encoding: UTF-8 or locale would both makes sense, and I believe Python chooses UTF-8 for this.)binary data has no textual representation: You have to explicitly decode it in order to treat it as text, and that forces you to think about which encoding it is in.
Your os is Chinese and run the script in cmd window? You could proc.name().encode('gbk')
