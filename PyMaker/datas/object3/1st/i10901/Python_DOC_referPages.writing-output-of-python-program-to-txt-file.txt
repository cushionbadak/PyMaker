I've written a program that reads a CSV file and outputs the contents as insert statements. I then wrote an execute program that should take the output of the CSV parser program and write it to a .txt file but instead of writing the entire output it only writes the first statement. Here is the code for the executor:And the code for the parser:I'm not entirely sure that it makes sense to have them as two separate programs but I could not get them to run as defined functions in the same program for the life of me. How can I get the execution program to output all the lines of the parser program instead of just a single line? And how can I combine them into one program?
You are making things more complicated than they need to be.  Just nest your open statements using with. One program.  And it prints to the screen and writes to a file.
Not sure if this would work for you but you can use the >/>> operator to have stdout be re-routed to a file.Edit: The difference between > and >> is that >> appends to the end of the file while > truncates the fileTo combine the programs you could have the executor program be defined as the main function by defining it as Then you can redirect stdout to a file by using Similar question: Redirect stdout to a file in Python?
