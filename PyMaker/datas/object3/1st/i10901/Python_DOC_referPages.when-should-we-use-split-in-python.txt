So I would like to remove the white space from my integer input and store them into a list.However, the output's still the same when I don't use strip(). Can somebody please explain to me why we should use strip(). I saw a couple of posts on the forum and people also frequently use strip(). I understand split() returns all the numbers by eliminating the white space, and strip() also does the same job.Thanks!
I don't understand the confusion. The split() function return a list of all subparts of your string by removing all occurences of the given argument.For example, if you have the following string : "Hello world!" and split this one by split("o") then your output will be : ["Hell", " w", "rld!"]With a code:Then, the output will be :str has type string with the value Hello world!split_str has type list with the value ["Hell", " w", "rld!"]So, if you have a string that represents a sequence of different integers separated by space: you could operate with this solution.It's a very basic use of string so, for the next time, have the reflex to read the doc. It's the first tool that you may read to have your solution.
split(split_item) returns a list with dividing the input by the split_itemstrip(strip_item) will remove the strip_item from leading and trailing end and will return the remaining item.eg:a = " how are you "a.split() will give ['how', 'are', 'you']a.strip() will give 'how are you'You can specify any string inside the ()a.split("o") will give [' h', 'w are y', 'u ']a.strip("o") will give ' how are you ' --> same string
