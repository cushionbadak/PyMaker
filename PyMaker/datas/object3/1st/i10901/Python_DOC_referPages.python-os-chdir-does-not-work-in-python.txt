I have the below code snippet and the function chdir doesn't seem to work.. The below is the output:
As you can read here os.chdir returns None in all the cases.
os.chdir returns None. In that case, you should set changed as a flag that checks if the current directory is the same as the last one:
os.chdir doesn't return anything back to you. When you want to see what directory you are in you want os.getcwd. E.g.Outputs something like;
os.chdir does not have a output, you have to make a os.chdir() then make:that way you get the new directory
