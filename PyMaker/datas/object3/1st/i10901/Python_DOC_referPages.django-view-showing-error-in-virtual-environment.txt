I am using virtual Environment to develop the project. Using python3 and Django 1.9.7I am splitting views into multiple files. Below is the tree structure.Inside __init__.py file - When I am activating virtual environment and running code it throws me below error - If I do not activate the virtual environment and run the code, it runs without any error. Default django version 1.8.4 and python 2.7.6
In your __init__.py try to use local imports instead, this may be a problem if you are using python3 in your virtual environment.Besides file and module names in python should follow snake case convention, only classes should use CamelCase.
