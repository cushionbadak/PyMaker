For a QThread I would like to create an array of pyqtSignalThe main part of the following code looks like:executing the StartTestThread leads to the following errorAttributeError: 'PyQt5.QtCore.pyqtSignal' object has no attribute  'connect'If I initiliaize the pyqtSignal without being an array, it works.What am I doing wrong? Thanks for the help in advance! 
You cannot create a list of pyqtSignal(s).Unfortunately the way pyqt implement signals use a bit of python magics, and the pyqtSignal objects are actually "converted" into pyqtBoundSignal when a QObject subclass (technically a class that have pyqtWrapperType as a metaclass) is loaded.You can solve your problem in different ways:1) Wrap the signalI'm not 100% sure about this, but it's a modified version of your attempt:2) Don't use a listIf the number of signals is fixed, just create them directly as signal1, signal2, signalN, then you can call them directlyIf you can determine which signal to call only at runtime you can get the signal you need using the gettattr(object, name) function, for example:and3) Use only one signalUse only one signal that emit two values, one identify the "step" in which the signal is emitted, and the second is your value, doing so the connected functions can decide what to do based on the "step" value.
