How does one use put_bucket_policy()? It throws a MalformedPolicy error even when I try to pass in an existing valid policy:* error message: *
That's because applying str to a dict doesn't turn it into a valid json, use json.dumps instead:
Current boto3 API doesn't have a function to APPEND the bucket policy, whether add another items/elements/attributes.  You need load and manipulate the JSON yourself. E.g. write script load the policy into a dict, append the "Statement"  element list,  then use the policy.put to replace the whole policy. Without the original statement id, user policy will be appended. HOWEVER, there is no way to tell whether later user policy will override rules of the earlier one. For example The user don't need know the old policy in the process.
