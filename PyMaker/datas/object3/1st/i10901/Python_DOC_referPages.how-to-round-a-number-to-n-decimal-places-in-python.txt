I want, what I enter in the entry field should be automatic rounded to n decimal points.
You do not get the expected result because when you run a.set(round(self.entry, 2)) inside initialize() , the value of self.entry.get() is always 0 (the default value after creation)You rather need to attach a callback  to a button widget on which, after pressing, the behavior you are looking for will be executed:
I suppose what you want is not to round the float value itself, you want to show a float value with a precision of n decimal points. Try this:Note: in your code you try to round self.entry .i. e. you try to round an instance of type Tk.Entry. You should use self.entry.get() which supplies you with a string.If you are not familiar with this kind of string formatting I use look here.
