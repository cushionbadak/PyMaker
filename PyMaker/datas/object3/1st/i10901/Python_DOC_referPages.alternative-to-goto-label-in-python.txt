I know I can't use Goto and I know Goto is not the answer. I've read similar questions, but I just can't figure out a way to solve my problem.So, I'm writing a program, in which you have to guess a number. This is an extract of the part I have problems:What would you do?
There are lots of ways to do this, but generally you'll want to use loops, and you may want to explore break and continue. Here's one possible solution:continue jumps to the next iteration of the loop, and break terminates the loop altogether.(Also note that I wrapped int(raw_input(...)) in a try/except to handle the case where the user didn't enter an integer. In your code, not entering an integer would just result in an exception. I changed the 0 to a 1 in the randint call too, since based on the text you're printing, you intended to pick between 1 and 100, not 0 and 100.)
Python does not support goto or anything equivalent.You should think about how you can structure your program using the tools python does offer you. It seems like you need to use a loop to accomplish your desired logic. You should check out the control flow page for more information. In many other cases, you'll want to use a function to handle the logic you want to use a goto statement for.
You can use infinite loop, and also explicit break if necessary.
