basically I have a structure like  "myapp/installed_application_10101010/", however, the number of that folder will change regularly. Therefore I need a way to find this folder everytime. Almost similar to how unix works when you press tab in the terminal, it'll autofill the rest of the name. 
You could use the glob module for this.The method returns a list because there could be multiple matches.
