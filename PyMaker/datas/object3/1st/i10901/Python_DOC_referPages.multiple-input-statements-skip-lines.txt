I'm using python 3.5.1 and I've had this problem with a few scripts. When I have multiple input() lines in a row, the ipython window will skip lines in between them. Here's my code:The ipython window shows the following:I'd like to remove the skipped lines above Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds so the end result is this:I checked the documentation for input() and it only talks about a trailing newline, which I don't think is the problem here.
With the input() function alone you can't.Try the Curses library so you can take more control of terminal behaviour, because input() will always give you a new line.
Carlos Cordoba, a Spyder developer, says this is a bug in their IPython console, see here:How can I prevent Python from inserting a new line after taking user input?You might check their Github repo to see if it has been fixed.Here's the issue page if you're curious: https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole/issues/262
