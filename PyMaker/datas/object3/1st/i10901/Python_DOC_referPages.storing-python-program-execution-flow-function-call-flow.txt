I am developing a project in which I have to store all the function that were called in each request-response cycle and store them. I do not need to store values of the variable, all I need to store is function that we were called with their parameters and their order in execution. I am using mongodb to store this trace.
You could use a function decorator for convenience.Then decorate your function(s) to log.Test call.If you wanted to store the entries in MongoDB directly instead of first logging to the logging module you can replace the logging.debug line with code that creates an entry in your database.
sys.settrace traces a function for debugging but can be modified for this problem. Maybe something like this - Also see profiling. It describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed
