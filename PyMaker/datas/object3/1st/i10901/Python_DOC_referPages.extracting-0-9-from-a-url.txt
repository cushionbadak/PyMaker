I've put together the following regular expression to extract image ID's from a URL:URL example:I want this bit:I've tested it on regex101 and it works: https://regex101.com/r/eS6eS7/2img.attr('src') contains the correct URL and is not empty. I tested this. When I try to use m.group(0) I get an exception that group is not a function. m is None.Am I doing something wrong?
Two problems:those enclosing /.../ are not a part of Python regex syntaxyou should use search instead of matchWorking example:If you want just the number part, use this (group(1), and note the additional _):
This is the correct python code from Regex101. (There's a code generator on the left). Notice the lack of slashes on the outside of the regex... I'm not sure how you got m as None, but you might need to compile the pattern and use that to match first.    Otherwise, try to fix the expression first
