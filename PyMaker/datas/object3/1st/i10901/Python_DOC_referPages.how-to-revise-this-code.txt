I'm trying to eliminate invalid input from users. With this code, if the input is not in (0,1), the result shows "not in Score Range", which is good.However, when the input is not a number, the result shows both "type a number" and "not in Score Range". I want it to show only the "type a number". Could anyone tell me how to do that? I was thinking about using "elif", but just didn't know how to handle it.
You can do that by simply adding a flag variable:Update 1:I am also not much a fan of flag.

It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception. For example:source: linkPlease comment in case of any problem.Hope it helps : )
I personally prefer to work without flags, and simply wrapping it in a function.
To add yet another variant, you could differentiate between different exceptions. May be overkill for this problem, but I think in general this is more elegant:
