This question already has an answer here:Addition overloading in Python behaviour x+y vs y+x                    1 answer                I've defined a new modulus 7 class:Then I wanted to allow additions of not just mod7 objects but also of integers to the new class. So under the class I've addedandHoweverI understand why - The addition function is called by the class of the 1st argument. My question: Is there any way to override 5 + a according to the class of 2nd argument, i.e. a?
You'll want to also define __radd__. This would be called automatically if the left operand did not support +, but ints do, so you have to define it specifically to handle this situation. You can just define it to call your __add__ function so you don't have to rewrite anything.
