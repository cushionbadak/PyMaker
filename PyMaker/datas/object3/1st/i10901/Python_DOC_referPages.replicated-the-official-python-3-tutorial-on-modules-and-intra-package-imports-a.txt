I followed Python 3 Modules tutorial and I cannot get absolute or relative intra-package imports to work.Specifically I replicated the project structure from the tutorial. The sound folder is located in my home /home/user/ directory. All project files (excluding filters/vocoder.py and effects/surround.py) are empty and have been generated using touch.As per instruction filters/vocoder.py contains:When this file is executed, it results in an import error:Likewise I have executed each of the following lines of code in effects/surround.py separately (I commented the lines out # and rerun the script):Which when it is executed results in:What am I doing wrong, why can I not get absolute and relative imports to work in my package?Below is a script which should help replicate the project:
I was just looking at the tutorial.  I don't read that from sound.effects import echo is supposed to work as is from filters/vocoders.py.  What is says there in the tutorial is:Users of the package can import individual modules from the package,  for example:So that would be as if a user could reference the sound directory from their current directory.  Like some of the comments said, in order to do that, the user needs to either be in the same directory as sound or add the sound directory to your PATH variable.  Like this:See also: Import a module from a relative pathFurther down the tutorial, they touch on what you are trying to do, which is intra-package references.  You could use this technique without adding sound to your PATH:For example from your filters/vocoders.py module, this should work to import echo:
