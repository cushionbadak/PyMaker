I need to pass a function (without calling it) to another function, but I need to specify a different value for a default argument.For example:This, however, calls func_a() and passes the result to func_b().How do I set default_arg=False without executing func_a?
Use a lambda-function. Like this:In func_b you will have a callable function which accepts argument input and executes func_a with previously specified default_arg argument.EDITED:Thanks to cdarke who is trying to say us that there is only one right way to do this.
Use a functools.partial() object:The partial() object is a callable too, when called it'll apply the arguments you gave it to the first argument.Demo:
