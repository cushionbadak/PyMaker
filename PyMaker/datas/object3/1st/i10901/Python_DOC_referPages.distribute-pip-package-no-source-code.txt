I have an "homemade" python package which i can successfully install via pip package manager.I'd like ti distribute it without giving the source code (*.py files)... i tried to compile them withpython -m compileall .and then installed by typing pip install .However it can't find the module when i try to import it in my application.ImportError: No module named...What do you suggest to solve?Thanks
I guess it is to do with setuptools not packaging up *.pyc files, because normally you don't want them.You should create a file MANIFEST.in with the contentThis tells setuptools to exclude *.py source files and include *.pyc compiled files.Afterwards create a source distribution packageor a wheelwhich also compiles C extensions.
