I can run my python+pyspark script from the unix command line by typingBut how do I run script.py from within the pyspark shell? This seems like an elementary question but I can't find the answer anywhere. I tried But I get an error which includes:
Could the error come from script.py trying to create a new SparkContext variable?When you launch the pyspark interactive client it usually says :SparkContext available as sc, HiveContext available as sqlContext.If your script file contains sc = SparkContext(), maybe try commenting it.
