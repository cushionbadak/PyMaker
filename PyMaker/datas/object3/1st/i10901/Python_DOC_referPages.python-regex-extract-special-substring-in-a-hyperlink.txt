I use python grabbed a series of hyperlinks,  I want to extract specific character string from these hyperlinks.the hyperlinks like below:    “http://tianqi.2345.com/hongkong/61063.htm”it contains a city name(hongkong) and a city ID(61063), I want to get the result below:my sample code is below:but the code throws bug, I am not familiar with regex, can anyone help me?  below is my full code:
You can just split:Which will give you:If you want to check if the url startswith the host:Since you are using BeautifulSoup, you can filter the anchor tags yourself using the id of the div that contains the links:Output will be like:I cannot add all the output as I am getting a warning about spam but it is all there. 
Another alternate would be to use urlparse (Python2 Doc / Python3 Doc)
Above code should work. Instead of using . as wildcard search I use specific \w and \d to improve efficiency
hope it help.
You've a simple syntax problem in search function, quotes are mismatched (' in the start of string and " at the end) and if you want to match a dot (. symbol in regex matches almost any character), you need to escape it. Also, it won't print 'hongkong', it would print 'qinxian'; symbols at the end on lines aren't necessary in python, and it's a bad style to use them
