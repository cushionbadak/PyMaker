This question already has an answer here:main() function doesn't run when running script                    5 answers                When I run the following code, it skips to the end and simply prints "Thanks for playing!"I'm sure it's something super obvious that I've missed, any ideas?  I am using Python 2.7.6.Thanks.
Python in itself has no concept of a main method. When it reads your code, it imports random, defines a method named roll, defines another method named main, then prints "Thanks for playing". It does nothing else, unless you tell it toIf you want to call main(), you'll need to do this yourself. Traditionally (to work with other code that might want to import yours as a module), it would look like this:That will check if the module name is __main__ (which is true for the main script) and call your main method
You need to add if __name__ == '__main__:', and call main() from there:For details as to why and how it works, please see:- what-does-if-name-main-do- tutorial name == main- python documentation
You need to run main
