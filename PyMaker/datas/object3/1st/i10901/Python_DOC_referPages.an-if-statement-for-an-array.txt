How do I make a two dimensional array an if statement.I have a grid of blank squares, 7 by 6, and if a square is clicked its given a value of 1 and if not it stays 0. When all the squares have been clicked making the now 1 I want Draw = True, but this statement above finds the row and column I've just chosen rather then the entire grid.
If you mean check the whole board if all are 1's, then its a simple fix.Going about it the other way is easier.
What you want is only when all board values are 1, the Draw is set to True. You code will set Draw to 1 if there is ANY grid clicked.The solution is simple, you can think reversely, preset the Draw to True and whenever the grid is not 1, set it to False.
You can use all as another way to @Wboy's forloop:Here, z would be your two dimensional list. You can evaluate uneven dimensions this way as well without getting "bogged" down in ranges etc.Caveat: If you had an empty list in your grid, then all here would still evaluate to true. Example grid for caveat:
If you need to check that all values in a collection have a value that is True you could always use the built in all() function which checks that all values in an iterable satisfy a given condition (which, in your case is i > 0):Which can get simplified to:Since positive values evaluate to True.
