For one of the apps, I'm overloading the "delete selected objects" method in a Django 1.9.x project which uses the Admin panel. For that, I have a code similar to this:The last line produces the following warning in the console:.../virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/shortcuts.py:45: RemovedInDjango110Warning: The context_instance argument of render_to_string is deprecated. using=using)I've tried to find some resource that explains how to "update" syntax according to version 1.10.x but I've been unable to.A similar question has already been asked here but it's slightly different since the OP is calling render_to_string explicitly and I'm not.How should I update the call above to make the warning disappear?
Yes, the "right" way to fix it would be to update it. According to the documentation, they recommend using render()Deprecated since version 1.8:  The context_instance argument is deprecated. Use the render() function instead which always makes RequestContext available.If you do want to suppress this warning (highly unrecommended), you can use the SILENCE_SYSTEM_CHECK setting. More on the system check can be found here
