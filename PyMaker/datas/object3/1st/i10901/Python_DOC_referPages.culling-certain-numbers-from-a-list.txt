I have a series of variable lists inside a list, and I'm comparing it to another list.  I want, run through each list in aList, analyze each number and as soon its a match in bList, append that number to finalList.  I want to return the first match in other words and ignore future matches.  For Example:
Use a for loop with a break.To iterate with a single for loop you could use the itertools module
