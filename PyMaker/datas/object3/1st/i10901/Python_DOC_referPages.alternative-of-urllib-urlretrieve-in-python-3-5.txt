I am currently doing a course on machine learning in UDACITY . In there they have written some code in python 2.7 but as i am currently using python 3.5 , i am getting some error . This is the code I tried urllib.request . But still gives me error . I am using PyCharm as my IDE .  
You'd use urllib.request.urlretrieve.  Note that this function "may become deprecated at some point in the future", so you might be better off using the less likely to be deprecated interface:For small enough files, you could just read and write the whole thing and drop the loop entirely.
I know this question has long been answered but I'll contribute for any future viewer.The proposed solution is good but the main issue if that it can generate empty files if you are using invalid urls.As a workaround to this problem here is how I adapted the code:I hope this help.
