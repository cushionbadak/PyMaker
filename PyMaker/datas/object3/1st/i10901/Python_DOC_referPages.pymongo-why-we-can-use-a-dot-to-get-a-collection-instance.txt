Just as the snippet above, we can use just a . instead of get_database("test") and get_collection("test") to get a database instance or a collection instance. Despite the convenience, I wonder what makes this syntactic sugar happen? 
There is a __getattr__() magic method making dot notation/attribute lookup happen.Let's look into the source code. MongoClient class defines __getaattr__ method and instantiates a Database class by name:And the same goes for the Database class.
