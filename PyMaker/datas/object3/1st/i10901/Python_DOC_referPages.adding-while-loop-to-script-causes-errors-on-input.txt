I'm writing some code to play Hangman (Python 3.5.2). I wan't my code to run forever, e.g with while 1 < 2:, but I start getting syntax errors on statements that work fine without the while. Here is my code:Essentially, I want to loop it like this:
The problem occurs because you mask the built-in function input() with the assignment:For one iteration, this will work just fine because you're not calling input() again. Doing it more than once though will use a value of input that is masked, in your case with a value of type str; calling a str value will result in a TypeError.Change the name to something different, like:for the error to leave, make sure you change it throughout your code.Remember to never mix user defined names with built-in function names because you'll get weird behavior.
