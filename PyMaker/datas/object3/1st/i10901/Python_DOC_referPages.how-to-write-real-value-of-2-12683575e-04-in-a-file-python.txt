I am currently working with really tiny values and when I try to write a value like -0.000212683575 in a file, it write me -2.12683575e-04.The problem is that I would like to have this value -0.000212683575 written in the file or a least this one -0.00021268 if there are too much numbers.How could I do this ?I use Python 2.7Thank you very much
