If it is a real INI file then you can use Python's standard library module called configparser.Otherwise, read the file into memory and split it into a dictionary or a list.And then you can add whatever you want and put it back.Like this:This way you have easy access to name, value pairs and you can add options as you go.When you want to save it, just reverse the process.If you want options to be sorted in the original order, then use OrderedDict() or a list instead of dictionary.
