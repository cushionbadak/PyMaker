I am facing an issue here. I have a Dataframe column whose values I need to put as value+% i.e. say 10%, 15% etc. However, I am able to put the values as string type in the excel sheet after writing but while I plot the graph, the value is being considered as a string and hence the chart is not getting generated. I need to paste the value with the % symbol in the concerned column as well as I need to plot the graph while writing to the excel sheet.Any solution  for this??Thanks in advance.
For writing the value in excel you can useWhile plotting graph access the values by slicing the last character(%) and convert it to number by using eval function.
