I'm writing a c++ program which evaluates the result of 3 values.I would like call this application by a python script, which should receive these values.The problem is that c++ main function, returns one integer value only.What's the best approach to solve this issue?Thanks!
You could save the intermediate values in a file or you could write to stdout in the c++ code e.g.Now in python use subprocess.Popen to execute the c++ code and capture stdout using a PIPE. It's up to you in which format you output the three parameters. I put them all on the same line, separated by commas and simply split in the python code. You may choose to do it differently, depending upon your needs.After compiling the c++ and running the python from the same directory. The output isNote: I used './nameofyourexe' (prefix with ./) to execute the program from the current directory. This may not work on windows (I'm on linux) or if you execute it from a different directory than the current one. To get around this you could pass the cwd parameter to Popen specifying the directory containing the exe.
