This question already has an answer here:How to clone or copy a list?                    20 answers                So this is basically how the code works that I'm using.This outputs "Hello World" twice. How can I prevent the change of the global variable when I change the local?Thanks in advance, I hope someone can help me out.
The problem here is the following line:Since Gvar is a list and therefore a complex datatype, Python won't copy the value but instead references to the variable. So whether you modify Lvar or Gvar won't make a difference at this point. Instead, you probably want to copy the values which you can achieve in different ways, e.g.:Alternatively, you can use the copy module. Check out the Python FAQs for more information on this. For completion, this is how your modified code would look:As a side note, variable names in Python should be lower-case - upper-case is typically used for class definitions only.
You can use shallow copy to do htis task :Output :You also use deepcopy to do this task :Output :N.B : if you use Python 2.7.6 then use print Lvar instead of print(Lvar) and print Gvar instead of print(Gvar).
