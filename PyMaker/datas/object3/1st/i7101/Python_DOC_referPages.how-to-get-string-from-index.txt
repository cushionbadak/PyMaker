I wanted to know how do I get string from index.For example:in user_input I enter 5 5 4 6 1in number_pick I enter 4The correct output should be Value: 6This is my code. It's not giving me the right value. If anyone could help that will be useful. (I'm a beginner in Python)
Instead of using find(), you can just parse your number_pick to intAnd I will use str.split() method, which simply takes a string and splits it by a given separator.And after running this code:And I think math is redundant for this piece of code.split() usage explanation:When we enter 5 4 4 6 1 for our user_input variable, it's value is simply the string "5 4 4 6 1".When we do .split(' ') on it, it creates a list with our values, separated by " ".So after doing split, we have ['5', '4', '4', '6', '1']. See the docs for more information.
The problem is that in lists indexing begins at 0 not 1. So this should give you the wanted result: 
You have misunderstood the nature of the find option in string and the idea that it returns an index, with a list.find determines if string str occurs in string and returns its index which is the starting point of str within the stringSo:The word "winter" exists in a and starts at position 11 (starting from position zero)In your case:is the correct answer.    Extending this out, you can manipulate the results of the index from findBest run with the answer that converts it to a list, as that appears to be what you actually wanted to do.
Try this:
You can achieve the same thing by using this code instead of using Find.
