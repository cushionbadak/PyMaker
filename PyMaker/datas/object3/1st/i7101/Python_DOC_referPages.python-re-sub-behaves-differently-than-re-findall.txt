Natural Text
I'm stumped. I'm coding Python 3.6.2, using PyCharm as my IDE. The following script fragment illustrates my problem:You can see that re.findall finds three matches. However, re.sub only calls the dosubst function twice. If I change @message to message then re.sub still calls dosubst twice, but picks up @arg1 and @arg2. Baffled. I thought it might be greedy vs. posessive, etc. but - changing @message to message and the resulting behavior negates that. Can anyone explain? I'm trying to do some basic text parsing of SQL to refactor message formatting for a large number of files. I use regexr.com to prototype most of the regex stuff I do and it also finds three occurrences of the pattern in the line. Thanks.
See the documentation.  The fourth argument to re.sub is count, not flags.  Since re.IGNORECASE happens to be 2, you are telling it to only do two substitutions.  Instead, pass flags by keyword:
By giving the fourth argument count=0. If you put the other positive numbers instead of 0 than it will replace the string exactly the same number of time. output:
