I have a date which I obtain from an API. It is in the form of 2015-01-01T15:04:23Z.How can I accept this date into a model using Flask-SQLAlchemy?So far I have tried, and which gives me the errorAlso, when I retrieve it using a get, I need it to be in the exact same format.The dateutil python module parses it well but when I retrieve it from the table, I need to get 2015-01-01T15:04:23Z.
You need to convert the string into a Python datetime object, which you can do using time.strptime:Then you can safely set it on your instance and commit it.To get it back in the same format, use time.strftime on the other side:And of course remember to watch out that the order of the arguments is different between strptime and strftime :)If you need to change/update the format, see time.strftime here : https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html
