The specific question is like this:I have two lists, namely: I would like to build a relation of those lists to match with the corresponding number of the other list, like 1-11,5-13,7-15...and if I input[1,5,7], then it will automatically generate[11,13,15]. I'm new to python so I don't know if it is doable or could someone give me some advise or ideas, thanks in advance!
you could create a dictionary with the elements of the first list as keys and the elements of the second list as values:
If by "relation" you mean a 1-to-1 mapping, then perhaps you should take a look at dictionaries. And if your lists (lst1, lst2) always have same length and order of mapping, you probably don't need a dictionary mapping, just use indexing correctly, along with the index method for lists.
dict(zip(lst1, lst2)) will be okay.
first zip both list then use list compression over the output of list with if the conditionOutputfor detail see
