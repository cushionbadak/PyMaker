I have a list of dictionaries which looks like this:What I would like to do is to take that list of dictionaries and make it into a dictionary with the following:I am just getting back into Python and have never done something like this before so I don't really know where to look. I know how to iterate over the list but I am not really sure how to get to where I would like to go. I did the following which has gotten part of the way there, now I am just looking for how to get the count of the issue numbers:
One option would be to iterate your original list of issues and increment the count in your result manually:
This looks like something that should work nicely with a Counter, only the inner dictionaries will be counters. You need to do a couple of extra steps to split up by date first.You need to split the dictionary by year_month. Then, you need to count of all the issue_priority types for that year and month:Many of the steps shown above can be reduced to a smaller line count, but at the cost of clarity and readability, in my opinion. That being said:The output of both methods isCounter is just a slightly fancier dict, so you can access it as ususal. To avoid problems with missing priority types, just use the get method instead of direct indexing:will raise an error, so do this instead:
