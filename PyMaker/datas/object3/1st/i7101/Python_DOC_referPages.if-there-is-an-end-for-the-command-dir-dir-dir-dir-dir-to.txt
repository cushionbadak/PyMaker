Every object has a __dir__ attribute, will the command stop if extra .__dir__ references are appended?and,will it stop when enough '.dir' are appended?
You are taking the dir() of the __dir__ attribute, which is a builtin_function_or_method object, which has a __dir__ attribute. So yes, you can chain those __dir__ attribute lookups endlessly, because the result will always be the same; a bound method object:Every object in Python has a __dir__ attribute, it is always a callable.Note: the way you strung the attribute lookups keeps a chain of bound method objects alive, so you will eventually run out of memory; each __dir__ method wrapper references the preceding one in their __self__ attribute.
