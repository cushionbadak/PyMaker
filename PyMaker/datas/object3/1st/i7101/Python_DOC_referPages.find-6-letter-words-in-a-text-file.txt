Natural Text
I am new to Python so I don't know how to find all 6 letter word in a text file then randomly select one of those words.First problem: I don't know how to locate the path to the file in Mac. I know it should be something like this:Second problem: Do I create an empty list then transfer the word in text file to the list then use for loop?Like: Third problem: Then how do I get a random word in list?
I think the following does what you want and effectively answers all of your sub-questions. Note that split() divides the contents the file into list of words separated by whitespace (such as spaces, tabs, and newlines).Also note that I used a word.txt file with just those three words from your question in it for illustration.
You could use regex to find all the 6 letter words:regex in action:Then use random.choice to pick a random word from that list:
First, put your file in the same folder as the .py file. Then try this:
If you are on Python 3.5 or better, do yourself a favor and learn to use pathlib.Path objects. To find a file in your user home directory, simply do this:Now in_path is a path-like object pointing to a file called "word.txt" in the top of your user home directory. You can safely and easily get the text out of that object, and split it into individual words as well, this way:Use the append() method to add words to your word list:The last 3 lines can be shortened using a list comprehension, which is very nice Python syntax for creating the list in place (without writing a for loop or using the append method):If you want to make sure you don't get words with numbers and punctuation, use an isalpha() check: If numbers are OK but you don't want punctuation, use an isalnum() check: Finally: for a random word in your list, use the choice function from the random module:
