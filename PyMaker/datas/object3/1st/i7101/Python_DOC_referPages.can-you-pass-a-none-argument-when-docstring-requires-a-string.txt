Ok, this question has probably been answered somewhere but my Google-fu hasn't found the right combination of keywords yet.I have a function that accepts a string, but when I pass None, Pycharm's inspection is flagging a type error. Is this an error in the linter? Does None count as a string? I know I can call the function with an empty string, but I think I should be able to use None as well.
As a dissenting opinion, Python is not strongly typed so for pycharm's linter to highlight that as an error seems a little odd to me.Of course there are many functions which legitimately need a string, but I'm sure i saw somewhere that 'good practice' for that was a function that looked more like this:This works with anything that can be coerced into a string, which seems more sensible than requiring literally a string.Am I nuts?
None does not count as a string. None is the sole member of the class NoneType.  To do what you want, arrange for your function to accept an optional string argument.Then don't pass it None, pass it nothing:
First to answer your question None is not a str It is the sole value of type.Nonetype it is a python Built in Contstant. Read about it here.And there are many ways to get around/handle possible None input1. To get around it, not going to handle None:is expecting str so of course, it throws an error. just pass in "" instead. but in this case calling my_func(None) would still give you an error.2. To Handle possible None input:if you want to handle None as one of possible input parameter then set your parameter  to optional parameter with * that way you can input None and not get an errorORDefault your input to None if the value user pass in is not None then you know user pass in something else: This allows you do to my_func(None) and not get an errorNote: this also allows you treat None and '' equally (thanks to Stael for pointing out)
