I wrote a program in python3.6 that the user creates a username and password. then the program checks if that username is stored if not it creates the username and password permanently.I am having trouble linking username and password lists as 'jason' has the password 'oero'. so that the runs as 'jason' is the the username and oero is the password.the other problem is when I ran the program it tried to run the entire list so you cant choose just one value of the lists. This is what I have so far. the program is also set to quit if the user gets their username and password wrong 3 times. which works fine. Thank you! The code runs as is, the way its supposed too.
First of all, are comparing a string username/password to the whole list in:When you slice a list like stored_username[0:] it gives returns a sublist starting from element 0 to the end of the list. You need first get the index of the username by using stored_username.index(sentence) then get the password of the same index. However, using a dictionary would make this simpler, faster, and easier to read. Here is an example using dictionary to store the usernames/passwords:
The issue is that the no matter the input,if sentence == stored_username[0:] and sentence2 == stored_password[0:]: returns false, correct?This is because you are checking equality between the input and the list, which will always return false, i.e. 'jason' == ['jason' , 'nicole',username] will always return false.To fix this, the in operator can be used, i.e.:if sentence in stored_username[0:] and sentence2 in stored_password[0:]:Also, the [0:] slice is redundant, as it returns the whole list, so instead you can write:if sentence in stored_username and sentence2 in stored_password:
