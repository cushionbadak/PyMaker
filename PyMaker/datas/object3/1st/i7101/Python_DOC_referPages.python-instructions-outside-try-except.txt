I have a single line inside a Try/Except block, but another line outside this block is being executed when there is an exception. I'm on my phone so I'll just enter a few linesWhen I enter a number, the count gets incremented as expected. If a character is entered, the exception is caught, but the count still gets incremented. I thought only the lines within the try/except block were repeated if there was an exception.
You need to use the else clause of the try/except statement if you only want to increment count if an exception was not raised. From the documentation section 8.3 Handling Exceptions:The try ... except statement has an optional else clause, which, when present, must follow all except clauses. It is useful for code that must be executed if the try clause does not raise an exception.As you can see from above, I changed your bare except statement to catch a specific exception type ValueError, since that's will int will raise if it can't convert it's argument to an int. If you want to catch a different exception, change ValueError, but don't use a bare except clause, as it can mask important exceptions. Also as said in the comments, a try/except statement does not execute it's body multiple times. You need a loop if you want that behavior.
when you enter characters and the exception is thrown. the line count = count + 1 still gets executed regardless. Because count = count + 1 is not under else: That is why the count still gets incremented.Also, realize that try-except statements don't repeat itself.
