I have a function which expects a tuple as one of the argumentsIs there a built-in error which is appropriate for saying that t is not of the correct type, or should I be defining my own?
Yes, the TypeError exception is meant to be used for exactly this case:Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.[...]Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a list when an int is expected) should result in a TypeError[.]You may want to look into using type hinting, to catch programmers errors that pass in the wrong type early. We check type hints during linting time, for example.
You can use TypeError exception.
Yes, this would typically be indicated by a TypeError. Or if the argument is of the correct type but its value is invalid, use a ValueError.In many cases (especially with TypeError) you don't have to raise these explicitly, though; they'll just naturally happen when you try to perform an operation that the type doesn't support.
