I set the FLASK_APP to api.py and then run flask run, but then I receive the error SystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import . There's no error on PyCharm whatsoever, which confirms that syntactically this is correct. api.piThe directory structureAs you can see above, both api.py and models.py are in the same directory, and using the from . import models line should import the script's code into api.py . For reference, this flask server was made using virtualenv, following the official Flask docs, hence there is a venv directory in the flask-api directory. Also, models.py further imports stuff from the modelpackage, so that's why I included it above for completeness. Does this have something to do with Flask/VirtualEnv/Directory structure? 
When module is used as main its name is __main__ . And so relative imports do not work. You should use absolute imports.i.efrom flask_api import modelsHere is link for more info DocumentationNote that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always "main", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.Note: According to PEP8 use absolute imports rather than relative ones.
