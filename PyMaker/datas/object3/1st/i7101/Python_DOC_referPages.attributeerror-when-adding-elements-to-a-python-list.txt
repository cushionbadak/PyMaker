I am newer to python and I am having trouble saving a list of renamed files so I can eventually move the files to a new directory. My code is posted below:Basically what this code does is loops over the original file names (orig), and renames them to a specific convention (new_name). The issue I am having is for every iteration, I am trying to save each new_nam to the list "new_files" however I keep getting this error:Basically I think it is saying you cannot add a "None Type" to a list which makes sense, however when I print all of the new_nam's, they are all string which is not a None type. So I guess I don't know why this code isn't adding each new file name to the new_files list. Any advice of tips is greatly appreciated, cannot figure this one out :/ Thanks!
list.append is an inplace operation. You must call the function without assigning the return value:In your case, you'll needAll the list.___ methods as described in the list docs are inplace.
