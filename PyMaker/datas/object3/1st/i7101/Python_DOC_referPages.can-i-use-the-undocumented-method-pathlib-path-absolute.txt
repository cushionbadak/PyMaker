The first method found by auto-complete on a pathlib.Path is absolute().It seems to just prepend Path.cwd() at the start:However, Path.absolute() is not listed in the pathlib documentation.Compare this to Path.resolve(), which does the opposite (replace relative parts but don't prepend cwd) and  is documented.Can I use absolute() or should I avoid it?
At least up until Python version 3.6, you should avoid using Path.absolute().According to the discussion in the bug report about the missing documentation,absolute() is not tested, and therefore not officially advertised.  In fact, it might even be removed in a future release of Python.So it's safer to just use Path.cwd() instead.If you're not sure it's actually necessary to do that, you can use Path.is_absolute() to check.
