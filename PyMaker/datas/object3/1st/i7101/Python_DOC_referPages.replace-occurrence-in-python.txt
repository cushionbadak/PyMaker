Natural Text
I have a string and this string could contain some occurrences like:http://site/image.jpgWhat is the right way to replace, when it's present, this kind of occurrence by <img src="http://site/image.jpg">What is really important, is to replace only occurrences beginning by http and which ending by .jpg, .png and gif by the <img> HTML tag.So if among all the text there is a URL link of any images, it's formatted by a HTML tag to display the image.
Pretty straightforward with regex:(https?.+(?:jpg|png|gif)) matches everything that starts with http or https and ending with jpg, png or gif. '<img src="\1">' here the \1 refers to the first (and only) capture group in the previous regex (which contains the image url).
This is a simple answer to your question:This includes "http" and "https" site verification, as well as code working for 3 character image extensions, such as you asked: jpg, gif and png.Hope it helped.Feel free to ask if you have any question.Edit: Didn't notice you had not the urls already in a data structure, so this is invalid to your situation
