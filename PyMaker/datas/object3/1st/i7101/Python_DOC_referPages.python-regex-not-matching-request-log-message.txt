so I tested out this regex but when I try it out in python shell I don't get any matches.
You missed a forward slash at the beginning of the pattern; Keep in mind re.match always matches the pattern from the beginning of the string, so everything should match from the start:
maybe you should use re.search(), re.match() need match the start of the string, re.search() will scan through the string.
