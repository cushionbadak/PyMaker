I have been asked to write a script that pulls the latest code from Git, makes a build, and performs some automated unit tests.I found that there are two built-in Python modules for interacting with Git that are readily available: GitPython and libgit2.What approach/module should I use?
An easier solution would be to use the Python subprocess module to call git. In your case, this would pull the latest code and build:Docs:subprocess - Python 2.xsubprocess - Python 3.x
I agree with Ian Wetherbee. You should use subprocess to call git directly. If you need to perform some logic on the output of the commands then you would use the following subprocess call format. 
In EasyBuild, we rely on GitPython, and that's working out fine.See here, for examples of how to use it.
If you're on Linux or Mac, why use python at all for this task? Write a shell script.
