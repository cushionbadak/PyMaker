I have a set object like thisSince in Python, set object does not support indexing. If I want to extract certain elements, say 'Book' and its lowercase form 'book', from the set and count their frequencies relative to total number of elements (i.e., tokens) in the set. What is the handy way to do this?Thank you.
You can count how many times the word is in the list whatever the casing by couting the occurrences of its lowercased (or casefolded) version (otherwise the question doesn't make sense since set guarantees uniqueness) using collections.Counter:result:and for frequencies:which gives:as explained by a nice comment, str.casefold handles more cases (no pun intended!) than str.lower, even if str.lower works for most words (use str.lower for Python 2.x, as casefold isn't available)
If I want to extract certain elements, say 'Book' and its lowercase form 'book', from the set and count their frequencies relative to total number of elements (i.e., tokens) in the set.If you want to find the frequency of a certain element in your set, you can use collections.Counter to accomplish this:Realize however, that sets do not support duplicate elements, so the frequency will always be 1. Consider using a list or tuple to initialize your Counter object.
Result:
This is handy (and it works also for lists) :
