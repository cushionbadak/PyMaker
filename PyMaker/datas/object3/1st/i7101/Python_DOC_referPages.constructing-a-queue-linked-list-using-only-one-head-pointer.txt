I'm trying to construct a Queue linked list using only a head pointer (no tail).but i cant seem to enqueue at the end of the list. example: at the moment the code will: c -> b -> a, however i would like reverse it a -> b -> c.
This should do it:Besides some logic fixes (we need to create a new node and store it in current.next, current is just a variable pointing to a node), note we use is operator for testing for None and Node constructor to set data (so we can create and assign new nodes without temp var).For example:Outputs:Btw, note that such structure requires O(N) insertion time and O(1) deletion (pop) time. Double-ended queue (like the standard collections.deque) will do both insertion and deletion in constant time.
