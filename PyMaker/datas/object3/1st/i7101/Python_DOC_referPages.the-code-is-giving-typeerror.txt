I tried to compile this code to the py 2.7.11 but it is giving this outputAnybody here to point out my mistake. I think there is a missing part in the code. May be it is written in latest version which caused this error. I tried to pass the arguments in the super but every time faced a new kind of error.
The proper way to call super here is with the following arguments:Because super in python2 needs the arguments (in python3 it's possible to do just super())Take a look at the docs for super for more detailsEdit: It appears that this mistake is repeated more times in your code, keep that in mind that some things will not work because of the same problem. Make sure you use super only when needed and use it properly
In Python2 super() takes reference of cls (class) and self (class instance) as arguments.Take a look here:https://stackoverflow.com/a/5066411/6654077super()  should not be considered the standard way of calling a method of the base class. This did not change with Python 3.x. The only thing that changed is that you don't need to pass the arguments self, cls in the standard case that self is the first parameter of the current function and cls is the class currently being defined.Now, when I run your code in Python3, I got no error.
this code works well on Python 3.x.Try Python 3.X, or fix the code  toin 2.x, you should write 'own class name' and 'self' for argument of super().
