Not sure if this is even possible, but my goal is to create a base abstract class that uses an enumerator as a subclass.Here is the code so far and what is/isn't working. I'd like to somehow be able to reference the "class Colors(Enum)" in my "IdealUse" class. Any thoughts on what needs to be changed?BaseClass.pyIdealUse.py
Again, thank you to those who replied. Just getting me to rethink the terms and what I was asking led me to a working solution.BaseClass.pyIdealUse.py
