Natural Text
I need an edit function, currently I have code for the user to enter an id number (same as line number) and then for writing to the certain text file, however instead of replacing the entered line, it clears the whole file and only saves the edited entry. How would I change my code so it only changes the entered line rather than deleting all the data in the file.
Your code should be edited to look like this (at the point where the fault occurs):Hope this helps! :)
Try opening file with 'a' instead of 'w' mode.  From python documentation:The most commonly-used values of mode are 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and 'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position).
