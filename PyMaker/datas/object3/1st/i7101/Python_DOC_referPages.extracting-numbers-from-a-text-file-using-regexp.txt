Natural Text
Iam trying to make a python script that reads a text file input.txt and then scans all phone numbers in that file and writes back all matching phone no's to output.txtlets say text file is like: Hey my number is 1234567890 and another number is +91-1234567890. but if none of these is available you can call me on +91 5645454545 (or) mail me at abc@xyz.comit should match 1234567890, +91-1234567890 and +91 5645454545Regexp for no is like : it takes country codes upto 3 digits and then a - or space which is optional and country code itself is optional and then a 10 digit number.
Yes, the problem is with your regex. Fortunately, it's a small one. You just need to remove the ^ character:The ^ signifies that you want to match only at the beginning of the string. You want to match multiple times throughout the string. Here's a 101demo.For python, you'll need to specify a non-capturing group as well with ?:. Otherwise, re.findall does not return the complete match:Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of  strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned  in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern,  return a list of groups.Bold emphasis mine. Here's a relevant question.This is what you get when you specify non-capturing groups for your problem:
this code will work:The output will be:
