My question is about how computer chooses function to run when there are two same named functions from two modules. One of the modules is imported.This is an example from Pythonschool.I have a file called crops.py:wheat_class and potato_class are children of class called Crop.Crop class is defined in crop_class.py:My question is about the function display_menu().As seen, the function is present in both crops.py and crop_class.py.When the main function in crops.py is run, the display_menu() from crops.py is run for new_crop = create_crop()while display_menu() from crop_class.py is run formanage_crop(new_crop).I was confused because both functions are not attributed to particular class. The display_menu() in crop_class.py is indented in a way such that it is not part of Crop class.Thus, I am confused on how the computer choose which code to run. A run-down on the rules for this would be really helpful.
When you import a module in Python using *, you include access to all classes and methods in the module. For manage_crop and create_crop, the crops.py file is able to access the methods from crop_class.py as it has been imported (indirectly through wheat_class and/or potato_class). Hope that helps!Have a look at the import and modules documentation for more information.
