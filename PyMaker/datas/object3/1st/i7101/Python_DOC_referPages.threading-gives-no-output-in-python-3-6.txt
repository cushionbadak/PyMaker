Here's my code:The output should be various lines telling the current time. But after running the program I got no output and no error. Why is this happening? I use Python 3.6.
Probably the first question is why you're using _thread. I am guessing your issue is that your main thread finishes before print_time manages to produce any output, and on this particular system, that exits the whole program. From the section Caveats in the _thread documentation:When the main thread exits, it is system defined whether the other threads survive. On most systems, they are killed without executing try â€¦ finally clauses or executing object destructors.When using threading instead, you get to choose whether to await threads with the daemon argument. 
Use threading:The threading module provides an easier to use and higher-level threading API built on top of this [_thread] module.
