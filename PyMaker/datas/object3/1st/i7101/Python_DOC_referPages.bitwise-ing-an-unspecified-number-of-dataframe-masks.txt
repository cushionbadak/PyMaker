So I'm used to combining dataframe masks like so:final_mask = mask1 & mask2But what if I want to combine many masks? For example, the list:[mask1, mask2, mask3, mask4, ..., mask20]
You can use pandas cookbook solution, last paragraph with reduce:Another solution from ayhan comment working on 1d mask (masks are Series):As ayhan pointed, first solution  also works with 2D masks:ValueError: cannot copy sequence with size 4 to array axis with dimension 3
Probably, the easiest way is using a for loop:Notice though that, although it is easy to understand, this way may not be considered the most "pythonic" way. Using reduce, as pointed by others, makes your code shorter but may not be easier to read by novices.
