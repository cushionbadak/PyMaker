Python has 42 builtin functions,however, official documentation lists 68 built-in Functions.2. Built-in Functions â€” Python 3.6.2 documentationIt is easy to get just 42 built-in functions:output:It is easier to categorize all the builtins by 'type'What's the logic underlying?
The objects listed under Built-in Functions in the docs aren't there because of their type. They're there because they're callable, and they do something deemed interesting enough to document when you call them. From a duck-typing perspective, they're functions.Many of them are types, such as int and super.
