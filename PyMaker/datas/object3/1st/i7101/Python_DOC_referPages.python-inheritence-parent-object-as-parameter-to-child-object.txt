I am having some issues with an inheritence model. i want to create a new child object from  a given parent object and i would like to access those properties.Here is a simplified model of my structure.I want all the attributes from the new object to be inherited in the x object.Thanks
At first, as PEP8 Style Guide says, "Class names should normally use the CapWords convention." So you should rename your classes to be Foo and Bar.Your task can be done by using object.__dict__ and by overriding the __init__ method in your child class (Bar)But this is not a conventional way of doing things. If you want to have an instance, that is a copy of another, you should probably use the copy module and do not do this overkill.
