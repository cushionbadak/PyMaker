I have a part in my program that requires working with directories.My current code is:Variable path prints: 'C:Users\\name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup'.My question is how can I make var path print 'C:Users/name/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup'
As suggested in the comments the system does it. You are better off changing os.sep or os.path.sep but however you can do this.But you can simply use this though,Well both are the same as mentioned in the comments!. Also os.path.join does not depend upon os.sep or os.path.sep so changing them doesn't prove any effect.
Use the .replace() method of strings
You can replace '\\' with '/'
