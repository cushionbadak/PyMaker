I would like to use assertions, so that my script exists, when assertions fail.For that I wrote an own function, which stops the scriptIs there a way to do that with pythons native assertions?
As has been pointed out, an unhandled AssertionError, as thrown by assert, should already stop your script. assert always fails if the condition being tested doesn't evaluate to True. That is, as long as you do not start in optimized mode, in which case it will not throw an AssertionError.SoShould be what you want, if you absolutely want to call sys.exit() and use assert, althoughwill stop your script just as fine and provide a stacktrace, which saves you the trouble of entering a custom error message each time you call assert_exit, and points you directly to the offending party.
