Javascript Constructor + create objects examplewhat is the python equivalent of this? (Constructor function / or class + create object instances + log out properties & methods?)Is there a difference between self from python and this from Javascript?
Here is a python translation:You must declare a class, then initialize that class as follows:Some notable differences is that self is not implicitly available but is actually a required parameter to all instance functions of the class. However, you should consult  the documentation  for python classes for more information.EditAs of python3.7, I feel obligated to show that newly introduced dataclasses are the most pythonic way of writing this kind of a class and may be of some help to you future python developers.  
There was some errors on the python solution fixed it nowResult print outA title123457Using print(courseB.update_views) outputs this though,<bound method Course.update_views of <__main__.Course object at 0x7f9f79978908>> , use print(courseB.update_views())
