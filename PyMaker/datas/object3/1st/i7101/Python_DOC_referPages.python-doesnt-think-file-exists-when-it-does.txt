I have this function in my code:Which prints out:When I copy and paste this command into my shell, it works absolutely beautifully. However, trying to run this in Python results in:OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directoryOn that line. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance.
Figured it out. I needed to add shell=True to the command. Does anyone know if this will cause any security vulnerabilities?Edited command:
