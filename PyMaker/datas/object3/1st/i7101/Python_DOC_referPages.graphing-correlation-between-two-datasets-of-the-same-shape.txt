I have two datasets, array1 and array2, with the exact same shapes of (365, 180, 140). The first array has values for precipitation, while the second array has values for dust concentration in the atmosphere. The first element in the array represents the day, and the second and third elements represent longitude and latitude. I would like to show the correlation between these two datasets on a scatter plot. I would like to have the values for precipitation on the x-axis, and values for dust concentration on the y-axis. Basically, I want to take the values at every index in array1, assign it as the x-coordinate, and take the values at the corresponding index in array2, and assign it as the y-value. Does anyone know how I can achieve this? Thank you so much in advance.EDIT: What I mean by "every index" is this: For example, I would like to take array1[1, 1, 1], assign as a x coordinate, and take array2[1, 1, 1], and assign as a y coordinate, and plot the resulting point on a scatter plot. I would then like to plot [1, 2, 1] , [1, 3, 1], [1, 4, 1], and so on. 
It sounds like you want to plot every single entry in array1 against its corresponding entry in array2.The scatter function in matplotlib automatically flattens n-dimensional arrays, so something like this should work:You could also be more explicit and flatten the arrays yourself (the indices will be preserved):And to provide a full working example, here's some code that creates these arrays and plots them, assuming precipitation will be negatively correlated with dust concentration with some noise.  NOTE: Scatter plots are very slow to render in matplotlib, so for your dimensions, 365x180x140, it may take a while to plot.Here is the figure this creates:
