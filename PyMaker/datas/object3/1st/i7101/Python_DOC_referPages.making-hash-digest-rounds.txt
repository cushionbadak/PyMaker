I'm trying to create a function that will take the sha1 hash and update it 500 times with itself, so for example:What I want to do is take the hash of the original string test and rehash it into another hash, from the given hash.I'm having some trouble doing this:When this code is run, it's giving me the following error:If I'm understanding this correctly, what this error is telling me is that when I'm trying to re-update the hash object it's resulting in None. However, I've tried a few different things, and I'm not entirely sure how I can successfully do this. How can I create a new hash object inside of a for loop from a given hash?
I think I figured this out, by creating a new hash object and hexdigesting the string before the rounds, I might be able to speed up performance by moving the hash object creation outside of the for loop. If anyone has any other ideas, I would be excited to see them:
