Was hoping someone could help me in trying to print a class method's variable. As show below in my code, I want to print variable A of the method "on_status", which is part of my class MyStreamListener. Is this possible? Bit of a noob question...appreciate any insight. Thank you!
Firstly, you should not describe your class's ordinary methods as "class methods". In Python, as "class method" is a method that is called on a class, rather than on an object of a class. Such methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator, and take as their first parameter the class (named cls by convention) rather than an object (named self by convention). (So a MyStreamListener class method could be called as either MyStreamListener.my_class_method(), or as myStreamListener.my_class_method(), where myStreamListener is an object of type MyStreamListener.)Secondly, if you assign a variable self.A within a method, that variable belongs to the object, not the method, and can be accessed anywhere where the object is available, as object_var.A, where object_var is a variable holding the object. If you're inside a method, then you would use self.A. If you're in client code that has just instantiated your class as myStreamListener, then you would use myStreamListener.A.Thirdly, if you will be accessing A from outside on_status, where it might not have been initialised yet, you should initialise it with some sensible value in __init__.
