I have a Javascript code that generates a string (similar to uuid) stringHere it is the js code:  How can I generate this string with python?
Using regular expression substitution and the new secrets module of Python 3.6 - this is not equivalent to the JavaScript code because this Python code is cryptographically secure and it generates less collisions / repeatable sequences.The secrets documentation says:The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.In particularly, secrets should be used in preference to the default pseudo-random number generator in the random module, which is designed for modelling and simulation, not security or cryptography.You'd want this for your IDs to be truly as unique as possible, instead of the Mersenne Twister MT19937 -using random which actually is built to specifically yield a repeatable sequence of numbers.For Python <3.6 you can do
Python provides UUID generation by default:
So basically you want some random hex digits:Where 10, 4, 4, 4, 10 are lengths of each segment in your format string. You may want to add a seed, but basically this does what your JS code does, producing strings like 'f693a7aef0-9528-5f38-7be5-9c1dba44b9'.
