I'm trying to sort an array of strings by comparing the concatenation of the strings, so that when you concatenate all the strings in the array, you get the largest value. However, I keep getting the error in the sorting function: ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpackWhy is this happening? Can I not compare values like this in the sorting function? Problem is inspired by https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/
The key function takes only a single argument. The value passed to your key function is simply the element in your collection that is currently being considered for positioning in the sorted version of your list. It is not doing any actual comparisons. The sort function does that internally.There is another function called cmp which does perform a comparison. It takes two arguments, see docs for more specific details.
