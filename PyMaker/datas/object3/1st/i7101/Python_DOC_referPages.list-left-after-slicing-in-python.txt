I'm trying to find an elegant way to obtain the list left after slicing.Here's my code:Aside from issues regarding managing the index, this method really is very hacky.Is there a way to do it.In essence after the first iteration, I should have,and after the second,and so on.Can someone help me with this.
Use itertools.combinations:
If you want elegance, take advantage of the implicitness of the addition operator that the list datatype implements.I'm not sure if this is what you were going for, though.
I prefer @AshwiniChaudhary's answer to my own, but I'm always a fan of list comprehension:Then if you're just looking for a single 'list left' at a given index, you can remove the outer layer and set current to your index.
