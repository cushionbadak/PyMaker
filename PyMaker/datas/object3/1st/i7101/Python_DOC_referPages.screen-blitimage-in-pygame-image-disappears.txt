I'm trying to blit an image in a pygame window based on one event, a midi input, and then blit another image based on the next event, another midi input. What happens here is that the image pops up just for a second when I press a key on the midi keyboard. I need it to stay in the window, even after I enter another input and blit another image. What happens with this is that each key on my midi keyboard gets recorded as a number (1-88) and added to NoteList[] then an image is blit in the window using h, an item in NoteList as the x coordinate. In my actual pygame the h variable will also go through a bunch of functions, I am just trying to figure out this part in a simpler pygame window.
You need to define the NoteList outside of the while loop if the notes should persist, otherwise you create a new empty list each iteration.You can use the enumerate function to shift the position:
I belive that the problem is that you fill the screen every time the while loop runs but you just blit that image on the screen when the event occurs...Try this:
