I was helped with this line but don't understand it completely. Any insight would be amazing!
Explanation:Your function drunks() takes 2 arguments (bottle and end).The built-in print() function takes unlimited number of positional arguments (in your case, they are 3).So it will print the three values, separated by the default delimiter (which is a space).First expression (bottle or 'No more'):Python supports short-circuit evaluation. See the first row of the table in the link: x or y | if x is false, then y, else xSo in your case bottle or 'No more', if bottle is a falsy value, No more will be printed. But if bottle is a truthy one, it will be printed (I don't know what type bottle is, but I think it is an integer).Second expression (bottle + ('s' if bottle - 1 else '')):Here, at first bottle is always printed.Then, we append the result of 's' if bottle - 1 else ''. We append the letter s if bottle - 1 is a truthy value (not a falsy one), otherwise we append an empty string (which is simply nothing).In the end, we print the end parameter, which can also be any type of value.
When you say print bottle or '...', it's saying if bottle!=0. If you inputed 0 into this, you would get the no more bottles, if you type in 1, you'll get singular bottle as opposed to bottles. For the second if statement, you'll always write bottles unless bottle - 1 = 0 (when bottle equals 1)
