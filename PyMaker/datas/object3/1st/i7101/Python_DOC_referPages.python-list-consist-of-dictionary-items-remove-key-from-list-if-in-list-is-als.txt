I have dictionary of seasons and months.I have a program which asks open times from user. User can put there both seasons, holiday times and months and program makes a list of these. My problem is that if in this list there are both key and value, the value is excessive. So if in list there is both summer and june, june is excessive. So if list is like this:open_time = [may, june, september, october, summer]the june should delete, so it should look like this:open_time = [may, september, october, summer]I have tried:How this should be done?
It sounds like you want to remove a month from a list if the season that describes that month is already in the list.  Because you want to look up the value of month given the key of season, an efficient way to do this would be to reverse the dict you have and use a set rather than a list for open_time:
I don't know if I managed to understand what you want but here is a try with comments explaining what I tried to do.
I came up with this code:
If I understand correctly you are trying to remove keys from your dictionary.  Instead of creating a list, just remove the keys as you iterate.
