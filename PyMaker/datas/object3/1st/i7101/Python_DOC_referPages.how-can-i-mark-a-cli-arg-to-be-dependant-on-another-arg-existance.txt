I am using python3.4The question refers to the https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html package  If I want an arg --with_extra_actions to always acompany --arg1 or --arg2 and give an error message if one of those two is missing?  Examples:command --arg1 --with_extra_actions  That should workcommand --arg2 --with_extra_actions  That should workcommand --with_extra_actions That should fail with informative error.  I am doing it right now in the code itself. No issue there, but is there an intrinsic way for the argparse lib to do this?  
You can do it using add_mutually_exclusive_group. Here example(test.py):Now let's check our script:Let's try with arg1 and arg2:Without any errors:Hope this helps.
