I'm very new to OOP (python) and i'm just practicing some basic stuff these days. im trying to write a prog that will create a file at a desired location and the file name should not be hardcoded ,it will be passed as an argument to the script. this is what i'm doing. please tell me where am i going wrong because this creates a file name with the name that i pass in the open function
The problem is in the open call, which should be:Instead of:This is because "filename" is simply the string with the letters "filename", while filename means the variable named "filename", and so its content (which in this case is the argument that you passed) will be used as the name of the file.As a side note, it is recommended that you instead use open in the following way:This is a context manager, an intuitive but powerful feature in Python that will make sure that the file is correctly closed no matter the errors that may take place during its usage.
Please remove the double quotes around the filename string in the open function
