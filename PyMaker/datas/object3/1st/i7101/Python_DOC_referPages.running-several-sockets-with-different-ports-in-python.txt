I'm trying to run several sockets on different ports as the following:Socket:And Runner:When I run FireStarter, it runs only the first instance of socket. I've read that there is "threading" library which can run several processes in async, but anyway there is no result, cause in console I see that "FIRST INITIALIZED". How to run the second or the third socket listener? May be there is another approach to do this.
You have two problems in that code.The first one: here the second socket is waiting for the first one to end as it is trapped in the while loop:The second one is this join sentence thr.join(), with that you are forcing the second thread to wait for the first one, avoiding to run it in parallel.Probably the approach I would follow is spawning a thread within the initialize function inside your Receiver class and manage the thread there (maybe extending the Thread class), with that you avoid to spawn by yourself a new thread each time and you have your code more encapsulated.
