I already asked my question but It was too complicated to understand. So it is the question in a very simple way.What I want is to have flow control on a loop with thread in a class in python3.Suppose this code:so the output would be something like this:After stopping the thread with thr.stop() it continues to print the i contents but the value of self.stop_event has been set to True. what I want is to control a the looping whenever I want and of course I want it to be in a class not in a main body of my program.
While using threadings, you can't use the plain value as the event.You should use the threading.Event to communicate between threads.Check the link for detail.
With the help of @Gribouillis The problem seems to be fixed. I also need to say using a threading.Event object inside a thread which has an endless loop is not a good idea and if you want to start multiple instances of a thread it can be declared many times and don't try to start/stop the only instance of a thread.
