Natural Text
Say customPassFile.txt has two lines in it. First line is "123testing" and the second line is "testing321". If passwordCracking = "123testing", then the output would be that "123testing" was not found in the file (or something similar). If passwordCracking = "testing321", then the output would be that "testing321" was found in the file. I think that the for loop I have is only reading the last line of the text file. Any solutions to fix this?
The main problem with your code is that you open the file and you read it multiple times. The first time the file object position goes to the end and stays there. Next time you read the file nothing happens, since you are already at the end of the file.ExampleSometimes an example is worth more than lots of words.Take the file test_file.txt with the following lines:Now open the file and read it twice:The second time nothing happen, as the file object is already at the end.SolutionHere you have two options:you read the file only once and save all the lines in a list and then use the list in your code. It should be enough to replacewith you reset the file object position after you read the file using seek. It would be something along the line:I would go with option 1., unless you have memory constraint (e.g. the file is bigger than memory)NotesI have a few extra notes:python starts counters with 0 (like c/c++) and not 1 (like fortran). So probably you want to set:when you read a file, the new line character \n is not stripped, so you have to do it (with strip) or account for it when comparing strings (using e.g. startswith). As example:will likely always return False as passwordChecking contains  \n and passwordCracking very likely doesn't.DisclamerI haven't tried the code, nor my suggestions, so there might be other bugs lurking around.
**I will delete this answer after OP understands the problem in indentation of I understand his intention of his code.*Here your code is outside of for loop so only last line is cached.
