I have NumPyI usedI want the output is list of element appear more than 2 times in the dataset.
To get the list of element appear more than 2 times in the dataset.
You need to test if the highest count in the counter is greater than 2; you can use Counter.most_common() to extract the highest count:Counter.most_common() returns a list of (value, count) pairs, even when you ask for just a single pair; [0] gets that one (value, count) pair from the list, and [1] extracts the count.
