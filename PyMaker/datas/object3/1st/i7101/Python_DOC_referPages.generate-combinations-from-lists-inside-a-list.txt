I have a list with lists which has cominations like baselist = [['Store3', 'Store4', 'Store5'], ['Rack1', 'Rack2'], ['Box1', 'Box2']] and try to generate a list with Strings like:I've tried it with itertools and collections. But in the end I have no idea how to solve this. What's the right way to a solution?
itertools.product is exactly the way to go. Did you try unpacking the list before passing it to the function?Let me break it down:itertools.product(*baselist) generates combinations in the form of a list of tuplesmap(''.join, ...) joins each product list together'\n'.join(...) will ready your output for printing
