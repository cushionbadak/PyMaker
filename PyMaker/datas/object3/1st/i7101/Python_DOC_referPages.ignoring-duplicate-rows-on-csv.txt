I am trying to read a CSV file and writing the rows in it on to another csv file. My input file has duplicate rows. In output I want only single row. from my sample script you can see that I created a list called readers . This list got all the rows of input csv. Then inside the for loop I am using writer.writerow(readers[1] + ....) which is basically reading the first row following the header. But the problem is this first row is repetitive. How can I tweak my script so it is executed only once ?Sample Input
You may use the pandas package. That would be something like this:You may check the references here, and here
You can use set type to remove duplicatesreaders_unique = list(set(readers))
While the answers above are basically correct, using Pandas for this seems like overkill to me. Simply use a list with the ID column values you already have seen in processing (assuming that the ID column earns its name, otherwise you have to use a combined key). Then just check if you already saw this value and "presto":
