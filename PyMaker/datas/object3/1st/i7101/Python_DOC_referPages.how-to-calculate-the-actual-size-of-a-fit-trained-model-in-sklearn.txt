Is it possible to calculate the size of a model ( let's say a Random Forest classifier ) in scikit-learn?  For example:Can I determine the size of clf?
Along the same lines as Nijan's answer, you can also do it without having to save the model, using pickle:It will return the size in bytes.
A way to do it is to dump the model in a file using joblib.dump and then calculate the file size. Based on the previous example, you would use: joblib.dump(clf, fname)   os.path.getsize(fname)
