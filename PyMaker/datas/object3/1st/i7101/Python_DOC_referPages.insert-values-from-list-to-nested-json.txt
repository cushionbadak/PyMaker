Natural Text
I have a nested json that looks like this:And I have a string that looks like this:I want to insert the string into the json with a name for the value. Each four in the string is for each person in the json.Final result should look like this:I have tryied with some iterations, but fails all the time :/Hope you can help me!
I'm assuming your data structures are python dicts and lists, and not strings containing json-text.First, turn your flat list of things to insert into a list of chunks of 4 items each. You can read up on some other ways of doing that here.Resulting in:Then, iterate over the two collections simultaneously. You can use zip for this:After that, your collection should look like expected.
Alternative to answer 1:Results in
A compact way to do this is to use the iter and zip functions to break the new data up into chunks. outputWe could also put the "chunkifying" step into the main for loop:but I think the previous version is a little more readable.
