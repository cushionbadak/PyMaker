Natural Text
I have a csv file which looks like following:I am using the fileinput method to do some operation in the file, but I want to skip the operation on the first (header) line, though still keeping it there. I have tried using next(f) and f.isfirstline(), but they delete the header line. I want to keep the header line intact, though not doing any operation on it. 
You can use enumerate to easily keep track of the line numbers:
You can use iter and skip it with next:This way you will just get the overhead of creating the iterator once, but will not create the indexes nor compute an if in each iteration loop as in @JonathonReinhart solution (wich is also valid).
