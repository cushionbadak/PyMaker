A python newbie question:I would like to print in python with the c format with a list of parameters:How can I print using python as:This is a test 1, 2, 3, helloThanks.
Strings overload the modulus operator, %, for printf-style formatting, and special case tuples for formatting using multiple values, so all you need to do is convert from list to tuple:
Have a look at the % operator. It accepts a string and a tuple like that:
Using new-style formatting: How about these one?  (just experementing here)Docs: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.htmlOr this one:Or simply:All print:This is a test 1, 2, 3, hello
Tuple:Example:In your case:Or use the new-style string formatting:Or pass the values as parameters and print will do it:Source
Hope this works !Cheers bud!
