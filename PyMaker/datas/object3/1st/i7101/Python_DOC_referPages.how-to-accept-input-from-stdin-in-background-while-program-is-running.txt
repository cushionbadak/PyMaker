Natural Text
I have a python program which takes several minutes to finish. I have some debugging code which is printed only when a variable is set. the variable is set through command line or environment variable in my current implementation. I want to enable/disable debugging on the fly when program is executing. For example, consider following code: So while the program is executing with debugging off, how can I dynamically enable debugging while the program is executing? In other words, how can I execute function enable_debugging (maybe in a separate thread), when a particular string is inputted? 
After some experiments using thread module, following code works for me. A listener thread keeps listening to the stdin.
One approach can be to read the value from a file at regular interval. And update that file when you want debugging on or off.
