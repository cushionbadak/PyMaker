This question already has an answer here:How to generate a random UUID which is reproducible (with a seed) in Python                    3 answers                With python's random number generator it is possible to set a seed and get the same sequence of random numbers. Is there a similar way to generate a same sequence of uuid's (with python's uuid module)?
Edit: Sorry, misread the question. The first part was irrelevant.Yes, Python's random module supports 'reproducable sequences'. See:https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#notes-on-reproducibilitySeeded UUIDs have been discussed here:How to generate a random UUID which is reproducible (with a seed) in Python
