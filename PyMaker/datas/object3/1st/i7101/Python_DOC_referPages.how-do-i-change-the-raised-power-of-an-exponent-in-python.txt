Natural Text
I am trying to fetch a value from a webpage that is in scientific notation 3.67E+17 and then convert it to a form 0.367E+18. Or if the scientific notation is 0.367E+18, then fetch exactly that value. I have been able to implement the part where I open up the webpage and then find where that scientific number is, however, I haven't been able to convert the number itself to the form that I want.I got this far though:I have been able to figure out how many decimal places I need to shift, either left or right, however, how do I actually shift them?
result will be the new mantissa for exponent 18
