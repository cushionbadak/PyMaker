I am new to Python, so apologies if my question is very basic, but this is driving me crazy.So, I created a 2D numpy array of floats, with a string row header. I would like to save the array so that I could re-open it and work it later.I tried to use np.savetxt as follows:np.savetxt('1_array', waves)but it gives the obvious error:TypeError: Mismatch between array dtype ('|S11') and format specifier ('%.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e %.18e')I looked for a solution, but I don't seem to find any that would be appropriate for my case. Intuitively, there should be a way to specify the only the first row is a string, but I couldn't figure out how to do this.Any help will be greatly appreciated!
You need to save the header separate and save the rest as float.
I don't understand why would you like to mix types in a single numpy array, but it's not really important here. Probably the simplest solution to save anything for later is using module pickle. Below piece of code which should solve you problem no matter what you put into the array:
