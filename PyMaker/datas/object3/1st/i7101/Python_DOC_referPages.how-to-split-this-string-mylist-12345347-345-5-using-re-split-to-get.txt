Your first solution fails because + and * are regex metacharacters - if you want to use them as literals, you need to escape them. The following would have worked:Note that I used a raw string - always a good idea with regexes to reduce the number of backslashes you'd need otherwise.Your second solution fails because - is a metacharacter in a character class (and there is no "range of characters between + and *). By placing it at the start or end of the character class, - loses its special meaning, so the following would have worked:
You can use re.findall('\d+', string):Explanation: \d is a digit (a character in the range 0-9), and + means 1 or more times. So, \d+ is 1 or more digits.
output is ['123', '45', '34', '7', '3', '45', '5']\W Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [^a-zA-Z0-9_].For more information refer to Python Docs for regular expressions usage
