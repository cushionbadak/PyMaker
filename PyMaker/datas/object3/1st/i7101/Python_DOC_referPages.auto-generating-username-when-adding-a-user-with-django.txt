I am trying to save username as firstname while adding a user from django admin. Currently it saves None in the username field as I have excluded username in the custom model.admin.py--forms.pymodels.py --How can I insert username as firstname and make the custom field ie email 'required'. Now the password1 & password2 fields are mandatory.Any help/link is highly appreciated.
You can define username as a readonly field.For your second question about validating email, define a form for CustomUserAdmin.Or:
To automatically populate username with the user's first name, you should use a signal - add the following to the models.py where you've defined UserProfile:The problem with this is that if you have two users with the same first name, the username won't be unique, so you'll get an integrity error from the database. You could check for uniqueness and append a number until you get a unique value:Or, if you're not using the username at all, you could just set it to a random unique value using uuid:If you plan on using emails for login rather than username, you'll also need to enforce email uniqueness, add the email to the admin user creation form - this should do what you need: https://gist.github.com/gregplaysguitar/1184995
