Natural Text
I have recently read about dirname and basename. My book uses the following image to explain the difference between them:I am currently using OSX so my root folder will be /. I wrote the following code in my shell:The result that I got was: '' Then I wrote the following code to check the basename:os.path.basename(path) and the result that I got this time was: '\\Users\\apple\\Documents\\list.txt! Whats happening over here? How to fix it?Also, I don't have any text file whose name is list. Shouldn't this cause an error when I was trying to find the dirname and basename of a file that does not exist!?
OSX, just like Linux, uses / as a separator. You can get the standard separator for your OS from os.path.sep.Notice that os.path is just constructing "correct" paths, it does not do any checking, if files exist. That would not make much sense, if you constructed a path to create a new file. You could use os.path.exists() for that.
