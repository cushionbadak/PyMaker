my program shown below has the goal of outputting statements based off two criteria:(Year and Location) Once that was accomplished, my next goal is to match year with Yearlink and Location with location. location and year are both input statements. The output should be a statement that outputs values from that row. For some reason, I always receive an error about too many values to unpack. My excel sheet is posted if anyone wants a better idea of what I am talking about. Anyway I tried everything but nothing was working for me.
Have you considered using a DictReader? That variable unpacking does seem like a bit of a code smell, and would be much more subject to errors, as opposed to just loading the entire row into a dictionary.
