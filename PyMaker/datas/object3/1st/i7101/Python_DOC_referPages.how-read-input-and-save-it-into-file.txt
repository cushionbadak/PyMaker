I'm learning programming in Python. And as my first attempt, I'm trying to make a program that needs the user to key in the user's data and then the program stores it. If possible, write it to a .txt file.I started with this;But it only runs once, so I tried this:But it doesn't do what my first code did. How can I make it keep going.
None of the other solutions will work, since you have to return something from your function.If you want to be able to add multiple user, you can do something like this, using a while loop:Here I also check for valid input, something you also need to do in your userData function to avoid user submitting bad values (like string for years, an invalid gender, or invalid name, e.g. containing numbers)
IT SHOULD WORK NOW.
You are missing the parentheses, so change this:to this:and you will be fine.
First of all, you are missing the parentheses in your function call, so it should be something like this:Then, in order to make the program keep asking user for input you should make use of a loop to do that:To stop execution, you press Ctrl+C.Then, in order to write that into a file, use the open() function in Python:
I think you might want to do that
