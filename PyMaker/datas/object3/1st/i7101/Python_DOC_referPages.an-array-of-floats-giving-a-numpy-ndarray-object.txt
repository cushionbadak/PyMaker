This is a followup question from the one I posted a few minutes ago. The problem I was having with multiplying int with float is fixed, thanks to user2357112 in the comments. However, it's come across another roadblock.Code:Code in ideone: http://ideone.com/DO1otSError:I am confused about why final[i] was recognized as a numpy.ndarray object. I thought that, since final is a 1-dimensional array, final[i] will therefore return the value (a float) within that array at index i. I'm not sure why that is not the case. Thank you in advance!
This is the answer to your question "I am confused about why final[i] was recognized as a numpy.ndarray object." In the following snippet of codeI skipped non-essential code. The code above shows that r is a numpy.ndarray and initial is a list. Then final is a product of a numpy.ndarray and a list. The result of this product is a numpy.ndarray.What is also important is that r is an array of floats. Therefore final is also an array of floats and not fraction objects. Therefore you cannot call limit_denominator() on elements of final.In addition, code such as:looks quite suspicious.
