I have started learning python and programming in general a few days ago just for fun and i've encountered a small roadblock.I'm trying to compare the values in 2 user generated lists and add the bigger value between each counter increment in a 3rd list such as:    a = [1 2 3]    b = [3 4 1]the result should be     c = [3 4 3]This is my code so far but i am getting an "IndexError: list assignment index out of range"
Note that a more Pythonic way to do that would be this:If it can be the case that the two lists do not have the same number of items you can use zip_longest from itertools:
zip your listsIterate through the sequence and find out the max item of zipped tuple.
You need to do myList3.append(myList[i]) and myList3.append(myList2[i]) instead of myList3[i] = myList[i] and myList3[i] = myList2[i], since the index doesn't exist yet so you can't assign it directly
