I created a file in the current directory with echo "foo" > foo. I then tried to pass that file to subprocess.run, but I seem to misunderstand how file paths are handled in Python, since I'm getting an error. What's wrong? My test codeyieldsWhat is a PathLike object? How to I get it from open('foo')? Where can I find more information about how files are handled in Python?
There's no need to open the file in the first place. You can simply runThe cat command is being run as a shell command by your machine, so you should just be able to pass the file name as a string.Python does not handle the file at all. The point of subprocess is to pass a command to the underlying system (in this case, apparently a UNIX based OS). All you are doing is passing a plaintext command to the command line.I won't, however, discourage you from reading about file handling. Look at this documentation.
