I figure this is pretty basic, but can't seem to figure out even how to ask google the right question.  I am using this python websocket client to make some websocket connections.  Let's just assume I'm using the code example similar to that page:So what I am trying to do is add more arguments to the on_open function, something like this:But i can't figure out how to pass these arguments in, so I tried in the main thread:But i get the error:TypeError: on_open() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)How am I going to pass these new arguments to my on_open function?

Look at the implementation of partial in the doclink for more details.
You can use a lambda to wrap the call:
