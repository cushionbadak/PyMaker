How can I add/subtract hexadecimal's that the user inputs?Like: I get: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'How do I do this? Must I convert them to int? Then I can't have them as hex (0xFFFFFF)...?The only way I can do it is:But this requires me to enter basehex/sechex as numbers, since int won't take it otherwise:Thanks :) 
Thanks to @Peri461This code will do it, by converting the hexadecimals to decimals, subtracting them, then converting(representing) them to hexadecimals again.
