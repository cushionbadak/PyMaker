I have one class (Bar) embedded inside another class (Foo).To access the attributes of class Bar, the user would need to the following:How can I setup a short dot notation so that users can use BOTH:and In my example, I'm trying to demonstrate that Bar class has a lot of variables.  So I don't want to write a getter/setter for each one manually.  So I was thinking to use the property() in a for loop like this:But I'm unsure how to use property in this context without manually writing several setter functions.  Any suggestions on how to allow access to both shorter and longer notations?
That's what the __getattr__hook is ideally suited for:__getattr__ is only called for attributes that are missing; so only attributes that are not already present on instances of Foo() are passed to Foo().__getattr__(). The getattr() function then lets you use the same attribute name on self.bar; if the attribute doesn't exist there either, an AttributeError is thrown, as would be expected.
