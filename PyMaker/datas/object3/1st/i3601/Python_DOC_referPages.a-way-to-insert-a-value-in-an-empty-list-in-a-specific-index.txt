is there a way to insert a specific value into a List into a specific index. List should be completly emptyL should give out the values of L [ , ,2]
That is not possible. Lists cannot have "holes"; every slot in the list must contain a value.You have two options:Fill the list with dummy values:Use a dict rather than a list:A dict is a mapping between arbitrary values, so it can handle "holes" with no problem.
iterables in Python must have objects inside. You can fill the list with None up to the place you want your actual value NoneThe sole value of types.NoneType. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function.
