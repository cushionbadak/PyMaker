Is it possible to create a iterator/generator which will decide on the next value based on some result on the previous iteration?i.e.I would like the logic of choosing the next x to depend on the calculation result allowing different logic for different results, much like in a search problem.I also want to keep the how to choose the next x and the calculation on x as separate as possible.
Did you that you can send to a generator using generator.send? So yes, you can have a generator to change its behaviour based on feedback from the outside world. From the doc:generator.send(value)Resumes the execution and “sends” a value into the generator function.  The value argument becomes the result of the current yield expression.  The send() method returns the next value yielded by the generator  [...]ExampleHere is a counter that will increment only if told to do so.UsageSince iteration with a for-loop does not allow to use generator.send, you have to use a  while-loop.OutputMake it work in a for-loopYou can make the above work in a for-loop by crafting a YieldReceive class.Usage
It's possible but confusing. If you want to keep the sequence of x values and the calculations on x separate, you should do this explicitly by not involving x with an iterator.If you want the loop to execute exactly i times, then use a for loop:
