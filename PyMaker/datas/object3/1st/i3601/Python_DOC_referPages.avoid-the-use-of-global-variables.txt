I'm trying to use this function to return two lists using the class dircmp from the filecmp module. I need to use the lists generated in multiple different parts throughout my code, for now I've been doing this by making the list a global variable. I would like to know if there is a solution to return both lists that have fully appended after the function is done recursing through sub-directories. This way I don't need to keep creating global variables for every function through my code. For reference the functions recurse in the same way, but they track a different set of data, for example same_files which need to split into same_leftpath_list and same_rightpath_list.
There are two common ways of solving your problem: passing in the lists as parameters and merging return values from the recursive calls.Here's how you could pass the lists as parameters.  We create a wrapper function to hide that implementation detail.Here's how you could manage it with return values.  This is usually a better approach.If you want to get fancier, you can use generators, but that's a slightly bigger change to your code.
