My main app is running with Python3I have a crucial package that I need to install which only support Python2...I'm running on windowsI thought of maybe setting this package on another virtual environment in addition to a flask server to be used for communication.Is there another way to pipe messages between apps beside a server?Is there a better way to go for Python2, Python3 mix?
How about using the subprocess module. You can start the Python 2 program as a subprocess of your Python 3 app. They can communicate via the subprocess PIPE. 
Flask is too heavy. Why not use socket and selectors?  offical example
