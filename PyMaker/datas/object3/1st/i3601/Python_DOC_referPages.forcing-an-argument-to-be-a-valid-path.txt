I'm writing a simple script that will be used parse the contents of a JSON file stored on AWS CloudWatch. I've added an argument parser to the script that will accept user input, and allow the user to either print the output of the file to the screen (in a predetermined fashion), or allow them to output the contents to a local JSON file. Here's a snippet of what's stumping me:My question stems from the parser.add_argument line, specifically the choices argument. I'd like to allow two inputs for this flag, those being either print or some valid path on their local machine. I'd like the choice that's currently marked by question marks to be a PATH that Python can recognize.Is there a way, using argparse, to specify that one of of the arguments to a flag must be a PATH? Search results have been, so far, inconclusive.Thanks in advance!
Use the type keyword argument to add_argument, instead of choices. As the documentation says:The type keyword argument of add_argument() allows any necessary  type-checking and type conversions to be performed.
Define a custom type (as in https://stackoverflow.com/a/14117511/1093967), where the value can be a valid path or 'print'. choices isn't the right choice here.
