Use sorted with key.Ex:Output:If want to maintain the order.
Use an OrderedDictIf you want you dict to be ordered, you should use an OrderedDict. You can sort the items from the first dict with a key.CodeOutputPython 3.6+ dict are orderedAlthough, if using Python 3.6+, insertion ordered is preserved for dict. This is specific to the CPython implementation and will only be an official language feature starting at version 3.7.CodeOutput
You can use lambda. Like : Or you can make it without using dict comprehension as Aran-Fey said:
