Consider the following code:My question is when does reading occur at the time of urlopen() is called or read() is called.
After reading again the doc and making a few tests, I can say that reading can occur in both.urlopen is a blocking call, and actually waits for the end of the headers part. At that point, the code and headers attributes are available.But if the server is slooooow, urlopen may return before all the data part has been received. In this case, read(n) may block if less than n bytes have been received, and read() will block until all the response has been received.Code demonstrating that:Server:Client:And here is an example of the client side:So:urlopen wait 3 seconds, up to the end of the header partfirst read (read(10)) waits 2 seconds more for the first part of the messagesecond read (read()) waits 5 seconds more for the end of the message
