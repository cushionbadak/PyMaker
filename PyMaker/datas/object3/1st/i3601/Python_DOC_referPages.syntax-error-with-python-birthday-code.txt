I am trying to learn to use this simple birthday one-liner in Python (3.6.5) but am getting SyntaxError: invalid syntax, can someone help me figure out where I've gone wrong:Thanks!
You've tagged this as python 3.x. This is python 2.x code. You needsince print is a function, not a statement in python 3. Also map returned a list in python 2 but now returns an iterator which needs to be wrapped in list in order to print the values.This is also slightly old-style python, a modern way of writing this would be
The reason why your code fails on python 3.x as already been answered by @FHTMitchell answer, that said, here's a simpler way to achieve what you want in both python2.x/3.x:There is a lot of ways to achieve this task, few more examples:lst = ["Happy Birthday to you"]*4; lst[1] = lst[1].replace("you", "dear Name"); print(lst)s1 = "Happy Birthday to you"; print([s1,s1.replace("you", "dear Name"),s1,s1])But if you ask me, my favourite one, even if not a oneliner, would be doing something like this:
Since we're playing lets find different ways to skin a cat.ps. I don't like lambdas, they're slow. On another note, thanks @FHTMitchell, I've always known list.insert() was slow but i had no idea it was SOO slow.Holy smokes!
