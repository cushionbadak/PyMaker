Byte literals start with 'b'. It creates a instance of bytes type instead of string type.You are getting an error as you have directly passed a string.Tryreturn data_file.strip().startswith(b'01BGMAX')This will tell python that it is a sequence of bytes and not Unicode characters 
Sounds like data_file is a bytes object, not a str. In which case .startsiwith requires a bytes argument (written as b'text'), not a unicode string (written as 'text'). In this case you wantProof
