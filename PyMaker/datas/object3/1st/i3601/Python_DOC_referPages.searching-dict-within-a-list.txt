If I have the following list of items for a shopping store:So I have several dicts within a list. I want to find out how to get the item dict knowing the item. For example:What's the shortest, most efficient way to do this?
If you intend to lookup entries by their 'item', then you should consider having a dict which keys are the 'item' instead of a list of dict.In particular, this makes the lookup O(1) instead of the O(n) required for traversing the list.If you cannot update the code that generated the original shop_list, then you can transform the already existing data with a dict-comprehension.
Then, you can call this function as:
You can try iterating through the list and just extract the dict that matches your shop item:Which works as follows:The above uses next() with a generator expression to iterate though the list until the condition is met, and returns None if item is not found. 
You can try this:This will return the list item if found and if the result is not found an empty list will be returned.
