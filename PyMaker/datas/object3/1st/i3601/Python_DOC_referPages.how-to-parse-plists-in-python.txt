Natural Text
I'm trying to parse through a massive file for an iTunes library and I'm attempting to use plistlib library, my code looks something like this:   As I do so, I get the error 'TypeError: startswith first arg must be str or a tuple of str, not bytes'.  I'm not sure what this is, any explanations?
As stated in the docs, plistlib.load takes a binary file object. You've given it a file opened in text mode.
