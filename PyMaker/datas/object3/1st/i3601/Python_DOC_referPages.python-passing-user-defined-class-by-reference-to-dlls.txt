I am currently working on a project that requires to access functions in DLLs, and I found ctypes to handle the function call for me. However, I encounter some difficulties when some functions ask to pass parameters by reference. I've tried the ctypes.by_ref() but it doesn't work because the object is a user-defined class.And then I gave ctypes.pointer() a try and it spits out the error message: "type must have storage info". I guess that means it only takes ctypes data types?My code:And the terminal output:I would like to know 1) what does that error message mean? and 2) the way to work around and pass a user-defined class by reference to an external DLL.Thank you in advance for your time.
The error message means that you can't create a ctypes pointer to a non-ctypes type.  ctypes types have the information needed to marshal values correctly to C.Read ctypes: Structures and Unions.  The first sentence is (emphasis mine):Structures and unions must derive from the Structure and Union base classes which are defined in the ctypes module.For example:Note that a pointer can be taken and that the raw bytes of the structure can be displayed.  The structure is little-endian and there are four bytes allocated for the c_int32, and two bytes each for the two c_int16 members.
