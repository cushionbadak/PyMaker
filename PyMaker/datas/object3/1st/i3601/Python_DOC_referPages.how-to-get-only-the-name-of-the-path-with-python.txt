In Python 3.4+, you can use the pathlib module (included in Python's standard library):
It seems that you're either looking for os.path.basename or os.path.splitext:
Use the os.path module to work with paths; the os.path.basename() function gives you the last part after the last path separator, and os.path.splitext() gives you the filename with the extension split off:Using the os.path functions ensures that your code will continue to work correctly on different operating systems, even if the path separators are different.In Python 3.4 or newer (or as a separate backport install), you can also use the pathlib library, which offers a more object-oriented approach to path handling. pathlib.Path() objects have a .stem attribute, which is the final component without the extension suffix:Demo:
