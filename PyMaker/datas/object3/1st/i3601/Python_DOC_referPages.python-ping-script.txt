I am trying to write a Python script that pings IP addresses and outputs whether each ping succeeded. So far I have the following code, but the output seems inaccurate. Namely, when I run the script, it pings each hostname as expected but the output is only ever all up or all down.
You should print the result immediately after pinging each hostname. Try this:Also, you should consider using the subprocess module instead of os.system() as the latter is deprecated.
