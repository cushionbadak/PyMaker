What does -m in python -m pip install <package> mean ? or while upgrading pip using python -m pip install --upgrade pip. 
From Python DocsThe argument is a module name, you must not give a file extension (.py). The module-name should be a valid Python module name, but the implementation may not always enforce this (e.g. it may allow you to use a name that includes a hyphen). Package names are also permitted. When a package name is supplied instead of a normal module, the interpreter will execute .main as the main module. This behaviour is deliberately similar to the handling of directories and zipfiles that are passed to the interpreter as the script argument.
The -m stands for module-name. From Command line and environment:python [-bBdEhiIOqsSuvVWx?] [-c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [args]
