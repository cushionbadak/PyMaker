I am using HtmlTestRunner to generate my test report, but I am not able to understand why I am getting this error: "TypeError: issubclass() arg 1 must be a class"My setup is Python 3.6, pytest, Ubuntu 17.10.This is the code I have written:The test suite runner:This is the resulting error:
Your problem is that you are passing the test module, instead of the test class, to the runner. If you look at unittest's documentation for loadTestsFromTestCase, you'll see its argument needs to be a TestCase-derived class.I reduced your example to a minimal version to simplify my answer a bit:In tests.py:runner.py, based on yours:This will give the following output:If I switch runner.py to use the class instead, it works:Output:You should be able to adapt this to your code. That being said, the pytest integration might not work with HtmlTestRunner, which is unittest-based. Make sure you look into pytest-html
