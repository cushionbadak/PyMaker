Is it possible to have a class attribute targeting another attribute from the same object and have a function to update the value of the target?Expected outcome:
I suggest making current_var a property that acts as a proxy for a given instance attribute. You can use set_current_var to update the proxy target.CodeExample
You can use the __dict__ of the object or as said by @bla setattr,And Enum so you don't use string to specify the attribute:I don't like using a string to specify the attribute, but this is solution
You can create a wrapper class for your MyObject attribute values. That way, a reference will exist from the contents of current_var to the attribute bound in __dict__:Output:
