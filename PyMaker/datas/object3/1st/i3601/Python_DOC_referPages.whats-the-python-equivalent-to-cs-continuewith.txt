What's the Python equivalent of this code?I assume that it'd use the asyncio library.  I know how to create a task in Python, but I can't find a simple example of something that does the same thing as C#'s ContinueWith()
You could use the Future.add_done_callback() callback registration function to do the same; echoing the lambda function support would be:So this:Creates a task for Foo()Registers a callback on this to be called when the task is done.The callback receives the task object, and passes that task object as the first argument to a lambda that creates a Bar() coroutine from this. The result of the lambda is then scheduled as a new task to be run.Then schedules the Foo() task; when that task completes the Bar() callback is called to run Bar().Demo:
