I coded this:My python version is the 3.6.5 so iÂ´m supposed to have the urllib2 installed already but every time i get this error:I changed the name to urllib3 as it appears in my anaconda folder but it  crashes anyway....what do i do?
Urllib2 is meant for Python 2, it is no longer used in Python 3.  The standard module is now called urllib (you can find the documentation for it here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html).  Try this instead:urllib.request.Request(): https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.Requesturllib.request.urlopen():https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlopen
