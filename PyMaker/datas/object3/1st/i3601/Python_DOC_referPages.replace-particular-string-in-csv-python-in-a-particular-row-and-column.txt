I have looked around but didnt quite find what i have problems with.The question i have about is that in the csv files called registro_usuarios.csv that has the following data. Which has 6 rows and 6 colmunsNow how do can i make a def that allows me to replace a 0 below ISBN1 or ISBN2 for a given RUT?... For example, i want to replace the ISBN1 of the rut 333 for 777. Then after using the def, it should change the data in the csv like this. since rows and columns starts with 0,0 i believe then ISBN1 of the rut 333 is row 3 column 5 if im not mistaken.
