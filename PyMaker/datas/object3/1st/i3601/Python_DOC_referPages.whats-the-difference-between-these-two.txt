This question already has an answer here:Difference between import tkinter as tk and from tkinter import                    3 answers                How to import other Python files?                    14 answers                Can someone please explain the difference betweenandIt would be so great if someone could give and example where the same task isachieved (or an object is created) by using these two statements seperately
Simply saying, the import tkinter as tk will initiate a tk instance of tkinter in your file which can call it's functions by writing something likeWhich will save you from typing the long name.while from tkinter import * will import all the names defined under the __all__ variable, so you can call the same function asYou should read This to understand more
Both are importing the same package. The primary difference is that your first line is importing the package tkinter and then referring to it with "tk", which would allow you to call its functions using that different name. I don't have any experience with tkinter, but a good example I can give would be with numpy or pandas. A lot of functions in numpy, like numpy.random.randn() could instead be written with a shorthand name using "import as", like so:
The differences seams little at first however import tkinter as tk is actually a much better option for one big reason.By importing as something specific you make all the methods from that import required a prifix. This prevents methods from overriding or being overwritten accidentally.For example if I have a library that contains a time() method and say lest call this library custom_timer and then say I need to import the built in time method also.If use * for my import we have a problem.What will end up happening is the 2nd import will override the time method from the first import. To prevent accidents like this we can simple import as your_prefix_here.Take this example.In this case we will have 2 distinctive imports for time that do not override each other.One is ct.time() and the other is time()Because libraries like tkinter contain many methods it is safer to use import as verses import * for the above reason.All that said if you are in a hurry and just want to throw something together to test an idea or answer a question using from tkinter import * is fine for much smaller applications. Personally I try to use import tkinter as tk for everything I do for good practice.As for your request for 2 examples see below.With tk import:With * import:
