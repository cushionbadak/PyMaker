How do i join two absolute paths in Python?e.g.The desired result is: C:/folder1/folder2/directory1/directory2/I tried os.path.join but it neglects the first path because it detects it's an absolute path. So what's the best way to join paths like this in Python?Thank you!
On Windows, I would use os.path.splitdrive combined with a strip of the separatorresult:(if the second path is a relative path, it also works)The seps = os.sep+os.altsep if os.altsep else os.sep line allows to be compatible with systems with no alternate separators (Linux). This solution works on Windows & Linux, os.splitdrive is a dummy on Linux (returning a tuple with empty first element)
Use the pathlib module to make the 2nd path relative and join it with the first one:To visualize what's happening, let's look at some intermediate output.Path.anchor gives you the drive letter (or / on linux) of an absolute path. If the path is relative, it returns the empty string:We can use this with Path.relative_to to turn path2 into a relative path. If it was already relative, it won't be affected by this operation:Finally, now that we have a relative path, it can trivially be combined with path1 with the / operator.
