I have a list of valuesand I want to return a list of True/False values based on whether or not there are consecutive duplicates. I also want to set a threshold so that I only start getting True's if there are at least 3 consecutive values.For example, the output of the list above would be...I don't really know what the most straightforward and robust way would be to do this. I did a for loop to check if the current value is equal to the next value, and set it to true, but that doesn't account for the beginning and end cases as well (for example one the first set of 3s I will get True, True, False)Also I feel like there's some difficulty with the beginning and ends of the list.
Use itertools.groupby() to group consecutive values, then turn those groups into repeated True or False values based on the length of each group:groupby() takes a callable to determine what to group on as the second argument, but without that callable, the default is to group on equality.Demo:If you want to return False for zeros, even if consecutive, use:v is the repeated value, and bool(v) is False for 0:
