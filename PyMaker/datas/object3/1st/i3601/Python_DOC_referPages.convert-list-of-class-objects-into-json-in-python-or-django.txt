i have list of object(example 5 objects in list) like thisand i need to convert this into json order by count like belowso how to achieve this in django
First you need to make your objects json-serializable. You could provide a default encoder function or write your own JSONEncoder as mentionned in the FineManual, but for a simple one-off case like your example building dicts from your objects is probably the simplest solution:Then build a list of dicts from your objects:sort it based on number:and serialize the whole thing:Note that all this is pretty ordinary Python stuff - building dicts out of objects, making a list of them and sorting the list, really no rocket science here, that's really basic python knowledge, something you shouldn't even have to think about. 
Beside the fact that this is not django related, here is some Python code that can help you:Which prints:Hope it helps.
