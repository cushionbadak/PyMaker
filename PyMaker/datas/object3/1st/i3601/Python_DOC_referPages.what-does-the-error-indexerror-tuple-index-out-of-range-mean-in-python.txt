Natural Text
I was trying to clean up my code instead of using a bunch of if statements to functions. Here is my code:
I'm assuming you're wondering why you get an IndexError from the above code (since there are no explicit tuples or indexing going on in it).'{}|{}|{}'.format() implicitly means '{0}|{1}|{2}'.format(), where the 0, 1 and 2 indicate indices into the positional arguments passed to format. Problem is, you didn't pass any arguments, so when it indexes the tuple of arguments with 0, it immediately fails, raising IndexError. You need to pass as many arguments as you provided placeholders for in the format string.
