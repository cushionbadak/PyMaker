I have imported nltk library in my main method of the Python code of the chaquopy Android app. It is asking me to implement nltk.download('punkt') for my processing. So I wanted to know: in what directory does the code look for the packages, so that I can download a copy of them in the desired folder for my code to work right?Edit: I implemented the solution provided by @mhsmith, but nltk.download('punkt') is still giving Lookup Error.Screenshots are attached:The first line is the download_dir in which nltk.download('punkt') is downloading dataThis is the error I am getting even after implementing solution by @mhsmithThis is the snippet of my code
I think the cleanest solution would be to create a separate directory for your downloads, like this:(The getPlatform method requires Chaquopy 3.2.0 or later.)From the NLTK documentation, it looks like you'll have to set the NLTK_DATA environment variable to this directory. This should probably be done before you import nltk.
