I'm currently taking a course in Python, and something that my tutor has said, has got me confused. Here is the code that we made.He said that we were creating a regular expression object, when we assignedphoneNumRegX to re.compile(r"\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d") But what does that mean? I've heard the word object, refer to different things in Python. I was wondering what he meant. Can someone explain what he was talking about? 
"regular expression object" is describing an instance of the the SRE_Pattern class.  This class has methods defined for performing various actions, such as the findall() method in your example.Classes, object and methods are discussed in general the Classes section of the Python tutorial. The introductory paragraph sums it up nicely:Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.  Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new  instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have  attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances  can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
