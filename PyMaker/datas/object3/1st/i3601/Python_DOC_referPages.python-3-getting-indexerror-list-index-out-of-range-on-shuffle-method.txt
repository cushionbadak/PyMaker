I'm building a blackjack command line game and I've run into a snag. The shuffle feature on my deck class object keeps coming up with IndexError: list index out of range on line 29.  It is a sporadic bug, id say about 50% of the time it comes up. Here is the code:
You're calling randint:Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).If it's not obvious why this is a problem, let's use a much smaller example:This is why Python usually uses half-open ranges, where a <= N < b, instead of a <= N <= b. And why you normally want to use randrange instead of randint.Or, even more often, when you find yourself reaching for randint or randrange, there's a good chance you wanted shuffle (which will randomly reorder the whole list in one go), or choice (which will pick a value out of a list, without needing to first pick an index), etc., so skim through the docs to see if what you want is already written.
