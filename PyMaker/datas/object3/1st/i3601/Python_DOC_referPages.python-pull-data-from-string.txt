I have the following string of data:and I need to pull the "id":38 out of it and format it a "id":"38"
since you're using the requests library (based on your tag), when calling your repsonse, instead of returning .content, you can return .json():
You could use the json module:Or in this case it is a valid dictionary so you could use eval():If you want to convert the dictionary in json_s and a back to a string then just use str(json_s) and str(a) respectively.See the documentation for the use of eval().Otherwise to keep away from eval() use the ast module.  As described here:Convert a String representation of a Dictionary to a dictionary?
