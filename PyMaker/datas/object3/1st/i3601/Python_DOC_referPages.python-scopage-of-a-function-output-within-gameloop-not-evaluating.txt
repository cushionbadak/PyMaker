My problem is, after calling the function check_win in the gameloop,even though the function evaluates false(I've checked so this is thecase), I assign this false value to gamePlaying inside the loop,however the game loop gamePlaying conditional still evaluates trueand keeps going. 
The issue is that you are using if statements when you mean to use elif. See the docs.However, what you probably want to do is return False at those points since that would allow the function to exit early and you would have to worry that gamePlaying gets set back to True by later if statements.
