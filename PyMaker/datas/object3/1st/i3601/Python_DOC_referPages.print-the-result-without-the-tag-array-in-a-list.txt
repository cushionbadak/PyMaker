I would like to display my result without the tag ARRAY before which array in a listMy result is this:And I want my result like this:
You could use reprlib and sys.displayhook.The following code very closely follows code snippets from the linked Python docs:And now for example:Note: this might also affect the display of other types. (I think reprlib.Repr by default shortens things.) To prevent this have a look at the docs.
Looks like a list with an array element (or maybe more than one):We could iterate through the list and turn each array into it's list equivalent:That's a nested list.  Or we could turn it into an array:The str display of a array doesn't include the array word.  This stack though only works if the constituent lists are all the same shape.One way or other we have to convert the list of arrays into something else - an array or nested lists.  We can't just change how the list is displayed.When I copy-n-paste your list (with array=np.array), I a list that displays as:Note that the arrays not only show 'array' tag, but the display all elements with with same format, scientific notation being the best for this range of values.If I specify a dtype=object for each arrayeach array element displays much as it is entered.  But there is also the dtype notation.For this list of longer arrays, the tolist approach displays as:Without any of the line wrapping that np.array display produces.Doing an independent print for each array in the list:Turning the whole thing into an array
