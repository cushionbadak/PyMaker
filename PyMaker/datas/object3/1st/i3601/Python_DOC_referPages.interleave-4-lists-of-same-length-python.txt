This question already has an answer here:Interleave multiple lists of the same length in Python                    7 answers                I want interleave 4 lists of same length in python.I search this site and only see how to interleave 2 in python: Interleaving two lists in PythonCan give advice for 4 lists?I have lists like thisI want list like
Provided the lists are the same length, zip() can be used to interleave four lists just like it was used for interleaving two in the question you linked:
itertools.chain and zip:Or as @PatrickHaugh suggested use chain.from_iterable:
From itertools recipesThe itertool recipes suggest a solution called roundrobin that allows for lists of different lengths.With slicingAlternatively, here is a solution that relies solely on slicing, but requires that all lists be of equal lengths.
For additional diversity (or for if you need to do this with Pandas)['a', 1, 'w', 5, 'b', 2, 'x', 6, 'c', 3, 'y', 7, 'd', 4, 'z', 8]
Just for the sake of diversity, numpy.dstack and then flatten can do the same trick.BTW you actually don't need to make an array, the short version also works
One other way may be using zip with np.concatenate:Result:Note: l5 is type numpy.ndarray, you can convert it to list either with list(l5) or l5.tolist()
Using zip and reduce:
