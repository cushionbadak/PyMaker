I want to come out of the loop immediately after pressing the stop button. But with this code, i could able to come out only after executing current iteration and next iteration.It is very important for my application since iam going to use this for automating instruments, where operations have to be stopped immediately after pressing stop button.
You are probably better off using root.after than threads:In any events, as other pointed out, using time.sleep is a bad idea in a GUI.You should also not name your buttons the same as your functions.calling root.update, is also not necessary here.
It's generally not a good idea to use time.sleep with GUI programs because it puts everything to sleep, so the GUI can't update itself, or respond to events. Also, it gets messy when you want to interrupt sleep.I've adapted your code to use a Timer from the threading module. We can easily interrupt this Timer instantly, and it doesn't block the GUI.To make this work, I moved your counting for loop into a generator.If you press the Start button while a count is in progress it will tell you that it's already counting. When a count cycle is finished, either by pressing Stop, or by getting to the end of the numbers, you can press Start again to start a new count.
Without using a separate thread, you could always iterate over the sleep command, which would make the code more responsive.e.g. This would reduce your wait between clicking stop and loop exit to 1/10th of a second, whilst retaining a 10 second gap between loops.
