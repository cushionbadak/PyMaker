Is there a way to enforce the type of a variable in a python function ? Or at least, give an indication of what it should be ?I already saw things like :But I don't know the name of that syntax, nor its use.Thanks
It's called Type Hints, has been introduced in Python 3.5 and is described here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.htmlSee also PEP 484: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/Example:Note that this will not enforce the type.From the PEP:While these annotations are available at runtime through the usual __annotations__ attribute, no type checking happens at runtime. Instead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line type checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily.
