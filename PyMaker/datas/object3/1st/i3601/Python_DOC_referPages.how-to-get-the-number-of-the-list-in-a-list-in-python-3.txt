I am trying to get the number of the nested list that contains the particular number. This is my code:What I am trying to get here is the number of the nested list that has 3 in it. My code is returning 3 because I am of the function len, which is only returning the number of items inside the nested list that has the number. The output should be:Since the number 3 is located on the second nested list. The count starts from 1, not 0.How can I get the proper output?
Use enumerate specifying the start value as 1:
Use enumerate:Note that Python is 0-index languange; the first element on a list has index number 0. That is why the code above returns 1. If you want to get 2, well, just add 1 to that or, ever better, use the optional start parameter of enumerate (enumerate(listo, 1)).To make the above Error-proof1, you can specify a default value to be returned in case 3 is not on any sublist.1 next raises StopIteration if it exhausts the iterable without finding something to return, unless a default value is provided.
Use enumerate so as to get the index of the element in the array.The same can be used for the code above.
You can use enumerate. But if you are very new to coding this simple code is good. Keep an extra variable (count) which will keep track of the index of the current list.
Simply use enumerate(). enumerate() returns a (element count, element) pair:
