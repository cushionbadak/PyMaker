Hello so i have my server with a database (dictironay) and another passworddatabaseWhats working:The server is working fine, i'm having troubles doing the login on the client side.client.py ==> client DOESNT go into the if data == Log in menuis there a better way to do this?What would be the best way to create an log in interaction with the server?the server has the usernames and passwords, i need to log in and then i need to edit the database depending on what user was chossen, but i'm having a hard time doing the algorithm
theres problems with the code you provided... however ill assume it actually works for you somehow and rather than copy paste you manually typed ityou are recieveing the first message hereYou then have the message datae = b'Welcome to the server. 'which does not match "Log in MENU: \n", and data != "!q" so it goes back into your loop and checks if data == "Log in MENU: \n" it doesnt so it repeats ... but you never get the next message instead try something like this second message but even then you are going to have problems because your server continues to write so you will get something like "Log in MENU: \nUsername" or something .... basically you need to work out a better message passing scheme than recv(24)
