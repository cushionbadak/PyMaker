Natural Text
I have a HTML formatted text string from an earlier text processing step. It goes like this, and you see that any <SPACE> character has been replaced by a &nbsp; sequence:...this&nbsp;is&nbsp;some&nbsp;text&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;some&nbsp;further&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text...Now, I want to replace some of the &nbsp; sequences within the text with a <SPACE> character. The rules would be:replace any single &nbsp; sequence with a single <SPACE> characterreplace the first &nbsp; sequence within a series of &nbsp; sequences with a single <SPACE> characterThe resulting string should then look like this:...this is some text &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and some further &nbsp;&nbsp;text...Any ideas for a programmatical approach using Python?
The problem can be shortened to replace every &nbsp; which does not come immediately after another &nbsp;.To implement this strategy, use re.sub with a negative lookbehind like so:
