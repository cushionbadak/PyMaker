My ExperienceSo I'm creating Discord bots to help teach me how to program Python, and programming in general. What I know about programming is mostly from an AP Computer Science Principles I took this High School Year (I'm gonna be a Junior in High School after summer). In the course we created apps with with MIT App Inventor which literally lets you make apps with blocks of Pseudocode. We learned binary, bits, bytes, parity bits, some search and sort algorithms, loops (index and stuff), variables, procedures (pretty much functions), and that's pretty much it. I used to learn C# game dev off of a course by copying them mostly but gave a little after when I decided I wanna pursue a career in Software EngineeringWhat I'm looking forI was trying to make a for loop or somekind of loop just to experiment and maybe use it later. Mostly to find out the syntax of it and what I would write everytime I would include it.Any help is appreciated :)
If you want just an infinite loop here is quick sample:
The github of discord.py has an example of a background task, found here. You should be able to use this as reference.
