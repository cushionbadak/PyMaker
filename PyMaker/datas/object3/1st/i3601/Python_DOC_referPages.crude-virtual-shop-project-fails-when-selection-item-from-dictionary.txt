I am making a crude shop in a Python 3.x script as a small project ( I started coding two days ago ), and when my program attempts to subtract the value of the item selected by the user from the initial amount of money the user starts out with, the program crashes. Note: balance(): function aims to display remaining amount of money yet, but is not finished yet.How can I fix my code, and is there any other way to improve/optimize it? Also, if you give a solution, please assume I don't know what method you will be using, so please give context and explain what you are using and other applications it can be used in.
Shop catalog is defined as:However, you are trying to access the key by number. Such as shopCatalog[2] which doesn't exist as a valid key. A valid key would be shopCatalog['2. Gucci Belt']Instead, try a list of tuples. A list is better because the order is guaranteed. In a dict, even though you numbered your items, it may print out of order.If you want the first item, you can just access it by the index. If you want them numbered, again, just use the index (although for both, keep in mind it is zero-indexed so you may have to add on to print your numbering and subtract one to get the right item.Also, there is a flaw in your logic here:shopChoice == 1 or  2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6:While people talk like that, coding doesn't work like that. Instead, you'd have to do:shopChoice ==1 or shopChoice ==2 and so on. But skip all of that and just say:elif 1 <= shopChoice <= 6:
The error is:shopCatalog is a dictionary, so you can access its values using keys. The keys are '1. MCM Backpack', '2. Gucci Belt' etc. Not numbers.If you want to access the first, second etc. values in a dictionary, you can use an OrderedDictionary in Python: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict
Try the below code, now i think it will work:Your code didn't work because there are no such a key i.e 1 or 2 etc so i simply just check each key if shopChoice is in it, if it is, get the value of it, if it isn't, check the next one.
