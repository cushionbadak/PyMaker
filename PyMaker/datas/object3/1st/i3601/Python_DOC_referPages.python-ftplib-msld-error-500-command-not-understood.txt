I'm trying to create a Python script for getting files from FTP. It is working right now but I tested it on free hosting page https://hosting.miarroba.com. If I connect it with my dedicated server FTP service, it fails with500 Command not understoodThe command I think fails is ftp.mlsd(). I don't know if I need and special configuration on my server.Code Python 3.5
Many servers do not support MLSD command, as it's a relatively new command (in FTP terms). And particularly IIS does not.If you need just filenames, use FTP.nlst instead.If you need file attributes, you have to use FTP.dir (or FTP.retrlines) instead and parse the returned listing.See also How do I parse a listing of files to get just the filenames in Python?
You can use wireshark or tcpdump to see what is being sent to the server in plaintext by filtering for port 21.You should be able to see exactly what's going on and where the "500 Command not understood" comes from.
