Natural Text
I have below String.How can I get the output:
You can use os.path.dirname to go up a directory as many times as you need toThis is easy to wrap in a helper function if you want to move up a known number of directoriesExample
Personally, I prefer the pathlib module.This is also repeatable
There are several methods, I would personally use the re (import re) module. But there is also the possibility to extract the directory without the additional module. It depends on whether you want to look at the slash (subdirectory) or the number of characters is enough (if the directory name does not change).
