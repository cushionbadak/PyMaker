I have set up a python script to insert a new record into a table, send out an email and update the most recently inserted record once the email is sent out successfully. The Python Script is as follows: This script is scheduled to run via windows task scheduleron an EC2 Instance. This script works just fine usually but this spits out an error message one in a while. The Error Message is as follows: I've tried to replicate this error and failed. Upon observation, I found a high co-relation between failure to no user activity around the time of failure. The Script only fails during the times there's no recent user activity on the EC2 machine. Did anyone come across something similar? or any suggestions/improvements?Please excuse if there are any indent errors, Might be due to my manual formatting while copying the script to StackOverflow's markdown.  
The context of your error message is missing, but this seems to indicate that the remote party you are trying to connect to.You most likely will find more detailed information in your exception object. I would suggest to connect a debugger or log more details of your exception, like the stack trace to find the offending line.Perhaps traceback might be off help here.
