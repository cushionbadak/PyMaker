You can use threading.active_count. From the documentation:Return the number of Thread objects currently alive. The returned count is equal to the length of the list returned by enumerate().From the documentation of threading.enumerate:Return a list of all Thread objects currently alive. The list includes daemonic threads, dummy thread objects created by current_thread(), and the main thread. It excludes terminated threads and threads that have not yet been started.
