I've just written some code that works, but I'm not sure about the syntactic differences between the two. I'm writing code that will check to see if string inputs can be successfully casted into new variable types without ValueError.I'm using decorators to make DRY code as many types needed to evaluated. Using decorators:Not using decorators:Performance is the same:Can someone explain if there are differences? Obviously decorator syntax seems cleaner.
input is never used, yet it seems that the try..except statement is written to check if casting the variable to a different type is a valid operation. Instead, declare the wrapped functions with no parameters in the signature, and then check for errors by passing the input value to the newtypeChecker, returned by the decorator typeCheck and stored as the name of the original wrapped function:Output:
