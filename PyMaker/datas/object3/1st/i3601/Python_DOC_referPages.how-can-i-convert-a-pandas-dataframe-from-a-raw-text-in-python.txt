Natural Text
I have a text file containing data like this, formatted in a list, where the first element is a string containing the column names sepparated by ';', and the next elements are the value rows:How can I convert this list of text into a pandas dataframe?
code:output:
Use pd.read_csv, that reads dataframe from text files, and pd.compat.StringIO, that makes stream from text, like io.StingIO:
You could use the function from_records() splitting each string item in the input list and taking care of the fact that the first line of your data contains the columns' labels
