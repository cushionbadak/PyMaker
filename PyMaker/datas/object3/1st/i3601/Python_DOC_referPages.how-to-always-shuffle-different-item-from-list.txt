I am writting bot using Selenium to auto comment photos on Instagram. My bot click on photo, write comment, click on next photo, write comment, click on next photo, write comment, etc. Problem is that my bot shuffle one of comments from my comments list but it uses always same shuffled comment... How to solve it? How to improve my function as to after each click or each post the choosen comment was different?
You could create an iterator as a class member. Initialize at None at start, and if None, use iter on random.sample on your whole list.When called, return the next element. On StopIteration exception (normal when you reach the end of the list), create another randomly shuffled list wrapped in a new iterable :one output:
You could return a new statement every time withBut that would still have a chance at repeating lines. The solution could be to have use random.shuffle, but if you want the object to "remember" what lines were already used, you would have to do that at the __init__ phase:A small warning however, this will fail if you already finished running through the list once, if you need to continue doing this infinitely consider adding that functionality some other way, possibly with itertools
