I work with large CSV files. I was able to put up a code which splits the files into small chunks: The problem I'm facing is that the first csv which is getting generated after the split has double quotes in the beginning and end for all its lines. Rest of the CSV files are not having this double quote issue. Also, the original file does not have any double quotes.Example, the first csv file looks something like below:  "abc,ghhh,123,fgfg"  "hjfhj,12312,adfa,6765"This causes an issue as I have to run few more tests over them and the first file is causing the issue while rest are just fine. It would be helpful if someone can help me modify this code to resolve my issue.
A quick go through the CSV module will have answer to your question.https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.QUOTE_NONE
You can fix the input and make the logic much simpler using Pandas.*Warning I haven't tested the whole solution.  So your mileage may vary.Thanks to @code-mocker for the Quote_None piece.
