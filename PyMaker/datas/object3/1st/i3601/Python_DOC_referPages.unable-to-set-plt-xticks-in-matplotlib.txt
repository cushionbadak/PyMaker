I have a pandas dataframe (df) I am trying to plot the timeseries plot of Date vs ConcentrationI converted the dates to datetime object using .to_datetime() The time series plot is easily done using: But if I try to change the xlabels to anything else, say month names, plt.xticks(["Jan", "Feb","Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"])]) I get an error:Although, I can change the ticks by set_xticks. What am I missing here?
As @ImportanceOfBeingErnest suggested, you should use locators to reformat the xtick labels. I have implemented them below:Here are some helpful resources:The matplotlib.dates apistrftime() directivesThis example, which I drew from heavily
