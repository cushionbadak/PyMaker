This question already has an answer here:Stripping off the seconds in datetime python                    3 answers                When i preform datetime.now() to get the current time, it gets printed (with print) like this: 2018-06-14 13:21:02.331933I want to ignore seconds and microseconds and to have it printed out like this:2018-06-14 13:21:00I know that I can convert to a string of my choosing with strftime but i'm not looking to alter the string but to change the datetime object itself so that it has 0 seconds and 0 milliseconds (and it seems stupid to do strftime and immediately strptime to convert back).In other words to convert from datetime(2018, 6, 14, 14, 7, 27, 326853) to datetime(2018, 6, 14, 14, 7)I've tried like this:And that works, but i'm sure there's a simpler and more efficient way (I need to do this thousands of times when iterating through different files). So my question is if i'm right that there is a simpler way and if so what are your solutions to such a problem?
