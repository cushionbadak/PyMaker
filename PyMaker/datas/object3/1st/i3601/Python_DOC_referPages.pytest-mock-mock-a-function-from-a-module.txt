I have an util in my module engine.py, which is imported from another file:In my test file:However, it's still trying to use the real implementation of string.get_random_string instead of the mock that I've created, unless I change my engine.py to:How can I achieve the mocking part without importing the whole string module to engine.py?
I have successfully achieved it by changing mocker.patch('main.utils.string.get_random_string', return_value='123456') to mocker.patch('engine.get_random_string', return_value='123456').Details can be found here.
