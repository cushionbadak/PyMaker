Is there an analogy to myStr.find(subStr, startInd) in order to get the index of the first occurrence of subStr before my startInd. Like taking step -1 instead of 1 from startInd?EditHere an example:Edit IIThe following code solves my problem but it is not really convenient. Wanted to ask if there is a simple method to fullfill that task
str.find takes an optional end parameter:str.find(sub[, start[, end]])Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are  interpreted as in slice notation.So, if you want subStr to end before endIndex, you can use myStr.find(subStr, 0, endIndex):If you want subStr to start anywhere before endIndex, you have to use myStr.find(subStr, 0, endIndex + len(subStr)) instead:
