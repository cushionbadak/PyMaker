I have the following directory structure (pretty standard for a python distribution):What I want to achieve is package both pkg1 and common into the same python egg. The setup.py file is pretty standard (auto discover packages) and pkg1 is properly included, unfortunately I can't say the same about common. I tried many things, like package_data, package_data_files, package_dir, etc. Nothing seems to work. How can I achieve this?I'm also not keen on keeping this structure, but I do need those files into a common directory, because I have to generate nodejs, python and java libraries that include them, thus moving the common/ directory inside python is not an option.
I think you should use a MANIFEST.in file and set include_package_data to True to register all the files you want to bundle with your package.https://setupy.info/ gives a pretty good overview of all the options you might need.
