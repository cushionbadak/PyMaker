Natural Text
I'm trying to read a byte object from a text file, but whenever I read from the text file I get double backslashes in the bytes object and I cannot find out how to revert them to single backslashes. The file is opened as open(file, 'rb'). I've tried using encode and decode and I've also tried using eval(str(my_string).replace('\\\\','\\')) as detailed in other answers, but all have returned the error: SyntaxError: (value error) invalid \x escape at position 372. The string I am trying to read is: \xde\xcct\x18\xe5*\x91\xcc\xf1\xb4\xe9\xc2\x97BhR\x87\xd6x\xd8\x83\x8b\xc2\x08Edit: The answers detailed in Reading utf-8 escape sequences from a file and other questions haven't helped, since I still get a unicode escape error when trying the methods.
If your string coming from file with characters escaped by backslashes, the backslashes are correctly backlashed themselves and then you can see the single backslash as double backslashes. What you certainly want is getting the escaped characters translated. You can use codecs module with unicode_escape for this:If you are encountering errors, you have a flag to decide what will happen by opening the file with "unicode_escape" encoding parameter.You can see a full list of error handlers here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#error-handlers
