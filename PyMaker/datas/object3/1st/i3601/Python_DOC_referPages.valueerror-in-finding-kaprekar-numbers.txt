In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer,  the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45Â² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.  I want to print all Kaprekar numbers between two integers p and q Error:Compiler message :Any help is appreciated.
If p is an integer in the range [0,3], so that its square is a single-digit integer, then your split of the squares string version will produce an empty string for p1.  int('') is an error.  You have to check that value before you attempt to convert:Better yet, cover the single-digit case, so you pick up 1 as a valid number:
Here's a more advanced implementation (for when you will be more familiarized with Python).code.py:Notes:kaprekar function:Tests whether a number satisfies Kaprekar conditionsSupports bases other than 10 (default)Does everything mathematically (no string conversions or parsing - this way you wouldn't encounter current error, and also waaay faster)The "position" in the squared number "held" by splitter (going right -> left) and the 2 parts are computed using [Python]: divmod(a, b)The rest are just wrappersOutput:
