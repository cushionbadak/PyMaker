I would like to ask if there is an easy way to modify JSON by using Python?I have found some of the relevant topic- How to update json file with python But could not figure out the solution for my current issue.Currently, JSON looks like this:Required: To be accepted by BQ / Need to remove "Y", keep only "X" in this format.Any relevant documentation, topics?P.S> Update 1.0
Solution:Explanation:Load the input json file using json.loads. The output file will be a plain text file and not a JSON file as the required output format is not a valid JSON. Use a .txt file for storing the output. Store value of json.loads() in data. To get inner element X which is a list of dictionaries, use data.get('X'), which will return list. Iterate over it and write json.dumps() to the output file, each element in a newline.C:\XXX\exportReport.jsonC:\XXX\your_output_file.txt
You need extract parent data at first. And definite this to a variable. And search "X" data in this variable.
