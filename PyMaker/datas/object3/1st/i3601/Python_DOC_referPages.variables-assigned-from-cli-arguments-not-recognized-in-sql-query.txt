I'm trying to write code where after giving name and email input in the command prompt it should update the data in the Postgres database. English is not my first language, but I'll try my best to describe my situation.So basically when typing in the cmd:It should update the jacob8 in the username column and jacob8@company.com in the email column.So my code is like this:...but for some reason userName that Im using where I'm trying to SET, doesn't recognize the userName that I assigned as sys.argv[1] and the same goes about eMail. When I'm adding them inside single quotation marks, it's recognized, but it messes up (makes the rest of the line green) the rest of the line starting with WHERE.I also tried to put sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2] straight into SET line (like UPDATE "table" SET "user_name" = sys.argv[1] WHERE) but it gives me the same kind of problem - it wont recognize the import sys anymore.What am I missing here? It's clearly something to do with how to add quotation marks but I can't find the correct way..
You need placeholders for all locations where you want to substitute parameterized data -- so not just mac, but also userName and eMail.Personally, for readability's sake, I'd write this as just one query doing both updates, as follows:That said, the shortest possible change is just:
