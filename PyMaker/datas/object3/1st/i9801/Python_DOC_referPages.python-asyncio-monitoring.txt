I've a python program which are launching a random number of asyncio coroutine. During the time my program can launch new ones and some of them can exit when they have terminated their work.I would like to know if it's possible to report, every minute, the number of active coroutine? Thanks
You cannot launch a coroutine but could start a new taskFor retrieving the number of active tasks please use len(asyncio.Task.all_tasks()).
