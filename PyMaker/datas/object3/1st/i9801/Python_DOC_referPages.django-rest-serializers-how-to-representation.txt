in django models  django rest codeoutput:But I need the name of friends.I want see "friend":username.I want to see also __str__ from django model.How can I do it?
First of all, in your __str__ in TableFriend, you would need to actually pass a string like:I'm assuming you have a name field in the User model.To display the friend username, you would do:Ref: Specifying read only fieldsThe output will now be something like:The __str__ is a string representation of the object.To see it, you would do something like: TableFriend.objects.first().This would give an output like <TableFriend: my_name friend_name 2016-11-21 23:54:57.060029>Ref: object.str(self)
