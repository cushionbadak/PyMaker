This is what I have:subprocess.call('''curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT -d '{"name": "{}".format(someVariable), "hive_ql": "CREATE VIEW user_balance AS SELECT NAME, LOB,ACCOUNT,BALANCE FROM csvtable"}' localhost:someport/api''', shell=True)I'm trying to pass a variable in for the 'name' parameter, denoted by 'someVariable' in this example. But I get an error stating:"message": "Failed to decode JSON object: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 14 (char 13):When I replace the format part with an actual string, the script executes just fine so I know I'm doing something wrong with passing the variable between the quotes, just not sure what the correct syntax is.
It will be clearer to pass a list to subprocess.call:
You aren't calling .format, it's inside your string.  Try this:As it stands, the JSON you're trying to decode is:because python is just treating .format(someVariable) as part of the string and not replacing it with the value of someVariable, and clearly it is not valid JSON to have that hanging onto the end of a string.Edit: I forgot to escape the brackets; try this instead:
