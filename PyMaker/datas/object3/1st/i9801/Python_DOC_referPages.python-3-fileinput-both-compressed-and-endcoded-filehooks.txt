Natural Text
I need to both uncompress and decode a set of gzipped files, and the filehook module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html) has hooks to both, but I am unable to apply both:Is there a syntax to apply both of these hooks onto the same FileInput instance?
Looking at the source and noting that gzip.open and bz2.open support encoding parameters, it shouldn't be too difficult to roll your own:
No, there's no way to combine these. You cannot even use hook_compressed with the default utf8 by passing text mode, because FileInput refuses to accept rt on the assumption that r always means text.The only solution is to write your own.
