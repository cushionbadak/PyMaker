Revived some old code and tried to refactor it to match Python7 and 3 standards.A lot of string operations used the "Something was %s in here" % "merged" syntax.So I began the process of swapping this out for .format("merged"), worked great until this row popped up:Now I thought I looked thoroughly at this and converted it into:Seeing as the command line was built upon further the last | didn't really trigger any warning signs.However, lots of head scratching and debugging later I found out the correct conversion should be:I'm aware that you probably should do "%s" % ("x",) + cmd here, but never the less, this was the code i was left with.I asked colleagues and friends, they all assumed the same thing: "I guess the math operator precedes the function operator of joining the string".That's obviously not the case and I'm wondering, is there a reason why "%s" % "x" goes before + "y"?Technically speaking to me the addition operation (purely speaking math wise here) should go before any function call?Why does Python2 treat the addition as a second hand operation to the function of merging into a string?
Because the % string formatting operator shares precedence with the % remainder or modulus operator, which binds more tightly than the + addition operator.  See all the operators in order of precedence here
