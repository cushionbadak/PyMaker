Is there such thing as:Basically this statement inserts the borrow item and date, time when the specific user borrows the item.Or  
exectute accepts parameters, but they follow the SQL template as a tuple.The ? placeholder must not be enclosed in quotes ', execute will take care of putting them around the value of the string parameter x. Edit:But still your SQL will not work because INSERT does not support a where clause, at least when values are given.
