The object of the program is to ask the user how many articles of clothing they collected on each day of a 3 day (weekend) clothes drive, average them, do it again for the second weekend, then average the two weekends (clothes per day). Here is my code: And here is the error i keep getting: I am trying to make num_clothes into a list and add all the values of it with sum(num_clothes).
Your num_clothes is an variable of type int and you are passing this variable as parameter to the sum functionYou can see by the documentation that, if you want to sum properly, you need an iterator passed as parameters.If you want to read a list from the user, try to change your input to this:SourceAlternatively, you can leave your code as it is and change num_clothes to list(). Then, after read the input, append the result to the list: 
sum() is a function that adds all objects of an iterable object such as a listeither change num_clothes to a list by using .append() and adding an integer to the list every iteration of the while loopor just make num_clothes a total by doing += int(input(..etc))
