I want to get an after and before match in a string. For example, using the following string:with the search string being: "I am", the match before the search string should be: "Hello" and the match after should be: "Jim!".How can I achieve this?
You can also use split()
Use str.partition which does exactly this:S.rpartition(sep) -> (head, sep, tail)Search for the separator sep in S, starting at the end of S, and return the part before it, the separator itself, and the part after it.
