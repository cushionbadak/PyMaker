This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                I have the following Python 3 code:The output is:What am I doing wrong? Why the regex does not match the dot?
As per the documentation of match it checks from the beginning of a string.If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this regular expression, return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.Use search instead  for search at any position.
match looks for matches at the beginning of the string, unless you tell it to do otherwise. The dot isn't at the beginning of the string, so it can't be found.See the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match
