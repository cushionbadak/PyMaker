I have a list of lists and I should find the sublist whose second element has the max value.I implemented it as follows, but I would say it's a bit 'suboptimal' :-)and thenThere's a way to accomplish that in a more coincise form?Thank you very much for any hint!ByeFabio
max accepts an optional key parameter; max compares the return value of the key function to determine which one is larger.
Another simple approach using sorted function:The output:https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#sorted
Here is another option (though not a very efficient one):Find all the sub-lists whose second element has the maximum value:[n for n in listofcounties if n[1] == max([k[1] for k in listofcounties])]Find the first sub-list whose second element has the maximum value:[n for n in listofcounties if n[1] == max([k[1] for k in listofcounties])][0]Split it into two statements in order to improve efficiency:Find all the sub-lists whose second element has the maximum value:maxvalue = max([k[1] for k in listofcounties])[n for n in listofcounties if n[1] == maxvalue]Find the first sub-list whose second element has the maximum value:maxvalue = max([k[1] for k in listofcounties])[n for n in listofcounties if n[1] == maxvalue][0]
