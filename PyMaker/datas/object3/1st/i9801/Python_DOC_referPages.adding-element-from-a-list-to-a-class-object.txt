I've got a class Animal, with attributes Name, Age, Gender and Species. I've got a list with split elements like this:Now I want to take four elements at a time, and add to new Animal objects.I really can't figure out how to. Can someone help me with this?
This may help you get started:Outputs:A brief explanation, "chunking of the list" can be done many ways, I just chose to use the *, splat operator, and slice the contents.Instantiating objects from the class was borrowed from this tutorial Learn Python the Hard Way, bottom of the page "A First Class Example".I didn't put these new class objects into a new list, but as everything in python is an object, and you know how to create lists as you did in your question, I'll leave that trivial part out.Hope this helps.
