I am using a tkk.Combobox themed widget in Python 3.5.2.  I want an action to happen when a value is selected.In the Python docs, it says:The combobox widgets generates a <<ComboboxSelected>> virtual event when the user selects an element from the list of values.Here on the Stack, there are a number of answers (1, 2, etc) that show how to bind the event:However, I can't make it work.  Here's a very simple example demonstrating my non-functioning attempt:I get one instance of "Selected!" immediately when I run this code, even without clicking anything.  But nothing happens when I actually select something in the combobox.I'm using IDLE in Windows 7, in case it makes a difference.What am I missing?
The problem is not with the event <<ComboboxSelected>>, but the fact that bind function requires a callback as second argument. When you do:you're basically assigning the result of the call to print("Selected!") as callback. To solve your problem, you can either simply assign a function object to call whenever the event occurs (option 1, which is the advisable one) or use lambda functions (option 2).Here's the option 1:Note the absence of () after callback in: cbox.bind("<<ComboboxSelected>>", callback).Here's option 2:Check what are lambda functions and how to use them!Check this article to know more about events and bindings: http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-events-and-bindings.htm
Thanks you for the posts. I tried *args and it workes with bind and button as well:
