I am new to Python. I want to have a class called "Verbosity". It is intended for controlling the amount of printed output of my new Python program. The verbosity should be constant while my program is running, thus I was intending to initialize the Verbosity object with the level of the desired verbosity. Lets call an instance of this object "verb". While my program is running, I frequently want to check the verbosity so that the program knows when to print output or not. Thus I want to call verb.high, verb.low, and so on and get back true or false.Here is some sample code (based on some code in some package I found), but it doesn't work yet in my program:If you have a better approach, I would be glad to hear that. Still I would  also be interested on how to get the above approach working.
Please see the Python in-built logging module. There's no need to re-invent the wheel.Here's a sample from the docs:If you want to set the logging level so that INFO + higher priority messages are printed:I also recommend sticking with the default logging levels listed here:
While trying to create a more nice sample code as requested by jonrsharpe, to my surprise I got the code from above working. But I still intend to use the logging module of Python... :-) The problem was mainly how I tried to use the verbosity class. Here in the code below is now included how to use it. (I don't know what I did before exactly, I changed the code a lot...)
