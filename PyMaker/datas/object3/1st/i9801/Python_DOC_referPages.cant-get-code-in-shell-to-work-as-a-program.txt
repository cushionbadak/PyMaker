I am working through the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book and am stuck on one of the practice problems. My solution works in the shell, but not when I try to run it as a program. Here is the problem prompt:Say you have a list value like this:Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string  with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it.Here is my code:When I define a list in the shell and run the above steps on it, I get the result I want: But when I try to group the steps together in the above program, the result is this:Any ideas? Thanks very much if you've taken the time to read this. There are a couple other topics on this same practice question on SO already (here and here), but I was still stuck so I went ahead and posted.
input() returns  a string. You need convert the string to list before passing to the function using str.splitOtherwise, string is iterated; yielding each character as items.
You have a problem since the input you are getting is a string and not a list.First convert the input to a list, then run your function.Try to use .split() on the input.
When take input of the string, make sure the input is "split()",to convert it into a string:Input:Output:
You just need to join list as per problem statement details,Execution:Now when you accept list from user, you are accepting raw string, You need to convert it into list.
