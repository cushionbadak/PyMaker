Simple question if do the following:returns 32 when I believe it should be 28.By doing the following (missing the Q):it returns 20, which is what I would expect.and doing:returns 8, which is correct.Why does adding the Q onto the top one result in 12 extra bytes being expected instead of 8?Python 3, windows machine.Thanks.
Alignment.  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#struct-alignment for more details.Try struct.calcsize("=6cHcBHIIQ").
You could also minimize the size by realigning these in a better way:yields 28,you should generally expect padding to be the culprit in any struct size issues. See Why isn't sizeof for a struct equal to the sum of sizeof of each member? for a good answer on why struct sizes might sometimes be larger than what they seem.
