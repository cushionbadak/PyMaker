I have the following expression in python:When I put this in python there is no problem and it returns a boolean (true) but I don't understand what '/' is? because it looks like your dividing two booleans. What does this expression evaluation to in java?
In java,In Python, all comparison operations have the same priority. It can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y < z is equivalent to x < y and y < z. Refer to Python documentation: Expressions for the detailed description.
you might want to use and(&&) to get a True :
Going to the docs, the answer to your question is literally spelled out in these two sections (both on the same page):https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedencehttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisonsThe first section gives a table that states that / has higher precedence than <, so your expression is effectively 0.85 < (0.81 / 0.83) < 1.15, or 0.85 < 0.9759036144578315 < 1.15.The second section states:Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).This means that your statement translates exactly asThe key here is that with comparison chaining, each expression is only evaluated once. In this case that means computing the division only once. Of course the Java compiler would probably have optimized that out for you anyway.
