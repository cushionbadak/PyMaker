I am trying to interactively validate an entry widget in tkinter to only allow the user to enter characters in the alphabet. I have already read a very popular thread (Interactively validating Entry widget content in tkinter) and from that I have tried to figure out my solution but I just cannot seem to get it working. In the comments of that thread was a solution that only allowed numbers, I have used that for one area of my program and it works perfectly! Code here:I would like a solution like this, with the only change being that it accepts letters instead of numbers. Any help appreciated 
Here's the solution you're looking for:Heres some other things which might be useful: .isdigit() tests if a string is an integer.isalpha() tests if a string contains only letters.isalnum() tests if a string contains only letters and numbers.isupper() tests for uppercase.islower() tests for lowercaseFor other datatypes you can use isinstance(), for example isinstance("34.5", float) will return TrueSource: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html
