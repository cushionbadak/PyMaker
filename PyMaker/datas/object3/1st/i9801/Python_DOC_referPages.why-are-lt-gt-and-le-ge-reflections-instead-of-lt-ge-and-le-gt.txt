In Basic customisation, the python docs state about comparison methods:[no swapped-argument versions of these methods];   rather, __lt__() and __gt__() are each other’s reflection, __le__() and __ge__() are each other’s reflection, and __eq__() and __ne__() are their own reflection.I'd be less surprised by __lt__() and __ge__() being each other’s reflection(, as well as __le__() and __gt__()).While the docs also state:… no other implied relationships among the comparison operators, for example, the truth of (x<y or x==y) does not imply x<=y,  what, if anything, is the or would be a rationale for the reflection relations chosen?
Because a < b and b > a are equivalent, as are a <= b and b >= a.
Reflection means swapping the operands, not applying "not" to the operator.You were thinking the followingBut that's not what reflection means.
