I am quite new to python, and I haven't figured out yet how to solve my quit simple problem. I did some research, but either I did not found or I didn't understand what to do with it... My question is :How to know if there is an instanciation of a class in a container such as a list ; I want to do something likeI know this is a really simple question but to be honest I can't find the proper syntax to make it work :/ 
You can use the isinstance built in function to test if an object is an instantiation of a certain class, and the any built in function to test if any of the members of an iterable match your condition:FYI:  all objects in Python are instantiations of some kind of class (even classes themselves!), so there's no point to seeing if an object in a list is an instantiation of any class, since everything in the list will be.
Use the built-in isinstance() function.Or
