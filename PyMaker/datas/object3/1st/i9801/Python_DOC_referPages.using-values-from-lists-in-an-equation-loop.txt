I have a short list with coordinates: (0|0) (10|0) (10|10) (0|10). Im trying to use these coordinates to calculate the area of the square they build. for loop should run 4 times and perfom the math written below.when running i get the following error in the area = .... line: TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
You are trying to access the index of an int, which is meaningless, since each coords is a list, not a nested list.Assuming you get a rectangle (or square) for sure, you are good enough with
the value of cords[0] is an int. Therefore cords[0][0] is trying to index into an int, hence your error. You can remove the for loop and your code should work.
