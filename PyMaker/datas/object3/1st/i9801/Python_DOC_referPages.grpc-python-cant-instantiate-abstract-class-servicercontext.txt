I am trying to test the following method:To test it, I must pass in a request and a context (which is a grpc.ServicerContext object), like so:The problem is, I get the following error when I run my tests: TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class ServicerContext with abstract methods add_callback, cancel, invocation_metadata, is_active, peer, send_initial_metadata, set_code, set_details, set_trailing_metadata, time_remainingHow can I get a grpc.ServicerContext object? If I can't, how do I test the method?
grpc.ServicerContext is an abstract class defined with the abc module. In your test you need to write your own concrete subclass of it and pass an instance of that to the method you are testing.
