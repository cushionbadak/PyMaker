Natural Text
My data sample is:I want to replace the punctuation with a new name. Such as ? = punct1, ! = punct2, ' = punct3. I tried using read from csv file.Then I stucked at replacing:The error is: error: nothing to repeatWhat have gone wrong? Or is there any possible way to do this? The desired output should be just like:Thanks in advance. Cheers.
You can use replace by dict d - but need escape ? to \?:Also you can create d from replace_df:EDIT by comment:
Most punctuation characters have a special meaning in regular expressions. Here you end up with, eg: \b?\b, which means an optional boundary followed by a boundary. Not what you meant.For passing arbitrary strings into a regexp, it must be escaped using re.escape:This will be \b\?\b, which means a boundary, followed by a ?, followed by another boundary.
