This question already has an answer here:What is the best way to call a script from another script?                    9 answers                I have tried every thing fromtoI have looked through all the other similar questions on here and read official Python documentation.I can't get thisto run the ceatebid.py file reliably. I got it to work withbut what if I also want to call another script? I want to call different scripts based on how the questions are answered.
I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do, but in general you should be able to do something like this.
The key to using os.system("python createbid.py") is to pass in a shell command in string format.If you want to communicate with that script you probably want subprocess.See the answer from this question: running bash commands in python
This was probably answered here: What is the best way to call a Python script from another Python script?So, you need to define some method in you createbid.py (and other scripts):then in your main script,
Nowadays, the recommended way to launch other processes is to use the subprocess module.It's relatively easy to do. Here's a simple way to apply it to your problem:Note: When createbid.py (or some other script) is executed this way,__name__ == '__main__' will be True, unlike it would be if it had been imported.
Alternatively, you could use exec (statement in Python2, function in Python3).Suppose your script scriptA is stored in a file named scriptA.py. Then:The merit of this is that exec allows you to define variables before, and use them inside of the script.So if you were to define some parameters before running the script, you could still call them in your solution:Still, this approach is more like a fun trick, and depending on the situation, there should be several ways to do better.
Thanks for the help! I combined a few answers to get it working.This works:
