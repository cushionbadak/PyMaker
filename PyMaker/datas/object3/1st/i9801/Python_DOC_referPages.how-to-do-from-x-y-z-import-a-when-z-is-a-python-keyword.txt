I ran into the unfortunate case where a particular file has the filename that is a keyword in Python. Is there some way to "bypass" this without renaming the file?libraries/import.py has a function my_function()Gives:and points at the ".import" partI tried a few things:But they all have the same result: SyntaxError.Can't find any tips in the Python manual either - but also no warnings about using reserved names :) Is this possible to do? How?
You should really just reconsider renaming your submodules, not only do you need to resort to importlib in order to get it but, you'll also be confusing people.To import you could just use import_module from importlib, that is:If you'd also want to bind the function to the global scope:but you can see how ugly this is getting.All alternatives you tried are either not allowed directly by the grammar (i.e import "libraries.import" or import libraries."import") or they get rejected during the parsing phase were it is detected that one of Pythons keywords is used.
