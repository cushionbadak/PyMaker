Lets say I have: What operation is then called on A in order to determine the while loop? I've tried __eq__ but that didn't do much. 
User-defined objects are truthy, unless you define a custom __bool__:
The while statement is composed of the while keyword followed by an expression.When an expression is used in a control flow statement the truth value of that expression is evaluated by calling the objects __bool__ method:In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false: False, None, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true. User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a __bool__() method.In short, the result depends on what the __bool__ of your object returns; since you haven't specified one, a default value of True is used.
There are different methods, that can be called, to determine, whether an object evaluates to True or False.If a __bool__-method is defined, this is called, otherwise, if __len__ is defined, its result is compared to 0.
