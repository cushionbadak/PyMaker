I have this list of lists:I want the total sum for Racing, Marcas and Crossi. I want do it with a dictionary on python if it's possible. Like this:Is it possible do it with only one for loop?
out:setdefault:out:
You can use collections.defaultdict for thisOutput of print(d)
You can do this:
Without importing collections, you may get the same behavior using dict.get() as:where l is the list mentioned in the question. 
With more iteration on the list you can solve the problem in an one-line way.
