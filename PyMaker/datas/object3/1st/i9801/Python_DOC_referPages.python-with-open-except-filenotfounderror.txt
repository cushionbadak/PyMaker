This question already has an answer here:Catching an exception while using a Python 'with' statement                    4 answers                It seems strange to me thatcan report but I can't catch that in some way and continue on.  Am I missing something here or is it really expected that you use isfile() or similar before a with open() ?
use try/except to handle exception
If you want different handling for errors from the open call vs the working code you could do:
If you're getting a FileNotFound error, the problem is most likely that the file name or the path to the file is incorrect. If you're trying to read AND write to a file that doesn't exist yet, change the mode from 'r' to 'w+'. It may also help to write out the full path before the file, for Unix users as:Or better yet, us os.path so that your path can be run on other operating systems.
