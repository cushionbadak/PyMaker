Natural Text
I have the following code:However when I run this command:the command loops through each letter of the word index.I want it to detect index as one argument and if I provide more arguments with spaces in between it should be looping through those.If I don't add the add_arguments method it shows unrecognized argument in the console.
This method fixed my problem.
