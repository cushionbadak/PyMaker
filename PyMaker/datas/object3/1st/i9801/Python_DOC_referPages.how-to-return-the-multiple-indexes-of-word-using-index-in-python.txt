I am struggling with the command .index in Python. I want to be able to enter a sentence and then Python to return the multiple indexes of the word I choose. For example if I enter the sentence "i love you you love me we all love barney" and then choose the word "love" I want it to return "2","5","9". But instead my code only will return the first one, "2".Please can you help me edit this code so it return more than one index of the chosen word. Thanks 
Use enumarate (Note: the index of the first word will be 0) and split:Output:
.index only return the first occurrence. You can try this:
You can split the words in the sentence with a space and then search for a particular word.For example:
indices contains all the position
