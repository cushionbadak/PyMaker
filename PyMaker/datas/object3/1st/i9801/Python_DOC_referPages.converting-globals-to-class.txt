Natural Text
I have been using global variables for a little text game in python and have come across a lot of articles saying that global variables are a no no in python. I have been trying to understand how to get what I have below (just a health variable and being able to change it and print it) working using classes but I am confused how I can converted something like this in a class. Any help, example, point in the right direction would be great.Here is an example of me using variables.Thank youEdit: this is the kind of thing I have been trying to do...
I would avoid classes for this, as classes are generally slower. You could make the function return the new value for the health variable.I would also suggest making a main controller function to take the return value and apply it to other functions. This prevents global variables outside of a function's scope.If you want to use classes, you need to actually instantiate the class (Make a new object from it) by doing instance = Test(). You also need to store variables as attributes of self (so self.number = number) as any local variables are different from each other.
