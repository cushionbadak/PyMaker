I want to pass the address of a python array buffer to another application or to c function, output:Is this address an actual memory address of first element of the buf array?Is this similar address like in C , address of first element of buf?If not how can I declare a buffer in python and pass its address to c function and use its value and addressing like arrays of C ? if this address is actual memory address can i use this address in memcpy() function in C.
As the documentation wrote, it's okay to use it as a address. But think of using buffer protocol as per NOTE.Return a tuple (address, length) giving the current memory address and  the length in elements of the buffer used to hold arrayâ€™s contents.  The size of the memory buffer in bytes can be computed as  array.buffer_info()1 * array.itemsize. This is occasionally useful  when working with low-level (and inherently unsafe) I/O interfaces  that require memory addresses, such as certain ioctl() operations. The  returned numbers are valid as long as the array exists and no  length-changing operations are applied to it.Note When using array objects from code written in C or C++ (the only  way to effectively make use of this information), it makes more sense  to use the buffer interface supported by array objects. This method is  maintained for backward compatibility and should be avoided in new  code. The buffer interface is documented in Buffer Protocol.
