Natural Text
Sorry if this question is stupid, but I'm kind of a python newbie.I'm trying to port a python 2.7 code base to python 3.4...I found this code snippet which should iterate over a csv file inside the packed application.Although PyDev is telling me, that pkg_resources.respource_stream is undefined the first line seems to work, causing the 3rd line to throw this error: _csv.Error: iterator should return strings, not bytes (did you open the file in text mode?)I tried switching the method to resource_string, ResourceManager.resourceStream etc. but all I got was different errors.
pkg_resources.resource_stream returns a stream that reads in binary mode; it just returns the bytes read, and doesn't try to decode them using a particular encoding.Most tools for encoding and decoding text are found in the codecs module. To convert a binary reader into a text reader given a particular encoding, use codecs.getreader. Since you are bundling this file yourself, you should know the encoding, which should probably be UTF-8. So you would write:
