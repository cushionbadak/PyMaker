I want to know that why do we specify names for parameters for model classes like CharField in django.like this for example.why not In java we call new charField(40,true) like this.If they are default arguments we specify these in the definition of constructor (in java).Why are we writing here.please,explain.
What you see in java is called positional arguments where the arguments are always in certain order. Python, however, supports two type of arguments: positional arguments and keyword arguments.The beauty of keyword arguments being that while using the function you don't have to worry about defining values for all the arguments used within the method (or class constructor).You can just use an identifier e.g. in your case max_length and blank and leave rest of the arguments as they are.If you look at the __init__ method of the Field class (superclass of CharField), you will find a number of keyword arguments defined there:Out of these, you just defined max_length and blank because that's what you required.
