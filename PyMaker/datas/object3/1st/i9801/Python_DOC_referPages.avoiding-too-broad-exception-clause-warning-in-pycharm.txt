I'm writing an exception clause at the top level of a script, and I just want it to log whatever errors occur. Annoyingly, PyCharm complains if I just catch Exception.Is there something wrong with this handler? If not, how can I tell PyCharm to shut up about it?
From a comment by Joran: you can use # noinspection PyBroadException to tell PyCharm that you're OK with this exception clause. This is what I was originally looking for, but I missed the option to suppress the inspection in the suggestions menu.If you don't even want to log the exception, and you just want to suppress it without PyCharm complaining, there's a new feature in Python 3.4: contextlib.suppress().That's equivalent to this:
I found a hint in this closed feature request for PyCharm:I suggest you to mark this inspection as 'okay' if the except  block makes use of exception instance e somehow.Because I'm logging with exc_info=True, I'm implicitly using the current exception object, but PyCharm doesn't know that. To make it explicit, I can do something a bit hacky: exc_info can use any truthy value to include a stack trace in the log. An exception object should be truthy, because it isn't None.
