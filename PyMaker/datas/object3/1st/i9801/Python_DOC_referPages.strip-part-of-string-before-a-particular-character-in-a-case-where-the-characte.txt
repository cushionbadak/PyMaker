Natural Text
I need to strip the string off the part that occurs before the character ':', where ':' may occur multiple times.For Example:The function I have is this (Python code)The output I am getting is 'I am sending the file abc.txt' without the second ':'.Is there a way to correct this? Also can this code be made more efficient in time and space complexity?
split isn't the best approach for this. You want to use a regular expression.This returns the string without anything up to the first : (colon followed by space). You can read more about Python regular expressions here.
How about using split()?Use -1 to account for list index out of bounds if the delimiter is not in the initial string Output:Try it out here.
What you want is out_str = ':'.join(in_str.split(':')[1:]): since you stripped all ':', you need to re-insert them. A better way would probably to use out_str = in_str[in_str.find(':')+1:].find(':') gives you the index of the first ':'.
