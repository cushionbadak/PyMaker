How would I generate random numbers to 2 decimal places in the range (0, 0.1]. My code so far is generating numbers with two decimal places in the range [0, 0.1]:
Perhaps the easiest way to solve your problem is to think in terms of integers, not floating-point numbers.You basically want possible random numbers like 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ..., 0.09, 0.10.First you generate an integer between 1 to 10 inclusive, then you divide by 100.0 to get a floating-point number.Here is the code:Documentation: random.randint(a, b)
Try subtract random value from max value as uniform includes low, but excludes high then you will get values from 0 to max excluding low and including high:
