I want to make communication between laptop and UART via Python file by sending some packet: My packet contains= I have a file.txt file which contains an example of  data That I want to send: By using my python file I want to read data  from file.txt ( which I already did), then I want add all the rest of field in order to send all the packet for the uart.So my questions are: 1/ How to concat those variables in order to have such packet?2/ My UART then will read that packet from cmd.exe, do you thik that is the best solution to send data from python to UART? I would be very grateful if you have any other proposition?Thanks in  advance.  
struct.pack is what you want.  It packs data similar to a C structure.  Your example has two 16-bit values, a byte length, four 32-bit values, and an 8-bit CRC.  Given something like the following:This will pack it little-endian (send the lowest byte of the multi-byte integers first), or big-endian.  hexlify is just for display so you can see the hexadecimal values of the bytes in the order generated.Output:
