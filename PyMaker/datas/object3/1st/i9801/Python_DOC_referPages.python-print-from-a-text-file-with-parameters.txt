Trying to write a program that will look through a text file containing the NYTimes bestselling books and let the user search and print a book from the list. Currently have this code that prints the line containing the name of the book they type:How would I let the user search for a year range? The txt file contains the book name, author, year published, etc. all separated by 1 tab space.
How about using Pandas read_csv function?This solution of course assumes that you can read the file into memory.
