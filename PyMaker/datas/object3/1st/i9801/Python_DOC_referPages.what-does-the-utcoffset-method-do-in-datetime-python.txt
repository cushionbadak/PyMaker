I know this questions answer is usually "go to Python's documentation". I have read it and am still not a 100% sure what the uctcoffset method does.I assume that it takes the timezone - utc and gives the difference but I need to be 100% sure.
yes, it is doing exactly what you think it does. Here are the official docs.Edit:To be precise, it does not take a timezone, it takes 0 paramters. You  invoke it on a datimeobject, that object has a timezone associated to it, if it is timezone aware. In that case the method wil return a timedelta object, which represents the differenc between the timezone of the datetime object and utc
The utcoffset method of a datetime gives you the difference between the "wall clock" time of the datetime and the "wall clock" time of the same point in time in UTC, so, exactly as you expect (dt - dt_as_utc). The reason it is a function is that for many time zones (such as those with daylight savings), the offset changes over the course of a year. As an example:As you can see, the same applies to the tzname() function.  For naive datetimes (those with no datetime), utcoffset() and tzname() should both return None.As a note, I would generally advise not using this function to calculate a UTC timestamp, rather, you should use astimezone() with either dateutil.tz.tzutc or pytz.UTC or, if you are using Python version >= 3.2, you can use the datetime.timezone.utc object.
