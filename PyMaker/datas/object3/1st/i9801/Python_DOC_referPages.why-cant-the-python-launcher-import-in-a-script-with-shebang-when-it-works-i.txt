I'm using the py Python launcher, and something weird is happening with imports. Certain modules can't be imported in scripts - despite being installed with pip and being importable in the interpreter. Here's the kicker, though: it works in scripts without the shebang line.For example, this script works:But this one doesn't:Why is this? What difference is the shebang making here?
The py launcher actually handles shebang lines even on Windows. This means the Python version a script is run in may differ depending on the shebang line. For example, a shebang line of #!/usr/bin/env python2 will always run Python 2, and #!/usr/bin/env python3 will always run Python 3. Without a shebang line, py pretends the shebang is !python, which it handles using its built-in rules for selecting a Python version (see the Python Version Qualifiers section). By default, if you have it installed, this will be some version of Python 2.Here's what's tripping you up, though. If the shebang is specifically !/usr/bin/env python, py instead follows the PATH environment variable to mimic the behavior of Linux's env
