Natural Text
I have a text file, populated with the following:It's not properly structured as it was scraped off and dumped into a text file.There is over a 100 of such segments. Despite how it looks, the page was not in just html hence why I couldn't simply extract the data as a structured form.Now I would like to use Python to extract just the hostname, Model number and IP address in an orderly list.So it would look something like the following in new lines:But I struggle to find how to do this by firstly extracting the necessary info from the first segment, then the next etc.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
I'm not gonna fully answer this as you didn't show us any code. Rather I'll give you some hints that will help:The way I'd do it:strip() away any new-line character and any space from your fileuse a regex to match the groups you need. You can use this oneRegex101 has also a nice way of generating the desired code in different languages so you'll be done after a bit of self-processing. (however, for learning purposes, I don't recommend it)Look into re module and implement the above regex. You can read the docs for thisOf course, you'll have to manage yourself how to handle opening of a file, reading its content, apply all the above on it and order the data however you like. Good luck.Here's a starting point
