Hi everyone! I am trying to debug someones code and I have found the problem. The program loops through an array of strings and count's certain ends. The problem is that some of these strings end with _, so the counting goes wrong. I would like to use regex, but I am not experienced enough. Could someone help me?I would like to loop through the array and per string check if it ends with _('s) and trim all of these _ off to put them again in the array! UpdateThanks for the rstrip suggestion! I have tried to write a code that works with my data, but no luck yet... But this still returns: ['Anna__67_______', 'Dyogo_3__', 'Kiki_P1_', 'BEN_40001__', .... ]
You can use rstrip('_') to remove trailing underscores:So you can see that any leading underscores and any in the middle of the string are unaffected, see the docs: https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string-functionsTo answer your updated question you can use a list comprehension to update each string in the list:
use string rstrip method to strip off unwanted _regex is a bit overkill for this, it can be done as below
