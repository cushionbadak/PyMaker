For example:Wanted result:
Three possible approaches:ReadableThis makes it very clear what's going on, but requires four lines and repeated calls to new_list.append(), which is slightly inefficient.ConciseThis is very compact, but for many people it takes a moment or two to remember whether the nesting of multiple-for list comprehensions goes left-to-right or right-to-left.LazyThis will work correctly even if list1 and list2 are generators or other one-shot, lazily-evaluated iterables, e.g.... which won't work with the first two approaches.Note that I've used new_list rather than NewList in these examples, which is the conventional way to name variables in Python.
You can check the result by printing NewList, which in this case can give you what you had above. Your list1 and list2 are initialized above this code just like you have above.
