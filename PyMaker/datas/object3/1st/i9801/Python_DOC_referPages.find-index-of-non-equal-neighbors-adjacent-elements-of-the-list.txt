I would like to create a list that:iterates through each value of List1 populates List2 with the index number where the value differs from the previous index numberprint List1 yields:Here is the code I have so far:This provides the error:I don't want to alter List_1 at all, because I use it to produce a graph later in the script.  List2 for these values in List1 should end up looking like:Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thank you!
As the comment on your question says, you are using ArraySize in the wrong place, and assigning c in a way that doesn't do anything useful, you aren't updating List2.And there's no need to keep a counter for the index when you can use enumerate() (also: What does enumerate mean? ) to do that for you, e.g.Output isTry online at http://repl.it
In order to achieve this, you may use zip() and enumerate() along with conditional list comprehension expression as:Issue with you code: You are assigning ArraySize = len(List1) which will hold int value. Then later you are doing ArraySize[c] i.e accessing it like a list. But since it hold integer value, you are getting the error:
