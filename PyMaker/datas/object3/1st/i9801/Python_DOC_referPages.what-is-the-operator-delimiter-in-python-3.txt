This question already has an answer here:What is the '@=' symbol for in Python?                    3 answers                While reading through the Python 3 Lexical analysis, I became slightly confused by the last section on operators[1] and delimiters. The @ character is listed as both an operator and a delimiter, and @= is also listed as an augmented assignment operator. Following the form of other augmented assignment operators, I would expect this to mean that the @ character can be used like so:orI have tried using it in this way with integers and strings without any success. I am familiar with using @ for decorators, but fail to see how an augmented assignment operator is compatible with decorators.What is the purpose of @ and @= when used as an operator and/or delimiter in Python 3?[1] Python 3 - Operators: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#operators
Expressions states The @ (at) operator is intended to be used for matrix multiplication. No builtin Python types implement this operator.So you have to use numpy or other math libraries to make x = x @ y work.
