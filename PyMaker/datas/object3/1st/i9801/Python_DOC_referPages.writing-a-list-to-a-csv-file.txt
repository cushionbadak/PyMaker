Natural Text
I've got a piece of code that extracts coordinates from a KML file.  It works beautifully and prints to the screen the way I'd want it to print to a CSV file.  However, when I attempt to write it to a CSV file, the resulting file is empty.  I've tried both the method below and the standard text output method using .write and .writerows.  All have the same result.Here is the KML I'm using: And the code:****SOLVED****Final working solution is this:I abandoned the csv method and went with a text file output, just renaming to csv.  I end up with the result I need.  Thanks to all that contributed.
The with and writer= should be happening once, at the beginning of your loop.  As it is now, you are re-creating the file for each item, throwing away the last item.  Edit Now there may be another issue: it looks like latlon is a string, but writerow expects a list of items, and fills in the commas between the items automatically.  You might want print(latlon + ',', file=output) instead of writer.writerow depending on your specific use case.Edit 2 Use [latlon] instead of latlon to get the whole line on one row instead of one character per row.  The brackets make it a list of one item rather than a string, which behaves in this context like a list of its characters, one at a time.
