Natural Text
Consider the following example:Then     smf.ols('a ~ b', df)     smf.ols('177sdays ~ b', df2)And the first work and the second does not. The only difference seems to be the presence of numerical characters in the variable name. Why is this?
Apparently, statsmodels uses a library called patsy to interpret the formulas passed to ols. From the docs, an expression of the form:will construct a patsy object of the form:EvalFactor then "executes arbitrary Python code." Thus your variable names must be valid Python identifiers. I.e. the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z, the underscore _ and, except for the first character, the digits 0 through 9.
