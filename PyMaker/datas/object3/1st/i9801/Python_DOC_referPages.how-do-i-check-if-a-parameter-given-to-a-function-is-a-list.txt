I will like the function to return a comment if the parameter given to a not a list. If it's a list, I'll like to perform some operation.below is the code:
By using the *nums argument you are packaging all the arguments into a list. The official documentation may be useful.manipulate_data(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) will result in num = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) while manipulate_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])will result in num = ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5],) that is a tuple with only one element. Remove the * or if needing to process multiple lists as arguments use a loop to do the check on every tuple element.Remember this function is not returning anything yet
ok, make it more clean, except a, b ,all left positional parameter will be pass to c...
