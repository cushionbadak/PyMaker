I've searched for some time to find a solution to this problem but have come up dry. I'm hoping I can find some help here. As the title suggests, python is not recognizing a module that has been set in my PYTHONPATH.I'm currently working on a project that has the following overall structure:This is executed in python 3.5 via a virtual environment called venv_1. I use a Mac running El Capitan.My runner.py script calls the logging_utility using the following import statement:from util.logging_utility import method.When executing, I receive this error:I am running this in the terminal from the base level of the directory. I'm using the following command to call the script:Now, I've tried to debug this by printing out my env as well as sys.path. In both cases, the base directory appears in the path. So why on earth am I receiving this error?I've also tried to update the import statement to from base.util.logging_utility import method which gives me the following error:Any idea why this is happening and how I can correct this?Thanks!UPDATEThanks to Billy and Moinuddin Quadri whose suggestions solved the issue. For some reason I still needed to add the __init__.py files. Even though python 3.3+ supports implicit imports, looks like it was still needed. This solved the problem.
You might not be having the path to package in your PYTHONPATH. In order to add that, do:Since from Python 3.3, you do not need the __init__.py. For the older version, the other possible reason is missing __init__.py. If you do not have a __init__.py file present in the directory, you can not import files of that directory.As is mentioned in the Packages Document:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.
