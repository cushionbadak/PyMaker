I have a piece of I/O-bound code that is basically doing some web scraping for a research project of mine.The code started imperative, then became list-comprehensions which now mostly turned into generators:This kind of code really fits well into my head, and since it's based on generators, without storing much state, I figured I could pretty easily turn this into asyncio based code:However in Python 3.5 this just returns a Syntax error since the await expression is not allowed inside comprehensions.Python 3.6 promises to implement asynchronous generators in pep 530.Will this feature enable me to convert generator based code to asyncio code easily, or does it also need a complete rewrite?
asyncio.as_completed() might be a better solution here:
