In a few __init__ of different classes I have to use several times the constructor as suggested by Moses KoledoyeI would like to have a method that inputs, say, the string 'member_name' and default_value and that the corresponding initialization gets produced. For example, if one inputs 'pi_approx' and 3.14 the resulting code is In this way I can replace a long sequence of these initializations by a loop along a list of all the required members and their default values.This technique emulate a switch statement is not the same thing but kind of has a similar flavor.I am not sure how to approach what I want to do.Assuming that initializer(m_name, default_val) is the construction that gets replaced by I would then used it by having a lists member_names = [m_name1, m_name2, m_name3] and default_values = [def_val1, def_val2, def_val3] and callingThis would replace long list of try's and also make the code a bit more readable.
If your try/except was meant to handle KeyError, then you can use the get method of the kwargs dict which allows you to supply a default value:Which can be extended to your list of attribute names using setattr:
