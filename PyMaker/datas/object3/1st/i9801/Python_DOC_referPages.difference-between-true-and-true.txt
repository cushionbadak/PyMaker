I was practising a python related problem at Hackerrank. I am a total newbie to python. The Problem was to simply write a function, which checks if a year is leap year or not according to the Gregorian calendar.I looked in the discussions tab, where I found out the answer, I decided to not to copy up the code and instead I wrote the code after understanding it.So I wrote it this way:When I ran the tests, It ended up with two failed tests and two timed out tests. So I checked the solution in the discussions tab again and changed my code to:When I ran this code, all my test cases passed, without any errors.Does python have only 'True' and not 'true'?Thank you in advance. :) 
True is capitalised because Python built in constants are capitalised: https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html"true" would create an error, as the program will be looking for a non-existant variable called true.
The difference is that True is the keyword and true is not. The flag is case sensitive. It is always True and False, not true or false.
Python is case sensitive and strongly typed.'true' is not the same as 'TRUE'Graphic example
