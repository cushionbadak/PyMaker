How will I be able to count the number of time a list of items are repeated in a string. For example how can I search through string and check the number of times this list has been repeated in string?
Firstly, don't use a name like list, it masks the built-in name list [See: Built-in Methods] and that can lead to some subtle bugs.After that, there's ways to do this. The crucial thing to have in mind is that objects like strings come along with a plethora of methods [See: String Methods] that act on them. One of these methods is str.count(sub) which counts the number of times sub occurs in your string.So, creating a count for every element in lst could be done by using a for loop:str(string.count(i)) transforms the integer result of string.count to an str object so it can be printed by print.This prints out:After getting more accustomed to Python you could use a comprehension to create a list of the results and supply them to print:which prints a similar result.Finally, make sure you read the Tutorial available on the Python documentation website, it'll help you get acquainted with the language.
