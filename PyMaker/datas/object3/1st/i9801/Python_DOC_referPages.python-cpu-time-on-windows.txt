I am looking for a way to measure the CPU time of the part of my python program. I was looking around and it seems all the time measuring functions that I could find measure the wall clock time on windows. Is there a way to measure the CPU time on windows for python ? Thank you.
time.process_time()https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0418/The new time.process_time() function acts as a portable counter that  always measures CPU time (excluding time elapsed during sleep) and has  the best available resolution.Earlier answer for anyone wanting to use timeit() to average:I wrote this while recently learning Python. It's a timeit.Timer class iterating timeit() over functions for averaging; in my research timing seemed to be easy to mess up and timeit() apparently tricky to get working (though easier to get working on command line). This works.Also note this answer suggests the best bet is time.process_time() for Python 3.3+ and reminds that .default_timer() is wall time:https://stackoverflow.com/a/15176730/3981745Output
time.clock()On windows you can use time.clock() which basically uses QueryPerformanceCounter() from the Windows API. QueryPerformanceCounter():Retrieves the current value of the performance counter, which is a high resolution (<1us) time stamp that can be used for time-interval measurements.Here is a detailed explanation for time.clock from the python docs:On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating point number expressed in seconds. The precision, and in fact the very definition of the meaning of “processor time”, depends on that of the C function of the same name, but in any case, this is the function to use for benchmarking Python or timing algorithms.  On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the first call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(). The resolution is typically better than one microsecond.timeitIf you need something even more accurate there is timeit.
