Natural Text
I've been struggling with this for two days now and I can't seem to find any help. I need to search the file for a student ID (1001 is my test ID being used) and then add the numbers in each line that takes place below each occurrence of the student ID together in order to get an average. The text file that is being opened looks like this:
This looks like homework so I don't want to write the code for you but here is a pseudo code (there are multiple ways to achieve what you want, this is just a simple beginner level code):Some useful references:Python I/OPowerful things in python to help with I/OBuilt-in functions to help with basic operations like sum
out:in this point, you can sum, average, max or min whatever you want.
Please don't use this code for your homework (use @Aditya's method); you need to learn the basics before using fancy libraries. However, I just learned about collections.defaultdict and I wanted to use it. Watch this video for a great demo on defaultdict.
Updated Answer:Okay, so I think I understand your question now... Same thing, except I suggest using a list, and as long as the file stays in the same format (SID, Score, so on...), this should work, and requires minimal understanding of Python (i.e No weird libraries like glob):This will return an integer, or with your file, will print:Regardless if this answered your question, my tip for learning basics is understanding file types and what they can do.In your case, you will mainly need to focus on strings (text) and integers (whole numbers). Using Pythons IDLE, declare a variable, and type the name and a dot, and use tab to scroll through each functions available. Example:Once you pick one form the list, enter an opening parenthesis "(", and it will give a brief description of what it does.Hope that helps, and sorry for the lengthy reply (I was trying to explain and give pointers (tips) since you said you were a noob)
