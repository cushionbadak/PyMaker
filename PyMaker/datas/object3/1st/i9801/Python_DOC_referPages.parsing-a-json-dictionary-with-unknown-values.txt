I am trying to deal with a dictionary in JSON, looks like following:Assume I have no info about the how many sectors and nodes are present and I want to know the number of sectors (and how many nodes per sector).I was able to find the total no of sectors by :But, the total no of nodes per sector is more important in my case. 
You can use for-loop to get every "sector" (it doesn't matter how many you have sectors) and then you can get "nodes" in sector and check len()
