Natural Text
I have search high and low on he net for answers to this question. Perhaps it is simply a bit too specific, but here goes.I am working through a crash course text on Python, and probably would be considered either an advanced beginner or a beginning intermediate practitioner at this point.I am trying to use a try-catch block to display a message about a missing file, using an exception with the FileNotFoundError exception type, as follows:I tried using an attribute name of filename, which obviously does not exist. But I have been able to find no appropriate attributes from which to extract this vital data for the error. As there are two different filenames specified, it could be either of those files that are not present.Does Python provide this kind of functionality in its built-in exceptions? It would seem that it should.Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.Sincerely,Robert Hieger
You can find the filename from the exception instance (not from the class).
Your real problem is that you are duplicating code. Make a function so that you don't repeat yourself, and then you already know the filename:
Another approach would be to try and catch either error, using the else clause after the first try:
