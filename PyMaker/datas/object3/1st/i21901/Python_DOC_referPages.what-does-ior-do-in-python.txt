Google won't let me search |= so I'm having trouble finding relevant documentation. Anybody know?
In Python, and many other programming languages, | is the bitwise-OR operation.  |= is to | as += is to +, i.e. a combination of operation and asignment.var |= value is short for var = var | value
When used with sets it performs union operation.
This is just an OR operation between the current variable and the other one. Being T=True and F=False, see the output graphically:For example:
|= performs an inplace, bitwise OR operation and also performs union operation of Python sets.  For example, the union of two sets x and y share the following equivalent expressions:where the final value of x is equivalent either by:an assigned OR operationan inplace OR operationan inplace OR operation via special methodSee also section B.8 of Dive in Python 3 on special methods of Python operators.Here are some examples comparing OR (|) and the inplace OR (|=) applied to sets:Here is an example of overloading the __ior__() method to iterate iterables in a MutableSet abstract base class.  See it also sub-classed and applied in Raymond Hettinger's OrderedSet recipe (see lines 3 and 10 respectively).  Here is a thread on Python-ideas on why to use |= to update a set.
It performs a binary bitwise OR of the left-hand and right-hand sides of the assignment, then stores the result in the left-hand variable.http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operations
It's bitwise or.Let's say we have 32 |= 10, picture 32 and 10 is binary.Now because | is or, do a bitwise or on the two numbersi.e 1  or 0 -->  1, 0 or 0 --> 0. Continue this down the chainNow change the binary into a decimal, 10 1010 = 42.For |=, think of the known examples, x +=5. It means x = x + 5, therefore if we have x |= 5, it means x = x bitwiseor with 5.
In Python,|=(ior) works like union operation.like if x=5 and x|=5 then both the value will first convert in binary value then the union operation will perform and we get the answer 5.
