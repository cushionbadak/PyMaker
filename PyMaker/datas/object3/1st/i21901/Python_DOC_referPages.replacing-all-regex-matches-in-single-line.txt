For a constant regexp like in your example, doNote that you need to enclose .* in parentheses as well if you don't want do lose it.Now if you don't know what the regexp looks like, it's more difficult, but should be doable.If the first thing matched by your pattern doesn't necessarily have to be marked up, use this instead, with the first group optionally matching some prefix text that should be left alone:You get the idea.If your regexps are complicated and you're not sure you can make everything part of a group, where only every second group needs to be marked up, you might do something smarter with a more complicated function:If you need to handle overlapping groups, you're on your own, but it should be doable.

Yes, this can be done in a single line.\b ensures that only complete words are matched.So if you have a list of words that you need to mark up, you could do the following:
