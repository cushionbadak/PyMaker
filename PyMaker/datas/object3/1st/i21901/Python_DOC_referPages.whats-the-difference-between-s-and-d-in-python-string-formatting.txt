I don't understand what %s and %d do and how they work.
They are used for formatting strings. %s acts a placeholder for a string while %d acts as a placeholder for a number. Their associated values are passed in via a tuple using the % operator. will print marcog 42. Note that name is a string (%s) and number is an integer (%d for decimal).See https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting for details.In Python 3 the example would be:
%s is used as a placeholder for string values you want to inject into a formatted string.%d is used as a placeholder for numeric or decimal values.For example (for python 3)Would output
from python 3 doc%d is for decimal integer%s is for generic string or object and in case of object, it will be converted to stringConsider the following codethe out put will begiacomo 4.3 4 4.300000 4.3as you can see %d will truncate to integer, %s will maintain formatting, %f will print as float and %g is used for generic numberobviouslywill generate an exception; you cannot convert string to number
These are placeholders:For example: 'Hi %s I have %d donuts' %('Alice', 42)This line of code will substitute %s with Alice (str) and %d with 42.Output: 'Hi Alice I have 42 donuts'This could be achieved with a "+" most of the time. To gain a deeper understanding to your question, you may want to check {} / .format() as well. Here is one example: Python string formatting: % vs. .formatalso see here a google python tutorial video @ 40', it has some explanationshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk
%d and %s are placeholders, they work as a replaceable variable. For example, if you create 2 variablesyou can assign those variables to a sentence in a string using a tuple of the variables.Note that %s works for String and %d work for numerical or decimal variables.if you print variable_3 it would look like thisI was searching for an answer in StackOverflow and found more than 45 answers to my question.
The %d and %s string formatting "commands" are used to format strings. The %d is for numbers, and %s is for strings.For an example:andTo pass multiple arguments:print("%s %s %s%d" % ("hi", "there", "user", 123456)) will return hi there user123456
They are format specifiers. They are used when you want to include the value of your Python expressions into strings, with a specific format enforced.See Dive into Python for a relatively detailed introduction.
In case you would like to avoid %s or %d then..Output:
speaking of which ... python3.6 comes with f-strings which  makes things much easier in formatting!now if your python version is greater than 3.6 you can format your strings with these available methods:
As per latest standards, this is how it should be done.Do check python3.6 docs and sample program
