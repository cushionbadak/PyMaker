I'm writing a cross platform file explorer in python. I am trying to convert any backslashes in a path into forward slashes in order to deal with all paths in one format.I've tried not only using string.replace(str, '\\', '/'), but also creating a method manually to search through the string and replace the instances, and both do not work properly, as a path name such as: changes to:I am assuming that this has something to do with how Python represents escape characters or something of the sort. How do I prevent this happening?
You should use os.path for this kind of stuff. In Python 3, you can also use pathlib to represent paths in a portable manner, so you don't have to worry about things like slashes anymore.
Elaborating this answer,with pathlib you can use the as_posix method:
Doesn't this work:?EDIT:Of course this is a string-based solution, and using os.path is wiser if you're dealing with filesystem paths.
