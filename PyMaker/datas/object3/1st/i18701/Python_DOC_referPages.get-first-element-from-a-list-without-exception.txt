Consider this codedesc is a list of strings. If list is empty description is an empty string, if not it's the first elements from the list. How to make it more pythonic?Forgot to mention that I have to use 2.7
You can write:As pointed out in the comments below, you can also directly evaluate the list in a boolean context:
Alternately you could use make use of the fact that next supports a default
You can use exception handling (although it's more verbose than using the conditional expression).
I don't think you should actually do this in your case, but for completeness…For an iterator that might be empty, you just use the optional default value for next:Meanwhile, you can always use iter() to "peek" at the iterator you would get from a sequence (or other non-iterator iterable).So:I think this is less readable than just using the list as a sequence (whether you use chepner's EAFP answer or Frédéric Hamidi's LYBL) rather than just an iterable. After all, we have the sequence API for a reason.
