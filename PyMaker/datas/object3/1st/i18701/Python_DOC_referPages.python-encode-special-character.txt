I'm trying to encode a string containing '-' (minus) symbol to iso8859-15, it will return the string as it is.  for eg: Expected output is Is there any way to do this? sorry me if my question is wrong.  
Your output sample suggest you are looking for url encoding, not Latin-1.The urllib.quote() and urllib.quote_plus() functions can be used to do such quoting, but the - character does not need quoting and won't be quoted:Replace special characters in string using the %xx escape. Letters, digits, and the characters '_.-' are never quoted.Demo:If you are using Python 3, the quote and quote_plus functions are found in the urllib.parse module.
ya.
