I outsmarted myself and created an error as a result of trying to be prepared. On the first line of a script I placed#! /usr/bin/pythonand later upgraded python and installed a new module. Sure enough, the new python is now /opt/local/bin/python and I got errors. It took a bit of debugging before I found this. Anyway, now that I have I am wondering what is the best way to run a script:Should I:use python <myscript.py> ormake it executable, add the environment on the first line, and use it from the command line ./<myscript.py>I like 2. but upon upgrading or changing the default python, the script can break because it specifies a different install. Then am I expected to go through all the scripts and update them? Is there a way to make the current/default python override the one specified on line1 of the script or is there another way to make a script executable without explicitly stating which python it uses (ie, to use the default one)?
Since the mentioned stackoverflow links do not have an accepted answer.  I'll answer it while giving my opinion.  I think the best solution for all python scripts is #!/usr/bin/env python as changing the python that runs is as simple as modifying the PATH environment variable.  This is much better than updating all scripts (assuming scripts are already this way).Number 1 python <myscript.py> can be used first to test before PATH modification.
