This question already has an answer here:What do square brackets, “[]”, mean in function/class documentation?                    4 answers                I was reading the python documentation where I came across elem [,n] this notation for arguments. I have seen such notations in past. Don't just know what they mean. Also, google doesn't support searching brackets.
The Python documentation has a section about the used notation, which says:[…] a phrase enclosed in square brackets ([ ]) means zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional).This notation originates from the Backus–Naur Form (BNF).
It means that the argument so bracketed is optional.
Generally this means that the parameter within the square brackets is optional; however, without a link to the specific documentation it's hard to say.
