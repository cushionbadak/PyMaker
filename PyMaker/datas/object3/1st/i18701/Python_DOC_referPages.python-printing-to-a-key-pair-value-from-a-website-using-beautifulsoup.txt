I have this code extracted using beautifulsoup from this website https://api.projectnimbus.org/neaodataservice.svc/NowcastSet ?After displaying all the location how do I pretty print it to a key pair value ? Like Location : Ang Mo KioLatitude : 1.3546846Longitude : 103.564132 ? 
Modified:
soup.find returns only the first one match, so you need soup.findAll. As for pretty print, you can use pprint.
