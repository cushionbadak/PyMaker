In my application, I receive informations from amazon in xml. So, I read and access the values by simplexml.My problem is when I want to access several neighbor strings that have the same name.an example :I want to have the three authors ! Frank and Brian Herbert, and Anderson too.Here are my results as I launch each command :So I access only the last item of the list, whereas there's several. How can I do ?Under PHP, I did "foreach author in xml['...']['Author']; print author" and it was good. Here, this solution is the second I wrote just up, and it doesn't gave the expected result !Any idea how I can access the authors' names one by one ? Thanks !
Is this the simplexml library you are using?  It hasn't been updated since 2005 (http://freecode.com/projects/simplexml).Since I don't see any documentation for the library on the PyPI page nor on the project page I can't help very much with it.The output of your code indicates that you iterated over a string.I can, however, recommend using ElementTree in the standard library.  It is easy to work with, currently supported, and I know it provides child elements as a list regardless of the uniqueness (or not) of the element tag.
Here's a working example using ElementTree:I hope this helps.Thank you.
Actually, it seems the lxml.objectify solution is the best.It allow to fellow the path you know inside the xml.Plus, I didn't say you (sorry), but the xml is much more complex and deep than what I explain earlier.It doesn't begin with ItemAttributes -> authors.It's much more :Items (there's other nodes inside the xml) -> Item (one item per book I find !) -> ItemAttributes -> â€¦Using lxml.objectify, I could find anything I need. The only hard point was to solve the common problem that when a tag or value doesn't exist, everything crashed.I simply use try :That's it !The above code show you how I use the xml path.Thanks anyway !
