I'am learning about the modules of re and BeautifulSoup. I have a doubt in few lines of the next code. I don't know the use of group() and what's inside of brackets in contents[]
.contents returns a list of items from a tag. For example:[0] is used to access the first element of the list .contents returns. In the example above, it will return bar baz.group(1) returns the second (indexing starts at 0, remember) matched value from a regular expression. Looking at your regular expression, it returns the second digit from something that looks like n1,n2.
