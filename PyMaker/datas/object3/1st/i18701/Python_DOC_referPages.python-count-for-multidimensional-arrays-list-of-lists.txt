How would I count the number of occurrences of some value in a multidimensional array made with nested lists? as in, when looking for 'foobar' in the following list:it should return 2.(yes I am aware that I could write a loop that just searches through all of it, but I dislike that solution as it is rather time-consuming, (to write and during runtime)).count maybe?

First join the lists together using itertools, then just count each occurrence using the Collections module:
This uses flattening of sublists and then using the collections module and Counterto produce the counts of words.
