I'm trying to use the Twitch API in a Django [python] web application. I want to send a request and get information back, but I don't really know what I'm doing.How do I convert this python?Thanks
Using the builtin urllib2:If you're using Python 3.x, the module is called urllib.request, but otherwise you can do everything the same.You could also use a third-party library for HTTP, like requests, which has a simpler API:
I usually use urllib2 for my api requests in (blocking) python apps.You can then access the text returned with response.read(). From there you can parse the JSON with your preferred library, though I generally just use json.loads(response.read()).I would keep in mind, though, that this is for 2.7, if you are using python 3 the libraries have been moved around and this can be found in urllib.request
