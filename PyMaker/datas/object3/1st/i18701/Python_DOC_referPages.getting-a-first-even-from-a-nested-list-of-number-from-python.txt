I need help figuring out this code. This is my first programming class and we have a exam next week and I am trying to do the old exams. There is one class with nested list that I am having trouble understanding. It basically says to convert (list of [list of ints]) -> int. Basically given a list of list which ever has a even number in this case 0 is even return that index and if there are no even numbers we return -1.Also we are given three examplesWe are using python 3 in our class and I kind of have a idea in where to begin but I know its wrong. but ill give it a tryI thought this was it but it didn't work out. If you guys could please help me out with hints or solution to this it would be helpful to me.
If I understand correctly and you want to return the index of the first list that contains at least one even number:enumerate is a convenient built-in function that gives you both the index and the item if an iterable, and so you don't need to mess with the ugly range(len(L1)) and indexing.all is another built-in. If all remainders are non-zero (and thus evaluate to True) then the list doesn't contain any even numbers.
There are some minor problems with your code:L1[i] % 2 = 0 is using the wrong operator. = is for assigning variables a value, while == is used for equality. You probably meant range(len(L1)), as range expects an integer. Lastly, you're adding the whole list to the count, when you only wanted to add the index. This could be achieved with .index(), but this doesn't work for duplicates in the list. You can use enumerate, as I'm about to show below. If you're ever working with indexes, enumerate() is your function:
So here's what I came up with.First a fix. You need to use == for "equal to", '=' is for assigning variables.And for the code, here's the idea in some more pseudocodey style:Hope it helps, if you need any further explanation then I'll be happy to.
