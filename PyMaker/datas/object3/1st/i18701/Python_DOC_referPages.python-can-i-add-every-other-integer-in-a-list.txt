I have experimented a bit with lists and I want to add every other part of a list.say I have a listand I want to add two and two together likeIs there a possible way to do that even if the list length varies? (for the sake of ease I assume that the list ALWAYS has digits in multiples of two so it will be possible to do)I am not sure what I can search for to answer this question

Break your problem down - you want to do two things:Split your list into pairs (groups).Sum those groups.The first is easily acheived with the grouper recipe from itertools:The second with sum() and a list comprehension.The main advantage to this method is it, without effort, scales to any size of group. If you want to sum every group of 100 elements, it's just changing the group size.
