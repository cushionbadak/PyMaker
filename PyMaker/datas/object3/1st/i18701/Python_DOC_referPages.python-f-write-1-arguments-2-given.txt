Natural Text
I'm having trouble with this line:I don't know what '{}\n'.format does, but someone suggested it in a previous question, so I thought it'd work here, but it doesn't.Inside the output text file, I just get the following: UID: /Users/bubble/Desktop/Plot 2.docxSize in Bytes: 110549But it should say: UID: 501How can I make the f.write understand two arguments and write it into the txt file?many thanks
'UID: {}\n'.format(stat(searchFolder).st_uid). If there is no {}, it just returns {}: \n.This is string format. The {} represents a replacement fields. You may read the doc.
