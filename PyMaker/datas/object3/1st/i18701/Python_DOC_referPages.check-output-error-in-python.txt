I am gettin a error while running the below code.  ErrorI am working on Python 2.6.4 . 
Just use :You've defined your own function, it's not an attribute of subprocess module(for Python 2.6 and earlier).You can also assign the function to the imported module object(but that's not necessary):
You probably just want to use check_output, but, just so you know, there is a method subprocess.check_output, but it's not defined until Python 2.7 (http://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output)You might even want this, which defines the function in the module if it's not there (i.e. running before v2.7).
