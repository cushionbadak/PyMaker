I need to extract those keys of a dictionary whose values pass a certain condition. Basically, I want to do this, only in a shorter, more pythony way:This was my original idea, but it raises a ValueError:I came up with this for the moment, but I can't help feeling it's not very nice:Is there a less messy way to it? Perhaps something obvious that I'm clearly missing?Thanks!
Here is a way to get the keys with true values that is a lot shorter and cleaner than a comprehension (not that comprehensions are bad though):
Use dict.items()If you want to take only the keys with True values, rather than any true-ish value, you can use an equality check:It is noted in PEP8 though, that one shouldn't compare boolean values using == - so don't use it unless you absolutely need to.Also, please don't name variables dict or map (even if it's for demonstration purposes only) because they shadow the bulitins.
Iterating over a mapping yields only keys. Use map.items() instead.
