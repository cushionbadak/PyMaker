This question already has an answer here:Naming conflict with built-in function                    7 answers                While following a tutorial for python, I got to know that we can use print for a variable name, and it works fine. But after assigning the print variable, how do we get back the original print function?Now, the last call gives the error TypeError: 'int' object is not callable, since now print has the integer value 5.But, how do we get back the original functionality of print now?
