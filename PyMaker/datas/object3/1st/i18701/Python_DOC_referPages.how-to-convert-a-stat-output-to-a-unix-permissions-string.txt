If you run os.stat(path) on a file and then take its st_mode parameter, how do you get from there to a string like this: rw-r--r-- as known from the Unix world?
Since Python 3.3 you could use stat.filemode:
Something like this:
The following function will achieve this, given some usual circumstances (i.e. I haven't tested it under Windows or with SELinux).This produces a basic string as asked. However, this could also be improved to display further data, e.g. whether it is a directory (d) or a symlink (l). Feel free to improve it.
