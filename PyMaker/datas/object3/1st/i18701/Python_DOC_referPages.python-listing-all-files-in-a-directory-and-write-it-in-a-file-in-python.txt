If you are using Python, you might as well do it the Python way:
On Unix, os.system returns the exit code of the process you invoked. So, os.system("ls") will give you an integer, not a list of files.Instead, use the subprocess module. The check_output method will give you the values that are printed to the screen.As an example gives:total 75032\n-rw-rw-r--  1 user  user         0 Jun  3 22:04 122.txt\n-rw-rw-r--  1 user  user         0 Jun  3 22:04 154.txt\n-r--------  1 user  user      8666 Mar 29 22:11 2731_74814450810_2074865_n.jpg\n-rw-rw-r--  1 user  user    111872 May 30 21:40 3065397482_cd8b581c9a.jpg\n-rw-rw-r--  1 user  user     24661 Jun 18 13:11 375585_782393371042_1430263587_n.jpg\nTaking the single string returned by check_output and turning it into a list of filenames is left as an exercise to the reader.
