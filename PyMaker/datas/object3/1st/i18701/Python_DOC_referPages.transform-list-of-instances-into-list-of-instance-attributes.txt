I have a list of instances, and I need to extract from that list a certain attribute of each of the instances, which will form a new list. I'm somewhat new to Python, and the only way I can solve this makes use of the exec() function, which obviously makes it a horrible solution. Does anybody know of a better way?My current function is:For example, working with the class 'my_class' with attribute 'name':
You can make use of getattr instead of using exec:You could also simplify your function by using generators:You could leave off the square braces if you don't mind getting an iterator instead of a list. (You might need parentheses to do so.)
You can use attrgetter with map:attrgetter('foo') creates a function that returns the foo attribute of whatever argument you call it with. Plus, it's implemented in C and will be faster than getattr() and a list comprehension.If you're using Python 3, map won't return a list, so you'll have to pass it through list() to get one.
