I am trying to add a comment form to my HTML test site, but i can not get the form to write the comments to a file. How can i get the form to write comments to the file? This is the python code that i am using for the server
Using this code, you will need to extend myHandler to handle a POST request, and then in the method that accepts a POST request, you will need to parse the form data out yourself. This site provides a simple example of getting POST data: http://pymotw.com/2/BaseHTTPServer/#http-post. Once you have the comment from the form data, you can write it to a file like you normally would in any other Python application. Here is some Python documentation on reading and writing files if you need it: http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files.That said, code like this that operates directly on raw requests is not usually written for production use. Generally speaking, web applications are developed using a framework that has pieces that do a lot of this work for you. The framework is often run under an independent web server. For example, Django is a web application framework, and you might run your Django application using Apache and mod_python.In terms of other frameworks, I'm fond of flask personally. You might find CherryPy interesting since CherryPy provides both a web application framework and a web server to run it under, which might be better to minimize server set up issues while you're just beginning to learn about web applications. (flask does come with a development server you could use just for testing, but that development server is hardly ready for production use.)
