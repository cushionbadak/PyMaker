You should read the documentation for the configparser module, it does a decent job explaining things. Be sure to read the docs for the version of Python 3 you are using though, as the interface seems to have been extended quite a bit between versions.Starting in Python 3.2, it is possible to treat a ConfigParser instance as if it was a Python dictionary (the term used in the docs is the "mapping protocol"). That means, you can probably just create a class instance with FopsTest(**config), or perhaps FopsTest(**config["TheSectionICareAbout"]) if you only want the items from a specific section of the file. See this section of the docs for details.
