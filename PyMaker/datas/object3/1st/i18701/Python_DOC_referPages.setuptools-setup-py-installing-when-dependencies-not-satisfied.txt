I have a setup.py that looks a bit (okay, exactly) like this:It installs the package perfectly fine when run with ./setup.py install. However, it does this whether or not the "sonLib" package is installed, ignoring the dependency.Is this expected behavior? Should a setup.py install blithely proceed if the dependencies are not installed, leaving it up to pip or whatever to install them beforehand? If not, and setup.py install ought to fail when dependencies are absent, what am I doing wrong?EDIT: Some version information:
The default install command for Distutils setup doesn't know anything about dependencies. If you are running that, you're right that dependencies will not be checked.Just going by what you've show in the setup.py, though, you are using Setuptools for the setup function. The Setuptools install command is declared to run easy_install, which in turn does check and download dependencies.It is possible you are explicitly invoking the Distutils install, by specifying install --single-version-externally-managed.
