I have a statement like this.I just want to know which of the two assert statement has thrown the exception.Thanks for the answer.
As mentioned in The assert statement docs, you can give an expression after the assertion test expression; that second expression will be passed in the AssertionError. Here's a simple demo:outputThat second expression doesn't have to be a string, it can be anything. Since assertions should only be used to verify program logic, not to validate user data, I generally don't bother passing a nicely-formatted string, I just pass a tuple containing the relevant values, and maybe an identifying string. Eg,
You could use functions from the traceback module. For example, extract_tb returns a list of tuples (named tuples in Python 3.5 and newer) representing the stack trace entries. Each tuple contains a line number as well as the source text line (if available).
You are able to print the last raised exception with traceback.print_exc(). An example:There is also traceback.format_exc() in case you don't want to print.
Maybe you want to differ the exceptions?Then Getting exception details in Python can help you.Copying the answer here:Then you can print out the info.
