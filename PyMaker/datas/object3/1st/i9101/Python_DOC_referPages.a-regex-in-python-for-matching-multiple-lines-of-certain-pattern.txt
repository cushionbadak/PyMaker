Hi I am trying to build a multiline regex to group a line followed by lines beginning with at least one white space.  For exampleHow to build a regex that would group "interface ethertnet 1/1" and its subconfig into one group, and "ip tcp path-mtu-discovery" into another groupand the bgp and it's subcommands into another group.  In other words, a line beginning with non-whitespace character should get grouped with, if it is followed by, lines beginning with whitespaces.  Two lines beginning with non-whitespace character should be two different groups.I tried some of the regex already discussed, but that doesn't help.Thanks in advance
^\S.+: matches lines that start with non-space character.\n[ \t].*: matches lines start with space character.\n$: matches empty line\n(?:[ \t].*|$): matches lines start with space or (|), empty lineUsing itertools.groupby:prints:
