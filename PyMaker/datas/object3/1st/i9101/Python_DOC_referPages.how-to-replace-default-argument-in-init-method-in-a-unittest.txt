I have a class under test that exposes an argument in __init__ just for testing.  It looks like thisIn my test, I want to pass in start_time using a fake time, so I get a time in setUp() first and then pass it to every test method.All this works, but I'm wondering if there's a way for me to avoid having to write start_time=self.fake_start_time in every single test.  Can I somehow replace the __init__ method's default argument in setUp()?I figured out an ugly way to do it, but was wondering if there's a more standard approach, possibly based on mock.patch?

functools.partial can be used to pre-bind arguments. So in this case, you can bind the time to the class constructor and then use the bound constructor without passing additional arguments:
