Natural Text
So I am moving my code from python 2.7 to 3.6 (yay!). However, I realized that all my super-long config files will need to be modified because while a line like this was valid in a config file in 2.7, it is not in 3.6Is there a way to have inline comment in a config file in python 3.6?
It looks like you can specify inline_comment_prefixes as an argument to configparser.ConfigParser.When inline_comment_prefixes is given, it will be used as the set of substrings that prefix comments in non-empty lines.This behavior was changed in python3.2:Changed in version 3.2: In previous versions of configparser behaviour matched comment_prefixes=('#',';') and inline_comment_prefixes=(';',).Note that this also tells you what values to use to recover the old behavior ;-).
