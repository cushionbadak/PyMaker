Natural Text
https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.htmlI am considering to use gzip.open(), and I am a little confused about the mode argument: The mode argument can be any of 'r', 'rb', 'a', 'ab', 'w', 'wb', 'x'  or 'xb' for binary mode, or 'rt', 'at', 'wt', or 'xt' for text mode.  The default is 'rb'.So what is the difference between 'w' and 'wb'? The document states they are both binary mode. So does that mean that there is no difference between 'w' and 'wb'?
It means that r defaults to rb, and if you want text you have to specify it using rt.(as opposed to open behaviour where r means rt, not rb)
Exactly as you say and as already covered by @Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre answer.I just wanted to show some code, as it was fun.Let's have a look at the gzip.py source code in the python library to see that's effectively what happens.The gzip.open() can be found here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/gzip.py and I report belowFew things we notice:  the default mode is rb as the documentation you report saysto open a binary file, it doesn't care whether it's "r", "rb", "w", "wb" for example.This we can see in the following lines:basically the binary file binary_file gets built wether there's an additional b or not as gz_mode can have the b or not at this point.Now the class class GzipFile(_compression.BaseStream) is called to build binary_file.In the constructor the following lines are important:   where can be clearly seen that if 'b' is not present in the mode it will be added  so there's no distinction between the two modes as already discussed.
