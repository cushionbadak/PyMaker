There is a convenient thing in Pascal which is typed binary files.Description from Free Pascal wikiThe type file of <type>, where <type> is any simple type (no references/pointers) or record type, is a binary file representing a sequence of  values. For example, you can have files that are a sequence of integers, floating-point values, or records (as long as all record fields are also simple types). I wonder if I can use something like this with Python data types, C++ classes or just C-like plain structs, i.e. with something more complex than primitive number types.
Python(3) basically has three types of files;textbinaryrawSee the documentation for the io module.Using binary files and struct you could basically create iterators over arbitrary file types.
In C++, the file layout is determined by the programmer.The language provides a binary mode in which data is not translated to or from the file.  Also, some types may contain pointers which are valid when written to a file because the items pointed to may be loaded into different locations by the operating system.  Search the internet for "c++ serialization".
