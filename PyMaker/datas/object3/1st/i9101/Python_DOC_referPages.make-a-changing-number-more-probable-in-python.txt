Natural Text
I have 6 colours associated with the values 1 to 6 that are all equally probable:Now I want a second colour to print such that 50% of the time it will be the same as the first colour.  In the past I have used numpy to augment probability, but I only makes a set value more probable:How do I change the probability such that it will make a previous selection more likely?
You could change the p or the input every time you call it.
Try this without using numpy or any other library,next will have the 50% probability you wanted.Since the probList will be filled with 5 times the last color out of 10, it is 50% probability. And for the rest of the colors probability is equally divided.Example:Lets say randC= 5Now probList will becomeThus getting 5 from the above list will have a probability of 50%.
