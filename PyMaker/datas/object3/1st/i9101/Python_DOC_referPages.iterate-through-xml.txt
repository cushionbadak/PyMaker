What is the easiest way to navigate through XML with python?I would go with regex and try to get the values of the lines I need but is there a pythonic way? something like xml[0][1] etc?
As @deceze already pointed out, you can use xml.etree.ElementTree here.You can iterate over all children nodes of root:Children are nested, and we can access specific child nodes by index, so root[0][1] should work (as long as the indices are correct).
