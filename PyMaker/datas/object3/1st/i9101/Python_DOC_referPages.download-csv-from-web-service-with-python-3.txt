I am trying to download a CSV file from a web service with Python 3.5.3. but I always get an error.ExampleI have this url If I open it with the browser it start downloading a watchlist.csv file.I wrote the followng Phython code:but I get the error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in        html = response.read() AttributeError: 'Request' object has no attribute 'read'what's wrong? If I use the same code with a static file path it works but it doesn't with the web service.I don't think this is a duplicate question because this is about PDF and how to manage PDF, not about CSV and how to download.
You can use urlretrieve Because your url gives me ERROR 404 it will be safer to use try/except
I'm not a frequent user of urllib package, I tend to use requests, which is HTTP for humans. But only by reading this HOWTO about urllib I can see that you are trying to read from an instance of Request, which gives you the error you are seeing. You should instead be reading from a response, which in turns you get from opening a request.The following snippet is a simple modification of the official example in the link I provided, i.e., I didn't try it out, it's only here to show my point. I think it should give you something to work with.
