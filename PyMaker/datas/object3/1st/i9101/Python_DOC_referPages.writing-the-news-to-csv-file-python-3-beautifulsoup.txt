Natural Text
I want Python3.6 to write the output of the following code into a csv. It would be very nice to have it like this: one row for every article (it's a News-Website) and four columns with "Title", "URL", "Category" [#Politik, etc.], "PublishedAt".For writing to a csv I already have this.....and need to know what's next to do. THX!! in advance!
You can collect all the desired extracted fields into a list of dictionaries and use the csv.DictWriter to write to the CSV file:Note how we are locating the categories and the "published at" - we need to go to the next sibling element and split the text by comma, stripping out the extra parenthesis.
