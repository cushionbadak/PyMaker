I have the following code for a list of lists with the intention of creating a matrix of numbers:On using the following code which i figured out would reverse the list, it produces a matrix ...The output is:I want however, the output to be as below, so that the numbers "connect" as they go up:Also, for an upvote, I'd be interested in more efficient ways of generating the matrix in the first place. For instance, to generate a 7x7 array  - can it be done using a variable, for instance 7, or 49. Or for a 10x10 matrix, 10, or 100?UPDATE:Yes, sorry - the sublists should all be of the same size. Typo aboveUPDATE BASED ON ANSWER BELOWThese two lines:produce the following output:but I want them to print one line after the other, like a matrix ....also, so I can check the output is as I specified. That's all I need essentially, for the answer to be the answer!
usually 2D matrices are created, manipulated with numpythen index slicing can reorder rows, columnsif you really want a list of lists:numpy is popular but not a official Standard Library in Python distributionsof course it can be done with list manipulation
You need to reverse the list and also the sub-lists:Note that lst[::-1] reverses the list via list slicing, see here. You can visualize the resulting nested lists across multiples lines with pprint:
