So far I have only been taught how to program/script at my school for console programs but wanted to start making some applications with an actual interface other then the command-line, unfortunately I have no idea where to begin. I tried to look it up but all I found were guides on how to "design" them not program them. As such I would like to ask you how exactly should I get started on this, I know this is a rather broad question but just a few links to some study material that can help me get started is enough. The languages I have been taught are Visual Basic and Python but I also know HTML and CSS, I am only slightly familiar with JavaScript.(Bonus Question: so when looking at the website for Atom.io I saw that the editor was made in JavaScript, node.js, HTML and CSS. I was wondering how did they use HTML and CSS for a desktop app? Also, is it possible to do that without node.js and JavaScript, say for example with Python?)
Recommend begin with:Visual Basic: Windows Forms(have a nice GUI editor, easier than TkInter) Python: TkInter(Everything simple with pack()). About HTML/CSS/JS desktop app use Electron http://electron.atom.io/
Given you already know python , you can use python library "Tkinter" to get started.https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htmhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter
Have a look at Graphics Py document created by John Zellehttp://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf
