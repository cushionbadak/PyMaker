I am capturing a packet from the network and trying to parser it into my python program and display the source MAC, destination MAC and Protocol each packet in it consists of. Error occurred in last line: "print("Protocol:",str[protocol],"Time to live:",str[timetolive])"My code:
Seeems like you are using [] instead of () for str function,use str(protocol), str(timetolive); check str, modify code to str(protocol.encode()), str(timetolive.encode()) for python3 compatibility.
Change the last line to:You are trying to access the str function with square brackets, which isn't going to work.
