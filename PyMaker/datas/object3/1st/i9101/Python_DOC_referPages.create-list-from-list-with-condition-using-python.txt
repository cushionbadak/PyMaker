I have a list called [7,1,2,2,3,1,2,3,3]. So we have to create another list with elements like if element in original is one time then simply append, if elements multiple times and in consecutive then sum up and add into new list. Output for above list should be [7,1,4,3,1,2,6]any help is much appreciable.
Yet another case for itertools.groupby, it's great at merging runs of identical values:which outputs:It's summing each run of identical numbers (including "runs" of a single value, so no special handling needed for the non-duplicate case), replacing the run with the sum.
