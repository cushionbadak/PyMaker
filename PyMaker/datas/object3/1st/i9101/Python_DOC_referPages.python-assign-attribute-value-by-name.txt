As part of a bigger project in python3, I need a method in the spirit of to the following (not working) code: I need this because I don't have prior knowledge on which attribute of Q has to be incremented. A  solution would be to declare specific functions for each attribute and use some selector, but I'd prefer to avoid this if possible. Is there a tidy way to do this ?
It is a very bad idea to use eval(..) (in almost any context). You can use getattr(..) and setattr(..) which are more secure:getattr(obj,name) and setattr(obj,name,val) get and set the attribute of an object. So here you can get/set an attribute if you do not know the name in advance.So the resulting code is:
A combination of setattr and getattr would do:yielding 101 for Q.a after your snippet executes.getattr just grabs an attribute from an object by a given name (and allows for a default to be used if the attribute doesn't exist); similar to Q.<val_name>. setattr performs the assignment, setting the attribute with the given name on the object.
You can use the build-in function vars which returns a dictionary of variables declared in given scope. It's usage looks like this:
