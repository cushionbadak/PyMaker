For the following codemypy return following errors (python 3.4):I don't understand how specify i want subclases of A as Dict keys. How to declare type ?
I may not be understanding how the typing and mypy modules work, but there seems to be some kind of bug going on here. If I do this (example adapted from the typing.Type section of the docs):There is no mypy error. If I do this: There is also no error. However, this does produce the mypy error: Based upon my understanding of the documentation, this error shouldn't be happening. 
It looks like you are doing this correctly, but it is required to declare the types for the MAPPING_X and MAPPING_Y first. This fixes the problem. No mypy errors. However, it seems to me that your code as written should work, and that this is the symptom of a bug.
