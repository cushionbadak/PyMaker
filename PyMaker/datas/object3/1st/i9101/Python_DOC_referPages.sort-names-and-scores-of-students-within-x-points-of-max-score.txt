I have a csv file with this format that contains one column with last names, another column with first names, and another column with averages.I want the program to find and print the word1, word2, and points of the students within 5 points of the maximum score. (So if the maximum score is 91, then all names and all scores starting from 86(included) to 91 would be listed.So far I have this:I'm an amateur so any help is greatly appreciated! (Can't use pandas or any of those cool shortcuts)
The first step you want is to get the maximum score.  You have a list of rows, so you can scan through these.  (I'm renaming your row to rows, because it is a list of rows, rather than a single row):Now you want to filter based on whether the score is within 5 points of the max:I, personally, prefer the functional style of Python, but you can do similar things with loops, etc., of course.Another approach for the max_score:
Here's a short example of how to sort the rows by third column using sorted:Output:First parameter of sorted is an iterable that is going to be sorted. Conveniently reader is an iterable so we can pass that as an argument once we have removed the first row containing column names. Second parameter is key function which takes an element from iterable as an argument and returns key to be used in sorting. Since we want to sort by third column we return that once we have converted it to int. If we would skip the conversion student with score 9 would be listed before student with score of 89 since '9' is greater than '89' in alphabetical ordering.Third parameter is just a flag telling that we want the result in reverse order, greatest items first.
