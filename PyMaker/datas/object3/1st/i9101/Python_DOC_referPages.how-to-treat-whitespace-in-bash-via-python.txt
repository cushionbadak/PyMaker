I am trying to run the ffmpeg command to record the screen using the subprocess module. Everything is fine with this line:GivenPathAndName is something like file:///home/user/Videos/test.mp4. As I said, it's working. (It is in this form because I am getting the folder URI from a GTK widget).However, the problem is when I select a folder with a white spaces. Like file:///home/user/Documents/New Folder. This will give me the following error in terminal:I know that this is because of bash misinterpreting the whitespace. And that I can actually run it with putting \ before the whitespace to solve it. However, I couldn't manage to find a way to do that from Python sending it to Bash.
There is nothing about the bash or python in cooperation with the bash. Here is a little example that shows that:Starting this little script with the bash it'll give you the following:And to be sure about the file://.So the problem must be with how you get GivenPathAndName from your script or other parts of the program. In order to decode this url encoding use urllib.parse.unquote() for Python3 or urllib.unquote() for Python2.
