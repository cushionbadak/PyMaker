Natural Text
So I have this project for school and I am so close to finishing it but there is one that I just cant seem to get to work properly. One of the functions I have is:For the most part the function runs exactly how I want it to. I take a string and it returns numbers as a string.For example: But when I do this one:it returns 346448 instead of the 3464408 like it is supposed to do (according to my assignment). Now I know the function is giving me the correct answer based on the code, but what am I missing to have it include the 0 before the 8? EDIT:Function is supposed to take the string that you pass(tone) and break it up into 2 letter chunks(vowel/consonant pair). With the pair, it is supposed to use the pair and index them with vowels/consonants and return a number. >>>alphapinDecode('hi') returns 27 because consonants[h] gives idx = 5 while vowels[i] gives idx2 = 2
I think your lecture trying to test students coding adaptability.If really want achieve some output like that please try like below
Your approach is perhaps awkward - I would iterate two characters at a time:OK, now we have the code looking a bit better, we can see, I hope, that for the co pair in your second text, the value is 1*5 + 3, which equals 8, of course, but you really want 08. There's a number of ways to do this, but since you're a beginner I'll illustrate the easiest way.EDIT: Let's forget about accumulating the answer in a string as we can simplify the code:
