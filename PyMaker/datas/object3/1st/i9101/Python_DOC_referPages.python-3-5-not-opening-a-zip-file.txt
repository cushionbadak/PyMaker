I'm not able to open the file downloaded from this URL using Python's zipfile facility.This file does open using my Mac's built-in deflater, however, and python-magic (via import magic; magic.from_file("...")) reports that the file is:'Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract'.Yet when I do:I get:BadZipFile: File is not a zip fileMy Python version is 3.5.2. What's going on here?
ZipFile opens the file based on the file name:
zipfile.ZipFile claims compatibility with file-like objects, but it almost certainly requires that they be binary mode, not text mode.For a minimal changes fix, try:Or as Trey mentioned, just use the with statement on zipfile.ZipFile('name/of/file.zip') directly, without opening it as a plain file first.
