I have two dictionaries:andI am trying to create a new dictionary that maps the values start and end as keys to a dictionary that would contain the info of dict1, while keeping those that are not present in dict2 as keys, e.g.:
Use dict.setdefault() to create the nested dictionaries in dict3 if not yet there, and dict.get() to determine the key in the top-level output dictionary:So dict2.get(k, k) will produce the value from dict2 for a given key from dict1, using the key itself as a default. So for the 'x' key, that'll produce 'x' as there is no mapping in dict2 for that key.Demo:
I actually figured it out while abstracting the example and typing up my question here (should have maybe done this earlier...). Anyways: Yay!So here is my solution, in case it may help someone. If someone knows a swifter or more elegant way to do it, I would be glad to learn!
