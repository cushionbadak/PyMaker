I'm looking for a one liner to converttowhere the algorithm combines the lists up to a certain threshold length.I currently have this
There's nothing wrong with your original implementation but if you insist oneliner here's one ugly option:Output:The idea is to generate list of (item count so far, sublist) tuples and group them by dividing count by THRESHOLD.
Cracked it but only because I'm stubborn. It's really ugly and inefficient though and maybe there's a cleaner way but, even if there is, it's not worth it.EDIT: Because I was testing this in Python 2.7 I missed the fact that division works differently in Python 3. Thanks @nexus66 for pointing out a modification (which just makes it even longer!).
This may not be ideal, but it would be my attempt. The idea is to chain your lists together with itertools.chain , then pull from the chain with itertools.islice and append a new list until you cannot any longer. It admittedly isn't a one liner.  Demo
This is an ugly one-liner... It's not exactly what you asked for (pretty close), but maybe it'll give you some idea of how to approach it...
I appreciate all the help, and I learned that a one liner is not be best for this problem as it is ugly and unreadable and probably inefficient. That being said I did come up with this which seems to work from a different slightly cleaner approach.
