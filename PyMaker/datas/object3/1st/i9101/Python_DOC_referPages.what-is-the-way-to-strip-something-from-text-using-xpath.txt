Natural Text
i am using an xpath in python  to parse a table from an html file. i am using this xpath :This give me output as two strings:output i want:but i want $ sign to be stripped of how can i do that in general using xpath? i have tried substring-after but it does not works.this is how i tried :but i got this output:Australia was missing from the result
Aside from using translate() (as posted in the other answer), you can also use substring() function and dynamically determine the beginning of a slice:By the way, this approach is a bit safer than using translate() since, here we are only stripping a single $ character at the beginning of a string if it exists, but translate() would replace all the occurrences of $ in every td text you are extracting. You may get some unwanted side effects.Note that you have to do it in two steps in any case - the translate() or substring() functions would not be applied to every node if used like translate(//td//text(), "$", ""), references:How to apply the XPath function 'substring-after'Is it possible to apply normalize-space to all nodes XPath expression finds?Or, you can trim it using Python and .lstrip():
This will evaluate the text() in ['australia', '$3333.99'], and for the australia, it dose not contains $, this will return false and will not show in the result
