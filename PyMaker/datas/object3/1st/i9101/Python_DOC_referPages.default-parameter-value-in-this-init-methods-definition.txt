I am looking at some python code to control a camera and having some trouble understanding it due to being new at python.  I see that the src parameter is set to 0.  Does this mean that if a src is not given 0 will be used otherwise the given src will be used?so if I do something like this then the src will be 3?and if I do this then src will be 0?
Quick answer is - yes.If you run:src equals to 3if you run:src equals to 0(default value).As an additional Python's feature, Python supports *args and **kwargs for cases when you're not sure how much and which arguments will be used in your method(it's very general explanation, but I hope it's clear).Some example of using **kwargs I've posted here:http://codepad.org/E7m3PnVrP.S. 1) use *args when you're not sure how many arguments might be passed to your function, i.e. it allows you pass an arbitrary number of arguments to your function.2) **kwargs allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance
