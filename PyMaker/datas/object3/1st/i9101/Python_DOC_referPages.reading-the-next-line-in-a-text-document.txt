Hello I'm trying to make an live info screen to a school project,I'm reading through a file which does a lot of different thing which depending of what line it's reading.As seen in the code, every line in my document i want to check the next line because if it matches a certain string, i set a variable.from what i could read myself to, python has a built in function next() that is suppost to be able to do the job for me. But when i run my code im presented with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'next'`
next() should be called on a file object (f in your case), not a string (line).Python knows the current position of f, so f.next() will automatically read the line following line.Note that this will influence the for line in f loop : this loop will skip every other line, the one returned by f.next().With this test.txt file :This code :returns :If this is not the desired behaviour, you could look at this thread.
you can hold your previous line in a helper string. (note, I'm using previous/current instead of current/next)
