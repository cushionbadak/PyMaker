Natural Text
I want to turn every hashtag in the comment textfield to url so that it will be clickable.For example, a user submit,I want it to return like this in template,Where whole text will display and all hashtag will be clickable by embedding {hashtag}.I tried the below templatetags code but it won't return the hashtags with the text. It will only return this,app_extras.pyIn the template, I did,What am I missing?
You will need to use mark_safe to mark your return value as html.  Keep in mind that since you are marking it as safe, you must escape it first.  re.sub() is what you were looking for:Note:  We assume that value is text (unescaped), and create_hashtag_link(tag) assumes tag is a word (\w+) and does not need escaping.  For creating links to other fragments of text, use format_html() instead of .format()
