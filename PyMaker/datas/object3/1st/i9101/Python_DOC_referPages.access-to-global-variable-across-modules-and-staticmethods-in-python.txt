Assume two Python modules titled GlobVars and MyModule.Module GlobVars is intended to supply the other module with the global variable my_glob_var.Module MyModule contains a class with two functions (_concat and getConcat), one of which (i.e., _concat) is a staticmethod that attempts to access the aforementioned global variable. Function getConcat accesses the staticmethod and is supposed to return a concatenated string.When I attempt to load both modules and execute function getConcat, the global variable does not seem to be properly accessed. Why is that and what is the solution?
In your particular case you don't have to use global keyword nor GlobVars class.Instead:By the way python docs have little section about sharing global vars across modules: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html?highlight=global#how-do-i-share-global-variables-across-modules
