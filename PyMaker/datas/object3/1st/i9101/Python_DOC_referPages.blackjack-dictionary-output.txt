I am making a blackjack game and am stuck on the first part where I need to define a function that gets the integer points for the card s. So input is the string value of card and the output should be the integer score of the card. Can anyone help with what I've written?
Accessing values in a dictionary is not done via the values() method, but rather via bracket-notation (eg. my_dictionary[key]). See d[key] in the documentation.Additionally, you could try just making a dict instead of a full-blown function:If you need it to be a function you can easily wrap this dictionary:Note: KeyError is the exception raised when trying to access a non-existent key in a dictionary, so if we encounter one of those, we can choose to instead raise our custom ValueError exception.Or if you want to get fancy (read: save some keystrokes):In the snippet above, {str(i): i for i in range(2, 11)} uses a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary mapping string values for the integers 2-10 to their numeric values. For the non-numeric cards, I pass them in as keyword arguments. Luckily, python's built-in dict constructor can handle both of these at once! So if you are just beginning you might want to use the first form rather than leverages a bunch of python's advanced features :)
I recommend writing a dictionary outside the function but if you want it inside try thisand then try it like thisKeys in dictionary are strings so you have to use function get_card_value using strings
