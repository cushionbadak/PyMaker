From here I am trying to find the degree sequence given an input like:a,b,c for the verticesand a-b,b-c,c-a for the edges. How do I do this with this type of input?looking for an output like [2,2,2]
You can use Counter to count the edges associated to each vertex:In above Counter constructor takes in an iterable of items and returns a dict like object where the unique items are keys and values the respective counts.Since the ordering of the Counter is random we need to use list comprehension to iterate over the vertices in order to generate list of degrees in the same order.
You can always use the networkx package - which gives you most, if not all, of the functionality you'd want manipulating a graph.  Say you have a path of 4 nodes radially connected you'd find the degree like this:
