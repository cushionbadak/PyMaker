In this code i am trying to finger users from a domain to return their credentials, but when i actually call the finger command in variable pep and have it displayed in the variable results which gets packed into a tkinter window. When i run it the only thing that is displayed is a '0' and i can see the finger command run properly and return the correct info the background Debug I/O but it does not display it in the tkinter window, i have no idea why. Any help? (P.S. for anyone running the code, entering a blank string on the finger_target returns a list on all users online)
subprocess.call returns only status code - error code returned by finger - and 0 means OK.Use subprocess.check_output to get text.BTW: tkinter should have only one Tk() window (main window). To create other windows use Toplevel(). And tkinter should have only one mainloop (it is its "engine")BTW: you can use tkinter.messagebox.showinfo to display window with message.BTW: I use lower_case names to make code more readable.See PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code
