Natural Text
I'm attempting to build my first program in Python 3.4 that aims to parse out forensically interesting data from the setupapi.dev.log file in windows XP (a text based log file that stores it's data in ASCII).I'm currently using re.finditer to identify the location of "VID" but need to specify that its the following 5 characters that I am interested in. So far my code looks something like this:results:Is there a way of using this function so that I can parse out the text that follows VID within the text file? 
In order to get the 5 characters after a pattern, you can use re.findall with a group:From the docs:If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. If you want to stick with finditer, the syntax will be slightly more complex because you have to extract the group manually:
