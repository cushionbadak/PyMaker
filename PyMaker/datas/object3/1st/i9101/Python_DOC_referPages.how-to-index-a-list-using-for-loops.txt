I have a list of words. I want to turn each element in the list into a sublist and add to each a number so that each entry is indexed. So it should outputI know how to do such a thing with a while loopBut I want to use the following kind of structure with a for-loop: I'm not sure how to do that with a for-loop. Can someone explain how to do this? 
If you want the inner parts to be lists then you can cast the enumerate result to a list inside a list comprehension:
Use enumerateIf you need a list of lists instead of tuples, you can do list(map(list(enumerate(mylist, 1)))) or [[number, word] for number, word in enumerate(mylist, 1)]
Use enumerate:
This is the method I think you are looking for.Uses a for loop to go through each item in list 1 and the indexes in list 1 and the adds 1 to the index so that it doesn't start with 0.
