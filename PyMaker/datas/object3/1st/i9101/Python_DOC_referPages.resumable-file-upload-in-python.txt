I am trying to upload the file in python and i want to upload the file in resumable mode i.e when the internet connection resume , the file upload resume from the previous stage.Is there any specific protocol that supports resumable file upload.Thanks in advance
So what you need is to seek the file and send a REST command to tell the server to download from the right location.Here is code that would try untill it finishes to upload with resume, also debug is on so you can follow:The magic line is:Which has rest=rest_pos.If optional rest is given, a REST command is sent to the server,  passing rest as an argument. rest is usually a byte offset into the  requested file, telling the server to restart sending the file’s bytes  at the requested offset, skipping over the initial bytes. Note however  that RFC 959 requires only that rest be a string containing characters  in the printable range from ASCII code 33 to ASCII code 126. The  transfercmd() method, therefore, converts rest to a string, but no  check is performed on the string’s contents. If the server does not  recognize the REST command, an error_reply exception will be raised.  If this happens, simply call transfercmd() without a rest argumentSourceAlso some code taken from here
