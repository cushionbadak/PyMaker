I'm searching for a method to get a simple python server to listen for a specific local IP address on my LAN using the socket import (assuming the destination computer has a client script).  socket.bind() and  socket.listen(int) methods cannot provide me with any options for filtering IP addresses. Am I missing a method?
I don't think Python has a built-in method to do that.However, as WhatsThePoint suggested, you can add your own filtering, as socket.recvfrom() will give you the client address, compare it with your required address, and if it's wrong, throw away the data.
