I am trying to improve my machine learning system by combining my features. I have written some code to generate all of the combinations of my features. However, it seems very inefficient. Is there a way to do this faster?
First, check out Python's itertools package; that will help make your code more efficient and readable.  You can do most of the combinatoric things you want with that package.One great advantage is that you get a generator for the sequence of combinations, so you don't have to store them all at once in a list.Also, do note that you have an inherently slow process.  If you want all possible combinations of 16 features, that's 2**16 times through any processing loop.  You're already at 64K iterations, and that will double for every added feature.Can you consider doing a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and feature reduction before you get into any heavy processing?
