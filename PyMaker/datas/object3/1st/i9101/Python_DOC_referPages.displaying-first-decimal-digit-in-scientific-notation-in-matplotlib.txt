I am currently generating different figures with a scientific notation for the y-axis leading to ticks like 2 or 6 on some plots, but 2.5 or 8.9 on some others. I would like to always have ticks with one decimal on the y-axis, even if it adds a zero. Here is an exampleWhat could I add to force to plot ticks 1.0, 2.0, etc. on the y-axis?
The ScalarFormatter does not currently support custom formats for the ticks, such as setting numbers of decimals. However you can extend the class, so to force it to use a format that you specify. Here is an example:Here is how it will look.
You can get the ticks and format it like you want.
