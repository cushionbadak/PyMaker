I've got a model I'm exposing through Wagtail's modeladmin that works until I try to apply a list_filter including a ForeignKey. I've got a self-referencing model (to store Counties, Cities, and Towns) called Region that I'd like to be able to create a filter on by the Parent level.I'm running Wagtail 1.8.1 on Django 1.10. Here's the model:And the ModelAdmin from wagtail_hooks.py:It works fine if I comment out the list_filter line in the class RegionAdmin. The documentation says it can take a ForeignKey in the list. Am I missing something obvious? Stack trace is here:Thanks for any help or ideas!
You are missing a comma:Without the comma, the parentheses are ignored and django will be iterating the string, and not a tuple (because there is no tuple!), hence the attempt to access field p.From the docs:a tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective.
