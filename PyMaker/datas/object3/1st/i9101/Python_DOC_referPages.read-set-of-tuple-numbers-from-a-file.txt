I have a file with the first two lines looking like this:I want to read each tuple and get each number (without the commas and parenthesis). I read like this:How can I go about doing the above? Any help would be appreciated.
First wayReplace all brackets and commas with spaces and then split the line removing the spaces. Thus, you obtain a flat list of all the numbers. By iterating through the list and getting the numbers at indices i and i+1, you can get them in pairs.Second waySimilar to the first way, except that you only replace the brackets with spaces and split. Now, you get a list of strings "first_number,second_number", so you iterate through those and split at the comma to get the pair.You can read more about replacing multiple characters in a string here.
I would go for regular expressions:Another interesting solution is to convert the line into a valid Python tuple by inserting commas between the pairs and then apply ast.litereal_eval:
Here's a relatively simple way of doing it that uses ast.literal_eval():Output:
You can, also, do it like this example (i assume your input file is called input_file):Output:
This will do it - if you can hold your gag reflex long enough:Maybe just go with DYZs answer.
