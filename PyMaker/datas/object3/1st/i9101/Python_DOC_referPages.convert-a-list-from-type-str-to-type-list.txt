It must be simple, but I don't know it:I've got a file.json with this contentand imported it as dataI'm quite happy that this worksBut unfortunately data is now converted as strSo I can't use data to do things like deleting items.How do I convert data to a normal list of dicts? (<type 'list'>)
If you use the file method .read(), you always get a string. You'd have to parse it yourself, but fortunately, Python has a json module that does all the parsing for you. It even reads the file:But, as Stefan has pointed out, your file isn't valid JSON - it rather looks like the repr() output of a Python object. In that case, it's nearly as simple:
Very simple with json library.Deserialize json_string (json_string is str or unicode instance containing a JSON document) to a Python object (dixt in our case).EDIT:As Stefan mention, this is not a valid json(it looks like a list) and therefore you can see Tim's answer.
