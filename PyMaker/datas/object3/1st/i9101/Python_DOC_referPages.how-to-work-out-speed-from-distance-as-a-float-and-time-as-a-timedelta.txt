If I have a  distance in km float variable, and a timedelta variable of time, how can I work out speed in KM/H? I'm not sure how to change timedelta to hours as a float. An example would be:Having an output of around 54Kmh
convert that '1:04' to secondsso you have speed in distance/secondper hour, you mulitply by 3600thanks for the 'total_seconds' tip guys.  although , in this case i got
Use distance / ( time.total_seconds() / 3600.0 ) (assuming distance is already in km).
First of all, you have to initialize your timedelta with the proper arguments:timedelta has a method total_seconds() so you fetch:By dividing by 3600, you get the number of hours:(in python-3.x it is sufficient to divide by 3600 (int)).and next you calculate the speed by dividing the distance (km) by the time (hours):
