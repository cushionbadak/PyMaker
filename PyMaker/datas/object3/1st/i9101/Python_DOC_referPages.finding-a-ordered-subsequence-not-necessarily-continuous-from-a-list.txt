I am stuck with a problem. I have a list for e.g. [A,B,C,D,E]. the size of the list may vary. I have to check whether a sub-sequence for e.g. [A,C,E] occurs in the main list. The size of the sub-sequence may also vary.The problem here is that the sub-sequence here need not be continuous. Just the order of occurrence matters. Some examples:
You could use iter to produce an iterator whose consumption enforces order on each member check. DemoThis approach works because the in keyword for a list is implemented as a sequence iteration (the docs): For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression x in y is equivalent to any(x is e or x == e for e in y).
You could easily write a recursive solution if you want to understand how to solve similar problems:called like isPresent(['A','C','E'],['A','B','C','D','E'])
You can do a fairly simple iterative solution as long as both inputs are iterable.
