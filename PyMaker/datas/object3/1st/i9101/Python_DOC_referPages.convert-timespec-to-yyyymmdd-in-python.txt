I am using the .st_birthtime method to get the date of creation of a file. The result looks like:1359492652which I can convert to a more readable format2013-01-29 21:50:52using My question is: how can I convert it to YYYYMMDD format? I don't give importance of the hours and minutes. In this example the result should be 20130129Something like the SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), @date, 112) of T-SQL.I am using Python version 3.5.3 and MacOS.
It's this what you wanted?I've assumed that 1359492652 is the total of seconds so this is the right date formatters for Python, tested it in Python 3 interpreter. The first line which is a comment is the same result as you had with the datetime method.if you want here is a link for the strftime behaviour: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
