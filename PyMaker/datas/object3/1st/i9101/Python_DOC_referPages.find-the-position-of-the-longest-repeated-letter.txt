Natural Text
I have a file that contains letters. I need to find the position of the longest repeated letters. For example, if the file contains aaassdddffccsdddfgssfrsfspppppppppppddsfs, I need a program that finds the position of ppppppppppp. I know that I need to use a .index function to find the location however I am stuck on the loop.
Using itertools.groupby:Gives the idx and the length of the longest identical substring:
You're going to need to loop through the entire string.  Keep track of each new letter you come across as well as it's index and how long each sequence is.  Only store the max sequence
Here is an onelinerThe above generates (key, position, length). You can get the maximum length byapplying reduce
A quick way of achieving this is to use a regex to match repeating characters with (.)(\1+).  Then we loop over all those results using a generator comprehension and find the max according to the length (key=len).  Finally having found the largest string, we call thestr.index() to find where the longest repeated letter occurred:Here is the same code broken out into stages:
