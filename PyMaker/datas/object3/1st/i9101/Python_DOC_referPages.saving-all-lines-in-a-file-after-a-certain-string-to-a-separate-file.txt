Natural Text
I have a file containing a block of introductory text for an unknown number of lines, then the rest of the file contains data. Before the data block begins, there are column titles and I want to skip those also. So the file looks something like this:I want to record the Time Position and Count data to a separate file. Time Position and Count Data appears only after UniqueString.
Is it what you're looking for?How it works:files can be iterated, so we can read infile line by line by simply doing [... for line in infile]in the operation part, we use the fact that writeline() will not be triggered if the first operand for and is False.in the or part, we set up the trigger if the desired line is found, so writeline will be fired for the next and consequent linesdefault initial value for reduce is None, which evaluates to False
You could extract and write the data to another file like this:It is pretty straight forward I think: The file is opened and all lines are read, a list comprehension slices the list beginning with the header string and the desired remaining lines are wrote to file again.
You could create a generator function (and more info here) that filtered the file for you. It operates incrementally so doesn't require reading the entire file into memory at one time.This could be optimized a little if you're using Python 3, but the basic idea would be the same.
