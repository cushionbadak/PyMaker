Hi does anyone know how to make a function that replaces every alphabetic character in a string with a character from a given word (repeated indefinitely). If a character is not alphabetic it should stay where it is. Also this has to be done without importing anything.So far i come up with:but, this function just prints 'abcabc abcabcabcabc abcabc' instead of 'ab cabc ab'
