This is just an introductory class code, and i'm wondering how to find the max of all the next_value variable and compare it to the first_value to print the maximum. My if statement is close but I'm not sure how to fix it 
I will try to keep my answer as clean and simple as possible:
I would just put the values in a list and get the sum and max later, like so:However, if you want to keep the same structure:You can also replace if next_value > maximum: maximum = next_value with just maximum = max(maximum, next_value).
If you used a list instead you could use sum() and max() respectively:Example Usage:Try it here!
