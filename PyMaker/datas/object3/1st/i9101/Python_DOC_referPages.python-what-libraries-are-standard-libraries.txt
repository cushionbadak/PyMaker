This question already has an answer here:How to check if a module/library/package is part of the python standard library?                    3 answers                I am reading PEP 8, and in the imports section it says to put 'standard library imports' in the top of your library import section. My question is: How do I know which libraries are 'standard'? I.e. where can I find a list of what libraries are 'standard'?
Any library that is listed in the Python core documentation for your version is part of the standard library. So anything you don't have to install separately from Python itself.See https://docs.python.org/3/library/ for the Python 3 list.
