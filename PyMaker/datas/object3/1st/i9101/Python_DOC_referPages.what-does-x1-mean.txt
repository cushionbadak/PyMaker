What does [x[1] for x in sortedAverageList] in the coding above?What does x[1] mean?
If sortedAverageList is a sequence containing another sequence with at least 2 elements, [x[1] for x in sortedAverageList] will give you a list of the second element in each of those sequences.Example: For each of the lists [1,2], [5,6], [7,8], x[1] chooses the respective second element. x[0] would choose the first and x[2] would not work because the lists only have two elements.Note that the x in [x[1] for x in sortedAverageList] has nothing to do with the x you define in the line above. Instead it is the variable inside the for loop to which the elements of sortedAverageList are repeatedly assigned.I would recomment to study some basic python tutorial before continuiung with more advanced tasks like plotting.
