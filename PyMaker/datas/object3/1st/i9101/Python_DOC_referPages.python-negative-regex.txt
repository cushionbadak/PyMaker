Natural Text
I have a string such as:The text in this string will not always be in the same format, it will be dynamic, so I can't do a simple find and replace to obtain the product code.I can see that:will get ride of the product code. How do I go about doing the opposite of this, i.e. deleting all of the text, apart from the product code? The product code will always be a 15 character string, starting with the letter A.I have been racking my brain and Googling to find a solution, but can't seem to figure it out.Thanks
Instead of substituting the rest of the string, use re.search() to search for the product number:
In regex, you can match on the portion you want to keep for substituting by using braces around the pattern and then referring to it in the sub-pattern with backslash followed by the index for that matching portion. In the code below, "(A[0-9A-Za-z_]{14})" is the portion you want to match, and you can substitute in the resulting string using "\1".
