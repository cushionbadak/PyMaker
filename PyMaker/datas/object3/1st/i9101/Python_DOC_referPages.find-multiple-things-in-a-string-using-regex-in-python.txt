My input string contains various entities like this: conn_type://host:port/schema#login#passwordI want to find out all of them using regex in python.As of now, I am able to find them one by one, like and so on.Is there a way to do it without if and else?I expect there to be some way, but not able to find it. Please note that every entity regex is different.Please help, I don't want to write a boring code.
No need for ifs. Use findall or finditer to search through your collection of connection types. Filter the list of tuples, as need be.  
Why don't you use re.findall?Here is an example: this will return a list full of matches to your current regex as seen in this example which in this case would be:If you need help making regex patterns in Python I would recommend using the following website:A pretty neat online regex testerAlso check the re module's documentation for more on re.findallDocumentation for re.findallHope this helps!
If you like it DIY, consider creating a tokenizer. This is very elegant "python way" solution.Or use a standard lib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html but note, that your sample URL is not fully valid: there is no schema 'conn_type' and you have two anchors in the query string, so urlparse wouldn't work as expected. But for real-life URLs I highly recommend this approach.
