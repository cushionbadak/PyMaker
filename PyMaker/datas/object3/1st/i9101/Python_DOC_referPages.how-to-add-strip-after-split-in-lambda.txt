How can strip the key value after a split inside of lambda ?The result has spaces :
You can strip each element after splitting:DemoI used a list comprehension rather than a map() call there; it's a little easier on the eye.You can make the whole thing a nested list comprehension too:Now, if you wanted to produce a dictionary, you'll have to filter out any entry that is not a key-value pair:
It seems like you want to create a dict from that list. Note than map, while similar in name to a Java Map, does not produce a dict. Instead, you can feed the result of the map or list comprehension into the dict builtin function. Note, however, that there is no value for key3, so you might have to filter the elements before.Or use str.partition:You could also use a dict comprehension, and optionally provide a default for missing values.
