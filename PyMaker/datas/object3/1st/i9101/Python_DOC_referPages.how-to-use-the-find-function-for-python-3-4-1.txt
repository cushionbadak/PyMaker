Here is my code:This works in python 2.7.3 but I need it to work in 3.4. When I run the code in 3.4 it gives "i" as an invalid syntax.Is there a way of altering the code slightly so that it will work or will a whole new method need to be used instead?Also the program can't be case sensitive.Thanks.  
You need to use input() instead of raw_input() and use print() function to print anything in python 3.x.The following code works for python 3.x. Sample I/O:
Change this:The difference is that raw_input() does not exist in Python 3.x, while input() does. Actually, the old raw_input() has been renamed to input()Also, print become print() as well.
