I am trying to compare two lists for the same element at the same index. The idea is to verify whether both lists contain same element at the same index. If yes, I want to count such occurrences. Here is my code:This gives me a count of 3. What I expect is 1 because only first element of b matched with a's first element. The second element of both lists differ. The third elements are also different. The remaining elements in list a should not count as there is no such index in b.Hope it makes sense. Thanks 
In that case, you should not use nested loops (since this means you will repeat the search over b for each line in a); but use a zip(..):zip takes some iterators and generates tuples. In this case the i-th tuple is thus (a[i],b[i]) so to speak.
Short solution using min() function(to get a limit size of compared sequences):The output:
does the match have to be qualified as following '*|*' ?if not then really simple is: or in later versions of python where iterator args are automatically unpacked:  if the match is just the last bit you could splitand while sum() is more "intentional" len() could be used for a speed advantage since it doesn't have to iterate over the list
