I have recently been learning python 3 and I cannot get any examples involving string interpolation (formatting) to work. I figured my machine was defaulting to python 2, but a quick check reveals:I am on Ubuntu 16.04:Am I just overlooking basic syntax? I have run the same commands on a few computers from fellow students and it seems to execute just fine.
As suggested by Josh Lee in the comment section, that kind of string interpolation was added in Python 3.6 only, see Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.6 (here it's called "PEP 498: Formatted string literals").You, however, seems to be using Python 3.5.2, which does not support that syntax.
