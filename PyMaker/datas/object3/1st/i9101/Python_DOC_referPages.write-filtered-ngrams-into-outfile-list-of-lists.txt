Natural Text
I extracted threegrams from a bunch of HTML files following a certain pattern. When I print them, I get a list of lists (where each line is a threegram). I would like to print it to an outfile for further text analysis, but when I try it, it only prints the first threegram. How can I print all the threegrams to the outfile? (The list of list of threegrams). I would ideally like to merge all the threegrams into one list instead of having multiple lists with one threegram. Your help would be highly appreciated.My code looks like this so far:
Firstly, the punctuation removal could have been simpler, see Removing a list of characters in string But it's not really correct to remove punctuations before you do tokenization, you see that We'll -> Well, which I think it's not desired. Possibly this is a better approach:But do note that the idiom above don't handle multi-character punctuation. E.g. , we see that that the word_tokenize() changes " -> `` , and using the idiom above it didn't remove it:To handle that, explicitly make punctuation into a list and append the multi-character punctuations to it:As for getting the document stream (as you called it all_tokens), here's a neat way to get it:And now to the part of your actual question.What you really need isn't checking the string in the ngrams, rather, you should consider a regex pattern matching.You want to find the pattern \ba\b\s\bleg[\w]+bb\b\s\b[\w]+\b, see https://regex101.com/r/zBVgp4/4Now to write a string to a file, you can use this idiom, see https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#print-is-a-function:In fact, if you are only interested in the ngrams without the tokens, there's no need to filter or tokenize the text ;PYou can simply your code to this:
