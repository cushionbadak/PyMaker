just a quick question. I have been using Tkinter in python in order to create windows. my code is a bit all over the place when it is one file...my question is, is it possible to call a window that will be located in a different file.for example,Window1.py opens a window, there is a button in that window that should initiate window 2, which is located in Window2.py. does the code physically have to be in the same file for it to work together??thanks in advance!
The answer to this question is yes.To link two python files, use:If you are in python 3, use exec(open(r"example").read())If you are in python 2, use open(r"example")-Note: the python 2 example works both in python 2 and 3-They do not need to be in the same file, just simply use their location.e.g. if I had a program on my desktop, I would useexec(open(r"C:/Users/MyName/Desktop/program").read())Hope I could help you :)
