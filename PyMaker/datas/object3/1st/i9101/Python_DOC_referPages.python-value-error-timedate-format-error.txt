I am getting the following error:Here is the code :I'm unable to figure out why I get the error.
A 12-hour clock has no 0 hour; %I will only match 1 through to 12. Your timestamp has an impossible time in it:From the strftime() and strptime() Behavior documentation:%I  Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.  01, 02, ..., 12Assuming 0 is really 12, you could repair this by replacing the ' 0:' with '12:' (note the leading space for the zero!):It doesn't really matter if you have one or two spaces between the year and the hour, the string will be parsed either way.
