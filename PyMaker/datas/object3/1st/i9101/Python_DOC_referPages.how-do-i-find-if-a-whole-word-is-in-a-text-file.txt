Natural Text
My code looks like this:The code basically asks the user for a name, and if the name exists in the text file, then the code says it exists, but if it doesn't it says it couldnt find it.The only problem I have is that if you even enter part of the name, it will tell you the whole name exists. For example the names in my text file are: Anya, Albert and Clemont, all seperated on different lines. If i were to enter 'a' when prompted for user_input, the code will still say the name is present, and will just ask for another name. I understand why its doing this, because 'a' is technically in the line, but how do i make it so that it only says the name exists if they enter the whole thing? By whole thing i mean they enter for example 'Anya', rather than 'a' and the code only says the name exists if they enter 'Anya'. Thanks
Short solution using re.seach() function:Test cases:
To answer the question , just do equal comparison. Also noted that You have infinite loop , is that expected ? I changed the code to exit that loop when a matching name found in the file Input Output
