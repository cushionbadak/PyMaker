I'm trying to install iPy, but I can't seem to do it right. This is the first time I install a module, so please don't assume I should be knowing some things.I downloaded the file, and I have a setup.py. I held down Shift+Right Click, then "open Command Prompt Here", and pasted the following line :python setup.py --help or python setup.py installIt says that it is not recognized as an internal command.I tried opening it in python and running it, and I get this error:I also tried to paste python setup.py --help and python setup.py install in the python console, and I get this:How am I supposed to install it ?EDIT: A screenshot of what I get:EDIT2: 2nd screenshot:
Run this code in a Python shell (i.e. one where you can run Python commands, for example the Python GUI) to get the location of your installed Python:This will give you the complete path to the Python interpreter. Then, in command prompt (Shift-Right Click where the setup.py is located and open Command Prompt) specify the complete path to Python like this:Or whatever your path is.
Sounds like you don't have Python in your $PATH, in that case you need to explicitly write the full path to your Python install, because your shell doesn't know where to find python. For Python 3.6 under Windows that'd probably be C:\Python36\python.exe (or whatever you chose when installing it).Hence, to install iPython, run:
setup.py is designed to be run from the command line. You'll need to open your command prompt (In Windows 7, hold down shift while right-clicking in the directory with the setup.py file. You should be able to select "Open Command Window Here").From the command line, you can typeIf you want to install it then the command is install:If you need to build the package first, use the build command before installing:Hope this helps!HELP:you need more details use this link.Even the above commands may not work correctly. In that case, you can download the Windows installer version which will install the library to your default system Python
