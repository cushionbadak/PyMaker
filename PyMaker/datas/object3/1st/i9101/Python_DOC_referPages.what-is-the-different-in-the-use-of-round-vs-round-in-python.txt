In python 3 this works:But, this doesn't work, Why?:Also, nowdays lots of python scripts don't use this old format __round__, I think for the reason to make the script look more clean. Any other core reasons?
There is no float.round() method, no. You'd use the round() function instead, passing in your value and the number of places to round to.round() is a function because rounding is an operation that applies to all number types, not just floating point numbers. Just like len() applies to all sequences (not just list or tuple or str), and str to all Python objects.Like all __*__ dunder methods, __round__ is a hook for custom classes to override how rounding works for that class. The round() function uses it when producing the output, as does some other functionality.This works:Note that I did not use float(9/5) here! In Python two, that'd be 1.0:because 9/5 is calculated first using integer division. 9.0/5 uses floating point division (because at least one of the operands is a floating point value), so gives you the right quotient:You are using Python 3 here, where / means true division (producing floats even for integer operands), but the float() call is still just redundant there.
