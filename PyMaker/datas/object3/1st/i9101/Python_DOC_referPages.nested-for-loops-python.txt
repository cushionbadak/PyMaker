I am trying to build a decoding function. This function should find the distance between the letters in 'phrase' and the letters in 'key' and the distance should be followed by the corresponding letter in 'key'. For example, let the 'phrase' = 'hello' and the 'key' = 'sam' then, since 'h' is 11 letters away from 's', one iteration through the function should return 's11'I have no clue as to why my 'decode_phrase' function is not working.When I input decode_phrase('mike','sam') I am currently getting string index out of range.  But there are more serious issues to the code than that I am sure
If you're supposed to repeat the key string when you get to its end, then you only need one loop, generating an index into the phrase. You can use the % modulus operator to get a second index into the key, wrapping around if necessary:That is probably the simplest solution when phrase and key are strings. But if you wanted to be a bit fancy, you could use itertools.cycle to make a version that would work for any kind of iterable (not only indexable sequences):
