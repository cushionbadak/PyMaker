The syntax r"string\with\slashes" indicates that the string literal should be treated as a raw string, which means that slashes do not denote unicode control sequences in the string.If you want to pass string literals to your useinR function, you need to add the raw string prefix. The prefix can't be applied in front of a variable because it relates only to literals.
