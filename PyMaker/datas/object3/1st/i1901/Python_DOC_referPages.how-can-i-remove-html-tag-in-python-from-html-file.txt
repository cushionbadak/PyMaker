Summary: What regex string would I use to remove  tags in a HTML document?Although, this may be a duplicate from a previous answer: How to remove only html tags in a string? and Remove HTML tags in String, I can not programme in those languages fully yet, so this is why I am asking the question.I am completing a Python Exercise by Google: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/baby-namesit requires you two parse HTML data using regex (the HTML is structured so it is easier). I've been having problems removing the tags surrounding the data:Currently, my regex does not replace the tags, as they're wrong. I have already tried teaching myself how to remove the tags to no avail:http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/27610/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet-v2.pdfandhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htmas well as looking at other sights before writing this.Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
If regex is not required and to get the job done you can check existing implementations.Django's strip_tags:https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/html.py#L183You can modify that implementation.Python Standard Library and its xml modulehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlIt contains examples on how to use it properly.Use lxml packagehttps://lxml.de/api/lxml.etree-module.html#strip_tagsExample usage:
