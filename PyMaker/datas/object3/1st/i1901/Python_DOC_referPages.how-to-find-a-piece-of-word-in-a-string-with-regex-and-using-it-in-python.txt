For a holiday homework, in a password-check python program, I'd like to use regexs to find if the name (or a "piece" of the name, meaning 2 consecutive letters) of the user is contained into a password he provided.Part 1: the regex itselfLet's say the user is named Samuel:password that would match:password that wouldn't match:So far, I've only succeeded to do this incomplete regex: But it matches if there is only one letter from the regex in the password and also when it's not 2 consecutive letters.How can I enhance the regex?Part 2: the python useWhen I use the search function from re package, it only matches my previous regex if it's at the begening of the string. Here is a sample code of a case that should work:What am I missing?
You can try:The main takes here are:use re.search() rather than re.match(), as the documentation puts it:If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead (see also search() vs. match()).(?i) makes the regex case insensitiveCredits to @sin for suggesting using pairs of characters in the question's comments
