I want to know value 'b_sec' is in list's key 'b'.Example:How can I do this?
Just use any, Python's built-in function to check if a condition holds for, well, any out of many. any breaks early and avoids spurious iterations once the first truthy element is encountered:Using d.get('b') instead of d['b'] is more robust as it won't raise an error if 'b' is not in one of the dicts. Note, that if by any chance, the value you are looking for were None, you would have to provide a different default value to get, e.g. d.get('b', '').
