Can a data frame column (Series) of lists be used as a conditional check within a dictionary? I have a column of lists of words (split up tweets) that I'd like to feed to a vocab dictionary to see if they all exist - if one does not exist, I'd like to skip it, continue on and then run a function over the existing words.This code produces the intended result for one row in the column, however, I get a "unhashable type list" error if I try to apply it to more than one column.Edit with reproducible example:Desired output is total (sum of the words within dictionary):
This should do what you want:EDIT:To reflect the lists inside the column, see this nested comprehension:You can then add list_totals as a column to your pd.
One solution is to use collections.Counter and a list comprehension:Alternatively, if you always have a fixed number of words, you can split into multiple series and use pd.DataFrame.applymap:
