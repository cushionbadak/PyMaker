I'm trying to move some files around on my filesystem. I'd like to use Python 3's Pathlib to do so, in particular, Path.rename. Say I want to move Path('/a/b/c/d') to Path('/w/x/y/z'). givesI can fix this withBut that's less elegant than old school os, which has a method called renames which does this for you. Is there a way to do this in Pathlib? 
It's not ideal, but something like the following would workPathlib.Path.mkdir doesn't return anything, so it seems like some sort of wrapper like this is necessary.
pathlib.Path.mkdir() is available:
Pathlib.mkdir offers the same parent-creation behaviorPathlib.rename does not create parents, similar to how rename() does not create parents
