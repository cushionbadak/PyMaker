This question already has an answer here:numpy max vs amax vs maximum                    3 answers                For example, if I define my array as my_array = np.array([1,2,3]),What is the difference between max(my_array)and my_array.max() ? Is this one of those cases where one is 'syntactic sugar' for the other? Also, why does the first one work with a Python list, but the second doesn't?
As people have stated in the comments of your question, they are referencing two different functions.max(my_array) is a built in Python function available to any sequence data in python.Whereas, my_array.max() is referencing a function within the object. In this case my_array is from the Numpy array class. Numpy does not recognize the list data type for this function. However, this method will provide a speed improvement over the max(my_array) whenever you are using numpy data sequences. As a rule of thumb if the variable has a variable.someMethod() the function is a method and is specific to the class of object. If the function is called as function(variable) then the function is either a part of the python distribution or the file/class you are working with.
