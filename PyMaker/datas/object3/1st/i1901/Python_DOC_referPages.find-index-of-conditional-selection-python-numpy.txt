I have an numpy array with numbers from 0 to 2:now i want all indexes where it has value 0.for example (220,15)so that i can do myArray[220][15] and retrieve 0.
Note that your array has three dimensions, even if the third can only take 0 as its index, so your indices will have three values.You can use numpy's n dimensional enumerator to iterate through the array, getting a list of indices where the value is 0.Edit: Slam's answer should be a lot faster though.
You need np.where without elements, and zip `em for your preferred format:
