When testing if a numpy array c is member of a list of numpy arrays CNTS:I get:ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()However, the answer is rather clear: c is exactly CNTS[1], so c in CNTS should return True!How to correctly test if a numpy array is member of a list of numpy arrays?The same problem happens when removing:ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()Application: test if an opencv contour (numpy array) is member of a list of contours, see for example Remove an opencv contour from a list of contours.
You are getting the error because in essentially invokes bool(c == x) on every element x of CNTS. It's the __bool__ conversion that is raising the error:The same applies for removal, since it tests for equality with each element.ContainmentThe solution is to use np.array_equal or apply the all method to each comparison:ORRemovalTo perform the removal, you are more interested in the index of the element than its existence. The fastest way I can think of is to iterate over the indices, using the elements of CNTS as comparison keys:This option short circuits quite nicely, and returns -1 as the default index rather than raising a StopIteration. You can remove the argument -1 to next if you prefer the error. If you prefer, you can replace (c == x).all() with np.array_equal(c, x).Now you can remove as usual:
This solution could work for this case:This function iterates over a list of arrays and tests the equality against some other array. So the usage would be:To remove the array from the list, you can get the index of the array and then use list.pop. In the function get_index, we enumerate the list of arrays, meaning we zip the indices of the list and the contents of the list. If there is a match, we return the index of the match.Please see the python data structures tutorial for the documentation of list.pop https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
Use del to delete the index of the list you want to remove.
