Because I imported many packages, every time when I run my script in debug mode, it takes around a minute for me to hit my first line of code. I run in debug mode many times a day, so I spend quite a bit time waiting. Is there any way to speed it up?
One way to speed up the development cycle is to preserve your Python process so youonly need to load the packages once.Instead of running the script, package the script itself as a module. Open an interactive python (or perhaps IPython) session, import your module, then"run the script" by calling its main function.If you make changes to the script, you will only have to reload yourmodule. Since the other modules are already loaded, this should be relativelyquick. Since Python modules are cached, importing the same module a second time is essentially instantaneous. In Python, reloading can be done this way.Or you could configure IPython to automatically reload modules or packages when they change this way. IPython also has some nice debugging features, such as %pdb, which will drop you into a debugger whenever an uncaught exception is raised.So instead of your script.py looking like this:You'd modify it to look likeThen, at the interactive Python session prompt, you'd typeto run the script.
