I usually write a small function to create QActions. But PyQt5 doesn't support function SIGNAL() anymore. I don't know how to rewrite this function beautifully.
I think you may be over-thinking this. New-style signals are instance attributes, so you can just use getattr:
The problem here is about use a string (by name) to reference a signal.There are three ways to connect signals under PyQt5. see connecting signals by kwargs So I come out with this solution.
