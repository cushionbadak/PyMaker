I would like to iterate over a subset of the following enumSay I want to:is there a shortcut? or do I need to list each item to iterate over?
Using itertools.islice you can iterate through a slice of your Enum class 
Python enums can have methods. I'd suggest you write a method that returns an iterable. Probably a set, in this case:Then:
There is nothing built-in to Enum to iterate over a subset, but since you can use list on them:
do I need to list each item to iterate over?No - Enum classes are iterables, each value has attributes .name and .value, so you can filter on either as you see fit. For example:is there a shortcut? Depends on what you want to do. Here are a few ways you could use the fact that Enums are iterables:sorted(Items, key=lambda v: v.value)[:4] => get the first 4 elements as sorted by their ordinal valuefilter(lambda e: e.value < 5, Items) => get all items with an ordinal value < 5{v.name: v.value for v in Items if v.value < 4} => get a dictionary of all name/value pairs given a filteretc.NoteAccording to the documentation you can get the Enums ordered dictionary by Items.__members__ and thus you could use .items on that to get the key/value mappings. However what you get as the value (in the dictionary) is in fact an object instance that has the .name and .value attributes.However I find the first method more intuitive.
