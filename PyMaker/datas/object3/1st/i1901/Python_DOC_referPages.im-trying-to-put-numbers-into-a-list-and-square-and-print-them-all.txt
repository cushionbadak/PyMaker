So, I'm trying to put numbers into a list and square and print them all. This is what I have :but then I have this error:File "Main.py", line 5      print(math.sqrt(ListNum))          ^  SyntaxError: invalid syntaxSomething with line 5 print. Any one that could help?
This works:The difference is that here you are printing every item in the list and not the list itself.The first line - print (math.sqrt(item)) prints square root and the second -  print (item*item) prints the square.
why not just create a list (using a list-comprehension) containing the result and then printing that (in whatever format)?
To answer the original question - SyntaxError is due to missing closing parenthesis on line 4 list(map(float, ListNum) should be list(map(float, ListNum)). Sometimes the error is on the previous line (line 4 in this case), not the one indicated in the traceback (in this case line 5).The code will not deliver what you expect though. See the other answers for that.
And math.sqrt is calculating for square root:For squaring:For square root:
In the document of python3, which you can find the link at the bottom, math.sqrt() is described as "Return the square root of x". Since ListNum is actually a list, math.sqrt() will have trouble recognizing any types other than numbers. And the'SyntaxError' comes from a missing ')' at the end of line 4.The following code could work.https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
You can't take the square root of a list, and ListNum is a list.If you want to take the square root (not square) of all numbers, you can map math.sqrt on to the list:Note that there is no loop; the iteration is abstracted into map.If you want to square the numbers, you need a squaring function:or
