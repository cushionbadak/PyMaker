Natural Text
So my text file says something like this:What I want to do is replace the variables in this file ($name, $score1, $score2 etc..) with the appropriate data for each person.Can I do this? Store variables in a text file and access them? Or is there a better way of doing this?Edit:An attempt using @Guilio's example.I get the following error: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
Create a "template", then fill in the placeholders {name} using the values stored in a dictionary.For each row of your CSV file, score_dict is going to be something like {score1:7, score2:9, ...}.P.S.: you can also do something like this with the $placeholders by some method included in the string module, but I think that's kind of osbolete. By the way, using multiline strings (with three quotes) you don't need to explicitly include newlines (unless you use "raw strings" like r"""my string""") just leave a blank line.EDITAssuming you have 4 scores called score1,score2,score3,score4 then (cfr. https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#index-3) for each row do this.The if col!='' part takes care of a trailing ; if any.
