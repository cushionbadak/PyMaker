I'm trying to add watermark on very short part of the mp4 video. It has to be very, very fast. Now I tried to do it with  moviepy Here is my code:Adding a logo and merging videos works nearly instantly, but writing to disc takes 1 min for 2 min video what is significantly too long. Do you know a way of editing only a few frames and save that much faster?Secondly, after conversion, the new file is approximately 40% larger. Why? How to fix that?
Re-encoding a video is always going to be a slow process, and I doubt moviepy defaults to using (or even can use) a high-performance encoder. The fastest general solution is probably to use FFMPEG to do the entire edit, if at all possible. For example, here's a quick demonstration of how to add watermarks using FFMPEG. Using a low-level tool like that is probably your best chance to get high-performance editing, and if you need to execute it from Python, just call the ffmpeg command using subprocess.
I tried FFMPEG but performance was also to low to make a video on request. We bought a stronger and bigger server and now we are processing files all the time - to have always ready for new watchers. It's not a perfect solution but it's much more scalable. To increase the rate of videos/h I didn't use moviepy but FFMPEG - 30% better performance, and less decreasing quality of video / increasing size of files.
