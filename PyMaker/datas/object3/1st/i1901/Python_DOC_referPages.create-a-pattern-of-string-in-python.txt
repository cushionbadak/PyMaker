I have a number.num = 5I want to create a pattern of  question marks i.e '(?,?,?,....n times)' where n is the number.in this case the output should be string containing 5  Question marks seperated by comma.I tried it using the below method:But it seems very lengthy and naive, is there any pythonic way of doing it? preferably a one liner?
Try this:OutputOr:Explanation The first approach creates a generator using range and join them using ',' finally it surrounds them with parenthesis using the format method.The second approach is a variation of the first, instead of using a generator expression it creates a string of 5 '?' (i.e. '?????'), as strings are iterables you can use them in join.
You can try:
Here you go

I would assemble the string using f-string syntax, as it allows to use a higher level abstraction after the more basic logic is sorted out:There are several ways to do it. In the end, it all comes to readability and, sometimes, performance. Both F-strings and .join() tend to be efficient ways to build strings.You cam merge it into a one-liner if you want it:
