I have a directory with a lot of files (~1.4M) from a data-dump and I want to sort them into subdirectories to create batches of smaller size.Due to the large number of files in the directory I want to batchify, I want to avoid having to os.listdir(...) everything in the directory and then test all of the results if they are a directory or not.My idea until now is to use os.walk(...) to check this.Is there a more pythonic/efficient way to achieve what I want?
As an alternative to os.listdir(), you can use os.scandir() on Python 3.5+.  This returns an iterator of DirEntry objects and does not recurse into sub-directories as is the case with os.walk.Here's an example from the docs:
