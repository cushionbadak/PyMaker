Natural Text
I am an amateur python coder. I was wondering if there was a way to open a file in ternary? It would really help to know soon. Something like this but ternary:
From the docs about openhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#openAs mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and  text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including 'b' in the mode  argument) return contents as bytes objects without any decoding. In  text mode (the default, or when 't' is included in the mode argument),  the contents of the file are returned as str, the bytes having been  first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the  specified encoding if given.So really "binary" here means bytes. Those bytes could contain data in some kind of ternary encoding, but you'd likely still open the file as binary and decode them to your ternary spec yourself.
There is no such facility in Python.  The language supports binary because it's a common file format; ternary is not.Of course, if you find it useful, I suggest that you write a ternary package of your own.
