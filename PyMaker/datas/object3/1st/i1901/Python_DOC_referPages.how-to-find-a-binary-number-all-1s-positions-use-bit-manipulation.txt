Natural Text
For example, I have a number 210 or 11010010 in binary, the 2nd 5th 7th and 8th position is 1, so the result is [2, 5, 7, 8].What is the fastest way to find that?
Convert the number to binary:Use a list comprehension and enumerate to find the indices of the 1s:
Just loop over your binary number to get the result.1 position is [1, 2, 4, 7]
The fastest way is to precompute all combinations (only 256 of them) by whatever method, and store in a list (of lists).You can build the list by appending 1 to all entries, then 2 to every other entries, then 3 to every fourth entries, and so on.
A solution in C++.Read a bit about bitwise shift and & operator, to understand the solution properly.
