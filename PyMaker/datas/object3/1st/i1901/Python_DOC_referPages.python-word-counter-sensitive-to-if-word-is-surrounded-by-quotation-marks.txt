Natural Text
I have a problem with my Python program. I am trying to make a word counter, an exercise from Exercism.Now, my program must pass 13 tests, all of which are diffrent strings with spaces, characters, digits, etc.I used to have a problem because I would replace all non-letters and non-digits by a space. This created problem's for words like "don't", because it would divided it into two strings, don and t. To counter this I added an if statement excluding single ' marks from being replaced, which worked. However, one of the strings I must test is "Joe can't tell between 'large' and large.". The problem is that since I exclude ' markets, here large and 'large' are considered as two different things, also they are the same word. How do I tell my program to "erase" quotes surrounding a word? Here is my code, and I have added two scenarios, one being the string above, and the other being another string with only one ' mark that you should not delete:Thank you for your help.
Use .strip() to take off the first and last characters once you have them in the list - https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/strip.html
The module string holds some nice text constants - important for you would be punctuation. The module collections holds Counter - a specialized dictionary class used to count things:Output:If you want to keep the punctuations inside words, use: Output:Readup on strip()
