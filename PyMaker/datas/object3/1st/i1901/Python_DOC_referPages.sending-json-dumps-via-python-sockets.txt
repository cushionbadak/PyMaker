What I'm trying to create are a set of server and client scripts; the server script prompts a user for raw input, stores that input in a dictionary and converts it to json with the json.dumps() function. The converted dictionary is then stored in the jasonFile variable which is then sent to the client. The json dictionary is working but I'm struggling with the networking side of things.Here is my server code:And here is my client code:I haven't gotten as far as converting the json data back to a string on the client yet because the server throws me an error when the client tries to connect.The error message I get from IDLE is:I thought I was defining the address to send data to in the addr variable, but apparently not?
Try:i.e. replace s. calls with conn. which represents the accepted socket connection from the client.From the Python socket API:socket.accept()Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for connections.   The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket  object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and address  is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.Examples are provided at the end of the page.Also see the Python Socket Programming Howto
