Recently I have seen a code with a method of a class that suggests me this but I've not seen anything like this in the documentation.I think that this code permits me to use a filepath variable with some inner-parameter step that could be updated through format whenever I want. However, I'm not able to pass filepath such that it is influenced by format(step=self.total_steps, **logs).So my question is: is it possible to define a string with a parameter that could be changed with format method?If you want to know the original code I could post here or could you give a check by yourself at keras-rl library on github. It's in the ModelIntervalCheckpoint class in the callbacks.py file.
in order to be able to format your filepath, you need to include a "placeholder" named "step" in your filepath string.A great overview of the format features: https://pyformat.info/
