The code i want to create is below[3, 10, 13], num 3How to count the list of list?
You can use collections.Counter for it if you convert the inner list into tuples (lists are not hashable - dicts need hashable keys - f.e tuples):Output:You could also use itertools.groupby() but you would have to sort the list first:Same result. The itertools usage was loosly inspired by this answer to "how to remove dupes from list of list" when looking for dupes to this OP)
