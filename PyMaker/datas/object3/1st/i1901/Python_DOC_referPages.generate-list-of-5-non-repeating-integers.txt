I'm new to Python and I am trying to generate a list of 4 random numbers with integers between 1 and 9. The list must contain no repeating integers.The issue I am having is that the program doesn't output exactly 4 numbers everytime. Sometimes it generates 3 numbers or 2 numbers and I can't figure out how to fix it.My code:Is there a way to do it without the random.sample? This code is part of a larger assignment for school and my teacher doesn't want us using the random.sample or random.shuffle functions. 
Your code generates 5 random numbers, but they are not necessarily unique. If a 2 is generated and you already have 2 in list you don't append it, while you should really be generating an alternative digit that hasn't been used yet.You could use a while loop to test if you already have enough numbers:but that's all more work than really needed, and could in theory take forever (as millions of repeats of the same 4 initial numbers is still considered random). The standard library has a better method for just this task.Instead, you can use random.sample() to take 5 unique numbers from a range() object:This is guaranteed to produce 5 values taken from the range, without duplicate digits, and it does so in 5 steps.
Use random.sample:This generates a list of four random values between 1 to 9 with no duplicates.
Your issue is, you're iterating 5 times, with a random range of 1-9. That means you have somewhere in the neighborhood of a 50/50 chance of getting a repeat integer, which your conditional prevents from being appended to your list. This will serve you better:
