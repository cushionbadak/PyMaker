Are these two format() methods are different? If so, then how can i know which class they belong to and how they behave differently?and
Your first snippet uses the format built-in function, documented in the docs for the built-in functions. Your second snippet uses str.format, a method of the str class, documented in the docs for the standard types. These are closely related, but the correspondence doesn't quite work the way you have things.format(thing, 'format_spec') is equivalent to '{:format_spec}'.format(thing). The format spec defaults to an empty string, so format(thing) is equivalent to '{:}'.format(thing), which is usually equivalent to str(thing).format('abc') corresponds to '{}'.format('abc'), not 'abc'.format(). The results happen to be equivalent because 'abc' is a string with no format placeholders in it. If you had used 'I love braces{}' or 3 instead of 'abc', you would have seen different behavior.
