It is well known that json converts integer keys of a dict to string:What's the cleanest way to restore integer keys when loading it back?I was thinking about:but is there a cleaner way to deal with dictionaries with integer keys with JSON / Python, not requiring keys conversion a posteriori?
Use object_hook to define a custom function and perform operations:From docs:object_hook is an optional function that will be called with the  result of any object literal decoded (a dict). The return value  of object_hook will be used instead of the dict.Or, you could also use object_pairs_hook that lets you iterate through pairs and saves the .items() call (Thanks @chepner):From docs:object_pairs_hook is an optional function that will be called with the  result of any object literal decoded with an ordered list of pairs.  The return value of object_pairs_hook will be used instead of  the dict.
