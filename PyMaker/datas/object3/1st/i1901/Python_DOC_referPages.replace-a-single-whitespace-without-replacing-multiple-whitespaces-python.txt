Natural Text
It seems like a trivial task however, I can't find a solution for doing this using python. Given the following string:I would like to outputHence, removing the single whitespace between amet and consetetur.Using .replace(" ","") replaces all whitespaces, giving me:which is not what I want. How can I solve this?
use regex and word boundary:This technique also handles the more general case:for start & end spaces, you'll have to work slightly harder, but it's still doable:Just for fun, a last variant: use re.split with a multiple space separation, preserve the split char using a group, then join the strings again, removing the spaces only if the string has some non-space in it:(I suppose that this is slower because of list creation & join though)
Reverse the stringDelete the first spaceReverse the string back
