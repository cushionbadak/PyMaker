Given two dates, I would like to generate a list of dates with a fixed time length in between one another using datetime, starting from the later date.For instance, given 01/01/2018 and 01/09/2018 and time interval of 2 months the output would be:For an interval of 3 months:I cannot just subtract months using the .replace method on a datetime object since going from a 31 days month to a 30 days month would return an error.
I think relativedeleta module can help you on this - pip install python-dateutilResult will be - ['01/02/2018', '01/04/2018', '01/06/2018', '01/08/2018']
You did specify datetime, but if you're interested,a time.localtime object can be broken down like so:   From here you could perform operations on specific parts of the date/time...
