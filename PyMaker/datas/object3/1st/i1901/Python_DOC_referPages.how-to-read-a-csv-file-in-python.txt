I need to read a csv file (named CityPop.csv) and this is the code I have:But when I try to run it, nothing is output.I am not sure how to continue; this only leads into more advanced tasks I need to complete, which is difficult if I can't even figure this out.
Try this code EDIT As Ralf said "f.close() is not necessary when using a with block"
An easier way of reading csv files using pandas library -or you can try modifying your code as below -
You have imported the csv module but never used it.So try read_data = csv.reader(f).
I suggest you follow the example from the docs of the python csv module:Analizing your code, there are a few issues:you don't need to call f.close() if you use a with statement, the file will be closed automatically when exiting the with blockyour print statement should go inside the with block, as the variable read_data is defined inside ityou would need to iterate read_data (for line in read_data:), because you already used f.read() so that iterating over f will no yield anythingyou are overwriting record each time, so I don't know why you want to it that way
