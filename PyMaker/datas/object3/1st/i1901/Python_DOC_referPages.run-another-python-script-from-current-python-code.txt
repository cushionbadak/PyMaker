I have following code:he should create a script with a random name, and execute the. Script created, but he don't execute.
exec(open(‘script.py’).read()) should work. Note that the code will be executed in the current environment (current working directory etc)Another way is of course running a command as if in a shell. One module that can simulate the full power of a shell is the package subprocess, where you would be able to take care of stdin, stdout and stderr as well.
