I would like to install some Python module, namely the MATLAB Engine. MATLAB is installed globally under /usr/local/sw/matlab, so I change to the  corresponding directory and then run setup.py as explained in the linked documentation. However, I am not root, so I added the --user flag, as documented by the official Python Docs.So this is what I get:> python setup.py install --user running install running build running build_py creating build error: could not create 'build': Permission deniedApparently it tries to build the module in the current directory, where I have no write access. I can sidestep this by runningpython setup.py build --build-base=/path/to/temp/build/dirBut then I don't know how to install that. Also I cannot combine those 2 approaches as install does not recognize the --build-base option.I furthermore tried to copy the whole matlabroot/extern/engines/python directory somewhere else and run python setup.py install --user there, but this yieldserror: The installation of MATLAB is corrupted.  Please reinstall MATLAB or contact Technical Support for assistance.I guess it does not find the matlabroot anymore.So how do I build and install some source located somewhere under /usr... without being root?
You can use Virtualenv or venv to deal with this kind of issues. Edit: As we went a bit deeper into issue itself, we managed to figure out the answer. If you wish to use virtual environment: python setup.py build --build-base="/path/to/directory_you_can_write_to" install --prefix="/path/to/virtualenv/" --userIf you wish to accomplish what @Feodoran asked for: python setup.py build --build-base="/path/to/directory_you_can_write_to" install --user Useful links: https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-matlab-engine-api-for-python-in-nondefault-locations.htmlhttps://python.org/3.2/install
