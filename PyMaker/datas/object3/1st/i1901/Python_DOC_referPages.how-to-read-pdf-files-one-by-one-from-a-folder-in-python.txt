I am reading pdf files and trying to extract keywords from them through NLP techniques.Right now the program accepts one pdf at a time. I have a folder say in D drive named 'pdf_docs'. The folder contains many pdf documents. My goal is to read each pdf file one by one from the folder. How can I do that in python. The code so far working successfully is like below.
First read all files that are available under that directoryAnd then run your code for each file in that listos.listdir() will get you everything that's in a directory - files and directories. So be careful to have only pdf files in your path or you will need to implement simple filtration for list.Edit 1You can also use glob module, as it does pattern matching.Key difference between OS module and glob is that OS will work for all systems, where glob only for Unix like.
you can use glob in order use pattern matching for getting a list of all pdf files in your directory.
