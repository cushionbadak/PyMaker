I'm trying to get a list of maximum values ​​of columns in a matrix without Numpy. I'm trying to write tons of codes but can't find the wanted output.Here is my code:And here is the wanted output:
Firstly, never name your lists list as it renders list data structure of python useless in the downstream code.The code with comments:Also, though you have specifically mentioned for a no-numpy solution, but in numpy it is as simple as this:Which just says, convert my_list to a numpy array and then find the maximum along the columns(axis=0 means you move top to down in your array).
Python has a built-in zip which allows you to transpose1 your list of lists:1 The official description for what zip does:Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.
One approach is to iterate over rows and keep maximum value on every position (column):Output:Another approach is first to build columns from the given list of rows and then simply find maximum in every column.
you can use this function:
