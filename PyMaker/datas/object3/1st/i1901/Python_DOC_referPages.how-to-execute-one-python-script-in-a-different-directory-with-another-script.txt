Natural Text
I am trying to execute one python script (file2.py) through the other (file1.py). The first file is located in test/file1.py and the second file in test/test1/file2.py.As an example file2.py has the following code:so I am trying to create a .txt file from file1.py. To do so, I have tried several solutions such as:or orin file1.py but none of them seem to work. The first solution works well if I want to import a function but it does not work when I want to create a text file.Does anyone know what I am doing wrong and how to fix it? 
To run the other file, you have some options:The best one is to treat the file as a module, import it, and call it's methods, so you would have to encapsulate the .txt creating inside a methodand call createTxt from file2.py importing file1.py, which will run the method and create the txt fileYou can also use execfile('file2.py') to execute it and run it as a script or make a system call with os.system('python file2.py') importing os to also run as a scriptThe first one is safer and a better code in general, avoid using the other two when possible
