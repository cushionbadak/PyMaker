I have a list of lists of dictionaries that I'm trying to convert to a pandas DataFrame but I'm unable to use pandas.DataFrame.from_dict() because I want the value of the 'name' key to be the column header and the value of the 'duration' key to be the row value. Any suggestions on how I can make this work?Desired Output:
You can flatten your list of lists via itertools.chain, then pivot your dataframe. The trick here is to use an index which counts cumulatively by your grouper.
