Hey i would like to make a list with:(the integer is the amount it costs)And be able to use one to find the other. What is this called(/how do you do this) because i tried to search for it and found nothing, might have been searching for the wrong thing thank you. i don't know if this is how you meant it @MayankPorwal
You might try using a dictionary for this. You can create the dict in a few different ways, but one way would be like {'apple': 1} where the dict key is the item and the value is the price. Then you can access the price based on user input using dict[key]. For example:Also, try to avoid using names like "list" for your variables since list() is a built in python function.
Dictionary is a simple solution. If you want to only use list, you can keep track of items and prices in separate lists, given than the order of the items and prices are kept fixed, then use the index of input item to find its associated price.
