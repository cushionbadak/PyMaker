I'm trying to append the last 4 elements in "lst" to "lst2", its 4 because that is what i assigned to value. However, nothing in the lists change?
The syntax for range is range(start, stop, step). As such, iterating over range(0, len(lst), -1) will iterative over nothing as you can't step down from 0 to a positive number.This would work, noting we must subtract 1 to account for 0-indexing:Your range object here is a bit convoluted. Noting that negative ranges and negative list indexing work fine, you can use instead range(-1, -value-1, -1).With Python, you don't need to loop over ranges at all here. Instead, you can use list slicing and reversed to iterate the values themselves rather than indices:Of course, a manual loop is not required here, you can extend via +=:If you also need to remove these items from lst, you can do so via slicing:
With accessing element in list you can do it by slicing
Try this:Output:
