months[location] <------ I would like to use list called location that holds more than one variable to print onto screen values assigned to positions in list called months is it possible?As normally you can only use single variable to point to position in array?
You can if you change your output a bit:Output:Essentially you need to plug and join all month-entries into a string - f.e. using a generator expression inside a ","join( ... ) statement.
As you noticed, you can't pass a list and use it as the index.You'd have to loop over each index, or build one complete string and print that. For examplethe end="" means that print will add an empty string at the end, instead of the usual new line.Also, you could improve your code in two other ways.The boolean found could correspond to the list location having any values in it, so And your input could look like this insteadso the user can fail multiple times and the program won't proceed.
