Natural Text
I want to create a SQLite database through the python driver. As the application will run on different operating systems I want to explicitly specify the (default) encoding of text within the SQLite database.Apparently I can only do this before a database is created with this command (see SQLite docs):My problem is that the Python way to create/connect to a database does not specify (at least to my understanding) a way to set PRAGMAs (such as encoding) before the database is created (Python docs)Is there therefore any way to specify the encoding through the python SQlite driver before/while a database is created?The only workaround I currently see, which seems a bit hacky, is to run Shell commands through python, but since the SQLite CLI is not installed on the machines, this is no option.
You can create the database and change the encoding afterwardsNote that it is required to edit the database to make these changes permanent, eg:If you do not at least add a table, the encoding will fall back to its default. Hope this helps.
