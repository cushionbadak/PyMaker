I am learning more about OOP in Python and I have hit a bit of a road block. Below is my code:As you can tell, I have created a class that is supposed to increment a counter every time an instance is called in the main function. For example, 'steve.hit' is called three different times, so the hit counter should increment to 3. I have attempted many different ways of approaching this; but every time I try something, instead of counting the three different calls as such, the program will only count the three calls as one. Thank you for any help you can give me
I would prefer the below for calss:Make self instead of Player, and make functions for them,Then call it like (see comments):Now:Outputs:Yey!!, it's as expected.Or even better @property:So class would be:Then to call it (no need to call just type it without parenthesis):Now:Outputs:Yey!!, it's as expected.
First thing, you need to instantiate you class. This effectively means to go and build an object (Player) based on the plan that you defined in the class. You do that just by declaring a new variable, steve = Player("steve")The __init__  method is a special method that gets called automatically when you create a new object. Here, your class takes only one argument, name. All other variables like hit are assigned automatically to 0.If you want to change the value of hit, you should create a function (also known as a method. Then you call this method quite simply with steve.increment_hit().Try always change the value of variables by calling a method, never by accessing the variable itself directly. Is better use steve.increment_hit() than accessing class variables directly  with steve.hit += 1, for example.After run the code above, you will get this output:
