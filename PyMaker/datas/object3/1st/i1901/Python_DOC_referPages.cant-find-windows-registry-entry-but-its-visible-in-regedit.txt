I'm searching for an uninstall string for a specific publisher to automate uninstalling some software.  I can see the entry in regedit. I'm searching both the 64 bit and 32 bit registry views as can be seen in my code.  I can see the application in Add or Remove Programs.  The software is published by Environmental Research Systems Institute, Inc.  I've searched all over and can't figure out why I can't find this key with my code. Any help would be appreciated.  In the function getUninstallers there is an if statement commented out in the first try block that has the actual key name I'm trying to find.  Below the code I've included a screenshot of regedit with the key visible.Picture of regedit with the key visible
