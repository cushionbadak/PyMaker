How do i code this effectively?Aim: [ [2,2],[3,4],[3,4] ]First Try:--> [[2, 2], [[3, 4], [3, 4]]] #this is one nested list to muchSecond Try:--> [[2, 2], [3, 4, 3, 4]] #there is one nest missing
In Python 3.5 or newer, you can use *iterable inside a [...] list displays (the literal syntax to create a list object) to have the iterable expanded to new elements. Because you are adding repeated copies of a nested list object, you do not want to use multiplication to generate those copies, however, because multiplication doesn't create copies.So you can use a generator expression here with a loop to create new list objects each iteration step:For just two copies that's really overkill, but perhaps you have more complex data. For this simple case, I'd just use [[2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 4]].You can use the syntax multiple times, and mix in more lists:Using a generator expression avoids creating additional intermediary lists that are then discarded again.The *iterable syntax is called iterable unpacking, and extends to tuples and sets as well, and you can do the same with **mapping syntax in dictionary displays.If you are using an older Python release (such as Python 2), you really want to upgrade. Python 2.7 is only receiving bug fixes and security updates now, and only until the end of 2019. Python 3.4 and older are entirely unsupported now. But if you are stuck, your only option is to use multiple lines, to expand on the initial list object with += or list.expand(), or use list.append() to add individual elements:
Use a list comprehension and unpacking with *:Proof it works:
