I want to know the method that weighted-random in Python.1:10%, 2:10%, 3:10%, 4:50%, 5:20%Then I choose the random number without duplication. How should I code? Generally, we will code below that:Python
You should have a look at random.choices (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices), which allows you to define a weighting, if you are using python 3.6 ore newerExample:Output:
Try this:
If you really wanted a sample-version you can prepare the range accordingly:Output:If you just need 1 number you can use random.choices - it is limited to 1 number because its drawing with replacement. Output:Using a "sample" w/o replacement and "weighted" is (for me) weired - because you would change the weighting for each successive number because you removed available numbers from the range (thats by feel - my guess would be the math behind tells me its not so).
