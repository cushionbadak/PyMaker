Why does this:return False? How can I check if there's a tuple, or even a generic sequence, inside a sequence with no specific values, as in this answer.
() is an empty tuple. seq does not contain an empty tuple.You wantFor a generic sequence you can useHowever, lots of objects are informally treated as sequences but neither implement the full protocol abc.Sequence defines nor register as a virtual subclass of Sequence. Read this excellent answer for additional information.You can find a question about detecting sequences here.
What you are checking is the existence of an empty tuple in the list.You can check the type instead.
