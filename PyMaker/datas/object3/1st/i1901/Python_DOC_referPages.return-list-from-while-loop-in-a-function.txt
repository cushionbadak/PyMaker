I'm trying to return a list my_list created within function make_list to use in the function print_elems. I keep getting the error my_list is not definedfor when I ask to print it, after calling "make_list". What am I doing incorrectly in trying to return "my_list"?
You are trying to access the local variable my_list. You have to use the returned value instead by assigning it to a variable:On a side note, you probably want to slightly modify print_elems:The * unpacks the list and passes its elements to the print function. Otherwise, when passing a single positional argument to print, the sep parameter will never be used.
You need to assign the return of your function to a variable:The variable my_list is destroyed when you leave the scope of your function that defined it. That is why you return it.See Short Description of the Scoping Rules? and PyTut: Scopes and namespaces
