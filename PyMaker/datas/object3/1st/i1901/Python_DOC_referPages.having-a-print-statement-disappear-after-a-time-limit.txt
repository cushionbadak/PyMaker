Natural Text
I would like to know if it is possible to limit the amount of time a print statement appears in the user console. I have a project that is a Contact Manager and it used a CSV file to store the contact data. The program is designed to create a new CSV file in the even that one is not available in the directory. If I run the program without the CSV file in the directory I have the console display a message to the user letting them know that a new file was created. I would like to have this message only display for maybe 10 seconds or so then disappear from the console. Is this possible? If so I would appreciate some suggestions. Below is the portion of the code that checks for the CSV file then creates a new one and notifies the user if a new one has been created.At this point the code continues to create a new CSV file. What I would like to do is have the previous print statement disappear after 10 seconds so that it doesn't display in the console the entire time the program is running. 
You can use the carriage return ("\r") to go back to the beginning of the printed line, wait for 10 seconds, and then replace the text. Example:
If you're not on windows, you can look into curses. There is also a port for windows called unicurses.
Another alternative approach can be using the \033[F character:(Since you do not want the delay to interrupt the remaining script, take advantage of python threading library)
