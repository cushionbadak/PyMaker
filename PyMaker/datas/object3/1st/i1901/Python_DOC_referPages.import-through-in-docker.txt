I've the main workbench folder (WORKDIR in Dockerfile) which contains the folder initialize with the file max_init.py. The problem is that when I run the image, it cant import that module:Dockerfile:I think that the problem is my lack of experience in Docker, but I cant find a solution by myself Edit: hierarchy:
Did you remember to write an __init__.py file in your initialize module folder? Does it properly onboard your max_init.py file? If you aren't familiar with the convention, explainers abounds.Official: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesFlask explainer that I found personally quite easy to grasp: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/packages/Edit: I see from updates that this is indeed the problem. You should be fine if you fix it...I don't even think you need to rebuild the docker image but I could be mistaken.
