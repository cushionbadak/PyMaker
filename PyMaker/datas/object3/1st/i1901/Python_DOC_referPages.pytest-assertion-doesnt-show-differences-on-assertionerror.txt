I recently learned about using Pytest for doing unit tests in Python. I've played around with it in Repl.it by doing a simple assertion on two different strings which should fail.Which fails with the errorTraceback (most recent call last):  File "python", line 2, in <module>AssertionErrorHowever Pytest does not print 'a' or 'b'. This would be really helpful in debugging as I can compare the diff between 2 different strings. The unittest module has this feature by default. Does Pytest have this feature? If not how do I enable it? I'm using Pytest for a larger project and would love to figure this out before continuing work.
If you want see assertion error, you add a string after assert statement. This is not a pytest issue.Example: assert a == b , "a:{} is not equal to b:{}".format(a,b)This will output:More info about python assert: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement
