I have a dictionary which has values as follows:Basically my keys are pairs of integers and the values of each key are just integers.I have an array which stores a set of keys:I would like to filter my dictionary to contain only elements which keys are stored in the array. In my case, after filtering the dictionary I would obtain the following:since the only key of the dictionary which is stored in the array is (1,1)What would be the most efficient way to do this?
You could do something like this:OutputOr even faster, transforming the list into a set:
You could find the set intersection of the dictionary keys and the array tuples, then get your new values in a dict comprehension. This will reduce the complexity of searching for each key in your array:
Here's a dict-comprehension:I renamed array to lst because it is a list. We should not confuse lists with numpy arrays, array.array or the bytearray type.You could also write a traditional for loop if you are not yet comfortable with comprehensions:
What about just:This does it in O(n) where n is the number of items in array and doesn't require any additional data structures. For your dictionary and array, this gives us:
