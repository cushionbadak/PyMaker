Natural Text
I would like to put a space before and after a dot in text but only if its not a part of a date.So far I have this, and i figured out I have to do something with \D. but it gives back the letter before the dot not only the dot:For example:Input text: 1992.01.04 is my birthday.Required output: 1992.01.04 is my birthday .there is a space before the end of string dot.Other question is the same with colon and time,Input text: The time is 11:48, reported by: Tom.Required output: The time is 11:48, reported by : Tom.there is a space after text 'reported by' before the colonThanks in advance
You can use this regex which does a negative look ahead and negative look behind to check if dot/colon is surrounded by digits and replace it with ' \1 'Demo, https://regex101.com/r/hr6slz/4This regex works for both colon and dot and as you can replace it by ' \1 '
You need _ positive lookbehind assertion._ (or negative, with \d). Look into https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html for details.
