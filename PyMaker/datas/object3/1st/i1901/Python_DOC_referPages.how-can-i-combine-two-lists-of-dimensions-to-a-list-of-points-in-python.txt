You are looking for zip.If there's no particular reason to have the elements be lists, just use zip on its own to produce an iterator (Python 3) or list (Python 2) of tuples.And if you don't even need all of these pairs in memory at the same time, for example if all you want to do is iterate over them, don't build a list. In Python 3, zip produces an iterator.Finally, if you want the Python 3 zip in Python 2, use izip from itertools.
You want the zip function:It yields a sequence of tuples, each containing a value from each of the arguments - in this case, with two arguments, you get two-element tuples.If you really need lists, useAlso, be careful because if all the arguments aren't exactly the same length zip silently drops any values remaining after the shortest argument is exhausted.
Use zip with map for iterating through lists simultaneously:zip(x1, x2) returns a tuple of zipped values. We use map to convert these tuples to list to match with desired output. Since, map in Python 3 generates a map object, we cast it to list again to match with the desired output.
