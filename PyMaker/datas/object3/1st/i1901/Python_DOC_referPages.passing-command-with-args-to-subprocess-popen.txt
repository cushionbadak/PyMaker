Following script works fine when I try passing a batch file (that doesn't require any arguments) to the function.However, when I try passing below command to the function, it fails.Output:Below command used to work fine when I didn't create a function.As you can notice from the output of print command, I was successfully able to somehow (by using the messy single and double quotes combination) pass the exact command that I was able to run when this function was not created but it seems it sill needs some work for jboss variable to expand.Any idea how I can fix this?
The subprocess.Popen constructor will accept either a string or a sequence like a list as its first argument named args. You code appears to be trying to use both...and here's how to do that correctly. As you can see, it's also expanding the jboss variable as desired.Output:
You're passing a str for command. Note that your working example has a list. You just need to get rid of all the extra quoting and pass a list.
