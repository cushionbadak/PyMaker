Is there any built-in methods that are part of lists that would give me the first and last index of some value, like:
Sequences have a method index(value) which returns index of first occurrence - in your case this would be verts.index(value). You can run it on verts[::-1] to find out the last index. Here, this would be len(verts) - 1 - verts[::-1].index(value)
Use i1 = yourlist.index(yourvalue) and i2 = yourlist.rindex(yourvalue). 
If you are searching for the index of the last occurrence of myvalue in mylist:
As a small helper function:
This method can be more optimized than above
Python lists have the index() method, which you can use to find the position of the first occurrence of an item in the list. Note that list.index() raises ValueError when the value is not found in the list, so you may want to wrap it in try/except:To find the position of the last occurrence of an item in the list in an efficient way you can use this function:
