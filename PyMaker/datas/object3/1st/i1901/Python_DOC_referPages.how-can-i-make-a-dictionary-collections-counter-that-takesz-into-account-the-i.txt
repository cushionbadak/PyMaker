I am aware of dictionaries and collection.Counters in Python.My question is how can I make one that takes index of the string into account?For example for this string: aaabaaaI would like to make a tuples that contain each string in progression, keeping track of the count going left to right and resetting the count once a new alphanumeric is found.For example, I like to see this output: [('a', 3), ('b', 1), ('a', 3)] Any idea how to use the dictionary / Counter/ or is there some other data structure built into Python I can use?Regards
You could use groupby:OutputExplanationThe groupby function makes an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable, in this case 'aaabaaa'. The key k is the value identifying of the group, ['a', 'b', 'a']. The sum(1 for _ in v) count the amount of elements in the group.
