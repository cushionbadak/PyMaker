Using two lists.numSet = [1,2,3]alphaSet = ['A', 'B', 'C']Provide for both the while and for loops, create nested loops that print a table that looks like this1 A1 B1 C2 A2 B2 C3 A3 B3 C
Don't use a while loop; for loops are a better option here because you know how many times you want to iterate.Essentially, you want an outer for loop that runs as many times as there are items in your first list. Each time it runs, run the inner loop as many times as there are items in your second list. Inside that inner loop, print out the relevant element from both lists.
You should check out the itertools standard library for effecient looping hereFor your case, you can use product which is explained in the documentation as:cartesian product, equivalent to a nested for-loop
