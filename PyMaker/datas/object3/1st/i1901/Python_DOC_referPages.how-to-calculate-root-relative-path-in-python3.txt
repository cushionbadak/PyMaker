The task is to implement a function root_relative_path(root : str, path : str) -> str, which calculates the relative path with respect to root, with no intermediate .. go beyond root. e.g., root_relative_path('/abc', '/../def') == '/abc/def'This question is different from How to calculate relative path in Python? because in this case, root_relative_path(root='/tmp/abc', path='/../def') should return /tmp/abc/def instead of /tmp/def.
I was able to implement your root_relative_path function using a combination of the posixpath and the pathlib modules. The result isPlatform independent (as long as the root path corresponds to the current platform)The path can begin with /, ./, or ../And the path will be normalized using all of the techniques covered by the normpath function which includes resolving ..s.Â
