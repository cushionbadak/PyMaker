I have two lists. Both of sizes are 1013x1. They look like below;I am trying to create dictionary with them. l1 should be key and l2 should be value. The code is here:and d looks likeWhy is size of d 20? As I understand it is distinct with l1. How can I create a dictionary without distinction only using python built-in funtions?
Each key can only appear once in a dictionary, but you can have a list as the value:
Your dictionary is of size 20 because you have duplicate keys in l1. Onle the last given value of each key "lives" the others are overwritten. You can append all values to a key, if you store a list of values instead only the value stored by that key.As alternative to a plain dict you can leverage the defaultdict from the collections module:Output:This is only feasable if you consider imports of basic modules as "python built-in functions".
