I have a list that is the a=[0,1] and I want to change with  a=[0x00,0x001] type. How can I do this? I tried this way But I cannot change to hex
Using hex directly should work:
Using hex(...) will only give you the least amount of leading 0:You can format(...) the string as hex and zfill() the needed amount of zeros and prepending '0x' to it yourself:Output:
As you fail to describe what your wanted outcome is, I can only guess:Do you want to pack some numbers to a string?Then it doesn't matter which format you use, both should work as soon as you use the correct format string:This is because a and b are equal: it doesn't matter if you write 1 and 2 or if you prefer 0x01 resp. 0x02. Be aware that the displayed strings are just representations of strings containing special characters with the values 0, 1 and 2, respectively.Do you want to output your numbers in a hexadecimal representation?In this case, see the other answers.
Below is the another way of converting a list of integer to list of hex using a map function:
