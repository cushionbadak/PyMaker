I want to check if m in between l and h.I can writeorThe latter one looks better, but does it take more than O(1) time?
O(1):O(n) in Python 2, but O(1) in Python 3: Better style:Note: The behaviour is different if m can be a non-integer (consider a float, for example).
It's better to use the first one but you can rewrite it like it:The function range create a list and in searches if m is in that list. It's worse in performance that two comparisons.That only applies to python 2, in python 3 both ways are optimal.
