What is the use of the MyDict class and what's up with the content attribute?
In the last line, you are assigning to message.content.This is not possible with a built in dict.In fact, dictionaries don't even have a __dict__ (obviously).However, your custom type will share no such problems.If you plan to design a more sophisticated subclass of dict, inherit from collections.UserDict. I have lined out some problems with inheriting from dict directly in the last part of this answer.
