I have matrix (type list of lists) and I want to select only the last row that fits my critera. Specificly I have this matrix:and I want to select only the LAST row i such that len(matrix[i][0]) == 1, so the answer should return [[1], whatever1].Haven't found how to answer that specific question yet. Thank you.
You could do something like this:OutputExplanationFirst iterate over the list backwards using reversed and return only the elements that have len(e[0]) == 1. Then with next get only the first result. 
It would be most efficient to simply iterate backwards:
check thisthere res contains last element of first of first item of each matrix item (bolded ones)...          [[0], "whatever0"],...          [[1], "whatever1"],...          [[1, 1], "whatever11"]...          [[1, 2]**, "whatever12"],...          [[1, 3]**, "whatever13"],...          [[1, 4]**, "whatever14"]
