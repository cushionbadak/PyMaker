I am trying to keep my SQL alchemy logs separate from my custom logsWhat's happening is two files are created and they look like below,my_log.logmy_alchemy_log.logThe queries repeat in my_log.log too! That's not expected!!!What's expected is, that my_log.log should only contain "this belongs to my_log" and no queries. Queries should only end up in my_alchemy_log.log
You can dowhich will stop events logged there being propagated to handlers of ancestor loggers (and hence the root logger, which writes to my_log.log).To turn off all SQLAlchemy logging (not just from sqlalchemy.engine) from my_log.log, you might need to doThe propagate flag is documented here.
