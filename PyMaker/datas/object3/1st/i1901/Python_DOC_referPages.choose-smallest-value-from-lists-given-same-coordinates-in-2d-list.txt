I have two lists:I am trying to remove the repeated coordinates in a and remove the adjacent value in b but by leaving the smallest value. So for example coordinate [9,10000] is repeated twice with values in b of 8824.73 and 26243.88 the result should be two lists where there is only one [9,10000] with the smaller of b which is 8824.73.So overall the result should look like:I am finding it difficult to formulate the problem and iterate through the lists and I am not sure how I can use the zip function. Any help is appreciated!
Here is an O(n) solution using collections.defaultdict:ExplanationThere are 3 steps:Create a dictionary mapping each pair of keys to a list of values. Be careful to use tuple as keys, which must be hashable.For unique keys, just extract your defaultdict keys, mapping to list so that you have a list of lists instead of list of tuples.For minimum values, use map with min.Note on orderingDictionaries are insertion ordered in Python 3.6+, and this can be relied upon in 3.7+. In earlier versions, you can rely on consistency of ordering between dd.keys and dd.values provided no operations have taken place in between access of keys and values.
