I have a very basic Python function and the code seems to be OK but it returns a count of 1 instead of 3. All the function does is to look for even numbers in a list.I have initialized the count variable at 0 and the for loop seems to be OK so I don't understand what else is wrong.
Your indentation is incorrect. Your return statement is triggered on the first iteration of your for loop, therefore you exit your function after only a single iteration.Your solution is to use proper indentation:Yields:Further explanation:When you define a function use def my_function(*args), you need to indent all lines following that function definition that you intend to be contained in the function. In this case, you are returning a value from your function, and that value count should only be returned once you have iterated through all numbers in your passed list integers and evaluated by your logic (your if statement).A more simplistic solution:Yields:
Indentation matters a lot. Your current code returning result as 1With correct indentationIf need one liner 
You indentation is indeed not quite right.Consider avoiding the loop entirely, because less code means less bugs.One option is to use functools.reduce:You can obviously inline the lambda expression, too, but I wrote it out this way for clarity.
