I was trying to generate all the permutations of 128 bits and store them in some kind of structure. I found some useful information about it in other Stack Overflow questions using: The problem is that this solution is useful only for enough small values of n since it stores the values in a list as strings and therefore each bit in the sequence will be a byte, meaning that each permutation would be 128 bytes longWith such a high value like n=128, storing all the permutations as strings is not possible. (My computer runs out of memory when executing itertools.product() with n=128). Whereas storing the permutations as raw bytes would mean having 16 bytes for each permutation.My question is how to archive the same results as intertools.product but dealing with bytes.
