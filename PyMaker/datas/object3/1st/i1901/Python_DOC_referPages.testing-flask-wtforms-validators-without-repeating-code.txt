I have written a relatively simple web app using Flask and WTForms with standard and custom form validators. I am now trying to learn Python testing. I have written the following tests.py file that works fine with unittest, but has redundancy. Is there a better, more effecient, more pythonic (DNRY) way to do this? I've looked at some pytest tutorials and wonder if fixtures would help, but I cannot quite understand them. And I assume there is a more pythonic way to do this with unittest. It seems I need a method to which I can pass the different dict arguments, but I cannot figure out how to do that.
I suggest you create a custom asserter method (assertExtensiveFlightSearchGivesError(self, data, expected_error_message)) to remove some of the duplication:You could also collect all the test cases together and use .subTest():But in your case, IMO the topmost code example is clearer.
