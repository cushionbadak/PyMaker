Natural Text
See the above line of code. It requires that the positional argument be specified, but it returns a list. To access domain_name, I need to access args.domain_name[0]. I'd like to access it as args.domain_name as it's confusing to see this list that can only ever be one item, and in fact must be one item as it's required.If I specify nargs='*' it's no longer required but is returned as a string.
nargs isn't a required parameter and its removal will return a string and not a list as specified above.
