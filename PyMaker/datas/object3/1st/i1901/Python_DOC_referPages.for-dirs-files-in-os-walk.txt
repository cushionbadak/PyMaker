This question already has an answer here:What is the purpose of the single underscore “_” variable in Python?                    4 answers                Can someone explain the usage of the _ in this for loop? My goal is to get the filenames with full path recursively. I got this from another question and it does exactly what I want. But I don't understand it. 
os.walk returns the tuple (root, dirs, files) whereroot: the current directorydirs: the files in the current dirfiles: the files in the current dirif you do not use one of these variables in your subsequent loop, it is customary to call it _ (or even append a name such as _dirs). that way most IDEs will not complain that you have assigned a variable but you are not using it.in your example you could do:and the IDE should not complain that you are not using the variable _dirs.
