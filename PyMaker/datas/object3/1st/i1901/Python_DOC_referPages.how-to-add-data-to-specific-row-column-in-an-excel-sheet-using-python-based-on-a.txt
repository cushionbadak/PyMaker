I have python code that gives data in the following list = [author, item, number]I want to add this data to an excel file that looks like this: . The python script will:Check if the author given in the list is in the Author Names column, and add name if it is not in present.Then the code will add the number in the column that matches the item given.For example:['author2', 'Oranges', 300], 300 would be added to Oranges column on the row for author2. If the person adds a list again like ['author2', 'Oranges', 500] and an input already exists for the item, the number will be added together so the final result is 800.How do I get started with this? I'm mostly confused about how to read columns/rows to find where to insert things.
Here's one example of how you might do it:For more details on writing out to CSV's you can see the documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlAlternatively, just search using DuckDuckGo or your favorite search engine.
Most likely it appears your spreadsheet is stored externally, and you want to read in some new data from the list format [author, item, number].Python pandas is great for this.  This would read in the data file, lets call it authorVolumes.xlsx.  This assumes the spreadsheet is already in the folder we are working in and looks as it does in your first picture.  Also the items are limited to the ones in the spreadsheet already as you did not mention that in the question.Now lets define a function to handle the updates.Time to handle the first update:['author2', 'Oranges', 300]Now to handle one where the author is not there:When we are done we can save our excel file back out to the files system.df.to_excel('authorVolumes.xlsx')
