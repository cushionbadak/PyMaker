Now I want to create a dictionary containing all keys from key1, key2 and key3 and corresponding values from val1, val2, val3 respectively.for example:I want the dictionary as given below:How can this be done?Thanks
Using zip and simple concatenation:If you have an unknown number of key and value lists, use itertools.chain and zip:
A simple answer would be this, Although there are much efficient ways to do this.Or combine lists before and do a one-liner
try this code:
add all the lists to a common list and automate the process, as such:
I would concat the lists, and by using zip merge it into keys and values (dictionary).
You can extend the list and the zip them and create a dictionary like below
