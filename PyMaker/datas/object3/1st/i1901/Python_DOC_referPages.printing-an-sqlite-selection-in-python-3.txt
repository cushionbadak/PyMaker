So I just started working with sqlite in Python (and I am a beginner with Python as well), and I'm struggling with using the data from a Table.Basically, I created my database but now I would like to do something with the data. I have tried just simply printing it using this function:but this is what gets printed when I call on the function.Anybody know what the fix for this is?Thanks in advance!
You have to use fetchone function of the cursor to get one record or you can use fetchall to get all the row of the query.
Try using the method fetchone or fetch many.or you can see the documentation here.
