My question is why is it repeating random amount of times instead of 100 times ? The print (len(result)) was added just to check how many iterations did it actually go over, and it's always a random number instead of 100 times.I also tried using for i in range(100) but it didn't work as well.
The problem is that you're calling random.randint on each if and elif check - with the result that it's possible that none of the checks pass, resulting in fewer than 100 numbers in your final array. You should call this function just once per iteration, store the result in a variable, and do the checks on that.
That's right. random.randint should be put once within the loop like below:
As Robin Zigmond answered: you are recreating the random so neither condition might match.Fix:Your die-simulator is overly compex. random can generate a list of 100 dice throws at once. You can use the Counter class to count them easily:Output:Readup:https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counterhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices
