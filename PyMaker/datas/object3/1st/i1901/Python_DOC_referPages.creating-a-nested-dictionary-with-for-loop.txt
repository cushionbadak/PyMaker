You can use pd.read_csv() and to_dict():Yields:
I like the pandas answer, but if you don't want a 3rd party library, use the built-in csv module:Output:

See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/ for fundamental understanding of the with statement.Since the key "" only appears once at the head of the csv, we can pop it at the end and avoid performing a comparison at every iteration. A dict comprehension accomplishes the same thing you wanted to achieve with d.update.More about comprehensions: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensionsEdit: refactoring to remove the repetitive calls to .split can look something like this:
