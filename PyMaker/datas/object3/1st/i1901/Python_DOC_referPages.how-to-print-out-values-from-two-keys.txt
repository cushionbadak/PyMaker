So I have trouble to print out two value that are from a list that I have created. Basically I did a list of:Right now if I basically call that function which isnames_number() It would give me that values.So of course you would use a for loop which will print each of these for its own so in that case a loop that looks like:for i in names_number():      print(i)That would give me:The problem now is that I want it to print out onlyand I have no idea how I would in that case print out just the values of each of this everytime it for loops. I would appreciate any tip or solution on how I can continue to make a output like I wish above 
The default separator for print is a single whitespace, so you use a simple for loop:Or using f-strings (Python 3.6+):Here's a convoluted functional solution:
How about that:which produces the desired:Note that if you did not care about the order of the items (1 Hello or Hello 1), or if you are using Python 3.6+ you can use the more elegant:
I would probably do something like this:Which produces:Pretty much looping the list, and the printing out the key/value pairs.
I would do it like this:Wich produces the desired out
