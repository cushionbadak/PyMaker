Natural Text
I would like to store the output of a for loop into a textfile but is not the desired output as they will only print the last element everytime. Please do take a look at the 2nd for loop (I have tried to put the output of the for loop in a text file but they always seems to save the last element into the text file)...The output of the arr is:
Context handlers will automatically close out its resources after it leaves scope.  open() has a context handler and can be used like this:In your code, you call text_file.close() which will close the file handler after only writing the first entry.  How you don't error out after the first write() statement is beyond me.
If you want to keep your current code without importing extra libraries:I also suggest you to read the relevant part of the Python documentation.
Try this.
Just write the whole array in a single operation, so you do not override you file after writing each element. You can use the with open() method as @SilverSlash commented or the numpy.savetxt method which also works for lists of integers or floats.EditOn your second loop remove the lines that handle the writing part and add numpy.savetxt('arr.out', arr, delimiter=',') at the end of the script. Remember to import numpy add the beginning of the script.  Edit 2Looks like you list arr is a list of tuples containing nested lists. So numpy.savetxt will not work. Instead use
