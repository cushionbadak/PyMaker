I am getting the following error:My code is:Windows 7, 64 bit. Python 3.x latest, stable.Any ideas?Thanks,
When the command is a shell built-in, add a 'shell=True' to the call.E.g. for dir you would type:To quote from the documentation:The only time you need to specify shell=True on Windows is when the command you wish to execute is built into the shell (e.g. dir or copy). You do not need shell=True to run a batch file or console-based executable.
On Windows, I believe the subprocess module doesn't look in the PATH unless you pass shell=True. However, shell=True can be a security risk if you're passing arguments that may come from outside your program. To make subprocess nonetheless able to find the correct executable, you can use shutil.which. Suppose the executable in your PATH is named frob:(This works on Python 3.3 and above.)
On Windows you have to call through cmd.exe. As Apalala mentioned, Windows commands are implemented in cmd.exe not as separate executables.e.g. /c tells cmd to run the follow commandThis is safer than using shell=True, which allows shell injections.
If you are using powershell, then in it will be subprocess.call(['powershell','-command','dir']). Powershell supports a large portion of POSIX commands
To quote from the documentation:"Prior to Python 3.5, these three functions comprised the high level API to subprocess. You can now use run() in many cases, but lots of existing code calls these functions."SO: instead of subprocess.call use subprocess.run for Python 3.5 and above
