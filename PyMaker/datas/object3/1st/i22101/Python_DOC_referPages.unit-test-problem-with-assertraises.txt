I am trying to test for an exception.I have:I get the following error:Thanks
self.assertRaises expects a function mro.setStatus, followed by an arbitrary number of arguments: in this case, just NEW_STATUS. self.assertRaises assembles its arguments into the function call mro.setStatus(NEW_STATUS) inside a try...except block, thus catching and recording the ValueError if it occurs. Passing mro.setStatus(NEW_STATUS) as an argument to self.assertRaises causes the ValueError to occur before self.assertRaises can trap it.So the fix is to change the parentheses to a comma:
Be careful if you're using factory boy, this package doesn't allow the exception to be raised to the assert level which will always fail
