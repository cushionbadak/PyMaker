How to find the maximum of 2 numbers?I need to compare the 2 values i.e value and run and find the maximum of 2. I need some python function to operate it?
Use the builtin function max.Example: max(2, 4) returns 4.Just for giggles, there's a min as well...should you need it. :P
max()
max(number_one, number_two)
You can use max(value, run)The function max takes any number of arguments, or (alternatively) an iterable, and returns the maximum value.
should do it.
Just for the fun of it, after the party has finished and the horse bolted.The answer is: max() !
You could also achieve the same result by using a Conditional Expression:a bit more flexible than max but admittedly longer to type.
I noticed that if you have divisions it rounds off to integer, it would be better to use:c=float(max(a1,...,an))/bSorry for the late post!
gives largest number out of the numberslist without using a Max statement
(num1>=num2)*num1+(num2>num1)*num2 will return the maximum of two values.
