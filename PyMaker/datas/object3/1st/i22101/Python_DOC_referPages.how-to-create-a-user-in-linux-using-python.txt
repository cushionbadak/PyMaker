How do I create a user in Linux using Python? I mean, I know about the subprocess module and thought about calling 'adduser' and passing all the parameters at once, but the 'adduser' command asks some questions like password, full name, phone and stuff. How would I answer this questions using subprocess?   I've seen  module called pexpect in this question: Can I use Python as a Bash replacement?. Is there any other standard module?
Use useradd, it doesn't ask any questions but accepts many command line options.
On Ubuntu, you could use the python-libuser package
You could just use the built-in binaries so just call useradd or something through the subprocess module, However I don't know if there's any other modules that hook into Linux to provide such functionality.
