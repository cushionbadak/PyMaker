The requests library can handle POST, PUT, DELETE, and all other HTTP methods, and is significantly less scary than urllib, httplib and their variants.  
You can override get_method with something like this:Then you pass "DELETE" as method.This answer covers the details.
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/client.htmlIf you're looking to work with HTTP in twisted using the client side I'd suggest checking that out. It demonstrates how you can really easily make a request using the agent class.
As far as I know, urllib and urllib2 only support GET and POST requests. You should probably take a look at httplib or httplib2.
The method is set implicitly in the urlopen callWhen you provide the data parameter a POST will be used.I don't think it's possible to use a DELETE HTTP method with urlib because of this line:Request.get_method()  Return a string  indicating the HTTP request method.  This is only meaningful for HTTP  requests, and currently always returns  'GET' or 'POST'. Consider using httplib, httplib2, or Twisted instead .for better support of HTTP methods.
The default HTTP methods in urllib library are POST and GET:But we can override this get_method() function to get DELETE request:
