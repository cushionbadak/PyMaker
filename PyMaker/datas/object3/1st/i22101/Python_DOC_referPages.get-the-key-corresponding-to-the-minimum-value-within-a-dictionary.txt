If I have a Python dictionary, how do I get the key to the entry which contains the minimum value?I was thinking about something to do with the min() function...Given the input:It would return 321.
Best: min(d, key=d.get) -- no reason to interpose a useless lambda indirection layer or extract items or keys!
Here's an answer that actually gives the solution the OP asked for:Using d.iteritems() will be more efficient for larger dictionaries, however.
min(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

For the case where you have multiple minimal keys and want to keep it simple
If you are not sure that you have not multiple minimum values, I would suggest:
Edit: this is an answer to the OP's original question about the minimal key, not the minimal answer.You can get the keys of the dict using the keys function, and you're right about using min to find the minimum of that list.
Another approach to addressing the issue of multiple keys with the same min value:
For multiple keys which have equal lowest value, you can use a list comprehension:An equivalent functional version:
Use min with an iterator (for python 3 use items instead of iteritems); instead of lambda use the itemgetter from operator, which is faster than lambda.

I compared how the following three options perform:Sample output:
to create an orderable class you have to override 6 special functions, so that it would be called by the min() functionthese methods are__lt__ , __le__, __gt__, __ge__, __eq__ , __ne__ in order they are less than, less than or equal, greater than, greater than or equal, equal, not equal.for example you should implement __lt__ as follows:then you can use the min function as follows:this worked for me.

Is this what you are looking for?Prints 'fourteen'
