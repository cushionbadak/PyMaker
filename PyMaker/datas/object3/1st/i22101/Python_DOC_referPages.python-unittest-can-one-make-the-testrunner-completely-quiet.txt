Natural Text
Is there a way to make unittest.TextTestRunner completely quiet, meaning it never prints to output on its own? Even at verbosity=0 it prints results when done.I want to process the TestResult object returned by the runner before anything is printed.
TextTestRunner has a stream=sys.stderr in its constructor:Change it to a null stream.
