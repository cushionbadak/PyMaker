I am downloading a file from the net, and it fails even though I am doing:for p in query:If there is an error, I want to log it, and then continue on with the next file.In this loop, I am trying to download an image, if for some reason the filename was bad, or the website was down, etc., I want to continue with the next item in the for loop.Is there a more generic error that won't fail and continue processing?Also, how can I log errors to a file?
As pointed out by Lott, if a download is failing, unless the problem is fixed upstream (or with your download address), the best you can do is to try again. However, if the situation is that you have a list of downloads, and simply want to skip over failed downloads instead of exiting, then:Things to note:(1) Use of the "logging" module, as suggested by ~unutbu, gives you much more flexibility and power with your logging output, including time stamp, simultaneously writing to different channels (e.g., stderr, file) depending on error levels, etc. etc. (2) You might consider implementing the above logic using the "with" construct.
You could use the logging module:Running the script writes in /tmp/myapp.log: 
This catches everything.But it is much, much better to catch the exact exception.python <= 2.7
This will write your error to a log file and continue to run the code.
