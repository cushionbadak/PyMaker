Is there any short way to achieve what the APT (Advanced Package Tool) command line interface does in Python?I mean, when the package manager prompts a yes/no question followed by [Yes/no], the script accepts YES/Y/yes/y or Enter (defaults to Yes as hinted by the capital letter).The only thing I find in the official docs is input and raw_input...I know it's not that hard to emulate, but it's annoying to rewrite :|
As you mentioned, the easiest way is to use raw_input() (or simply input() for Python 3). There is no built-in way to do this. From Recipe 577058:Usage example:
I'd do it this way:
There is a function strtobool in Python's standard library: http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/apiref.html?highlight=distutils.util#distutils.util.strtoboolYou can use it to check user's input and transform it to True or False value.
A very simple (but not very sophisticated) way of doing this for a single choice would be:You could also write a simple (slightly improved) function around this:Note: On Python 2, use raw_input instead of input.
You can use click's confirm method.This will print:Should work for Python 2/3 on Linux, Mac or Windows.Docs: http://click.pocoo.org/5/prompts/#confirmation-prompts
as mentioned by @Alexander Artemenko, here's a simple solution using strtobool
I know this has been answered a bunch of ways and this may not answer OP's specific question (with the list of criteria) but this is what I did for the most common use case and it's far simpler than the other responses:
You can also use prompter.Shamelessly taken from the README:
I modified fmark's answer to by python 2/3 compatible more pythonic.See ipython's utility module if you are interested in something with more error handling
on 2.7, is this too non-pythonic?it captures any variation of Yes at least.
Doing the same with python 3.x, where raw_input() doesn't exist:
You could try something like the code below to be able to work with choices from the variable 'accepted' show here:Here is the code ..
As a programming noob, I found a bunch of the above answers overly complex, especially if the goal is to have a simple function that you can pass various yes/no questions to, forcing the user to select yes or no. After scouring this page and several others, and borrowing all of the various good ideas, I ended up with the following:
For Python 3, I'm using this function:The strtobool function converts a string into a bool. If the string cant be parsed it will raise a ValueError.In Python 3 raw_input has been renamed to input.
How about this: 
This is what I use:
This is how I'd do it.Output
Here's my take on it, I simply wanted to abort if the user did not affirm the action.
