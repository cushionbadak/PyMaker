If you do a try in python, and the code doesn't fail, but it's outside of a range you want or something, what is the best way to make it fail so it goes to the except?A simple example is as follows, to check the input is a number between 0 and 1:Is there a better way to go about this? The between range is just an example, so it should work with other things too (also, in the above example, it should also be able to use a number in string format, so detecting the type wouldn't really work).
Sorry but rchang's answer is not reliable for production code (assert statements are skipped if Python is run with the -O flag). The correct solution is to raise a ValueError, ie:
You can use the raise statement:Note that Exception can be more specific, like for example, a ValueError, or maybe it can be an exception defined by you:
The other answer is accurate. But to educate you more about exception handling ... you could use raise.Also consider Bruno's comment where he says:You also want to catch TypeError in case input is neither a string nor a number.Thus in this case we may add another except blockTypeError will be raised iff the input is an object ( for e.g)
The built-in assertion mechanism may be a fit here.AssertionError will be raised if the condition you provide to the assert statement does not evaluate to True.  Also, upon attempting the float conversion upon an invalid value would raise the ValueError.
