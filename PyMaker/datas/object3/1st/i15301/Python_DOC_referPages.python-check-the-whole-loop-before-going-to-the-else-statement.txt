How do I run through the whole loop and then after go to else statement, if the if condition is false?The output is:NoNoYesBut I only want it to jump to the else statement if all of the values does not equal!So basicly the output should say, because one of the values was true.Yes
You need to run the loop until you find a matche. You can use any function for this purpose, like thisWe pass a generator expression to any function. The generator expression takes each and every item from the dict and checks if it is equal to (500, 50, 200). The moment it finds a match, the any will return True immediately and the rest of the iterations will not even take place. If none of the items match (500, 50, 200), any will return False and the No will be printed.Edit: After a lengthy discussion with the OP in the chat, he actually wanted to know the item which matches as well. So, the better solution would be to go with for..else like in the other answer by NPE, like this
But I only want it to jump to the else statement if all of the values does not equal!Python's for-else construct can be used to do exactly that:For further discussion, see Why does python use 'else' after for and while loops?However, in this particular instance I would not use an explicit loop at all:
Maybe use in operator:
