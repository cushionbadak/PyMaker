I am am looking to restart an iteration if i receive an exception. (... it is reading data from a server, and occasionally gets intermittent error codes, that do not repeat on a retrying).If i was using a while loop, this sort of thing would obviously be obvious (e.g. don't increment the number), but given I am iterating over row in a for loop, can't think of a way of forcing a re-do of the current iteration.Although there are lots of similar sounding titled posts (e.g. how to restart "for" loop in python ?  , Python - Way to restart a for loop, similar to "continue" for while loops? , python: restarting a loop  ) each of the ones I have found/read seems to get at something different (e.g. just how to restart when get to the end, rather than restarting an iteration should a certain condition occur).[Python 2.7]
You can add a second loop like so:
