I want to pass any number of strings to a a python program and have them parsed as a list or array:etc, up to 200 strings.I'm using argparse to parse command-line arguments in python. How can I do this? The documentation doesn't give any examples of parsing arbitrary-number of arguments.
Use the nargs keyword argument.nargs='+' requires one argument.  Usage:
Just do, e.g:You'll see that sys.argv is exactly the list you want (except sys.argv[0] is the name of your program, which you probably don't care about -- which is why I'm slicing it out:-).
