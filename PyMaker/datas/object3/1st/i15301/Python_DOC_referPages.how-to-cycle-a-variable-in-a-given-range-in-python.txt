is there an easy way in python to cycle a variable in a given range?For example:Given a range(), I want a variable goes like this:0 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3... till some conditions are satisfied.
You want to cycle the sequence 0, 1, ..., n, n-1, ..., 1.You can easily build this sequence using chainSample run:
You want itertools.cycle(), see here:https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle
itertools.cycle is a good start. Else you can program it yourself:
output:
you need itertools.cycle:demo:
Essentially, you just want to loop and constantly check the condition. And each time yeild the next item from the cycle. Now, admittedly there are better ways to check a condition than a function call, but this is just an example.
