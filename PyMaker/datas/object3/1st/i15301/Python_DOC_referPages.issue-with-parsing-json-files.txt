I have a problem with the fonction. The fonction does not give me the right informationI have this I look for this information in this  files 
That's becasue you are assigning the function itself to the oname variable.you need to call the function and then assign the return value of that function to the variable.You can do it like this, oname = FHD(). note the parenthesis.I can see that you are using a function argument named RFHD.but you are not using it inside your function.you gonna have to pass some value to it or else your function call will be failed. something like, oname = FHD('RFHD')As other have suggested, you can make your life easier by using the built-in json parsing lib. Take a look at, Parsing values from a JSON file in Python.in your case, you have to use data['vostf']['FHD']
