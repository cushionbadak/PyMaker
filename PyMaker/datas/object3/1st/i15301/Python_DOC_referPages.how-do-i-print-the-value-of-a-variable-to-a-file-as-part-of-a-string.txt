Natural Text
If I have:how do I write 10 and 20 separated by a tab to the file?  Doing:just prints the literal string to the file.  How to substitute the values of a and b into the string?
Python does not recognize variable names inside a string literal.  Instead, it treats them as normal text. In order to do what you want, you can use str.format:This will take the values of a and b, convert them into strings, and then insert them into the string '{}\t{}'.  The curly braces {} denote where the values will be inserted.
They need to be outside the '' 
This is a pythonic way of doing it
you can easily use formatted string for that
