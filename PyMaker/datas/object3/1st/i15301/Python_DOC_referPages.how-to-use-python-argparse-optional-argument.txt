my python code looks like thisthe idea is when running with -c option, I could have select to use myspecial config file. However, I issue my command python mypython.py -c myconfig, I am getting unrecognized argument: myconfig. What am I missing?
As Adam mentioned, you'll want to change your parser's "action", as stated in the docs.But it sounds like you want to indicate whether that special config is active, or not. In which case, using action='store_true' or action='store_false' would be correct. You just won't pass the myconfig argument.
"-c" will store True or False, so why are you passing a value (myconfig) to it?  You would call it as:If you want -c to take an argument, then it shouldn't have the action store_true.
