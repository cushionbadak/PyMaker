Ok so im trying to hexlify the .png's byte length here. i know its because the len() of file_1_read is a number. im trying to convert decimal to hexidecimal. how would i go about doing that?
You can use str.format with x type:or using printf-style formatting:If you want to use binascii.hexlify, convert the int object to bytes using struct.pack:You can control byte order using >, <, .. format specifier:See Format characters - python struct module documentation
