Natural Text
The error message from this is as follows:I think the problem is somewhere in bigger_than but I am not too sure. What I am trying to do is add a method that compares the size of the square with the size of another square and output whether the square is bigger or smaller.if I try and print(), self.size and t it outputs the values from: s = Square(8) and t = Square(7). 
You should implement as follows:Note that naming the method __gt__ allows direct use of > (greater than), and we are explicitly comparing the size attributes of the two arguments (s > t is equivalent to s.__gt__(t) or Square.__gt__(s, t)). I have also altered the __repr__ to:look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment)You should read the documentation for more information on these "magic methods".
