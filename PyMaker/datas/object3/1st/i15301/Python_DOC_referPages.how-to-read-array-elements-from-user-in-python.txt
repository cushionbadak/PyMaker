Since there's no input delimiters in Python, you should use split and split the input that you've received from the user:
Your first approach is OK, for the second way use this:This will map the function int on the split parts (what split gives) of the user input (which are 1, 2, 3 and 4 in your example.It also uses slicing (the [:n] after map) to slice in case the user put more integers in.
The input() function returns a string that the user enters. The int() function expects to convert a number as a string to the corresponding number value. So int('3') will return 3. But when you type in a string like 1 2 3 4 the function int() does not know how to convert that.You can either follow your first example:The above requires you to only enter a number at a time.Another way of doing it is just to split the string.The split() method returns a list of numbers as strings excluding the spaces
