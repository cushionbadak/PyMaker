I have two expressions: 1. (\w+)[\s\(]at[\s\)](\w+)\sdot\s(\w+)\sdot\sedu2. (\w+)[\s\(]at[\s\)](\w+)\.(\w+)\.eduThe first one identifies : csk at cs dot xyz dot edu   csk(at)cs dot xyz dot eduThe second one identifies : csk at cs.xyz.edu   csk(at)cs.xyz.eduHow do I combine the above two? I also want to include @ in it, what I did was :(\w+)[\s\(][/at/@][\s\)](\w+)\sdot\s(\w+)\sdot\sedubut it is not working. Can some one please help? I have lot of formats to cover but dont want to write each regular expression explicitly. 
Put the varying patterns inside a non-capturing group separated by | logical OR operator.Add anchors if necessary.DEMO
[/at/@] does not match what you think it does.  [...] denotes a character set, so that part is matching the individual characters /, a, t, or @.In order to match either at or @, you will need to use:Here is a reference on Python's Regular Expression Syntax.
