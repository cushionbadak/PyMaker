I came across this confusing problem: when I use this statement: then: it doesn't work, butworks! Q:How could this be since dir2 is just a namespace (module object) which is initialized from __init__ file? 
from dir2 does not look at local names in the current module, it only looks at directories on the sys.path search path.In other words, it doesn't matter that you imported dir2 here, as the global namespace of your module has no influence on what can be imported.The rules for Python 2 for imports that do not start with a . are as follows:Look in the current package for the name. If your current module is the initial script or the interactive interpreter, there is no current package.Look at each directory named in sys.path in turn.If you are using from __future__ import absolute_imports then the first option is dropped altogether and only the second location is used.
As the import statement use sys.path (A list of strings that specifies the search path for modules ) for import modules . its because of that you have not dir2 in your sys.path but you have dir1. and about dot (.) python wiki says :Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”. For example, the module name A.B designates a submodule named B in a package named A. Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or the Python Imaging Library from having to worry about each other’s module names. so when you use from dir1.dir2 import module actually python assume dir2 as a submodule of dir1.
