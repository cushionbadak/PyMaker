I would like to send some data from jQuery to a Tornado Python backend.Here is simple example:Here is the Python code:When I click the submit button then the Python backend retrieves following dictionarybut I would like to retrieve exactly the same dictionary as jQuery sends:Could you help me what I am doing wrong?
request.arguments should only be used for form encoded data. Use request.body to access the JSON raw data and decode with the json module:request.body contains bytes, which is fine in Python 2, but if you are using Python 3 you need to decode those to Unicode first. Get the request character-set with cgi.parse_header():This defaults to the UTF-8 character set, which as a default is only valid for JSON requests; other request content types would need to be handled differently.You may want to make it clear that you are sending a JSON body by setting the content type:and verify in your Tornado POST handler that that content type is being used before trying to decode the POST as JSON:The $.ajax dataType parameter is only needed when you are returning JSON from Python  back to jQuery; it tells jQuery to decode the response for you. This is not strictly needed even then, as a application/json response Content-Type header is enough.
