Is there a way to query what Qt widget the variable a is?It appears some Qt widgets would be supplied with .uiType attribute. But some (like layouts) are not. 
You can get the type of any object in Python using the type built-in:You may also be interested in the __name__ and __class__ attributes, which will hold data corresponding to the widget's name and class:Note however that if you need to perform a typecheck, you should use isinstance:This will take into account inheritance.
Have you tried a.metaObject().className()?See the QObject documentation for more info.
