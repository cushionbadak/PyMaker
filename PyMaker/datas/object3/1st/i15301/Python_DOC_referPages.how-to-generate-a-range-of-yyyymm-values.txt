This question already has an answer here:Generate a list of datetimes between an interval                    5 answers                I have two yyyymm values that will be input by a user:I want to be able to iterate through this range in increasing month order:How can this be done in python?Update: Ideally, the solution should be as simple as possible without requiring external libraries.  I'm not looking for a generic date manipulation solution, but a solution to answer the specific question I have asked above.I had seen lots of generic solutions before posting my question.  However, being a python noob, couldn't see how to adapt them to my question:Generate a list of datetimes between an intervalIterating through a range of dates in PythonOn that note, the other questions linked to from this page are much more generic.  If you are looking to generate a range of yyyymm values, I urge you to look at the selected answer on this page.
Here's another rather simple variant, without even using datetime. Just split the date, calculate the 'total month', and iterate.Output:For output in the same yyyymm format, use print("%d%02d" % (y, m)).
You can do this using the builtin datetime module and the third party package dateutil.The code first converts your strings to datetime.datetime objects using datetime.datetime.strptime. It then uses the relativedelta function from dateutil to create a period of one month that can be added to your datetimes.Within the while loop you can either work with the datetime objects directly, or construct the month and year as strings using strftime, I've shown an example of both in print functions.
