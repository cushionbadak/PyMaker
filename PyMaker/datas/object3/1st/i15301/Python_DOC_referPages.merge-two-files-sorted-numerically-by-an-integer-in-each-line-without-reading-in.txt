I have two files, file1 and file2, sorted numerically by column 2:file1file2I want to merge them and get this output, which is also sorted numerically by column 2:I can do it with this unix command, which doesn't sort, but merges the pre-sorted files:But how do I do this in Python 3.4 without reading the files into memory and without sorting? Python 3.5 will add a key parameter to heapq.merge() according to docs.python.org, bugs.python.org and github.com, but no pre-release is available. In the meantime I came up with the solution below. Is there a more elegant way? Could I have used map and looped over the two files? Perhaps I should post to codereview instead?
I just downloaded alpha release 1 of Python3.5 and I was able to do it by using the new key function of heapq.merge():Or for those that prefer one line lambda functions:Could I have done this in one line using map, operator.itemgetter(), str.split and int?
You can try this way
