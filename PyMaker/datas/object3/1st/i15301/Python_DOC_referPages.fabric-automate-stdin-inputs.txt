I know, I want always more! I am wondering how I can do something like this in fabric: I thought of fabric.operations.prompt but I dont need prompt. I want that fabric reads the credentials from variables and goes on further without asking me anything.. any ideas? 
As stated in fabric's documentation, use subprocess to send data via stdin (used code from "how do i write to a python subprocess' stdin"):Remove the stdout, stderr parameters if you want to see the output.Also, in case of collectstatic you can just specify a --noinput parameter without playing with pipes.
