Using IPtools python package I am trying to see if an ip address is in a specific range or not. Here is my code:and here is how my file looks like:I am getting this error, which I cannot find why. can anybody help?
The iptools._address2long() function returns None if it cannot parse a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.Both your start and end addresses failed to parse as such, and the min() function on two None values then fails with the exception you got:Triple-check the addresses you pass in to make sure they are valid. You could catch this exception to print out the values that cause the problem, for example:on a side note, you do not need to test for is True in an if statement. That is what if is for. With comparison chaining the statement doesn't mean what you think it means in any case. Strictly use:When using is True you are really testing ('198.0.184.126' in range_s) and (range_s is True), which will never be true.
