I'm currently doing python for recreational uses and this ATM script is not running correctly, please help.
It appears that you are using Python 2, in which input attempts to evaluate what the user types as though it were a Python statement.  You should instead use raw_input, which does not.
When the script ask you "which option would you like?:" you have to type "D" or 'D' and not D cause the input function, I think you should use raw_inputAnd you will have an other problem with the line:you have to add () for call functionAnd with this line:Cause option is not define.
You will need to indent your code correctly so it looks like this (look up):input is only used in Python 3.x. The equivalent of the Python 3.x version is raw_input, the Python 2.x version. Using the same name for a variable and function is not recommended, due to the confusion to come. It is better to rename one of them. If you are using Python 3.x, then you need to fix your indention. Try the Python 2.7 Docs or the Python 3.x Docs
