I've learned exception 'catching' on one in pythonIf I had a lot of user_inputs in a piece of code it would look like I don't know what I'm doing (which I don't fully)Is there an easier, less 'disgusting' way of doing this.  If so, how?
Actually, using try/except for this task is idiomatic in Python because it follows EAFP.  The only problem is that you are writing the same input-gathering code for each input.You can make your code reusable by putting it in a function:Now, whenever you need to get an input from the user, you can just call the function:You can even make it so that the get_int function accepts a custom prompt for each input:This allows you to make your program more intuitive.  For example:
From here;Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming  language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code  readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in  fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or  Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable  clear programs on both a small and large scale.The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document "PEP  20 (The Zen of Python)", which includes aphorisms such as:Beautiful is better than ugly Explicit is better than implicit Simple is better than complexComplex is better than complicatedReadability countsSo don't rush, first complete tutorials and learn the basic, you'll see Python is the most 'clear' and less 'disgusting' language.
