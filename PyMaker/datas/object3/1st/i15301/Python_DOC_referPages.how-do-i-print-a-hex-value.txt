the following code:returns this response:from the response, I can get myid quite easily, I just type:Now I want to get the parameter and store it as myparameter, but it is hex so myparameter = response['parameter'] does not work. How can I get the hex parameter \x04 and simply print it?

I think that you confused yourself with your question. The actual question is "how to extract the numeric value of a byte from a byte string", for which the answer is simply ord(). Note though that ord() only takes a single byte, i.e. a byte string of length one, which I'm not sure if that is guaranteed. Also, in Python 2, strings are byte strings by default, while in Python 3 it requires an explicit 'b' prefix.Now, coming back to the hex value, the point is that there is no hex involved, except when either writing the response to the console (the repr() function is used there) or when writing it in code! Another important thing is that there is no such thing as a "hex value", there is a numeric value and there is a representation of that value using the hexadecimal format. That's why 0x11 == 0b10001 == 17, because these are value comparisons and the different number bases are just different ways to write the same values.
