For example I have something like this:And have an array:How to check if all keys from second array exists in first? 
You can use all and a generator expression. This will iterate over your array and check that each key is in the keys of d. If at least one of the keys is missing then it'll return False.
You can use set.issubset() method to checkEdit:  apply issubset directly on a according to @Maroun Maroun comment
Another way (using set and issubset):
Use a loop and in operator with dict object:"in" can check if the key in a dict
