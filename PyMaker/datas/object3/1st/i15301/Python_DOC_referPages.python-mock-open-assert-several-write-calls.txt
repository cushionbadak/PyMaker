I am trying to test some code that does logging.I'd like to assert that both blah1 and blah2 get written.  My test function looks like this:But it gives me an error:How can I properly test multiple calls to the write function?Versions:Python 2.7.6mock==1.0.1
According to the docs, assert_called_with and assert_called_once_with only pass if the call is the most recent one1.  The trick us to use assert_any_call, or assert_has_calls.1It's kinda hidden in the docs for assert_any_call, so we can't really blame you for missing it...
