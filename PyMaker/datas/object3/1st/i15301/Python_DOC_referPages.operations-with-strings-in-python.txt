Currently I'm learning Python3, and I already have some experience with C. I need to shift string to get rid of two first bytes. Here's code in C:this program will output "llo World"I was wondering if there is a way of doing such thing in Python efficiently, without copying the whole string.
The closest operation in 2.x would be creating a buffer from the string and then slicing that. Creating the buffer is an additional operation, but only needs to be performed once since the buffer can be reused.3.x doesn't have buffer, but you shouldn't be trying to emulate the C code in Python regardless. Figure out what you're actually trying to do, and then write the appropriate Pythonic code for it.
Python is higher level than C and understands what a string is. You can do:You can find more here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings.
Sure there is and is better than CThis is called slicing Refer the image
FYI : You don't need to declare any variable, you can do the operations on the string directly
