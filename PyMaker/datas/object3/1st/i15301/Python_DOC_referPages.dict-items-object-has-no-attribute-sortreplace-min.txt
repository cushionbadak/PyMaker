First of all I am new to Python. I am using PTVS http://pytools.codeplex.com/. Next I installed reportlab. Then I run a sample demo at https://github.com/nakagami/reportlab/blob/master/demos/colors/colortest.py#L68 But at line,I am getting error, dict_items object has no attribute sort
Haven't tested but a theory: you are using python3! From https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmldict methods dict.keys(), dict.items() and dict.values() return “views”     instead of lists. For example, this no longer works: k = d.keys(); k.sort(). Use k = sorted(d) instead (this works in Python 2.5 too and is just as efficient).as I understand it a "view" is an iterator, and an iterator does not have the sort function. Change it to according to the documentation
So the total solution based on Johan's answer is:
