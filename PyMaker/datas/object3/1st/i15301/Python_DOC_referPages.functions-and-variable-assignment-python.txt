This question already has an answer here:Why does “return list.sort()” return None, not the list?                    6 answers                Why does it print None? Can you elaborate on all functions?
sort() and sorted() are different:sort() sorts the list in-place and returns None.sorted() creates a new list and returns it.See here for further details.
