I have a string:'ABCDEFGH'I want to cycle through the string and, one by one, replace each character with one of 4 characters (1,2,3,4):etc etc and so forth. However everytime I try, I end up altering the original string and my output ends up being strings of 1s!'1111111'Example code below:
Rather than change a list you reuse between iterations, produce a new list each time and replace the one character:You can combine this with a nested loop:In essence you are creating the product of '1234' and a position from range(len(letters)), so you could use itertools.product() to make that a single loop:With a little enumerate() trickery you could make this a one-liner generator expression to produce all combinations:This builds a new list on the fly by iteration over letters, swapping out the one character at position pos for the digit.Demo:
Reinitialize the list each time.
