I'm a newbie in programming in general, and with python in particular ...I'm trying to write a python script, launched from a Linux Terminal, with a 'latex' file as an argument : I wish then my_script.py to open the file.tex in vim (in the Terminal), run another compiling script and then close, leaving 'file.tex' opened in vim and the compiling script running in background.So, I tried :but my_script.py is still waiting for vim to close before continuing, which is exaclty what subprocess.call is supposed to do, as explained in the : official python doc.I tried :I've got an 'input/ouput error'...Thanks in advance.
