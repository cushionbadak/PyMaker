QuestionWhat is a good way to handle a file that has been uploaded through a WSGI POST request?More infoSo far, I'm able to read the raw POST data from environ[wsgi.input]. At this point the issue I am having is that the information associated with the file and the file itself are jammned together into one string:Is there a library in python I should be using to handle information more cleanly? Ultimately, I'd like to take the file contents and then turn around and upload to Amazon S3.
You can use cgi.FieldStorage.
Usually you want much more abstraction than raw WSGI. Consider frameworks that run on WSGI.
