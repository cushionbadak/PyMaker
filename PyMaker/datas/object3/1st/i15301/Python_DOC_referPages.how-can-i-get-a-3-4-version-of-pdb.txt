I tend to use a Debian wheezy system, that ships with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.However I'm developing now using a local installation Python 3.4 because has a very interesting advantage over Python 3.2.The problem is that I don't know how to install such a thing as a pdb3.4. When I run pdb3 over my Python 3.4 program, it runs as a Python 3.2 program, failing.I'm on the need of general Python advice on versions and multi-host (Ubuntu precise and trusty, and Debian wheezy) multi-version development, and I particularly need downloading and building a 3.4 version of pdb, but I don't get to find any documentation on that.
Every version of Python comes with its own pdb module. It is part of the standard library.The version in the 3.4 standard library has no special advantages over the version that comes with 3.2 or 2.7. The last time pdb functionality was changed was in the 3.2 and 2.7 releases (the only thing missing in the 2.6 version is the skip keyword argument to pdb.Pdb(), and 3.3 added more tab completion support).If you have a pdb command line, then that's just an alias for python3 -m pdb; you can use that with any of your versions:Debian and Ubuntu simply copy the pdb module to /usr/bin/ with the Python version appended, so /usr/lib/python3.2/pdb.py is copied to /usr/bin/pdb3.2.
