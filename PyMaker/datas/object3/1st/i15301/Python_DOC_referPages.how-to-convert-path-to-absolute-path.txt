Natural Text
I have the following file: ~/.config.txt which is located in /root/.config. In order to avoid hardcoded paths in my Python file, how can I always replace (and correctly refer) to a ~/ path as <home> in Python?This way I could replace ~/.config.txt by /root/.config if /root/ was my home directory? 
You can use os.path.expanduser to convert ~ into your home directory:This works on both *nix and Windows systems.
