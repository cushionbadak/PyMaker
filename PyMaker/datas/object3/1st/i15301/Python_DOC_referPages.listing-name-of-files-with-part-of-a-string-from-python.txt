If you want to use find you need to pass a list of args when shell=False.  check_output will work for your case, you can slice the list instead of using range and you need str.format to wrap each specie/ele in *:For python 2.6 use Popen:
Your loop is all wrong.  python is much more expressive than that:1) You can skip the first element by starting the range at 1: ...then use i instead of i+1 inside your loop.2) Even easier (and more idiomatic) is to use list slicing:3) You can format strings in python using the format() method.  Here is an example employing those concepts:The format() method was introduced in python 3.0--but it was backported to python 2.6 (in a more limited form).  If for some reason your install does not have the format() method, you can use the old way:See additional format() examples here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples4) Here's what you can do with the glob module:Or, as a dict of name, matches pairs:
