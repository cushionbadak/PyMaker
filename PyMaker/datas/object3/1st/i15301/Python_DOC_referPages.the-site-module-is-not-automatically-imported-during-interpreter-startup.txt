The question is quite straight forward. As told by the Python doc, the site package should be automatically imported during initilization. but this is not the case for me. I have to import it mannually to make it work using this:Also, I'm sure that the directory python\lib which contains site.py is in the search path. And I'm using windows 7. I'm wondering what is wrong here if any one knows...
It's undeniably imported at startup, as you can easly verify:That doesn't mean any name has been imported into your namespace. To do that, you must use import. Since the module has already been imported once, you'll get a reference to that module:In other words, it works like any other module that is imported in some module other than your own.There's actually not any point in calling site.main(), as it's already been called during the import.
