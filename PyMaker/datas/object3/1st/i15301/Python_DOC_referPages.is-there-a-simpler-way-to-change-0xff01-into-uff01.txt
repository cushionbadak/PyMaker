I want to print all the full-width characters in the Python console.I want to make it simpler; the important key is that to change 0xff01 into \\uff01, here is my way to do the transformation.Is there a simpler way to do that?
Your code produces single Unicode characters from integers, in a very roundabout way. Use the chr() function instead:Note that the list() call is very much redundant and wasteful here too; I removed it.From the documentation:Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i. For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a'.Demo:If you really wanted to produce escaped \uhhhh sequences (without interpreting them to their actual codepoints), use str.format() to format the integers as 4-digit hex values:The leading 0 makes the format zero-padded, 4 sets the field width to 4 characters, and x produces hexadecimal characters:
