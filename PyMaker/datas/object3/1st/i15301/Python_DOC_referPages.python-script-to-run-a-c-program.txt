I have a C/C++ program which takes a set of arguments and displays a set of outputs to a command line (for my research).I would like to write a Python script to run this program multiple times for different inputs and write outputs to a file. I am planning to run the program with exhaustive inputs.However, I don't have any experience in writing scripts or programming in Python. So, I was wondering if I could get some pointers where to start.As an example, I would like to write a script for doing:EDIT: I am running the program on Linux through command line, bash.EDIT2 SLN: Just for a future reference to others who might be a beginner, doing something similar, the solution looks like following. I stripped all the parts that only affects my case.
Currently recommended way of running and controlling executables using Python is subprocess module. You can use different arguments, capture stdout, process it, or just redirect to arbitrary file. Have a look at documentation here https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess
I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you can use python to execute commands through the terminal. For exampleThis will execute the terminal command >> echo 'hello world'
