I'm learning python and trying to create a movie collection for my own use using web.py .I have two listsWhat I want to do is Print all rows of movies_all in the final output.Such that If there is a match in list movies_watched, output Yes or No. For example, in above only "xyz" is common.Preferably the output should be in a single data type, for example "list of lists" or dictionary or list of tuples, etc.The intention is to display the output in an html table like the one below.Output:The table in output is only for improving readability and is actually not required.I have tried this but not able to output desired result
Iterate through one list with for...in... and compare to the other list with in. Build your dictionary by creating an empty dictionary and assigning a value to each new key. In  your example, you'll have a key for each item in movies_all.
