Natural Text
I need to output the values that I calculate from my code to a text file in a certain format. First I will explain how my output from the python code look like and then explain how I want the text file to be.How I want the text file is as belowall the output on the screen are due to print statement of variable value that I am calculating using the code. Can you help me on how I can do this?
If the items come in that order you will have to save it to a list, dictionary or something and then print. Look at this example:prints:Output:"output.txt":
If you have a print() statement that already does exactly what you want then you only have to redirect the output to a textfile.
If your print statement is creating that output exactly the way you want, I strongly suggest using the new-ish pathlib module (available in Python >= 3.4) to create your file. It is great for working with path-like objects (both Windows and for other OSes). If your file content is stored as a string in data, you can just do this: Here's a little Path tutorial.  It's Paths - Paths all the way downTo simplify: you can build up any path (directory and file path objects are treated exactly the same) as an object, which can be an absolute path object or a relative path object. Simple displaying of some useful paths- such as the current working directory and the user home- works like this: To navigate down the file tree, you can do things like this. Note that the first object, home, is a Path and the rest are just strings: To read a file located at a path, you can use its open method rather than the open function: But you can also just grab the text directly! ...and WRITE text directly!Check to see if it is a file or a directory (and exists) this way: Make a new, empty file without opening it like this (silently replaces any existing file): To make the file only if it doesn't exist, use exist_ok=False:Make a new directory (under the current directory, Path()) like this: Get the file extension or filename of a path this way:Use name for the entire last part of the path (stem and extension if they are there):Rename a file using the with_name method (which returns the same path object but with a new filename):You can iterate through all the "stuff' in a directory like so using iterdir: 
I searched and found that it was better for me to print the values in the terminal exactly like how I want in the text file. So I rewrote my code to display the values as one complete tab limited row and it worked. I appreciate all your help.I am not sure if this can be marked as an answer. If not let me know, I will add as a comment.
You can use numpy.savetxt and use the header-keywordhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savetxt.html
