I expect d to be a Card object and d.val to be -1. How I can do that?
It sounds like you want the unary minus operator on Card to return a new card with the value negated. If that's what you want, you can define the __neg__ operator on your class like this:__neg__ is included in the list of methods that can be overridden to customise arithmetic operations here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types
