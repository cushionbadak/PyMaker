Apologize if the title is a bit hard to understand.Not too sure how to explain it within a line.What I want to do is...actually I have this codefor example, if my obj.type is 'hello'I wantif my obj.type is 'world'I wantI thought of doing something such asthe above should work but if there is another better way, I would love to know another way of doing this because the above seems too redundant.Thanks in advance for any advices
Well what you have seems alright, but if you really hate code repetition, you could always make the dictionnary outside the if first. But you might be slowing things down a little.. (Though time is won by not doing the second check :P) Use timeit (https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) to see if the "beautiful code" is worth the time, maybe it doesn't change much for your use case. Also, for one-liner lovers : As of python 3.5 and like suggested in  Pep 448, you can do: Which can also be put in a single line. If you really love conciseness, that is, but some will argue it's wayyy worse than what you had. ^-^
