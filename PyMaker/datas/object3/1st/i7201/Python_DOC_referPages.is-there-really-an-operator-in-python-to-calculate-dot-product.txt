Is this answer correct: https://stackoverflow.com/a/39662710/1175080 ?Quoting that answer.In Python 3.5, there is a new operator for the dot product,  so you  can write a= A @ B  instead of a= numpy.dot(A,B)It does not seem to work for me.But the linked answer has received 6 upvotes, so I must be missing something. Can you provide a complete example that shows how to use the @ operator to calculate a dot product?
See what's new in Python 3.5, section matrix mult (PEP 465):PEP 465 adds the @ infix operator for matrix multiplication. Currently, no builtin Python types implement the new operator, however, it can be implemented by defining __matmul__(), __rmatmul__(), and __imatmul__() for regular, reflected, and in-place matrix multiplication. The semantics of these methods is similar to that of methods defining other infix arithmetic operators.So, you would have to implement those methods yourself.Or, use numpy>=1.10 which already has support for the new operator:
