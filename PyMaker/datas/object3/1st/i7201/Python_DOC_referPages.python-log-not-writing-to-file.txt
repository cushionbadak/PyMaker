So I am trying to implement logging within my Python program.  The goal is to set it up so that a log file is created and everything the program does through it's various modules is logged (based on logging level).  This is what my current code looks like:Text File for Log Configuration:External Module to Test Logs:Main file:Currently, all log messages are currently being displayed withing the IDLE3 shell when I run __init__.py and the log file is being created.  However within the log file itself the only message being recording is the "Debug Test" from __init__.py.  None of the messages from the test.py module are being recorded in the log file.What is my problem?
In test.py it grabs a logger object before you configure it later in your __init__.py. Make sure you configure the logging module first before grabbing any logger instance.
