Say I'm having a following code in CHow could I do similar thing in python?I'm trying to read a binary file (byte by byte) - already got it working, and combining every 3 bytes into one int. Heard struct would do the trick, but I'm not really sure how.Best,Henry
What about ctypes?   
Here is what you would do. First, let's create the raw bytes we need, I'll cheat and use numpy:These could have easily been read from a file. Now, using the struct module is trivial. We use the unsigned int format character 'I':Note, each time we iterate we get back a tuple, since our struct has one member, it is a list of singleton tuples. But this is trivial to get into a flat python list:Another alternative is to read them into an array.array:
You asked about C union, but if your objective is to group 3 bytes into an int, you could use Python struct.unpack instead.
