Why can't I append to the dict returned by json.loads inline as I can do with the dict sal ?Doesn't json.loads returns just a dict and that should be same as any other dict ?
The assignment statement x = y = z implies that both x and y will take on the value of z. As an example, look at the byte code for the assignment a = b = 2:With 4 STORE_NAME, a is assigned first to 2, followed by 7 STORE_NAME where b is then assigned to the same value, 2.So, withsal receives the value 0. Also, a temporary variable is created when you call json.loads and that is modified, following which the reference is lost.In order to get this to work, you'll need to break this up into 2 parts, as you have already done.
Why can't I append to the dict returned by json.loads inline as I can do with the dict sal ? You can, and you do, but then you just discard that dict. It doesn't have any effect on the salaries variable, and you didn't assign the dict to sal. You assigned 0 to sal.When you assign sal = json.loads(salaries), that makes a new dict, unrelated to the first dict, and then you actually assign the new dict to sal. Modifications to this new dict are still visible when you view the dict through sal.
