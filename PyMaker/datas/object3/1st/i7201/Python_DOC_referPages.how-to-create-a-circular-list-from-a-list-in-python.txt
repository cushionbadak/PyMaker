I am new to Python and I'm in need of a circular list. I have a list of 5 tags:I have another list with monotonically increasing values:I want to create another list using the taglist by the length of list. If list has 7 items, I want a new list of tags like below.And this list will go on like that as circular filling. How can I do this?SOLVED: Thank you all who answered in this post. Now I am confused to select the answer. :( Everyone seems good one. Though I have used The one with  simpler one.
newtaglist can be generated using a modulo operator to make sure the index is in rangeYielding:['faint', 'shocking', 'frosty', 'loved', 'sadness', 'faint', 'shocking']Run it here
The easiest way is use itertools.cycle which was designed for this particular purpose.Another way is to multiply (repeat) the list to make it large enough, then slice-off any excess:The double-negation is used to convert floor-division to ceiling-division which rounds-up whenever there is a remainder.  That makes sure the list multiplication always gives at least as many elements as needed.
Also, in python list is built-in function, dont use list as variable name.
Where n is the desired length:Or you could use Raymond's suggestion of
Multiplying plus slicing:
