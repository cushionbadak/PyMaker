This question already has an answer here:Convert string representation of list to list                    14 answers                I have a string likeand want to convert this into a list likeI have tried various methods of slicing the string into a list, but while that does work, it is keeping 0 and 1 as strings, while also being unable to change easily for different lists.Is there an easier way, aside from massive for loops and slicing? 
Not that I'm advocating for the use of eval, you can just doeval("['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 0, 1]")I'll suggest that you instead use ast.literal_eval, a "safer" eval.
If it just contains primitive objects (like strings, integers and such like) you can use ast.literal_eval:
Consider the literal_eval function for a direct conversion.  If you care to do your own processing, then try this:Output:Can you finish from there?  Each element is a string image of the value you want.  For the true strings, you'll have to strip off the extra quotation marks; for the numeric values, you'll have to use int().To tell which is which, try the isdigit method.
