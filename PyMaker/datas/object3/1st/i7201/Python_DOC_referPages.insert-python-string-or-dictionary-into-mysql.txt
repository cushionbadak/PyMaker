I have a Python string (or potentially a Python dictionary) that I'd like to insert to MySql table.My String is the following:  I have the same kind of error if I want to insert the Dict format.I really don't understand this kind of error (i.e. the '\' in-between the components of the string).How can I deal with this error? Any why to properly insert a whole string to a particular TEXT cell in SQL?Many thanks !!
Here is how to connect, make a table, and insert in the table.     Example above will make a table with 2 cols, one ID and one namelook here on an example on how to insert stuff from dictionary with keys and list as value to sql, basically you need place holders or you can go with this as an example for a simple straight forward dict
