I am trying to read csv files using pd.read_csv.  I am running into encoding issues and I’m not sure how to proceed.  The first issue I running into is the following error message caused when reading csv fiels that contain a µ character.“SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xb5' in file GUI_Simpilify.py on line 4, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details”I’m able to get past this error by manually changing the file name and removing the µ.  However, this is not a solution as I have 1,000’s of csv files to extract data from.Once I manually remove the µ from a single csv file and rerun my script I get this error message:“UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb1 in position 13: invalid start byte”I believe this is due to the fact that all of my csv files contain both ± and µ characters.How can I deal with both these errors without manual solutions?Code:
This error because of without specifying encoding.Add this line at the beginning your python script
I was able to figure this out.  It's not the most eligant solution, but it works.  I made a method that finds all csv files in the current working directory if any of the filenames contain a "µ" character replace with an "_".  Return a list of all csv file names.  I understand that this could potentially create naming conflicts, but since I'm the end user I'll be careful.
