How to manually calculate a size of a dictionary (number of bytes it occupies in memory). I read that initially it is 280 bytes, at 6th key it increases and then at 86th so on. I want to calculate the size it will occupy when I have more than 10000 keys. 
sys.getsizeof will help in that case:especially for dictionaries the size will depend on your python version (the implementation has changed recently).a quick way to create an N-sized dictionary is:this should help test your assumptions for your specific python version.this question may be related.
You can do a quick check with sys.getsizeof() (it will return the size of an object in bytes):If you are interested in actual inner-workings of Python dictionaries, the dictobject.c is the definitive resource (here for the latest Python 3.6 branch). Also, take a look at dictnotes.txt.
Use sys.getsizeof to get the size info
