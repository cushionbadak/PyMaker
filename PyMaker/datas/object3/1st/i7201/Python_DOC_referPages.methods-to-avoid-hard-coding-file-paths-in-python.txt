Working with scientific data, specifically climate data, I am constantly hard-coding paths to data directories in my Python code. Even if I were to write the most extensible code in the world, the hard-coded file paths prevent it from ever being truly portable. I also feel like having information about the file system of your machine coded in your programs could be security issue.What solutions are out there for handling the configuration of paths in Python to avoid having to code them out explicitly? 
I believe there are many ways around this, but here is what I would do:Create a JSON config file with all the paths I need defined.For even more portability, I'd have a default path where I look for this config file but also have a command line input to change it.
In my opinion passing arguments from command line would be best solution. You should take a look at argparse . This allows you to create nice way to handle arguments from the command line. for example:myDataScript.py /home/userName/datasource1/
One of the solution rely on using configuration files.You can store all your path in a json file like so : and then in your python code, you could just do :and then you can use your path (or any configuration variable you like) like so :
