Natural Text
I'm trying to make a webscraper that gets some information (in this case a phone number). In order to get the phone number, I'm using a self-created and tested regex (using RegExr) to search for the phone number, which is here (accounting for country code (+1 in the USA), parentheses, etc.)I have a soup object, and go through it like so:However, even though I know there's a phone number within the html page, the program doesn't print it. Why is this, and what can I do to fix it?
Added raw string to regex and extracted only text from soup using soup.get_text().
