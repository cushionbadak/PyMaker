I have an object that has different methods like SGD, Adam, Adamax and I can call it like this:How can I call it all in the cycle. I have the following algo:How can I call train() with all optimizer's algorithms that I mention(optim.SGD, optim.Adam, optim.Adamax)?
You can use getattr  to get the train attribute of each optimizer, then call it:There's also operator.methodcalller which does exactly the same thing with a slight change of syntax:
Directly enumerate the optimize function
