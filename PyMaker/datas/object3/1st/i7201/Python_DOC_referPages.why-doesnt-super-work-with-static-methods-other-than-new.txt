I understand that __new__ is a static method and super() can be called from it create a new object, like so:Why doesn't the super call work with other static methods? Why does the following fail?
super() with no arguments in Python 3 is basically a hack over its argument based version.When super() gets no arguments it fetches the first argument i.e the class using a special cell variable named __class__ and for second argument it will get the first local variable from the stack(which is going to be function's first argument).In case of __new__ it can get both(__class__ and cls) and works fine.But in this case for example there's no second variable available apart from __class__ hence it fails.Now if we change it to accept an argument then things change:Hence the only solution is to make the things explicit with super() in your case:In general I am not sure why the implementation in case of staticmethod can't make an exception and use __class__ for both the arguments to make it work.Related CPython code:
You are right, but __new__ is a static method (special-cased so you need not declare it as such) that takes the class of which an instance was requested as its first argument. Its ideal behavior is somewhat like a classmethod.But when you call a staticmethod method, the method does not receive anything, an has no way to know from what object or class it was called. That's the reason why you cannot access super in a staticmethod.Therefore, new by definition has a class argument in it and can use super along with it.For your logic you should make a call to instatiate your object and call the function that you want to call from there.
__new__ is treated as a special-case by the python interpreter (pretty much all the "dunder" methods are). One aspect of this special case handling is to make super have access to the underlying class object when normally a staticmethod does not.  You can search for __new__ in the source code for the type object to take a peek at what is going on under the hood.To solve what you were trying to do with inheritance, you probably want a classmethod.
