This question already has an answer here:Is it possible to make abstract classes in Python?                    10 answers                I use pep8 in visual studio code and I just tried to write some abstract classes.The problem is I get the error [pylint] E1101:Instance of 'MyAbstract' has no 'child_method' member because pep8 does not realise that the method is well defined, but in the child classes.To illustrate my problem here is a code snippet that is reducted to the minimum for clarity:So my questions are:Is it ok to write classes like this? How would you solve the error? (disable error, use another pattern, ...)ClarificationThe MyAbstract class shouldn't be instanciated, and the child classes will inherit the some_method. The idea is to use it on child class instances.
If you want MyAbstract to be an abstract class with abstract method child_method, Python has a way of expressing that in the abc module:Your linter will no longer complain about the nonexistent method, and as a bonus, Python will detect attempts to instantiate a class with unimplemented abstract methods.
