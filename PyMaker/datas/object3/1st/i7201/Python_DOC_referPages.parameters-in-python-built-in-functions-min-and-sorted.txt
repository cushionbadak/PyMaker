I'm doing tasks on py.checkio.org, I have meet an exercise to write my own function min() and max().I have read documentation about this function in official documentation and I'm surprised about described parameters, they look like:  min(iterable, *[, key, default])I'm wondering what does this construction *[, mean, it is strange, because *args and **kwargs is clear, also [,arg] is clear.But *[, is very strange, what does this parameter mean?P.S sorted() function has strange parameter asterisk: sorted(... *, ...) what can it mean?
The following applies to Python 3 (to which the OP linked).The single star (*) in the function definition of sorted denotes that all following named parameters must be supplied as keyword arguments ("keyword-only arguments", see PEP 3102). That means the following won't work:Instead you must supply those parameters via keyword arguments:I'm not completely sure what the , *[, key, default] syntax shall denote (it's not valid Python but a documentation purpose) however I think the developers want to express the same thing, namely that you have to provide those parameters as keyword arguments (because min and max can take an arbitrary number of positional arguments that is the only way to do it).
The [, key, default] part is not Python syntax, it's general programming languages grammar syntax denoting optional parts (here optional arguments).EDIT: the * part is explained in a_guest's answer (nb : this is for Python 3 only)
