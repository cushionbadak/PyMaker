i'm new to logging and python and have found a library called logbook that i would like to use. i'm trying some kind of wrapper that intiliaze the log file and i then can call it from different files.but i keep getting below error. What am i doing wrong?logger.pycli.pyother files
The issue is that you are not providing a default logging directory, so the line log_handler = FileHandler(path) will fail when you don't pass anything to initialize_logger(). Simply add and else to the if path is None statement that sets path to some location :)Even better, simply change path=None to path='/path/to/default.log' or something.
