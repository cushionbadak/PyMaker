So I am trying to organize data through a CSV file using pandas so I can graph it in matplotlib, I have different rows of values in which some are control and others are experimental. I am able to separate the rows to graph however I can not seem to make it work, I have attempted for loops (seen below) to graph although I keep getting 'TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable'.
There is a typo in your for loop :Should beYour for loop tries to call __getitem__ on range, but since this method isn't defined for range, you get a TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable. Check python documentation for getitem() for more details.However, you cannot use range on a pandas Series to loop over every item in it, since range expects integers as it's input. Instead you should use :This will loop over every row in your csv file, and output the exact same plot for each row. I'm quite sure this is not what you actually want to do.If I understand your question well, you want to plot each group of experimental/control values you have in your csv.Then you should try (untested) : for group in df['Group'].unique() will loop over every piece of data in the Group column, ignoring duplicates.For instance, if your column have 1000 strings in it, but all of these strings are either "experimental" or "control", then this will loop over ['experimental', 'control'] (actually a numpy array, also, do note that unique() doesn't sort, so the order of the output depends on the order of the input).df[df['Group'] == group] will then select all the rows where the column 'Group' is equal to group. Check pandas documentation for where method and masking for more details.
