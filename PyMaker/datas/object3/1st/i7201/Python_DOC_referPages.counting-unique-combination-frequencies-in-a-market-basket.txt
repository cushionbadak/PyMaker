I have a set of 1000000 market-baskets containing 1-4 items each. I would like to calculate the frequency of each unique combination of items purchased. The data is organized as such:In this example [P06, P09] has a frequency of two and all other combinations have a frequency of one. I have created the following binary matrix and calculated the frequency of each individual item as such:How can I calculate the frequency of each unique combination of 1-4 items that are present in the data? 
Well, since you cant use df.groupby('product_id').count(), this is the best I could come up with. We make a dict with the string representation of lists as keys, and count occurrences in it.
Maybe:Creates a column of frozensets (hashable, and ignoring ordering) from product_ids, and then counts the number of each unique value.
