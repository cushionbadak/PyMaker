So I found an example that showsand this works.But how does it work when I usually have an object with the function.Here are 2 functions I normally use.How do I add servername.strip() to the below?
The target should be a function, so define your own function that does what you want:and hand it to your Thread.If you want to do it in a single line, you could use an anonymous function:As cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ mentions in his answer, you can also specify arguments for the callback as a tuple:
You can pass arguments to threading.Thread, so this should work:This is, in my opinion, the simplest option.
Use either lambda or local functions:orIn python you can define function in function (local functions, lambda is also kind of this), and inside functions can access names from it's parent function. Even after execution left original function Keep in mind, that this will prolong lifetime of objects in parent's function. So:Now you can use a to access s. But as long as a exists, s will also, as a keeps reference to substr, which keeps reference to s.
