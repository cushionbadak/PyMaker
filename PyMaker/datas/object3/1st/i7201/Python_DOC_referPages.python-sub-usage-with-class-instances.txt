Can anyone explain how the above code works. Can't get my head around it.I understand that __sub__ is an operator overloader in python and intercepts the p1-p2 call. But how does it work with two separate instances of class ?
__sub__ is supposed to be the magic method equivalent of - arithmetic operator, so not sure why you're adding them... That aside, when you do p1 - p2, it is the same as p1.__sub__(p2). The __sub__ function is invoked on p1, the calculation made and the new Point object returned.
Now you edited the question, the answer is simple:You have two points as arguments self, other, so, self, obviously in your example would be p1, and other is p2, after doing all the calculation, you return a new Point, so, p1 and p2 are not modified.Important adviceThe most rare thing, is that you call it __sub__, but indeed, you are actually adding! I mean, please... either change the method definition and replace + by -, or change __sub__... just a piece of advice.
