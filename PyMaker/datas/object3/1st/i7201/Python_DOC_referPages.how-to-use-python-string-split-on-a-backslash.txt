This question already has an answer here:Confused about backslashes in regular expressions [duplicate]                    3 answers                I am trying to name a text file after the last directory in a file path.  I need to be able to get this name for OS's that use either forward or backward slashes. I've successfully used the string split() method for forward slash file paths but not backslash. Also, when I try to print the backslash directory name the slashes are not included (probably reading as escape sequences); however, when I use re.search() method it still finds the slash.How do I fix this?See code below:The link shows my console output (I'm not allowed to embed images yet apparently...)
I think you're trying harder than you need to. Python has an os module which has a function to do exactly what you want, independent of platform. Here, you just need to useAlso, if you're using Python you should seriously consider moving away from camel case (fileName) to the more Pythonic snake case (file_name).
A small example,'r' prefix matters!Reference! That is,When an "r" or "R" prefix is present, a character following a  backslash is included in the string without change, and all  backslashes are left in the string. For example, the string literal  r"\n" consists of two characters: a backslash and a lowercase "n".  String quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash  remains in the string; for example, r"\"" is a valid string literal  consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; r"\" is  not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd  number of backslashes). Specifically, a raw string cannot end in a  single backslash (since the backslash would escape the following quote  character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is  interpreted as those two characters as part of the string, not as a  line continuation.
