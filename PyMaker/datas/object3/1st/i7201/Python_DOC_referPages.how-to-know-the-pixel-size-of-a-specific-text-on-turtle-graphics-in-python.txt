Natural Text
As title, when I execute the following code I want to know the whole size (including height and width) of the string some text on the canvas of the turtle graphics.How can I do that?
The font size only tells you half of what you need to know, i.e. the height:The size of a font is typically taken to be the distance from the top  of the highest character to the bottom of the lowest character.From FontSize.htmlBut we can get the width via setting the move= option of turtle.write() to True.  Here's a example where I want to draw a tight box around the text I've just drawn:Now, here's a harder problem of drawing the box first, filling it, and then drawing the text into it.  The trick used is to draw the text off-screen:Another approach would be to draw the text in place in the background color first, measure it, draw and fill the box, and finally redraw the text in a different color.
The default font for turtle.write is 'Arial' with a font-size of 8px as described in the documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.write.The height and width of the text is dependent on the font parameter.
Though Brandon pretty much gave the answer, let me give you an example:This would do your job, Consolas is the font type, 8 is the font's size, and bold is the font type. Other than bold you can go for italic or normal as well.
