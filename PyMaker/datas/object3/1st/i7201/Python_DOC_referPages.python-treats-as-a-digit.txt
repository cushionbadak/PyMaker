Basically im making a small piece of code to remove the end character of a string until the string passes .isdigit.I used http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html to see why I wasn't getting any output, it passed a + symbol as a digit, just like the numbers 6 and 0.Am I doing something wrong or does python treat + as a digit?
str.isdigit is a method not an attribute, so (as was already mentioned in the comments) you need to call it.Also you check each character (starting from the left side) for isdigit but if it's not passing the isdigit() test you remove a character from the right side. That doesn't seem right. You probably wanted to iterate over the for i in reversed(string) (or using slicing: for i in string[::-1]).But you also could simplify the logic by using a while loop:
