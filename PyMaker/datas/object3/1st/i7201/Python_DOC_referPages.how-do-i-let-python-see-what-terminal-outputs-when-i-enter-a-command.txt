I want to run a program on Python on macOS Sierra that checks Terminal for its outputs after I automatically enter a command on it. For example, I would write in Terminal:and then Terminal would output something like:How would I have Python scan what Terminal outputs and set it to a variable as a string?By the way, the other forums do not explain in much detail how one would do this in macOS. Therefore, this is not a duplicate of any forum.
You could pipe the output to a file and read the file.Then read the file and take further actions based on its contents.
Use the subprocess module, it has some shortcut methods to make things easier and less complicated than using Popen.You can decode this using output.decode("UTF-8") if you like or you can use the universal_newlines keyword argument to have it done automatically as well as sorting out newlines.Edit: With @Silvio's sensible suggestion, passing all arguments you can do the following:Or if you have a string sourced from elsewhere you can call .split() which will generate a list of substrings separated by a space.Note: I'm using Python3 on Windows and Gnu on Windows so I have \r\n line endings and pwd.
