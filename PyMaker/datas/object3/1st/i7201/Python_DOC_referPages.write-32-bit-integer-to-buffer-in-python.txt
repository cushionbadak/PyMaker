I'm trying to write 32 bit integer to byte array (which is Node.js buffer).As i know, Node.js Buffer objects allocUnsafe function returns array of pseudo-randomly generated numbers encoded in hexadecimal format.So i interpreted Node.js Buffer.allocUnsafe(n) method in Python:[c.encode('hex') for c in os.urandom(n)]But then, allocUnsafe function has its own nested functions writeInt32BE(value, offset) and writeInt32LE(value, offset), I have read the official documentation, But i didn't understand what was exactly returned from these functions.Is there any equivalent method for these Node.js functions in Python? As i know equal action in Python can be done with struct module and from_bytes method works too, But i'm not sure how. Thanks in advance.
Python provides methods like int.to_bytes(size,byteorder) See hereSo in order to convert number to 32 bit we take length in to_bytes method to be 4 i.e 4*8 = 32 bits.int.from_bytes function converts the bytes to int See here Default representation in bytes is signed representation of integer.From docs :  You can check out the hex representation to converting to integer
