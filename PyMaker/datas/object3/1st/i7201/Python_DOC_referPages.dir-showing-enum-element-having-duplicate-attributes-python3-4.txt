I was playing around with enums. In particular, I took this bit of code from the enum docs:Then, call dir() on Color.RED:As you can see, there are two identical attributes - name and value there.From the docs of dir():[...] With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for  that object.So why does dir register Color.RED as having identical attributes with the same name and how do they differ?
dir(thing) is basically just sorted(thing.__dir__()), and thing.__dir__ can return pretty much anything. Enums have a custom __dir__ implementation that has changed a few times; in 3.4, that __dir__ implementation accidentally put 'name' and 'value' in the list twice, once explicitly and once from an MRO search.
