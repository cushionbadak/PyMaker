I am trying to construct a python lambda function from either a single parameter or a list, and am unsure what syntax to use to build the lambda:The lambda should check if x is an instance of any number of classes that is passed to the function (either one or many).Is there a general way to build functions from an arbitrary number of parameters in python, maybe as a kind of comprehension? 
You could loop over your classes args using all.Although I'd prefer just passing in a list of classesand calling the function as
If you want to check that an object is an instance of any listed class, you don't need to define anything:From isinstance documentation :If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such  tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types.In your question, you mention if x is an instance of any number of classes that is passed to the function (either one or many), it would mean that you should or instead of and in your boolean logic. If you want to check that an object is an instance of every listed classes, see the answer with all.
