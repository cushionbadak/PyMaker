How do you compare the objects in two lists, and then if there are two of the same objects in both lists, replace it with something? For example:I want to say, if some of the objects in list1 are the same with some of the objects in list2, replace those objects with something else (For example, 'hello')

Try using a list comprehension and the ternary operator.
