The python logging library allows to log based on different levels:https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-levelsBut I would like to use it to log based on custom tags,  for example "show_intermediate_results" or "display_waypoints_in_the_code" or "report_time_for_each_module" and so on...Those tags cannot be measured in a severity ladder, during development i would sometimes want to see them and sometimes not depending on what i am developing/debugging at the moment.So the question is if I can use the logging library to do that?Btw, i DO want to use the library and not write something by myself because i want it to be thread safe.
As per the documentation, you can use logging.Filter objects with Logger and Handler instancesfor more sophisticated filtering than is provided by levels.
