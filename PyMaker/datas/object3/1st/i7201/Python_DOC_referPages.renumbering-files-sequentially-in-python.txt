I'm building a database gathering thousands of images in a folder. I'm using a python script to rename the files in a database but the problem is that whenever I add images to the folder and rename them, it gives all the files a different name. Is there any way to not rename the files in a certain format?
Check the filename matches your format or not with a pattern match.  Also, check for the existence of a new filename and increment the counter until you find an unused one:Here's an example starting list of files:and output:
So, first you need to find out the largest file name in the sequence. You can use glob function.given this folder structure:Next thing, since enumerate(os.listdir(_src)) includes not interested files, you can't use its index. So just the max index from above:And filter out the hidden files, of course.
