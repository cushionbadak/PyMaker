Hi i have written basic python unittest code below :    i am getting an error : Someone please help me to resolve this error.
In all likelihood you have a file that is named operator.py in your directory. Unfortunately, that name conflicts with Python's standard library, which has an operator module.In fact, look at the last two lines, one of which says:Which suggests it tries to get itemgetter from operator, but since you have an operator.py file in your working directory, it tries to import itemgetter from that file, not Python's standard library.Try to rename your operator.py to something else and see what happens.
