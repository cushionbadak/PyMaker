What is the value 0 in front of [].
0 represents the first argument of the format function, which is somelist.This means that this 0 will be replaced by somelist and then its first ([0]) and third ([2]) elements are used in the string.Therefore 0 is ['S', 'P', 'A', 'M'], 0[0] is 'S' and 0[2] is 'A'.
