I wanna check 2 elements already in the array.Now my code is and I wanna print out yes because [1, 2, 3] of Y has 1&2.But now,it print out no.For example,if  if (1 in Y) &(4 in Y): is my if statement,in that time I wanna print out no because 1&4 are not in same array.So,I cannot understand why my code does not print out yes.How can I fix this?
The if X in Y statement checks Y for the existence of X. In your code (if we simplify the steps) It checks:Since none of those are true the answer is False.If I understood correctly, what you want to do is:
You can use a combination of all and any.[1, 2]Check that 1 and 2 are in the same sub-list of YThere should be one sublist of rows which include every x from to_search.Check that 1 and 2 are in YEvery x from the to_search list should be in one of the sublists of rows.[1, 4]With [1, 4], the difference between the two becomes more apparent. 1 and 4 are both somewhere in Y, but not in the same sub-list:Check that 1 and 4 are in the same sub-list of YCheck that 1 and 4 are in Y
Will this help you?
Your array is not normal a list .. it is a list  of lists. If you want to check you need to check for each item in Y. It should be something like this
