I'm working on the start menu for my game in python using pygame, I made a function that detects if the mouse pressed on the position of each button and if it does, it changes the value of a boolean asigned to said button. However the boolean values are not changing.Here is my code:The '...' are jumps I made in the code to show you only the parts related to the issues.The position detection does work, I checked it using 'print' for debbuging.-- Update --Accidentally deleted the section where the button was defined.Also a few typos I made when I returned the code to it's original state.
The problem is that the variables in the checkSelection() function are local variables. You need to declare the variables as global in the function:The rules on local vs. global variables in Python are neatly summarised at the official Python Programming FAQ.P.S. It's not a good idea to use global variables inside functions. I would recommend to define a function that checks only one button area and returns the result, which can be assigned to the (global) variable:
