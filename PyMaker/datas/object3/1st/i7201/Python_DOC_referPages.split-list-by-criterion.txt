This question already has an answer here:Python: split a list based on a condition?                    29 answers                Let's say I have a list of numbers and I want to split this list into two sublists: one for odd numbers and another one for evens.I wonder if there is a one-liner for this problem while keeping the same order of complexity.I tried using itertools.groupby but the list needs to be ordered first so I'd be achieving a O(2n) rather than O(n):
How about using the ternary operator prior to append:Of course you could do this inside a list comprehension, but it's not Pythonic to use a comprehension for it's side-effects because you create a potentially large unwanted list of None values. You could instead use the itertools consume recipe if you want to take that route.
You could abuse list comprehension, but please don't do that in production code.
