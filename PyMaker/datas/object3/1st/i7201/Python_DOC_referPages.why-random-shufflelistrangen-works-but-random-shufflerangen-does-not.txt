When, in Python 3, using random module random.shuffle(list(range(n))) works, but random.shuffle(range(n)) does not. Why is it so? When I type type(range(n)) it returns range. 
Python 3's range now returns an range-object (beeing an immutable sequence) and not a list (like Python 2)!A range-object (besides other differences) does not support item assignment, which is the error you observe (probably):The line 272 is the pythonic-way of swapping two variables in python, which is a common operation in most shuffle algorithms (like Fisher-Yates).The docs also mentions this (if you want to shuffle sequences):To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use sample(x, k=len(x)) insteadSo this will work (and is equivalent given the task of shuffling):Your approach of creating a list first is also fine, if you can afford the memory/time needed to do that.
