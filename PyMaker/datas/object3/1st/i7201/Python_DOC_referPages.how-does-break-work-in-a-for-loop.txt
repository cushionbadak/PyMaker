I am new in Python and I got confused about the way that "break" works in a for loop. There is an example in Python documentation(break and continue Statements) which calculates prime numbers in range (2, 10):and the output is:however when I outdent "break" in the code:the output will be:Can you please explain what happens in the code after I outdent "break"? Thank you
Sure - Simply put out-denting the "Break" means it's no longer subject to the "if" that precedes it.The code reads the if statement, acts on it, and then regardless of whether that if statement is true or false, it executes the "break" and drops out of the for loop.In the first example the code only drops out of the 'for' loop if the n%x==0 statement is true.
Try executing this code - it might make it more clear:vs:I'm sure the output would help you understand what is going on. #1 is breaking only if the if condition is satisfied, while #2 breaks always regardless of the if condition being satisfied or not.
