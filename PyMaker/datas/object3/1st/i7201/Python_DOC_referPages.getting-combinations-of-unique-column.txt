I want to know if someone knows of a python function that returns a combination of columns without repetition. For exampleEven if its a custom function you have made I would like to see it and understand the logic behind it. Also if possible I want functions from modules readily available in python by default so don't want something like numpy where I have to manually install it via pip.Thanks :)
You can use itertools.product and exclude items in the same column after generating column indices using enumerate:You can generalize this for multiple rows and columns by checking that no column in each combination is repeated:
For larger square matrices, you could take use permutations of columns:Regarding the last line: given an N x N matrix, there are exactly N! ways to pick an element from each row without ever picking two or more from any column: You have N choices in the first row, N-1 in the second, etc. Hence, each combination that meets your requirement is pinned down by a permutation. map(enumerate, permutations(range(ncols))) gives a list of all valid indexes. For a given index inds, [mat[i][j] for i, j in inds] gives a list corresponding to that index.
