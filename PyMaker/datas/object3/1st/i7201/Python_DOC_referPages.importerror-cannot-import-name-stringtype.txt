I took some sample code that was made in the django version 1.8.4, and like Python 2.7 when transferred to 3 python all flown away and produced such an error, how to fix it?one piece of code where using stringtype (config.py)(in site-packages)
There is no StringType in Python3.Try this instead:To check the type of an object use:    which gives : True in the given case.Also, alter you code as suggested in the question comments by iFlo : https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html
StringType is obsolete in python 3, UnicodeType is not available anymore as it's the built-in str from python3 right now.
