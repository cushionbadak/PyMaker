I have a class City:I create a list of cities:Example:I would like to group the cities by orders so that it would look like this:I've tried it with dictionaries, list lists and sets but it still does not give me results and I do not know how else I could get it. I leave you a code that I have tried:This outputs:I hope you can help me.Thank you very much

You are getting an IndexError because you are trying to access items in an unpopulated list.  I imagine you are trying to fill out something more like this:There are a few other problems here.  You are indexing by integers starting from 1 it seems from your example of how each city is set up.  You need to adjust for the offset.  You don't need to iterate the indices of city.orders you really only need the values.The below code requires hard coding the number of lists you will need to fill out.  Easy if it is known, but annoying if it can change.  The below code assumes there are 3 tours as in your example.Ideally you might want a more dynamic set up where you don't have to specify the number of groups before hand:The above code introduces a while loop that will add lists to tours if you have not yet created the sub-lists you are trying to fill out.
If you want list1 to contain Cities that have 1 in their order, you can test for that and take action:Similarly
