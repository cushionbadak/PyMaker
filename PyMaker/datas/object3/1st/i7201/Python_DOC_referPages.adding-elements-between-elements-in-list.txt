If I have a list eg.and a function f(), how do I insert such that the new list is like:
You can use:with data the initial list, and f of course the function you want to apply.For example if f is the str function (converts a number to its textual equivalent), it will generate:So here we obtain [1, '1', 2, '2', 3, '3'] where 1 is the initial 1, and '1' is f(1).Benchmarks: I altered the following test setup to:This means we can test the different answers for different file sizes using pandas. For every configuration, we perform 10 tests with timeit.This generates the following timings (in seconds):Or in relative terms (best is 1.00):

A slightly different approach from Willem's answer, that avoids two loops:[x, f(x)] creates a list of two elements with the current element and the function applied to it.sum(..., []) flattens the list.

You can use map and list comprehension:Output:
