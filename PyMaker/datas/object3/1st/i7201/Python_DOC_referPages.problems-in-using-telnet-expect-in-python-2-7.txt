I am trying to telnet to remote server and trying to get the response back.I was using telnet.read_until earlier to match whether prompt/pattern appeared or not but read_until returns everything even if there is no match. I thought of using telnet.expect but i am getting errorBelow is the codeError I am getting is 
telnetlib.expect() requires list as first argument, you are giving a SRE_pattern.From telnetlib documentation:Telnet.expect(list, timeout=None)Read until one from a list of a regular expressions matches.The first argument is a list of regular expressions, either compiled (regex objects) or uncompiled (byte strings). The optional second argument is a timeout, in seconds; the default is to block indefinitely.[...]Should works (the diff is expect([com]) instead of expect(com)).
