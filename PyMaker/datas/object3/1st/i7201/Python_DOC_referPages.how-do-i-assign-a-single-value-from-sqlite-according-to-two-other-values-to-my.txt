I'm trying to create a simple online login form using Python and SQLite3:The email and password values entered into the html form are assigned to the user_email and user_password variables respectively. What I'm trying to do is, once the user logs in, he is greeted with a welcome message ("Welcome, UserName!").My question is, how do I assign the UserName value from my SQLite database table to my Python variable user_name?I've also tried this code:But that gives me an error: "Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 1, and there are 15 supplied." There are 15 rows in my database. I'm assuming that the criteria (WHERE UserEmail=?) isn't being applied.How do I fix this?
Two issues with this:(user_email) is not a tuple, so you are not passing a 1-element tuple to execute(). Instead, pass (user_email,) to make a 1-element tuple.The return value of fetchone() will return the whole result row as a tuple. If there is only one column in the row, you will still get a 1-element tuple back. You need to unpack the tuple first in order to fix this:
