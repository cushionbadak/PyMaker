Natural Text
I am working through reviewing a video on Lynda and sometimes instead of just running the provided code I typed it myself. The instructor's code works, but mine doesn't. It returns "object does not take parameters". Mine is on top, his is on the bottom. Can anyone explain?
The reason is the init function in the class. The way this method works as seen here to let an object be assigned parameters when initialized. I am sure you understand this, but the simple error you made was that it requires 2 underscores on either side to take effect. Like this: __init__. That is the difference between your two codes.
