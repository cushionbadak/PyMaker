I have a superclass as below:And I worked on a subclass:When run test cases:a = Bag() a.insert(3) a.insert(5) b = Bag() b.insert(5) b.insert(5)b.insert(5) print(a+b)My output is:{3: 1, 5: 4}However, the expected output should be:3:15:4How could I get the right format output? Thank you very much!
Currently your __add__ function returns a normal dict instead of an instance of Bag. Instead of that you can use the new_dict with a new instance of Bag and return it.Demo:You may also want to checkout bag data-structure(collections.Counter) provided by Python's standard lib for other functionalities possible with it.
Because once you add a and b you no longer have a Bag, just a regular dict. If you want addition of Bags to return another Bag, you have to modify your __add__ function accordingly, such that it returns a Bag as opposed to new_dict, which is just a regular dict.
