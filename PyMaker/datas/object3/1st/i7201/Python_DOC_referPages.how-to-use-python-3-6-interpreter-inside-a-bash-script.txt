I want to have a little script, that will find, run and report about all the tests in the folder, like this one:But, when I run it, I get some errors, which I do not get on Windows (like using of super() without an argument). As I've understood, it's connected with the fact, that build-in and default version of Python on Linux is 2.x, whereas I am using 3.6. How should I change the script, so it would use Python 3.6 interpreter?EDIT:So here's one of the files with tests that I run:And the error:
First, install it for your python3 (if you have it and pip installed)sudo python3 -m pip install coverageThen, in order to run coverage for python3, run python3 -m coverage report -mSo your final script should look like this:Also you can replace python3 with path to your pythons bin. For example /usr/bin/python3. So You can call it this way as well:
The problem is that the coverage command on your Linux host has been installed for Python 2.  That is, somewhere there exists a coverage script that starts with:And on your system, /usr/bin/python is python 2.The best solution here is probably to set up a Python 3 virtual environment for running your tests (and then installing coverage into that virtualenv).  You may also want to investigate tox, which will handle this for you automatically.
