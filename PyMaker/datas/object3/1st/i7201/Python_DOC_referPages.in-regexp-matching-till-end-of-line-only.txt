Try using the flag re.DOTALL:From the documentation:'.' (Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a  newline. If the DOTALL flag has been specified, this matches any  character including a newline. re.DOTALL Make the '.' special  character match any character at all, including a newline; without  this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline.
