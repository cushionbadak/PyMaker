This question already has an answer here:Python Class Members                    6 answers                I have created class Circle with no instance variables. I've added a class-method from_diameter to generate the circle with given diameter.diameter is a class (static) variable. However - it looks like it exists as an instance variable and class variable as well.Output:Why does it work? There is no instance variable diameter.I suppose print myCircle.diameter should throw an error.
when you try to access the variable with a class it look into only but when you try to access the variable with instance it looks first if find then return or if can't find then it also looks in here cls is the class Output:For detail class special attribute 
There's no instance variable, it's just that name lookup in Python objects first looks into the instance, then, if no match has been found, into the class.Class instancesA class instance is created by calling a class object (see above). A class instance has a namespace implemented as a dictionary which is the first place in which attribute references are searched. When an attribute is not found there, and the instance’s class has an attribute by that name, the search continues with the class attributes. [...] If no class attribute is found, and the object’s class has a __getattr__() method, that is called to satisfy the lookup.(Python 2, Python 3)
