I have a vpn connection and when I'm running python -m SimpleHTTPServer, it serves on 0.0.0.0:8000, which means it can be accessed via localhost and via my real ip.I don't want robots to scan me and interested that the server will be accessed only via localhost.Is it possible? Any other simple http server which can be executed instantly using the command line is also welcome.
If you read the source you will see that only the port can be overridden on the command line.  If you want to change the host it is served on, you will need to implement the test() method of the SimpleHTTPServer and BaseHTTPServer yourself.  But that should be really easy.Here is how you can do it, pretty easily:And to use it:  
As @sberry explained, simply doing it by using the nice python -m ... method won't be possible, because the IP address is hardcoded in the implementation of the BaseHttpServer.test function.A way of doing it from the command line without writing code to a file first would beIf that still counts as a one liner depends on your terminal width ;-) It's certainly not very easy to remember.
In Python versions 3.4 and higher, the http.server module accepts a bind parameter.According to the docs:python -m http.server 8000By default, server binds itself to all interfaces. The option  -b/--bind specifies a specific address to which it should bind. For example, the following command causes the server to bind to localhost  only:python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1New in version 3.4: --bind argument was introduced.
