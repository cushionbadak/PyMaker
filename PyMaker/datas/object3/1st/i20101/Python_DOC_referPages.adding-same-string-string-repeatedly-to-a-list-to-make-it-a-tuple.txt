I'm trying to combine a string with a series of numbers as tuples to a list.For example, starting with:  I want to turn that into:I tried:but this returned:
You can iterate over each position within a string so zip causes the behavior you were seeing previously.
If you want to use zip(), then create a list for your string variable before multiplying:string * len(a) creates one long string, and zip() then iterates over that to pull out individual characters. By multiplying a list instead, you get a list with len(a) separate references to the string value; iteration then gives you string each time.You could also use itertools.repeat() to give you string repeatedly:This avoids creating a new list object, potentially quite large.
