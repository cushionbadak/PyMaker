As a homework assignment I have to write a script which finds the median of 3 given numbers without using a standard sort function of Python.This is my first week in class and my first programming experience so I find it very difficult to get any further than I am right now.Here's what I have so far:This seems to do the trick, but only for the first two entries of the list. The loop doesn't include the third entry.How can I make the script include all three entries?Thanks in advance!Sander
sum([a, b, c]) - min(a, b, c) - max(a, b, c) - no sorting!
You are modifying the list in-place while looping over it, which has consequences for what elements you see:Note how 3 is never printed; by removing the second entry in the list, we've shortened it by one element and the loop finds the list exhausted early.Note that you don't need to loop over the items, a few simple comparisons will tell you what item is the median if you think about it for a second. :-)
There are a number of simpler ways to go about this, but as for your approach:You're modifying list inside of your loop. Don't do that. :)In your case, you should be removing elements from newlist:But as an exercise, you might want to think about a few things:Why are you putting the elements in a list and looping over them? What advantage does this have over comparing a,b,c with simply if statements?Why the if list:? 
The fastest way to do it:Guarantees you 3 comparisons at the worst case and 2 comparisons in the best case. 2,5 comparisons in average.Using ternary conditional we can write it shorter as:If you could use sorting you would have the shortest version:
