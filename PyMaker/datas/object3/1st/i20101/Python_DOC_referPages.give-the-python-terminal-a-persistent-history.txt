Is there a way to tell the interactive Python shell to preserve its history of executed commands between sessions?While a session is running, after commands have been executed, I can arrow up and access said commands, I'm just wondering if there is some way for a certain number of these commands to be saved until the next time I use the Python shell.This would be very useful since I find myself reusing commands in a session, that I used at the end of the last session.
Sure you can, with a small startup script. From Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution in the python tutorial:From Python 3.4 onwards, the interactive interpreter supports autocompletion and history out of the box:Tab-completion is now enabled by default in the interactive interpreter on systems that support readline. History is also enabled by default, and is written to (and read from) the file ~/.python-history.
Use IPython.You should, anyway, because it's awesome: persistent command history is just one of the many many ways it's better than the stock Python shell.
This is also required for Python 3 when using a virtual environment.I use a slightly different version which keeps a history file per virtual environment:
