Basically my question is say you have an list containing 'None' how would you try retrieving the sum of the list. Below is an example I tried which doesn't work and I get the error: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'. Thanks
You can use filter functionUpdated from commentsTypically filter usage is filter(func, iterable), but passing None as first argument is a special case, described in Python docs. Quoting:If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed.
Remove None (and zero) elements before summing by using filter:To see why this works, see the documentation for filter:filter(function, iterable)Construct a list from those elements of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If iterable is a string or a tuple, the result also has that type; otherwise it is always a list. If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed.Note that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to [item for item in iterable if function(item)] if function is not None and [item for item in iterable if item] if function is None.
Another suggestion:
Assuming you want to treat None as zero, a simple way is
You always have the option of just writing the loop you want:But it certainly doesnâ€™t hurt to know about filter either.
Explicitly, this is equivalent to filter:That saves me from remembering another function.  :P
