The R function rep() replicates each element of a vector:This is like the list multiplication in Python:But with the rep() R function it is also possible to specifiy the number of repeats for each element of the vector:Is there such a function availbale in Python ? Otherwise how could one define it ? By the way I'm also interested in such a function for duplicating rows of an array.
Use numpy arrays and the numpy.repeat function:
Not sure if there's a built-in available for this, but you can try something like this:Note that sum() runs in quadratic time. So, it's not the recommended way.Timing comparions:
Since you say "array" and mention R. You may want to use numpy arrays anyways, and then use:EDIT: Since you mention you want to repeat rows as well, I think you should use numpy. np.repeat has an axis argument to do this.Other then that, maybe:As it doesn't make the assumption you have  a list or string to multiply. Though I admit, passing everything as argument into chain is maybe not perfect, so writing your own iterator may be better.
Your example uses strings which are already iterables.You can produce a result string which is similar to a list.Update: the list comprehension is not required here:
What do you think about this way?To repeat a value:To repeat a sequence:
