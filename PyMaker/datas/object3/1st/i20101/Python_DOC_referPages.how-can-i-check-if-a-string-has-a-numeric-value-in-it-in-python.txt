Possible Duplicate:How do I check if a string is a number in Python?Python - Parse String to Float or Int For example, I want to check a string and if it is not convertible to integer(with int()), how can I detect that?
Use the .isdigit() method:Quoting the documentation:Return true if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, false otherwise.For unicode strings or Python 3 strings, you'll need to use a more precise definition and use the unicode.isdecimal() / str.isdecimal() instead; not all Unicode digits are interpretable as decimal numbers. U+00B2 SUPERSCRIPT 2 is a digit, but not a decimal, for example.
You can always try it:Note that this method outshines isdigit if you want to know if you can convert a string to a floating point number using float
