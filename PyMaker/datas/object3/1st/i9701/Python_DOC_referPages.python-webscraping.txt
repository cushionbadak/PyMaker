I'm trying to scrape data from a website using Python. When I look at the source code in my browser, I can see all the things I'm looking for. However, when I download the code with BeautifulSoup, I only get parts of the data that I want.I know BeautifulSoup doesn't work with javascript, (I don't know javascript at all) and I was wondering if there's a way to download all the raw source code (basically get a hard copy) even if parts of the site are done with javascript.This is my code thus far:I know it's hard to thoroughly answer my question without the actual source code. Unfortunately I can't show the code! Hope it isn't too big of a problem.
Maybe not the best solution, but here are my 2 cents if you only want to parse links. Of course you can search for class like: 
It's hard to get a full copy of a dynamic (JavaScript based) website without a browser, that's why the easiest way of getting such a copy is with a browser.You can look into PhantomJS and Selenium to control the browser and download the HTML, or just run PhantomJS with subprocess.A very simple PhantomJS script downloading the contents of a website:This waits 500ms before "downloading", depending on site and internet connection this is not enough or way too much, you can improve it by waiting until PhantomJS stops downloading data for X seconds using the onResourceReceived callback.
Your code is wrong and makes no sense:
