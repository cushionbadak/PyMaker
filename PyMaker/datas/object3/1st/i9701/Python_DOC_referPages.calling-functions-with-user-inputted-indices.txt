I am attempting to call functions in python 2.7 by presenting a list and asking the user to choose the index of the item in the list. I am confused on two points:How can the the user inputted index correspond to the function which is defined in the initial list? I understand how to choose items in a list, but don't understand how to call a function. Where should I put this block of code? In the main function?Here is my code: Thank you 
Put the functions in a listIndex the list with the user's input and assign the result to a name.Call itTo call different functions multiple times with predetermined arguments based on a user's choice - you need to associate the user's choice with the functions and the functions with the arguments they will be called with.  This could be done with a dictionaryThen you could construct an option menu withThen you would select and call the function like this. Notice the *args, the asterisk unpacks multiple items in a list or tuple.If you construct the dictionary with too many or too few function arguments it will throw a TypeError exception when calling the function.  If the user submits an invalid option, you'll get a KeyError exception. Handling Exceptions.This seems a little convoluted compared to the simple conditionals you used in your example but if you have a lot of functions this might be better and this lets you construct/modify the dictionary at runtime with different argument values.This isn't very generic and it seems that it could be encapsulated in a class.  I bet this is a pretty common thing and if you search around someone has come up with something a bit more refined.A possible refinement would be to use collections.namedtuple to make it a bit more readable.
