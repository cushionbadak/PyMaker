In Python, it is possible to dynamically import an entire module using importlib.import_module(name), which returns the specified package or module (e.g. pkg.mod). However, is there no analogous way to dynamically import a specific function/class/etc. from a given module in the same fashion as done using e.g. from foo import bar, where the symbol bar of the module foo is imported into the symbol table of the importing module?For example, if I try to import a symbol directly using importlib.import_module(symbol_name), I just get an ImportError:Executing the code above prints the following stack trace:
You have to look up the symbol you need in the module object that is returned by import_module using getattr:
import_module method only accept module.You could try something as below to access the module's method/attribute
