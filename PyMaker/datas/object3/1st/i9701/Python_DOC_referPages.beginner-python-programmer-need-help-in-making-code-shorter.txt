Using third party library named "nsetools" for fetching stock dataI want to make the code starting from here shortIs there any way to loop through the dictionary, access the closing prices of each individual stock and then calculate the current value of the investment preferably in one or two lines?
I asked this on codereview.stackexchange.com and received the answer
