Natural Text
I'm studying for my python programming test and I'm going over past exams, and got a bit stuck on this one question. The problem is with inputting arguments using the sys library.My program works but only when I input single length characters. If there are more than two characters between the delimiter(I used a comma),then the program splits it in a way that the rest of the program fails to work.What my program works for:What my program should work for:My code:I have tried doingbut to no avail. Is there a way to input characters (quantity set by the user) directly with a set delimiter?
You can simply do:and of course you can choose what delimiter to use.
