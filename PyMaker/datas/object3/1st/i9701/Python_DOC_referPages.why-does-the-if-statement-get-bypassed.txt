I am trying to figure out why the second string of "peptide_seq" bypasses the first if statement? The three strings are supposed to go through the if statements and return the following statements:Convert the string to uppercase.Strings that contain any character that is not A C G T or U should return: "not an unambiguous nucleotide".Strings that contain ACGU should return "DNA".Strings that contain ACGT should return "RNA".
First condition should be fixed in following way:Notice the upper case 'D' in the condition.Update:Full code, using Holloway and rassar comments:Update 1:Full code, using Holloway and rassar, and Copperfield comments:
.upper() will convert everything in the UPPERCASE. And other conditions like  ('A' and 'C' and 'G' and 'T') will always give the one char, so you need to update the if clauses. You should try something like this.
You can't say:You have to say:Or you could make it more concise:So try this:
I'm not certain what you are trying to do, but this may do the job:
just asking if the string have "d" or "D" in it is not good enough to rule out a invalid string, because it may contain "E", "Z", "X", "1", "@" or any other possible character, the best solution for this in my opinion is to use a set which will reduce anything you give to it to only its distinct elementsfor examplethen you only need to compare against the set of valid option to see if there is any matchand the output is
