This question already has an answer here:UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)                    24 answers                I'm currently trying to reduce a large list down in size by removing irrevelent data. I'm currently usingIt is currently working with a smaller scale file but when the larger main file is used it gives the following error. UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 3656: ordinal not in range(128) Is there another way to read the list into python. Also the file has over 10000 single data points for the list.Thanks for your help.
The cause is probably a 'misunderstanding' about the file encoding. Your python interpreter expects a textfile encoded as ascii, but in truth it's encoded as unicode or latin1. If it contains accented characters it's certainly not an ascii-file.Which version of python do you use? Python 2 treats text differently than Python 3.I generally use notepad++ to check which encoding is used in a text file if it's unclear.Once you know which encoding is used you can specify it as mentioned  here like this with open('list.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f_line:
