I was trying to do some csv processing using csv reader and was stuck on an issue where I have to iterate over lines read by the csv reader. But on  iterating second time, it returns nil since all the lines have already been iterated, is there any way to refresh the iterator to start from the scratch again.Code:what is precisely want to do is read a csv file in the format belowid,price,namex,y,za,b,c and rearrange it in the format belowid:x aprice: y  bname: z   cwithout using pandas library
Reset the underlying file object with seek, adding the following before the second loop:Mind you, if memory is not a concern, it would typically be faster to read the input into a list, then iterate the list twice. Alternatively, you could use itertools.tee to make two iterators from the initial iterator (it requires similar memory to slurping to list if you iterate one iterator completely before starting the other, but allows you to begin iterating immediately, instead of waiting for the whole file to be read before you can process any of it). Either approach avoids additional system calls that iterating the file twice would entail. The tee approach, after the line you create Reader1 on:
