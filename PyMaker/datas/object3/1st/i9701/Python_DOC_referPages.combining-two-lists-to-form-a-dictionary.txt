Natural Text
I have extracted the data I need from two columns of an excel sheet as two lists. When I try to combine these two lists into a dictionary, the final output has only 300 entries whereas my excel sheet has about 1200 entries. Why aren't all the entries being stored in the dictionary?Here's my code:I tried printing lengths of list1, list2, and data to cross-check.
Dictionaries can only contain unique keys. Check the length of set(list1) to see how many unique keys you have.
