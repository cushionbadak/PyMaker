The program should add all multiples of 3 and 5, up to the value passed. But instead it seems to add every number regardless of the multiple. It should return 23, but instead returns 45. Why?
In such cases adding a debug statement often helps to identify the problem:and this prints:Note that for simple cases a print (if you just want to inspect variables print(locals()) is very handy!) is sufficient but there are also other debugging tools like pdb.The reason why this is failing is that you compared the modulo of number instead of i. number=10 so number%5==0 is always True. See also the comment of @JohnColeman.Change it to i % ... == 0:which prints:and returns 23.
