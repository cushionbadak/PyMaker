Natural Text
I am trying to get a list after segmenting a word into it's constituents such as suffixes and prefixes (i.e. morphemes or affixes).I have tried using regular expressions, with the re.findall function.(Shown below)However, I need the sections in which it does not match to be included. For instance, the above example would be desired to output:['di', 'meth', 'yl', 'amin0', 'eth', 'an', 'ol']Does anyone know how to extract these segments in the list?
You can use re.split() capturing the "delimiters":The list comprehension here is to filter the empty string matches.
Assumption: Your final list does not require a particular order.
