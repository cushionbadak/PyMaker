I am working on a compute server which runs a linux. The machine is used by several users so I don't have and won't get root privileges. I need to install Keras which you would normally do by using pipNow, pip is not installed and the root won't install it for me either unless I beg him for probably a month or so. I tried to locally install pip with the python installation scrip Python352/bin/python3.5 get-pip.py --userThis unfortunately throws me an no permission error /etc. This is not exactly what I expected from installing the tool locally. Is it somehow possible to make an installation of pip that does not try to touch anything outside my local directory?
For installing pip as user without sudo access, check: How to install pip (python) to user without root access.Also, you need a virtual environment and for that you may use virtualenv. As the virtual environment doc says:A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them. It solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.How it fits you?You don't need to be root, in order to use itYou may install multiple versions of libraries in different virtual environment without worrying about the version conflicts.You need not to worry about the libraries you install to mess up with the configuration of the other users using the system
I had the similar case as you and I chose the Anaconda. You can download Anaconda file from this page using wget. You will happily find the file to be a .sh file. Use the following command to install Anaconda (for Python3):Use the following command to install other software (SOFTWARE_NAME) by pip:Hope it could help you.
