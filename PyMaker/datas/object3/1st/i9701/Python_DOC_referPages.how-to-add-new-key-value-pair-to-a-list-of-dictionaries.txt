I am initializing a list of dictionaries with:I want to be able to add key : value pairs to a certain dictionary. For example, I want to add the key value pair primer 1 : primer 2 to the first slot in the list.This gives me the error TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'. How am I able to access a certain dictionary within the list to add a key value pair?
This error message suggests that the key primer1 is a list (or contains a list).  What you're attempting will not be possible, because dict keys must be hashable in Python.  Instead, you may use a hashable sequence type for the key primer1, such as a tuple.
