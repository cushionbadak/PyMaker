I have written a simple program that simulates a magic card trick. I didn't feel the need to post the entire program, as it is running smoothly, the problem I have is finding a way to display 6 grids of numbers for the user to choose from.I wrote it using Python 2.7In the code example below I have just shown 2 of the grids, and how I print them, this is actually an improvement to how it was as I added the (\n) next line. The data is displayed in a very unorganized looking fashion. It just looks untidy. If I play with the spacing and get it kinda nice looking, this is all easily undone by the end user having different window dimensions.Is there something built into Python to display a grid of numbers or a table neatly?Or an additional module for displaying a grid of numbers that is fairly simple to use?A table wouldn't require any headings or anything, I just want to display the numbers. And the program doesn't need to interact with the numbers in the grids or tables afterwards, for now I can do that side of things by gathering input from the user.Each grid has 32 numbers so it could be divided into a 4 x 8 table or grid   I hope I have provided enough info to get a reasonable solution, I apologize for not putting the whole program into my question, I just wanted to keep the focus on the area I am looking at. I am fairly new to this site so if there's anything I could do better, I appreciate the feedback. 
This is a function that takes an iterable of values and prints them in a grid of width 4
There's a library for that Data pretty printer Python 2Data pretty printer Python 3
