I'm creating a web scraper and I'm running into an issue where the date the website gives me is of the form "Monday, January 1, 1991"What's the best way to format this into a "MM-DD-YYYY" format?  Should I split on the comma, pull out the month and convert it to a number, and then put the numbers together? Or is there some quicker way to do this?
Use the datetime module, using strptime to parse to a datetime object, then strftime to format as you need it:which outputs:For the record, any time you're considering rolling your own parser, the answer is almost always "Don't". Rolling your own parser is error-prone; if at all possible, look for an existing parser.
