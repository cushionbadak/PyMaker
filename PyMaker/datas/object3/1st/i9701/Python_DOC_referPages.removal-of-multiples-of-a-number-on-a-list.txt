I have a number two, I have this list, how would I go about removing multiples of the number 2 from that list and update it?
Methods:Using a generatorOne of the first option that comes to mind is to make use of a generator. The generator would iterate through a sequence, and test if the current element is divisible by n. This allows you to have a more generic solution as well:Usage:Using a generator expressionWhile the above solution is fine,  is can be shortened even more by using generator expressions. generator expression are like list comprehensions, but unlike them, they return a generator iterator instead of a list.Usage:Using filter():Among many of the builtin functions in Python, there is one for filtering list called filter(). The usually way to use filter() is to pass in the function you want to use to filter your list, and then the actual list you want filtered. In your case, you want to filter out every element the is not a multiple of two:Usage:Using a list comprehensionWhile all of the above are fine ways for filtering a list, probably the most obvious and canonical, is to use a list comprehension. In your case, your list comprehension, is dead simple.Usage:
Assuming you have a list l and a number n you can remove all multiples of n from l with a list comprehension:writing if i%n here is the same as writing if i%n != 0, and n divides i iff i%n==0
