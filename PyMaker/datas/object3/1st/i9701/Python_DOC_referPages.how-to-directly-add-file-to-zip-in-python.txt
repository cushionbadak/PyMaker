I am new to python. Here my target is to put data into a file in zip. Following is the code I have written, in which I am write data to a unzipped_file, then writing unzipped_file in zipped_file.zip and then removing unzipped file.Instead of creating an intermediate unzipped_file. Can I directly write my data in zipped_file in one step.
zipfile.writestr(file_name, bytes) writes  raw data represented by bytes into an archive.  file_name is the name of a file the archive will contain. EDIT: the only thing you can do to write multiple pieces of data to some file in an archive is to write all of it at once:The method above will work only if big_data contains strings. Otherwise you could try pickle.dumps(big_data) or pickle.dumps(list(big_data)).Note that then a copy of big_data (unless it's a generator) will be constructed in memory and then written to a file. It's impossible to update a file inside an existing ZipFile archive without extracting it and then zipping again.  
According to docs, You could use:to add someFileToBeAdded.txt to existing someZipFile.zip file. If someZipFile.zip doesn't exist, it will be created.
