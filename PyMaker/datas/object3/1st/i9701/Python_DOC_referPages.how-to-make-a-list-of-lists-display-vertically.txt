So I have a list L.How would I go about to make it look like this.I want this to be able to iterate.I think the best way would be nested for loops, but I am confused on where to begin.EDIT***I managed to make something that resembles what I want to do.Output:As of right now how would I format it to
Solutions are not so elegant, too much code...Output:So 3rd line is not that obvious, i will break it downUPDATETo lengthen the spaces you need to provide keyword argument sep to print function: for i in output: print(*i, sep= '  ')
assuming you are just trying to print it in that format, how about this code: it only works for this specific case, where L = [[1],[2,3],[3,4,5]] but it prints the desired output.
