I am trying to list valid hosts for given network range via Python3, ipaddress module but I am getting ValueError ValueError('%s has host bits set' % self)while trying to list all valid hosts.
As stated in documentation:A ValueError is raised if address does not represent a valid IPv4 or  IPv6 address, or if the network has host bits set.The number after slash(16 in your case) means, number of bits reserved for subnet, so last 16 bits are your host bits. This method requires those bits as 0 (unset).
You have another option.From the document mentioned above, we can see that:If strict is True and host bits are set in the supplied address, then  ValueError is raised. Otherwise, the host bits are masked out to  determine the appropriate network address.So, please try following again.
