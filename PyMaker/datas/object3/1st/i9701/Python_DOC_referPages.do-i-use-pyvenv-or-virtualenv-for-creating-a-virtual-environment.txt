Some guides mentions pyvenv (pyvenv not pyenv) when talking about virtual environments such as the official Python tutorial. Others mentions virtualenv such as in the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python. I've tried pyvenv and I think that it worked as you can see:and these are the contents of ve directory:So can pyvenv be used to create virtual environment? Does virtualenv do the same as pyvenv? Which one should better be used?
They are very much alike. The main difference is that virtualenv has been around for a long time, and can be used in most setups.pyvenv, on the other hand, was designed for Python3, and ships with the standard library since version 3.4.In other words, virtualenv is the classic choice, while pyvenv is a recent addition to the standard library. I suppose pyvenv will eventually replace virtualenv (as soon as Python 3 replaces Python 2 :P)
pyvenv is basically a wrapper around venv module which is part of standard library since Python 3.3 and is the recommended way of creating virtual enviromnents since then. And actually pyvenv wrapper is not so recommended. On Python >= 3.3 consider using venv module directly as described in linked docs. Older Python versions should use virtualenv to create virtual environments.
Use pipenv a tool that unifies pip and virtualenv in a way similar to npm. You can use it to install and manage both your virtualenvs and your dependencies.
