I have a list of items:and a csv file:I am trying to see for each item in the list if it matches the first column of the csv, and if it does, append a '1' to the end of the row (otherwise appending a '0'), but I am a bit lost. The code below is pretty much what I'm trying to get the end result to be.I am very new to python and would really appreciate any help! Thanks
I tried below code, which will store result in CSVOUTPUT in CSV
Perhaps something like this. It'll read from the csv, count how many times each fruit is found in your list, then overwrite the csv file with the new data.
Note that your csv file is rather a plain text file. But also a valid csv, so I'll treat it like one.Read line by line and print 0 or 1 alongside the data using a ternary expression. Quick & easy, no dictionary or counters needed and preserves the order:since it's not really a csv, basic line by line read will do too:note that in both examples I have used a set, not a list. Makes a difference speed-wise when there are a lot of items.
You can easily achieve this using the csv module in the Python standard library, specifically the csv.reader() method. After achieving this, it seems from your question that you want to write a csv file containing this data, so we'll iterate through our dict and write to a csv file using the csv.writer() method.:
