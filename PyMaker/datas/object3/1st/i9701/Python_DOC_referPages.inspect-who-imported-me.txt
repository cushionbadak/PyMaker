There are two files:And:When executed with Python 2.7:When executed with Python 3.5:What is that weird thing <frozen importlib._bootstrap> all about?  What happened with import and/or inspect that changed this behaviour?   How can we get that Python 2 filename introspection working again on Python 3?
In Python 3.1 and newer the import machinery is implemented in Python, which makes it possible to access its call stack. To illustrate this, I'll put the following codeto the_imported.py and import it.On Python 2 that code printsBut on Python 3 the output is much more verbose:Before Python 3.3, these lines were also included in tracebacks.To achieve the desired result you could walk up the call stack to find the first frame, the file name of which doesn't start with <frozen importlib.
There's just more on the stack in Python 3.  importlib is now responsible for importing:Output:You could do something like:Output:
