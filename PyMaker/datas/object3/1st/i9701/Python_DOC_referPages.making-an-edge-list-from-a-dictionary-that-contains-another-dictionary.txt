I have a dictionary that looks like:Essentially, a dictionary with keys and values, and the values itself are in another dictionary.How would I made the keys and values into an edge listI want each edge to be like:For every key in the dictionary, the edges it's connected to are its values in the dictionary.Thanks.

Considering you have a dictionary and the value for each key is a set you can try this:However, the order that you require could not be exactly the same since dictionaries and sets are not sorted data structures. If order matters, you can use the following code:I really hope this helps.
While it is not clear to me the exact edge cases you are looking for, as an alternative to @double_j's result, you can perform an itertools.product on the keys and values.This approach finds the Cartesian product of two iterables: 1) the keys and 2) a set of unique values in the main dictionary.
