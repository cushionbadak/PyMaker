I know the question is not very precise, and that is because I have no idea what is going on either. I have narrowed down the problem to a couple of lines, but to me the execution seems rather weird.Obviously I changed the variable names so it's clear what I'm doing.The problem is, when I call the function loadmaze(maze), it never  returns a maze with walls. Somehow the test and maze values are always identical. I do not understand how this can be as the maze with walls is assigned to maze after test, which at that point does not have walls. According to the debug, test also contains the walls after the third line has been executed.Please help, I'm terribly confused.
As @stephan said, the variables test and maze refer to the same objects in the memory. So I changed maze = placewalls(test,"x") with maze = placewalls(createmaze(10,10),"x"), thus creating a new object different from maze. This then results in test and maze being two different mazes.
