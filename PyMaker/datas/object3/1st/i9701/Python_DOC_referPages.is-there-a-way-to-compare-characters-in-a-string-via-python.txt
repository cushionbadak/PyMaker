Natural Text
I am wondering if there is a way that I can compare the first letter of the string to the second; then the third to the forth ... etc.At the moment I have this:It works but is there a more efficient way of doing it?
You can use zip to pair up the elementsMore on this usage of zip here
Create a range of every second character in the string. Iterate over the range and compare character at the index i with the following.Edit: If your string length is an odd number you run into an out of range exception. I let you figure that one out by yourself :)
