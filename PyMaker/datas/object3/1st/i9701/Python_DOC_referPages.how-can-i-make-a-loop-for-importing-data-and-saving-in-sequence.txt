I have a xls file and the first column consist of many rows for example Then I want to pass each cell (the value of it) to a function So each time the value of one cell will go to the function Then I want to pass the output of it to another function this is how if i do it manually. I want to avoid doing it manually 
You can construct the filename using str.format, Format String Syntax You can use enumerate while iterating over the sheet's rows to help construct the filename.If you only want to iterate over the first column.Or you can access the cel values directly.Once you have extracted a cel's value you can pass it to any function/method - similar to passing the cel value to the str.format method.To automate processing the cel values, add your process to the loop.
I don't have comment privileges to ask for clarification, so I'm going to answer this best I can and hopefully you can clarify if I'm going in the wrong direction.From what you wrote, I'm assuming that you have some column, 'MN' and you want to name a bunch of files starting from 'MN001.pdb' all the way to 'MN0xx.pdb' (where xx is the last row you're working with.One way you can achieve this is by working with a loop that has a counter and iterates with each iteration of your second for loop.
