I need to build a list of dictionaries which is resulted from for loop with if statement, where each dictionary key is the same. How can I do it? Thanks in advancethe result of list after for loop should look like:
The logic is all there, but I don't think you are adding items to the right object.dict.update updates the dictionary that you've created.  And by "updates", it will join the two dictionaries together.  If the key already exists, it will update that key with the given value.  If not, it will create a new key with that value.  So, you are constantly updating your dict variable, not the list. To add values to the end of a list, you should use append.What this will do is, for each iteration of the loop, create a new dictionary.  If item is 0, we will write item.value to a given key.  Otherwise, we write it to a different key.  I'm assuming that in your actual code, the two keys are different.  If they aren't, then this if/else block is pointless.After this, we append it to the end of the list.List ComprehensionThis could also be done in one line with list comprehension if you want:If i==0, the first dictionary will be placed in the list, otherwise, the second one will be.
You need to change dict.update to list.append to get the result.Actually, using list comprehensions would make it more clear:If you want to generate different dict according to the value of item, you can write this:  
You have to first convert your list to a set. Because if you dont it, it will append the same dictionary again and again in the list. Which is kind of pointless.Output:And if you want your key to be same in all conditions then why are you using if else condition? You can simply do this:
