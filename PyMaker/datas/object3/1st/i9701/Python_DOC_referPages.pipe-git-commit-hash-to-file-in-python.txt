Natural Text
I'm trying to write to file the commit hash via Python. So I did:  But this wrote the following to file:I would like just:How may I do that?
That's just a byte string. All you need to do is decode it before writing it:r.strip() was called to remove the trailing '\n', you can alternatively do r[:-1].decode() if you prefer that.Also, as @torek notes, it is best to open files using the with statement which automatically closes it for you.So:
In Python 3, subprocess.check_output returns bytes objects, not str strings:By default, this function will return the data as encoded bytes. The actual encoding of the output data may depend on the command being invoked, so the decoding to text will often need to be handled at the application level.However, if you're confident you'll be getting data in your platform's default encoding (safe enough, here), you can set the parameter universal_newlines to True:If universal_newlines is True, these file objects will be opened as text streams in universal newlines mode using the encoding returned by locale.getpreferredencoding(False).This will also handle common whitespace annoyances like end-of-line characters (as the name implies).Here's a function that returns Git's output as a string, using universal_newlines:And here is an example of writing that string to a file:This uses the with open(...): syntax that was suggested in comments, and also in The Python Tutorial.  It's (unfortunately) well-hidden, appearing at the end of section 7.2.1. Methods of File Objects.
