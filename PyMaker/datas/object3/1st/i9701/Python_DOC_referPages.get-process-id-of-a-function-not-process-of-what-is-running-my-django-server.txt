I am currently using psutil to do......In an attempt to kill the process of one function (that I thought I was getting the pid of with):...Though this kills my entire manage.py runserver command and I have to restart the server.Does anyone know what I can do here?
Functions do not have a process ID independent of the VM. Your question is meaningless.
As Ignacio said, my question didn't make sense: "Functions do not have a process ID independent of the VM"Though to answer the essence of my question: "how can i stop the execution of a function (infinite while loop) from outside of that function?" We check a flag, e.g. a value set in a database. Helped by a kind stranger in #python in freenode
