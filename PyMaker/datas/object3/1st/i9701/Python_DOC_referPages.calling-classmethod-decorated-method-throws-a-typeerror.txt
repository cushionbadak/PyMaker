I am trying to figure out difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod. The latter is passed a cls instance.When I tried to call the @classmethod, it is giving me an error. How should I call a @classmethod (to_c() and to_f()) decorated method in REPL?Here is the REPL callsHere is the class, TemperatureConverter
Problem: You trying to access the temperature property from the class and expecting the same result as an instance, in this case an int value of 41.  However, attributes are called differently in instances and classes. Compare the __get__ method for each:  DescriptionHere is more information on the signature of the __get__  method and a SO post on how descriptors work.  In this case, the signature is could be seen as C.__get__(self, inst, cls).  In short, when getting from a property, unlike an instance calls, calls from a class passes None for the instance argument.As shown above, the property object is returned if bound to the class:   Can we still "get" the value from the property object?  Let us call __get__ on the property object:The latter shows it is possible to get the property value while bound to a class.  While it may be tempting to implement the __get__ method on cls.temperature inside your class method, you still need to pass in an instance (e.g. i) to access the value of the property.  Instances are not accessible in a class method.  Therefore, we see why the property object is returned in your code, which is trying to multiply with an int and raises the error you observe. This is one explanation for your problem, in particular describing why you cannot access your property value cls.temperature within a class method.
