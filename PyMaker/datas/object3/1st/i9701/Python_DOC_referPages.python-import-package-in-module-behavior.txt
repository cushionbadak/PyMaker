I have a behavioral question about Python. Coming from the C background, I understand that modules are not the same as header files. Here are two scripts:Module1.pyDriver.pyThe behavior I expected at first was for urllib to be imported along with module1 inside the driver. However, this is not the behavior that I am experiencing. Is it correct to putOr does that cause urllib to be imported twice?I read in the documentation that the I can do something likebut that seems to be too much writing
The behavior I expected at first was for urllib to be imported along with module1 inside the driver.Why should it? You've imported urllib inside the namespace (module dictionary) of module1 and not in that of Driver.urllib is imported but, in module1, try:and see that no NameErrors are raised, urllib is there.does that cause urllib to be imported twice?No, Python will see urllib has already been imported (by peeking inside sys.modules) and just create an entry for urllib in the namespace or Driver.
