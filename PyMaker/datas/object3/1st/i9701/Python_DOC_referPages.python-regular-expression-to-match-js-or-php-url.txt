I tried to match js and php url with python rebut expression below doesn't work, anyone can help me?Also, some Web pages use //, not http or https. Is there any way to match those, too?
You seem to want to match URLs that end with file extensions js and php, that may start with http, https or //.UseSee the Python demoDetails:(?:\bhttps?:)? - an optional sequence of \b - a leading word boundaryhttps?: - http, 1 or 0 (=optional) s, and a :// - a literal char sequence //\S* -  zero or more non-whitespace symbols\. - a dot(?:js|php) - js or php literal char sequences\b - a trailing word boundary
