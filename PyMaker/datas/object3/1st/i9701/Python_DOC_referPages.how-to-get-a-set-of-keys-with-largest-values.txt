I am working on a functionDescription of the function is: The first parameter is the dictionary of word counts and the second is  a positive integer N. This function should update the dictionary so  that it includes the most common (highest frequency words). At most N  words should be included in the dictionary. If including all words  with some word count would result in a dictionary with more than N  words, then none of the words with that word count should be included.  (i.e., in the case of a tie for the N+1st most common word, omit all  of the words in the tie.)So I know that I need to get the N items with the highest values but I am not sure how to do that. I also know that once I get N items that if there are any duplicate values that I need to pop them out. For example, given thenshould modify k so that it becomes {'a':5}.
my algorithm as below1st build tuple list from dictionary sorted based on value fromlargest to smallestcheck for if item[N-1] match item[N] value, if yes, drop item[N-1](index start from 0, so -1 there)finally, convert the slice of tuple list up to N element back todict, may change to use OrderedDict here if wanna retain the items orderit will just return the dictionary as it is if the dictionary length is less than NOP wanna modify input dictionary within function and return None, it can be modified as below
Here's my algorithm for this problem.Extract the data from the dictionary into a list and sort it in descending order on the dictionary values.Clear the original dictionary.Group the sorted data into groups that have the same value.Re-populate the dictionary with the all (key, value) pairs from each group in the sorted list if that will keep the total dictionary size <= N. If adding a group would make the total dictionary size > N, then return.The grouping operation can be easily done using the standard itertools.groupby function.To perform the sorting and grouping we need an appropriate key function, as described in the groupby, list and sorted docs. Since we need the second item of each tuple we could useorbut it's more efficient to use operator.itemgetter.output
