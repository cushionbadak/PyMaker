Natural Text
I know how to parse between two lines, when the start "target word" and the end "target word" are differente.g. if I want to parse between X and Y:I'm stuck on a slightly different question, where the word I want to parse between is the same word. i.e. in this example, there are 4 different homolog groups, and i want to extract the human/mouse pairs in each homolog group, so I want to turn this file:Into a Homo_sapiens/Mus musculus comparison like this:I don't have almost-successful code to show, this is an example of what I've tried (and I've also tried regular expressions and splitting the line on the word "HomoloGene"):Thanks
The commented code below produces the result in your example. To understand it you may want to read the following:Regular expressions and tutorialUnpacking argument listsdefaultdictitertools.productThe Code:
Its a two part problem. First you extact the homology groups into a dictionary, then you iterate through the groups and print the pairs.Hope this helps.
