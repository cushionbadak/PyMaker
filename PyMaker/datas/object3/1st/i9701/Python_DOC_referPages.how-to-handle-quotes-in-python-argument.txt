I'm using Argparse in python3.5. one of my required parameters is a long string that may has any character like single or double quotes. I don't want to limit user how uses this python script and force him to remove this characters. so I'm looking for a solution to handle quotes in my code.It's my argument parser:This type of argument fails with Unrecognized error:And sometimes without any error:I want to know reason of second type errors and solution for handle errors in my code without any attention to argument.
This isn't an argparse issue.  It's a matter of how the shell splits the input line, and passes it to Python.  Look at sys.argv to see what argparse has to work with.I believe backslash allows you to include quotes and other special characters in the strings - but experiement.From the side bar:Python argparse argument with quotes
