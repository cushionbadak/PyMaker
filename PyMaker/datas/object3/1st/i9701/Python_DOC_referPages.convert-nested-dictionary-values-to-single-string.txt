How can I convert the below nested dictionary values to a single string ?Output should be P1 L1, P2 L2Here is my current code: Is this a efficient way for a larger set to items in people dict ? If not how to improve this  ?
You can make your expression a bit short by only looping over just values and using named field in format string(Emphasis is to keep it more readable):In Python 3.2+ this can also be done using str.format_map:If the keys fname or lname might be missing from the dicts then you could do something like this:If number of values are huge then replace values() with itervalues(). In Python 3 use values() only.Dicts don't have any specified order, so you cannot expect the output to be P1 L1, P2 L2 here.
Your data structure is recursive so you'll need a recursive function to obtain them
or
I hope this what you are looking for.
