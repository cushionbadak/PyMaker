Alright, lets suppose I have a class called Tab and that class has a method that takes in keys and values of dictionaries and and makes it into a huge dictionary.Now if i were to have a function and a dictionaryAnd if I were to run this it would run fine, but if I did this,It would crash. I know I can fix this by converting the object back into a dictionary, but i need the type to be the Tab class(the one i defined earlier).How can I do this?
To make a Tab instance behave like a dictionary, you can override __getitem__(self, item), __setitem__(self, key, value) and __repr__(self) methods within Tab class:The output(sequentially):
Why you overcomplicate things? Why not inherit dict object, and using update method.Or even better to inherit UserDict from collections module.And it's better to pass obj in read_table function.
