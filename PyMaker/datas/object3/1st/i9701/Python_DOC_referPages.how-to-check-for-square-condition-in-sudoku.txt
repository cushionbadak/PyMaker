Questions you asked:1. How to check for squares?2. How to reduce the size of the conditions?3. How to generate random numbers?4. How to make a GUI version?Answers.1. and 2.First, one simple way to check these kind of conditions is:Depending on the case you have to construct my_list differently:get the list for the rowget the list for the columnget the list for the squareHere I used 2 important features:list comprehensionlist slicingMake sure to understand them as they are really useful.3.You may use the function randint4.There are many ways to do it and I don't have enough experience to tell you about. Personally I liked a lot this tutorial. It might be useful, if you want to program a simple game with GUI. Before starting a project with GUI, my advice is to learn classes.
