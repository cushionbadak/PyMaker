Once finished it would say out of index/range. How would I get it to say ran out of numbers instead of an error?I think it's called error handling.
You can handle errors using try and exceptReplacing Exception with the one you are receiving
The stack trace tells you what exception to catchSo add a try/except blockBut please go through some of the excellent python tutorials out there. This will be a painful way to learn the language!
Without modifying your code, you can raise a custom exception message and then break to avoid the infinite loop:   
Rather than while, I would use for.
Your loop condition is always true, therefore it prints each element 0-4, then tries to print the 6th element, which does not exist - thus an out of index/range error.Try using a "for" loop instead.  Psuedocode: for x in numbers print(numbers[x])
Use try..except. Instead of 0 == 0, you can just use True:
