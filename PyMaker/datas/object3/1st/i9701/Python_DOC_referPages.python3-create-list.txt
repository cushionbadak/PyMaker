How can I convert it to this list:For example list[0] is ['Sum', 'Qo'D', 'tob', "'e'", 'SoH']or list[0][0] is Sum.
if:Do that with a oneliner (using a listcomp):result:Edit: Jim suggested an alternative using map, which makes sense here since we don't need a lambda to provide to map (we already can use str.split):(list is required because python 3 map returns an iterator)
