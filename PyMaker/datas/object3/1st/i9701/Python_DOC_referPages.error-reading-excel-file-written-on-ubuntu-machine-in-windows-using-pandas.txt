I am using Pandas for data analysis. In one of the programs, I had to write an Excel sheet and I accomplished using pd.to_excel(). This was executed on an Ubuntu machine.Now I was trying to read the written excel file on a Windows machine. I am using pd.read_excel().I am getting the following error:The source is:I can vouch that the file is present as I have opened it and checked.Why is the file name changed to x07c1.xlsx in the error message? How would I avoid this problem?
The error you are getting is due to how Windows normally expects file paths to look (with the \) versus how Ubuntu expects them (with /).Your path, as written, has escape sequences, specifically a \t (tab) and \a (BEL). The second one is why you see \x07c1.xlsx. The \x07 is the ASCII representation of BEL. If you look closely at the path you'll also notice a hidden tab character as well. This can be seen when there is only one slash instead of two:You can fix this by doing a one of a couple different things. The easiest, is to make the path a raw string. Do this by putting an r in front of your string:This reads the string literally as it exists. One note: A raw string can not end with a single backslash.Another option is to escape your backslashes by making each backslash into two:This works, but requires that you perform this step every time you use the path.A final option is to use forward slashes. Windows can handle forward slashes just fine, it's just not the standard convention of the operating systemPersonally, I'd go with the raw string. It's a single character and the path doesn't "look weird" to you or other developers.
