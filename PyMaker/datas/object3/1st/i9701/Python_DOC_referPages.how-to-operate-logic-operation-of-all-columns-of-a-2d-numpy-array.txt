Let's say I have the following 2D NumPy array consisting of four rows and three columns:What would be an efficient way to generate a 1D array that contains the logic or of all columns (like [True, False])?I searched the web and found someone referring to sum(axis=) to calculate the sum. I wonder if there is some similar way for logic operation?
Yes, there is. Use any:Note what happens when you change the argument axis to 1:If you want logical-and use all:Also note that if you leave out the axis keyword argument, it works across every element:
NumPy has also a reduce function which is similar to Python's reduce. It's possible to use it with NumPy's logical operations. For example:  It also has the axis parameter:The idea of reduce is that it cumulatively applies a function (in our case logical_or or logical_and) to each row or column.
