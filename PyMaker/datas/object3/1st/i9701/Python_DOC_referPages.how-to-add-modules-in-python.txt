In Java, we have a main class who calls the classes and methods when needs. I'm trying to build a Python app with the same style: main file and few .py files with extra functionality.I can import those files usingWhat if I want to put all those files into a lib folder? I want to build a package for PyPI with my app.

First, place a __init__.py in the directory the modules are in. Then - if your directory's name is lib - import your file like below from your main file.
Place all Python files into your lib directory then also add a file called __init__.py in that directory. This file is to be left empty.Create a directory: mkdir libCreate an empty file in this directory: touch __init__.pyCreate the other modules you want to include in your package in thissame directoryIn your shell (e.g. bash) add lib to your $PYTHONPATH:export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/lib"import all modules in lib: Be sure to be one directory level above lib, then: >>> from lib import *
