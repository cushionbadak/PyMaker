Is there an existing package to do the above so that 3D objects can be created through a GUI and exported to mesh for use in Python packages?The link here contains the procedure for exporting the mesh:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Advanced_Tutorials/Python_Scripting/Export_scriptsThanks in advance for any help!
Yes it is called blender. Using python you can tell blender to render a specific frame, you can also tell it to render a viewport preview using opengl. A python script can be generated on the fly and given as a cli argument for blender to run without using a GUI, this answer provides an example of passing arguments from the cli to be used within the script inside blender, the subprocess module can be used as a cli equivalent. There is also an option to build blender as a python module that can be imported in any python interpreter.To manually render a live 3D view of your model within your app you could use one of several modules that provides opengl support in python to draw the surface, such as PyOpenGL or pyglet
