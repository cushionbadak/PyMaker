Disclaimer: I don't have any Idea about c languageI am trying to make this thing work:https://github.com/berdario/resumable-urlretrievehere is the function:How should I provide the filename?I am seeing for the first time colon in the argument.
Union here has nothing to do with C or the kind of unions found in C. It just means that you can provide either a str or a Path for the filename argument... whatever a Path is in this context.
