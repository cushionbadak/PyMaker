This question already has an answer here:How to iterate through two lists in parallel?                    8 answers                I have a list of keys and a list of values, I want to fill a dictionary so like:However, I get the following error:
You want the zip function to make a generator of tuples of values from each of a number of inputs:That said, you could skip the rigmarole of writing your own loop and let the dict constructor do the work; it can take an iterable of key/value pairs to initialize itself, and avoid the Python level loop entirely:or if mydict is an existing non-empty dict, use the update method, which accepts the same arguments as the constructor:Side-note: I renamed your variable to mydict, because shadowing built-in names like dict is a terrible, terrible idea.
Use zip:for key, value in zip(listKeys, listValues): dict[key] = value
Iterate through two lists simultaneously using zip :
