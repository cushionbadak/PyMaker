More specifically, the last column of my table contains just dates. The most recent date is at the top of the column, and this date sometimes reoccurs in lower rows. I am trying to write an if loop to see: if that date occurs somewhere else in the table, capture it and the corresponding data in its row.Here is my relevant code:The last few lines of code are my attempts at searching and capturing future occurrences of '5/20'. But even those fail. I need to verify if '5/20' occurs again in the table, and if it does then I need all the data from that row, and if it doesn't then end. Here is the HTML code:Screenshot of entire data table
I'd find all table rows and use max() function with a custom key function to determine the "latest" record. The custom function would find the inner cell with the date inside and convert it to the datetime.date() in order to compare dates with one another:The code is probably missing error-handling and should be further improved, but it works on the provided sample data, prints:Note that this would only find the row with the maximum date. If you want to take it further - find all rows with this date:
