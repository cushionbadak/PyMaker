I have a list of positions, like this:I also have a string, for example this one:And I want to put each character of the string in the order of the list of positions, in a matrix (where position[0] is the line and position[1] is the column),like this:How do i do this?
You can use these functions to achieve that:zip() to form tuples of elements in s and afilter() to separate characters of line 1 and line 2sorted() to sort the characters of each lineOutput:
There is also the option of using a couple of list comprenhension and a zip function.Wich results in result ="WOEL\nHLLOR"
It can also be done like this:This zips the string with the list which is then sorted by the list element then the column is removed and the items are groupbyed their row and the each of the letters in each groups is joined after removing their row and then the groups are joined as lines.which prints:I don't know where the second E disappeared to.
Here is another way less elegant than the previous ones from my coleages, much more "wordy", but maybe more accesible to you (you said you were new to python).I hope it helps you.
