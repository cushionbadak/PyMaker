1) that's not a .csv file.2) in python, you cannot concatenate integers with strings without prior conversion.3) doing this: Home+str(House) would be legal, but when you want to read back your file you have to separate both fields (you provided no way of separating them)Here's a code which would create a real csv file:when you compose your row, you can put any data you want, the csv module will convert it to string if needed.BTW to read it back, use a csv.reader and iterate through the rows. Since you know the datatype, you can convert 2nd column to int directly.
You can not concatenate an integer with a string, use the following to convert the int to string:
Python variables have types.  So you are trying to add 5 to the 'House' which is not defined application.  To make this work you have to convert number 5 to string '5'.  As ettanany suggest useAlso,  note that it's  '\n' not '/n'
