Hello I am pretty new to python. I have the following problem: I want to write a script that, given a (dna) sequence with ambiguities, writes all possible sequences, (if there are less than 100,  if there are more than 100 possible sequences, an appropriate error message is printed)For DNA nucleotide ambiguities: http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.htmlExample: for the sequence “AYGH” the script’s output would be “ACGA”, “ACGC”, “ACGT”, “ATGA”, “ATGC”, and “ATGT”. A, C, G and T are the default nucleotides. ALL others can have different values (see link). So i wrote this: when I test my function: possible_sequences ('ATRY-C')i got: but i should have get: Can somebody please help me? I understand that I have to recap the and write a second poss_seq when there is an ambiguity present but I don't know how... 
You can use itertools.product to generate the possibilities:Output:In above we first iterate over the items in the given sequence and get the list of possible nucleotides for each item: Then the iterable is unpacked as arguments given to product which will return the cartesian product:Finally each one of the products is turned to a string with join:Note that possible_sequences returns a generator instead of constructing all the possible sequences at once so you can easily stop the iteration whenever you want instead of having to wait every sequence to be generated.
