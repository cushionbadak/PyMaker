I get message Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault when I'm working with my code. My program calls C module with defined struct.Definition of structDefinitions of moduleSimply, my object gets initialised by function fromString - when I'm using constructor like this:(init function)Program throws error on g.order().What am I doing wrong? This code worked in plain C, when I moved it to Python, it crashes on every method called after constructor...
Your struct is missing the PyObject_HEAD macro:After expansion this eventually (among other things) also hold a pointer to the type, the fact that you're missing this probably causes this whole thing to blow up.
