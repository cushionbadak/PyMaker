I have two inputs lists a and b and a function which takes two inputs, let's sayHow do I use map() for this setup? I triedand got TypeError: f() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)It makes sense because I need to unpack the zipped input. How can I do that?
map doesn't unpack the iterables as your function argument, but instead as a more general way for dealing with such problems you can use starmap() function from itertools module which should be used instead of map() when argument parameters are already grouped in tuples from a single iterable:Here is an example:As another option your can just pass the iterables to map separately without zipping them.Also as a more pythonic way for multiplying two variable you can use operator.mul() instead of creating a custom function:Here is the benchmark:
You could use a lambda function to handle this situation where: I know this is an old post but probably will help somebody else in future.PD: Sorry any typo I'm from my phone.
