I'm comparing a dictionary LIVE_DEPARTURES_DATA of ferry departures to determine if they have the same DEPARTURE TIME and DEPARTURE PORT. As I loop through it and do the relevant checks I noticed the order of the items is changed.The output is the following - why has the order changed?UPDATE:I've updated to Python 3.7 and run my code. My initial order is kept.
Dictionaries are defined as unordered key-value pairs. So, you can't rely on their ordering. If you want the order to be stable, use collections.OrderedDict
