Natural Text
I am new to Python. I am running following simple web server:Unfortunately i get following error:Please suggest what i am doing wrong. thanks.
You can't use print() to write to binary files. print() converts arguments to str() before writing to a text file object.From the print() function documentation:Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. [...]All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end.Bold emphasis mine. Note that the file object must be a text stream, not a binary stream.Either write to a TextIOWrapper() object wrapping your BytesIO() object, call .write() on the BytesIO() object to write bytes objects directly, or write to a StringIO() object and encode the resulting string value at the end.
