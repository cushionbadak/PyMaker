I have 2 data frames: normal,cancerand now I have a for loop to read them:  which means I want to read these 2 data by line at one time in a for loop.  How can I accomplish this?
Firstly, should cancer() be cancer? Is it a function?You could try doing a for lineNum, line in enumerate(normal) and then accessing cancer like cancer[lineNum]
