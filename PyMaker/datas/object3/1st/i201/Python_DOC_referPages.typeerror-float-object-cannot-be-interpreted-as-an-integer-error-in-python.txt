I am brand new to Python and programming. I am trying to code a simple GAN to use Keras datasets (see hyperlink to tutorial below). I am receiving two warnings followed by an error: Any help would be much appreciated. Details:Python 3.7.1, Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6. I am using IDLE for the Python code and running the program through the terminal.

The problem comes from the line x_train.shape[0] / batch_size.By default, in the newer versions of python3, the / operator performs floating point division instead of div.If you want the result to be an integer, you should instead use the // operator, which behaves like div:x_train.shape[0] // batch_size.
