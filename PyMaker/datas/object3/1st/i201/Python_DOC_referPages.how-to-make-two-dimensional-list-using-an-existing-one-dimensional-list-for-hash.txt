Natural Text
I have a list of integers like: [10, 20, 50, 30] and I want to count the occurrence of these integers in another list.For example if 10 in the first list comes twice in the second list with rest of the integers occuring only once, then the output must be: [[10:2], [20:1], [50:1], [30:]]I tried with the below code but I'm getting an error: AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'extend'. What am I doing wrong ?I am trying to achieve a sort of hash map, please share any better approach you may have. Thank you!
A Counter object is ideally suited for the task.
You can use both Dictionary comprehension in Python:You can also use Python collection Counter like this:References:List and Dictionary Comprehension in Python - hereCounter object documentation - here Good Luck!
