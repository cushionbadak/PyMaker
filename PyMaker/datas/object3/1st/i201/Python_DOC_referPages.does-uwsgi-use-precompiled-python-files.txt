I am using uWSGI to deploy my WSGI application. Are the Python file compiled for every request, or are they precompiled once? I don't see any .pyc files.
Python caches modules bytecode - directly in the same location for python2.x, under a __pycache__ subfolder for python3 - but scripts (the difference is in usage - if you import it it's a module, if you execute it it's a script) are always recompiled (which is why main scripts are usually very very short an simple).IOW, your main wsgi  script will be recompiled once for each new server process. Typically a wsgi app is served as a long running process which will handle much more than one single request, so even then the initial compilation overhead is really not an issue (short script + only compiled once per process)...Also, once a Python process is started, imported modules are cached in memory so they are only really imported (loaded) once per process. Just note that the user under which the process is running must have write permissions on your app's directory in order to create the .pyc files... and of course read permissions on the .pyc files too.
If you're using CPython then by default, no it does not compile every time a request is received unless you manually configure it to do this. By the first request, the uWSGI will load the python scripts bytecode and will  reload it in 2 different scenarios I know of:There is a new import that has not been loaded before (only the new module will be parsed and converted to bytecode).You explicitly ran service uwsgi restart Yet, there is still a way to keep reloading python scripts in every request by suppressing it by the interpreter, example: python -B my_amazing_view.pyFor more details check here:What is pycacheShould I generate .pyc
