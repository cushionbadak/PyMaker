I have a list of duration times formatted like this:I tried such grouping:where x is any element from the list, because I want a time() format from it:But when there is no match, the code breaks.Is there a solution to fill unmatched search with zero (for example) or another attempt would be easier?I've found such method, but I couldn't apply it to my case:How to ignore unmatched group in a string in re python?
Use Match.groups:
This solution provides tuples that include None for missing elements:Output:The regular expression reads as follows:([0-9]+H)? <-- This will match the 1 or more digits followed by a literal H, but the entire term is optional because it is followed by a ?.
