I am automating a process where I supposed to run the Linux commands like ls, truncate etc.Well, I got stuck with truncate command where I take input from user and want to truncate an image. truncate command will be I have below peace of code running:However, it is may seem very silly for experts but for me as beginner and new to python not sure why getting error like:Well, now is there way to do above execution with other implementation in python or suggest me way to convert the both variables to same type. ( with typecasting if any). 
You need to concatenate first parameter into string with shell=True:Note:str(size) -  converting into string" ".join - concatenating into shell-commandBut you can:Choose yourself what is suited for your needs.Read  Security Consideration before using shell=True
use subprocess.call(["truncate", "--size",str(size),str(image)] ,shell=True)OR size= str(input('Please enter the size of the new image, in terms of Total Bytes =')).strip()image= str(input("Enter the image file name =").strip()
Instead of writing the command like thisYou can first create the command and store it in a variable likeThen use this command variable in the subprocess.call method.Moreover give the absolute path of the image
