This question already has an answer here:How to count the frequency of the elements in a list?                    26 answers                I have a list [2,3,0,3]And want to generate a list The reasoning is that 1 zero appears, no one appears, 1 two appears and 2 threes appear in the input list.Is there a non for loopy procedural way to do this in python?
You can use collections.Counter which finds count of elements:An alternate way avoiding loops:
You could probably use the following code:At first, we find out all the unique elements of the list, by using a set object, which stores unique elements only. Then we traverse through the list and use the count method to get the counts of each element, which are sorted in order.
Another solution with count:
If you want to avoid for keyword at any price, then you might use map instead, following way:This solution assumes that a contains solely non-negative integers and is not empty list.
