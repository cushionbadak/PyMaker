My code puts all of he users entered items into a a listI want it to stop when 0 is entered and follow the other commans such as sorting the list, deleting the highest and lowest values and then finding the average of themHere is the Code so far:
You do not need i and you do not want packages that weight less the 0. You might want to consider using float instead of int - where I live we measure kg for packages or g for letters - both will be taken including fractions ( 1.235kg or 5.28g).If someone inputs "22kg" any number conversion will crash - you should guard against it:Output:If you want to remove only 1 maximal and 1 minimal value from the sorted list you can simplyfy it:Doku:pop() dokutry: catch: error handling
if you want your code to stop(appending sizes to your list and continue with the commands after the repetitive procedure ) when 0 is entered, you have to do the opposite action.While the statement is false, the code continues from the  sortedsizes = sorted(sizes) command.
