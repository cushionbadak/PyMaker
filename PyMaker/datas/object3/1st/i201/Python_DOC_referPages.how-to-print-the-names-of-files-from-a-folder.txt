I'm trying to print the names of all the files from a folder directory. I have a folder called "a", and in that folder there are 3 NC files, lets call them "b","c","d", whose directory I want to print. How would I do this?For example, given my path to the folder is I want to print the directories to all the files in the folder "a", so the result should print:So far, I've tried But that doesn't seem to be right.
I think you're looking for this:
You can have a list of file names in a folder using listdir().
You made a couple mistakes. You were using os.path.basename, that only returns the name of the file or folder represented at the end of a path after the last file separator. Instead, use os.path.abspath to get the full path of any file.The other mistake was one of using the wrong variable inside the loop (print(os.path.basename(path) instead of using the variable a)Also, dont forget to use os.listdir to list the files inside the folder before looping.
