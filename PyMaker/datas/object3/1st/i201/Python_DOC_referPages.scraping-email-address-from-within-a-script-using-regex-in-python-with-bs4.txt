Natural Text
I'm trying to scrape the email address from a website where the email is nested within a script, and a simple "find/findAll + .text" isn't doing the trick.source html:<script>EMLink('com','aol','mikemhnam','<div class="emailgraphic"><img style="position: relative; top: 3px;" src="https://www.naylornetwork.com/EMailProtector/text-gif.aspx?sx=com&nx=mikemhnam&dx=aol&size=9&color=034af3&underline=yes" border=0></div>','pcoc.officialbuyersguide.net Inquiry','onClick=\'$.get("TrackLinkClick", { LinkType: "Email", LinkValue: "mikemhnam@aol.com", MDSID: "CPC-1210", AdListingID: "" });\'')</script><br/>My current approach was to try a "findAll +" regex expression like so:but in jupyter this is only returning a [] :/Is there an issue with the regex expression or a simpler way to try to tease out the email here?
Although regex may be more robust over time, in my experience these parts of scripts tags remain pretty constant so consider a plan B of using split
It appears that you aren't using the right findall method. You need to import re and then use the findall() method, not the findAll() method (note the case difference of the letter "A"). The function's interface is:For details, see this section of the re doc on finding all adverbs.
