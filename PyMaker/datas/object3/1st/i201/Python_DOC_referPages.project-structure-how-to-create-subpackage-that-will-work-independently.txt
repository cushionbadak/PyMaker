Python 3.6+, directory structure:main.py:  submain.py:config.py:it throws error:We use couple gitsubmodule in our project and for now it works with:but I'm sure it's wrong solution cause it's already require in some folder/folder/folder create relative import like that ...config or ../../../config.I already spent week to find how to do it that subpackage can work independently(from config import config_param), any help, links appreciate, thanks
try to add __init__.py files in your dirs https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
One solution that should work :Add __init__.py in the subpackage,Add the subpackage directory in PYTHONPATH, you can also do it with :sys.path.append(PATH_TO_THE_SUBPACKAGE) .The package is now part of the PYTHONPATH, so you can import it like any other libraries with import config.
