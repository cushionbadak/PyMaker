I have this code that is supposed to connect to wifi using a given ESSID and password. Here is the code:At first, I got an error message that network was not installed. This was fixed by simply using pip to install network. After I ran this again, it told me that network has no attribute WLAN. How do I fix this? What am I doing wrong?
You are trying to run code designed for the MicroPython language, and it won't work on CPython (the Python version you'd download from Python.org or find installed on most PCs and servers).MicroPython is designed to run on embeddable specialist hardware, and comes with its own library to support the hardware it is running on, including a network module:To use this module, a MicroPython variant/build with network capabilities must be installed. Network drivers for specific hardware are available within this module and are used to configure hardware network interface(s).It tells you so in the comments at the top:The code can't run on 'regular' CPython. You installed the PyPI network project, which is a very different module, originally designed to help learn coding for the Raspberry PI.What project could work depends on your operating system (OS). Different OSes use different programming interfaces to let programs change networks. Most have command line tools to let you do this, which should be easy to drive from Python with the subprocess module:Windows has the netsh command, run netsh wlan connect name=... to connect to a network interfaceMac OS X has the networksetup command, networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 ... connects you to a given WIFI network.
