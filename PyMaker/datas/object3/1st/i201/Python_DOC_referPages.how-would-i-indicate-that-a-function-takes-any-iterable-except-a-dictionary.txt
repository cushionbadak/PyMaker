I have a function that will accept an Iterable[int], but I don't want dictionaries to be accepted. I have another method to handle it. How do I indicate that in the type hint?def unpack(iterable_to_unpack : Iterable[int]):Would sequence be more appropriate?def unpack(sequence_to_unpack : Sequence[int]):From the definition of iterable, it would seem like it.An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of  iterables include all sequence types (such as list, str, and tuple)  and some non-sequence types like dict, file objects..
Does this help? From the docs:
