I am trying to convert the value of a dictionary to a 1d array using:np.asarray(dict.values()), but when I tried to print the shape of the output array, I have problem.My array looks like this:but the output of array.shape is:by which I was expecting (27,1) or (27,)after I changed the code to np.asarray(dict.values()).flatten(),the output of array.shape became I have read the document of numpy.ndarray.shape, but can't get a hint why the outputs are like these. Can someone explain it to me? Thx
This must be python 3.From docsThe objects returned by dict.keys(), dict.values() and dict.items()  are view objects. They provide a dynamic view on the dictionaryâ€™s  entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view  reflects these changes.The issue is that dict.values() is only returning a dynamic view of the data in dictionary's values, Leading to the behaviour you see.Notice that the numpy array isn't resolving the view object into the actual integers, but rather just coercing the view into an array with dtype = objectTo avoid this issue, consume the view to get a list, as follows:
