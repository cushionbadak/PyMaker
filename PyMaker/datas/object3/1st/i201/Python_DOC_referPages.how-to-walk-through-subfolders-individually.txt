Natural Text
Actually I have a folder (data in below picture) which contains 2 subfolders and each subfolder includes some .png files. I need to have loop through each subfolder and do some coding on each image file in that subfolder and save the result. I have used os.walk() and os.listdir() and glob.glob() but none of them worked.  One of many codes that I have tried is same as below:enter image description hereAny suggestion would be highly appreciated. 
Something like this with os.walk:That has a bit of pseudocode:fname_meets_my_criteria is a substitute for a comparison, it needs this if you want to filter the files for processing - it could be something like fname.edswith('.txt') or not fname.endswith('.cfg')new_file_path is the path and name for a new file that the processed data would be written to.If you intend to overwrite the files after they have been processed use this instead:In both of my examples, the files were opened as Text files.  If you need to process bytes instead of test/strings open the files with mode arguments of 'rb' or 'wb'
I'd suggest using pathlib library. The library is an “Object-oriented filesystem paths” module which combines the best of Python’s file system modules like os, os.path, and glob.This will give you a list of all .png paths in subfolders of data.
You can use listdir()like that:
I could find my answer! It was pretty simple but I made a mistake in naming. So, the code is written below maybe help others with same issue:
