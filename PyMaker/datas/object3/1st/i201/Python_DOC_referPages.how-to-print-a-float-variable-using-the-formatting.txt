Natural Text
I'm using Python 3.7.1 on Windows.When I print a float variable using the % formatting. only the natural part is printed.Here is an example:This gives the following result:But what I actually want is:How do I prevent the print() function from practically deleting the decimal numbers?How to round the number to four decimal digitsThanks in advance!
As you try print float number, use %f instead of %d.This code will print the number to 4 decimal places:
A better alternative than % formatting would be to use .format.For rounding use roundBut if you feel comfortable with % formatting then to print whole number use %sFor rounding to 4 digits use %1.4f
You are using "old-style" formatting and used %d as the placeholder. This will represent your number as a decimal number without any fractions. If you want to display floating point numbers, the placeholder is simply %f.If you want to use the variable's string representation, you can also always just use %s. But since you are on python 3.7, there are some more modern approaches as well."old-style" formatting: "%s" % var"new-style" formatting using format(): "{}".format(var) (Read up on python formatters for details)f-strings, which are basically syntactic sugar for format()-based string interpolation. You prefix with f and put the variables in the string literal itself: f"{var}"
There are several options to evaluate expressions and print them as a string in python. There are already some good answers, but here are some explicit examples and links to the documentation.Formatted string literals (f-strings)f-strings allow you to input expressions which are evaluated at run-time. In the f strings expressions are encased by curly brackets.As an example:prints My value is: 42.222222222.and with specifying the format:prints My value is: 42.22.Str formatting methodStrings have a built-in .format() method where you can specify replacement fields with curly brackets.As an example:prints My value is: 42.222222222.and with string formatting:prints My value is: 42.22.String formatting operatorString formatting operatorAs an example:prints My value is: 42.222222222.and with string formatting:prints My value is: 42.22.See @Felk answer for some more qualitive descriptions of the different methods.
