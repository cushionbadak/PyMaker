i am new to python,and below is the code which is suppose to send mail to multiple receipent but only dipeshyog94@gmail.com is getting a mail. milanthapa898@gmail.com which is second on To and alexlee94@gmail.com which is on cc is no getting the maili am stuck in this couldn't send the mail to multiple users.any help will be greatly appreciated!thanks in advance 
The information in the headers doesn't control where the message actually goes.  The second argument to sendmail is the only place where this is controlled.  This value should be a list, not a comma-separated string.You'll notice that you could also add addresses which are neither in To: or Cc: (or a number of other headers which serve the same purpose) to effectively implement Bcc:Maybe also look at send_message which saves you from having to separately convert your message to a string you can pass to sendmail.
Here owner_emp_id_email is a string.Make it a list of email ids. Then it would work.
>>> help(smtplib)to_addrs: A list of addresses to send this mail to. A bare string will be treated as a list with 1 address.You need to convert your CSV string to a list like mentioned in the the other answer. With this answer I just wanted to demonstrate how can we use the python's amazing help function when stuck.
