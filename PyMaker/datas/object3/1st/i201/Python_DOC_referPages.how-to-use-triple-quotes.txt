Add an r to your stringThis tells python to use the string a raw literal, not using backslashes as escape characters
The problem comes from unwanted escaping of new line characters due to antislashes at the end of some lines.Simply declare a raw string by prefixing your string by r, and it will fix the problem.
The error comes due to a backslash character in the string which is used for printing escape sequence characters(\n, \t, \, etc.). Use raw string for printing a backslash character on the screen, something like:
The problem is because some of your lines end with the Python escape character: \.The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.String and Bytes literalsWhen a line ends with a backslash, it tells Python that the line is continued on the next line.To counter this, you either want to 'double up' your backslashes to escape your escape characters:Or mark your string with an r to mark it as a raw string.Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters.String and Bytes literals
