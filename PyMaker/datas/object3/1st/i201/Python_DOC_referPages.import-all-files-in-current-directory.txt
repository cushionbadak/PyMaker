I have just started a python project. The directory structure is as follows:You can also check the Github repository.In each of the sub folders under algorithms, in the __init__ file I am including the following for all the files one by one:And so on.The task that I am trying to achieve is running all tests together using the query:Each file in the tests directory starts as follows:Right now if I want to add a new file to the linkedlist directory, I create the file and then add another from .filename import * in the __init__ file. How do I write a script in the __init__ file so that each time I create a new file, I do not have to manually insert the import command? 
So the __init__ is in the same folder? As the docs say The import statement is syntactic sugar for the __import__ function. So we can use:Some reasons why this does not work:You want to load the functions in the module - the import * from syntax. With this code you can only run file1.test.  You run the script loading from another directory, which confuses glob. We have to specify the actual working directory. __import__ prefers to know the module name. To find the solution I combine the import * from function from this answer with pkgutil.walk_packages from this blog.
