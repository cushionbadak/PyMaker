Environment: I'm using conda 4.6.7 on a Mac with High Sierra.I got some legacy Python code, and first of all I'd like to run it. Of course, since this is research code, I didn't expect to find "fancy stuff (!!)" such as a test suite, but I was hoping that at least a requirements.txt file would be provided. Pipe dream. After GREPping the list of imports across the various files composing the project, I came up with the following list of packages to be installed:I put all of them in a single call to conda, because, according to https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commandsyou should Install all the programs that you want in this environment at the  same time. Installing 1 program at a time can lead to dependency  conflicts.(btw, is there a way to include a line break in the command, or does it have to be that long?)However, conda is giving me the error:This seems weird to me, because at least some of them are very common. These are the packages in my conda environment:How can I solve the above problem?
Most of those packages (e.g. math, random, itertools....) are part of the python standard library, so should be available with any standard installation of python (even if they don't show up in the output of conda list). Conda therefore does not install these separately or have them in its package lists. Other issues with your attempt are with the names of packages. For instance, you are trying to install scikit-image, but using the  shortform name skimage (which is used once it is installed for import, e.g. import skimage). If you use conda install scikit-image, conda will find it.
Try to do this via a shell script. Go to the folder where your requirements.txt is located thenotherwise you dont necessarily have to use conda - just go to the environmentfor standard and some more ... packages
