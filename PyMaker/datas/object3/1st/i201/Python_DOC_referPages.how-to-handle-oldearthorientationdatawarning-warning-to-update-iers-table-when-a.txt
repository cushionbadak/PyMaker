With one of the modules I'm currently using (astroplan) it has to download a IERS table in order for the timings in it's Observer objects to be accurate. (I'm using it to workout sunrise/sunset times etc). Problem is after 14 days or so, the table becomes out-of-date and a new one needs to be downloaded. Once the table is out-of-date an OldEarthOrientationDataWarning warning is raised when the module is imported. What I'd like to do, is detect if the warning is raised, and update the table if there is a warning.Normally the module is imported using:I know how to update the table manually using:I also know that Python has a warnings module, from which I think the catch_warnings function is what I need to be using. There are quite a few examples on how to get code to ignore deprecation warnings, but I don't want to hide the warning. I just can't seem to get my head around how to lay it out to get it to do what I want. I'm using Python 3, and need the code to work on UNIX machines. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
I think I've sorted it myself. I'll post the code below in case someone else ever wants to do the same thing.
