Natural Text
I have a list that contains directories and filenames that I want to open, read a paragraph from and save that paragraph to a list.The problem is that I don't know how to "filter" the paragraph out from the files and insert into my list.My code so far.The format of the file I'm trying to read from. The text between the  paragraph start and the new paragraph is what I'm looking forWhen I run the code I get all the lines from the files as expected. 
You need to learn how your imported text is structured. How are the paragraphs segregated? does it look like '\n\n', could you split your text file on '\n\n' and return the index of the paragraph you want?The other option, as someone else mentioned is Regular Expression aka RegEx, which you can import using RegEx is used to find patterns in text.Go to https://pythex.org/ and grab a sample of one of the documents and experiment findingthe pattern that will match with the paragraph you want to find.Learn more about RegEx herehttps://regexone.com/references/python
Solved my problem with string slicing.Basically, I just scan each line for a start String and an end String and makes lines out of that. These lines then get appended to a list and written into a file.But I still have "## Required reading" in my list and in my file so I run a second read/write method.
