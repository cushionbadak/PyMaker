In my main file of my Python3 project, I want to display dotted definition path of imported class as string.My imported class:Is named WoodCuting and is located in constants/dimensions.py.What I want:Dotted definition path of imported class as a string - constants.dimensions.WoodCuting.What I tried:str(type(WoodCuting)) returns constants.dimensions.WoodCuting - which is exactly what I want. However it is not reliable solution.Any Ideas?
You can do this with the object's __module__ and __qualname__ attributes.Using __qualname__ rather than __name__ means you get the correct result for nested objects.Say this class is in the module:
Assuming WoodCuting is located in constants/dimensions.py:returns constants.dimensions.WoodCuting.
Try this
