I'm looking for more info on this kind of syntaxfunction_name[data type]I don't know what this is called so I hope someone here can point me in the right direction. I'm used to this kind of syntax with referencing values in list and dictionaries but not so much for function definitions.I came across this when following PyQt5 tutorials, specifically this onehttp://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/widgets/which contains this lineFrom the Qt5 documentation I can see that this is the definition of the signal functionhttps://doc.qt.io/qt-5.11/qabstractslider.html#signalsThanks,
When coding Qt in C++, you can subscribe to signals using slots with different signatures, using a C++ technique called method overloading. Qt will call the right slot based on the argument type of the changed value. The Qt documentation on slots uses an overloaded display() slot definition as an example:and connecting display to a signal that can send int values on changes would connect to the first one of these.Python, on the other hand, doesn't have such a concept. Python is dynamically typed, function definitions don't include type information.So the PyQT wrapper around QT lets you define what type of argument to expect by using Python's subscription syntax on the signal, the same syntax you'd use to address indices and slices in lists or keys in dictionaries. Using this you can connect your slot to a specific 'variant' of a signal. Signals are not methods in this scenario, they are custom wrapper objects that support subscription instead, and the result of that signal[type] is a more specific signal object, one you can then connect to or disconnect from and the slot will only ever be called for that specific type.For your example, the QAbstractSlider.valueChanged` signal comes in just one variant, one that emits an integer:so in Python you'd bind that variant via valueChanged[int]. If a signal takes no arguments, you can use signal directly, no subscription required; e.g. sliderPressed. In fact, you can use any signal that way, but then a default is picked if there are multiple overloads; you may want to check the .signal attribute in that case to see which one is going to be used.See the Signals and Slots documentation in the PyQT5 manual:A bound signal has connect(), disconnect() and emit() methods that implement the associated functionality. It also has a signal attribute that is the signature of the signal that would be returned by Qtâ€™s SIGNAL() macro.A signal may be overloaded, ie. a signal with a particular name may support more than one signature. A signal may be indexed with a signature in order to select the one required. [...]If a signal is overloaded then it will have a default that will be used if no index is given.
