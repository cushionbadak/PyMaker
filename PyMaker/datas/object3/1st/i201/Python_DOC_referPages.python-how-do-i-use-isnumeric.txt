This question already has an answer here:AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'isnumeric'                    1 answer                How do I check if a string is a number (float)?                    32 answers                Can someone kindly explain why the following throws an exception? And what should I do with variable s to find out whether it contains a number?When I read Python documentation it seems to me the above should work. See:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=isnumeric#str.isnumericBut what I get is:"AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'isnumeric'"Any help is most appreciated. Thank you!
replace isnumeric() with isdigit() as
for python 2 isdigit() and for python 3 isnumeric()python 2python 3
Try using replace with isdigit:
You are obviously using python 2, so a such method does not exist. That said, the most pythonic way would be to try to convert it
