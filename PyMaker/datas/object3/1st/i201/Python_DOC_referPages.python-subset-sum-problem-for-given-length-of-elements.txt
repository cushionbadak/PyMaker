For given set, and sum, and length of elements, I want to get the boolean value whether the set satisfy the conditionFor example...How can I solve the problem if there is a given length constraint?(I can solve it easily if there is no length condition:subset-sum-problem)
If you're allowed to use imported modules, itertools has a combinations function that can make this quite easy:If you need it to be a recursive function, consider that for each element X in the set, if you can find a subset of N-1 elements in the subsequent elements that total sum-X, you have a solution for sum/length=N.For example:
Use itertools.combinations:
