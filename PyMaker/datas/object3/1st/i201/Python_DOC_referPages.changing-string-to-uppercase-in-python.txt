I' trying to change my variable to uppercase and I don't know what I'm getting wrong.  Sample code: When I run the above code, time is returned instead of TIME.
Method upper() does not change the value of variable, it only returns a string where all characters are in upper case.So, you may print it directly:or change first and then print:
In Python str.upper() returns a copy of the string with upper case values, and does not mutate the original string. In fact, strings in Python are immutable anyways.Try: Quacks = Quacks.upper()Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html"str.upper() - Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [...] converted to uppercase."
