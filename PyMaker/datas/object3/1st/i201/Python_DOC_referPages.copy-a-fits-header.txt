This question already has an answer here:How can I create a copy of an object in Python?                    4 answers                Say I read a FITS fileAnd I want to make a copy of its header so I can modify the copy without changing the original headerHowever, this also modifies cube.header. How would I go about to make an actual copy of the header, rather than creating a new pointer to the header?header_copy = ?
The Header class from astropy.io.fits has a copy function.Then header_copy is an actual copy of the object, rather than a pointer towards cube.header
