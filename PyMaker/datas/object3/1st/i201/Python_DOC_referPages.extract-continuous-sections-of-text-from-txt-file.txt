Natural Text
I have a text file that has continuous sections of questions and answers. For example:I want to extract the questions and answers from the text file, and put them in a csv file with two columns (Questions and Answers), where the questions and answers go into their respective columns.This is the code I have now (still rudimentary):But this prints out only the first instance of the Answer. What do I do?This is an example of the file:This is a screenshot of part of the file:This is an example of the question and answer format in the text file:
I think using the full question text as a key dictionary is not needed. Then you need to know it in advance to recover the answers.You could use two separate lists or dictionaries, one for questions, one for answers. If you use lists, just be sure that question and corresponding answers are at the same index. If you use dictionaries, use the same key (could just be a progressive number) in each dicitionary for the question and the corresponding answer.Here an example with two dictionaries:questions[1] is the first question, answers[1] is the corresponding answer.EDIT after comments and edit of questionAfter seeing the screenshot and reading the comments, I think you do not have any new lines between answers and questions.I've edited my answer. I use regex to search for "Q1", "Q2" at the beginning of a line to identify a new question, and do not make any assuptions on presence / absence of empty lines (if present, they are skipped).
Let's assume your text file as:Now to create a dictionary we can do:I am also assuming that each question is followed by it's answer. If not this might need some update
