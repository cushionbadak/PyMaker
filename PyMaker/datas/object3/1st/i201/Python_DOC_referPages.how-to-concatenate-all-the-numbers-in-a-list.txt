Natural Text
For clarification, I don't just only want a random letter word. I need the random numbers in my code later on also.   I made the following code which gives a random 7 letter word.Here is the code:-My question is there any better way to concatenate the word using the random numbers? 
You can achieve concatenation in a single for loop. Try Below Code:
Is how i would make a random string
There are many different ways to solve this and also improve your code. You should definitely checkout str.join and list comprehensions. If you want to stick to your original code as much as possible, how about this basic solution:
You've tagged your question Python2.7. If you can use Python3 instead, you can use random.choices to make things rather simple:If you're stuck in Python2, you can implement a (simplistic) random.choices thus:
this is a way:ascii_lowercase is just 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; i select a random entry from that and join the single letters with str.join....actually random.choice is better suited for that. see this answer.
