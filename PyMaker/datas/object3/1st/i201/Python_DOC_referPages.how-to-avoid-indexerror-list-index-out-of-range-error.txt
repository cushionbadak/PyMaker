Suppose there are a list called 'my_list' and an int variable called 'list_index'. Basically, the list 'my_list' might change over time and hence the 'list_index' might raise 'IndexError: list index out of range'. However, I just want to make record when this error occurs since it is not that important. To avoid this error, my basic solutions currently are:Except for try/except statement, are there other solutions to avoid the 'IndexError: list index out of range' error?
You can use a try-except.
What we can do in this scenario is we know a possible error can happen, so we encapsulate the statements where the error is prone to happen inside try and we add an except block with an error type where we define what the program should do if it encounters that error.The general syntax for it is,So here the error you are mentioning is IndexError which catches the out of index exception in runtime. So a neat and pythonic way to do it is as follows.
