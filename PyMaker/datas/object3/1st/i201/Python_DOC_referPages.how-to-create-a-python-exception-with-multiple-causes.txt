How do I raise a python exception with multiple causes, similar to Java's addSuppressed() feature? For example I have list of multiple methods to try and if none of them work I want to raise an exception that includes the exceptions from all the methods that were tried. I.e.:But this code fails because the raise ... from ... statement expects a single exception and not a list. Python 2 or 3 solutions are acceptable. All back traces and exception messages must be preserved.
Use logging insteadIf using the logging module is acceptable for you, I guess it would be the cleanest to log the individual exceptions you caught and only raise a single overall exception.If you only want to output the log-messages in case all tried functions error, this is an ideal case for the buffered logger from the  logging cookbookYou could modify it to always log at debug level, but raise the level to error, if all subfunctions raise an error.
Just pass the exceptions as arguments when creating the last exception.They will be available en the args attribute.
