Natural Text
I want to read a table from a query script in my computer.I found the command to be simple: The first issue, has to do with encoding: So we do what we do, search for an answer to add argument into command open(sql_file, encoding='utf8') and execute the query. And now the error is more tricky:That is to not be reading the file correctly.  Upon inspection I found that there is \ufeff at the beginning of the file and that the line breaks \n are not being translated.  Does anyone know how to go about it? 
I had a similar issue while trying to parse an XML file that had special unicode characters.  What I found as a viable workaround was just reading the file as a string, then using the string.replace() method.  Something along this line:text_query = r"\ufeff + "actual SQL code"text_query = text_query.replace(r'\ufeff', '').replace(r'\n', '')
