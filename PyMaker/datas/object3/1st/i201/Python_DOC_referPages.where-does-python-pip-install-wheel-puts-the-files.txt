I just wanted to know...where does the command puts its files?  i just need to check some script.I am no Python expert and I just wanted to check on something.let me know if this is a duplicate question..sorry if my question is a bit basic.
Library files will install to the site-packages directory, and the location of this directory depends on your Python installation. You can check it with stdlib sysconfig module:Some wheels might also install some scripts into the bin subdir.  You can also find this location using sysconfig:
Try the show command:pip show sample.whlIt will show the location of where it was installed.
