I want to generate a list of ternary numbers of length l and save into a dictionary. Then I want the ability to compare these numbers digit by digit and do modifications too.For example if the length l=2, the dictionary should contain numbers: 00,01,02,10,11,12,20,21,22.Then I want to do operations like comparing the ith digit of the jth entry in the dictionary with the kth digit of the lth entry. Like in the above list, comparing "0" of the entry "20" with "1" of the entry "21"Also I should be able to sum up the digits of the ith entry of the dictionary. Like sum of the entry "11" = 2.Please suggest me a way to do the above things. I am new to coding in python.Here is my try but this doesn't give me 2 digit numbers. So a suggestion for how to go to tens place from ones place and so on, would be appreciated:
itertools.product seems to give you what you're looking for. It's often used in place of nested for loops, but has a convenient repeat kwarg that makes your life easier here.This produces a generator (note: not a list!) that produces all the values you're looking for from (0, 0, 0) to (2, 2, 2). To make a list, simply cast it to one.Then to compare digits, just use indexing like any 2D list.If you want to specifically output (0, 0, 0) as 000, you can write a function for that:then loop over your digits and print each:
