I have this code:Basically I am using a program called gromacs. As you can see I am combining stdout and stderr so I can then just use stdout.read() and be able to get everything.However, the print(output) is a mess and it has no format:b'                      :-) GROMACS - gmx grompp, 2018.3 (-:\n\n                            GROMACS is written by:\n     Emile Apol      Rossen Apostolov      Paul Bauer     Herman J.C.

I hope I have made myself clear.
I think you can do what you want by adding the following line before printing the output:Calling decode() will turn the bytes into a python string (str), and the splitlines() turns that into a list-of-strings.decode() is bytes method that decodes them into a string assuming they've been encoded in utf-8 (by default) â€” it's not documented in the subprocessing documentation (that I know of).
