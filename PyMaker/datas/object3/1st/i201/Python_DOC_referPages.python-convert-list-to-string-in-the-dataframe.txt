Natural Text
I have bunch of list and string like texts in the cell value of the pandas data frame. I am trying to convert list to string, I am able to convert list to string, but its splitting the string as well. How do I only apply this logic if the cell contains list [] in the particular column?Data Need output like this: But the code below is splitting string cell values too.
