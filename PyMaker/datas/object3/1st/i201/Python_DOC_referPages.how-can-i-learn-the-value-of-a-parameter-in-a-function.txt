I am new in pyspark , I have a script as below ;and the output is ;After that I have function that is ;Than I have this RDDMy problem is to able to understand how run this function I wrote I received error that is;But it is running under “def filterDuplicates(userRatings):” function without any problem , please let me know how can I learn the value of “joinedRatings[1] “ ?
please let me know how can I learn the value of “joinedRatings[1] “ ?Use either first:first()Return the first element in this RDD.or take with __getitem__:take(num)Take the first num elements of the RDD.
Based on the code above (which is not easy to read) I'm guessing the userRatings is an array while joinedRatings is a PipelinedRDD. It seems PipelinedRDD objects cannot be accessed using an index. e.g. [1]. That's not too surprising. Objects can support accessing them by index but they have to deliberately implement that feature. The vast majority do not as it typically does not make sense for them.A convenient feature of Python, especially for those new to it, is its build in debugger.You can add this line to your source code and debug through it. That'll let you play with/examine the joinedRatings object. For more info seehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html
