I have a pandas data frame with 100 columns and I want to create a dictionary for each column with the first column as key and I've been doing it manually. Let me explain with a sample dataframeID     a     b     c123    jon   foo   bar789    pan   bam   fan278    car   bike  boatLet's consider the above table with column names ID, a, b, c. Now I am trying to create dictionaries for every column with ID being the key of the dictionary. something like belowdicta = {ID: a} dictb = {ID: b} dictc = {ID: c}What I am doing currently is:dicta_ = dict(zip(df['ID'], df['a'])) dicta = {k:v for k,v in dicta_.items()}dictb_ = dict(zip(df['ID'], df['b'])) dictb = {k:v for k,v in dictb_.items()}dictc_ = dict(zip(df['ID'], df['c'])) dictc = {k:v for k,v in dictc_.items()}and the above code is fetching me the desired result but I have to do it manually for all the 100 columns which is not the most efficient way to do it.I would really appreciate if I could get some help or suggestion to automate the process by writing a loop or function. Thanks in advance!
set_index then use df.to_dict():then call the column with the value:
