I'm trying to reproduce the code from this site: https://www.guru99.com/python-copy-file.htmlThe general idea is to copy a file using python. Although I can work my way around the errors, I also want to understand what I'm doing wrong in this case.If used with the full directory (main('C:\Users\test.txt')) The code returns the error AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'exists'. If I remove the line with path.exists() I get a similar error: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'realpath'.By using the filename main('test.txt') everything works, as long as the file is in the same folder as the python script that contains the function.So I tried reading the docs, which states for both path.exists() and path.realpath():Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.Since I'm running 3.7.1 I went foward to check what is a "path-like object":An object representing a file system path. A path-like object is either a str or bytes object representing a path, or an object implementing the os.PathLike protocol. An object that supports the os.PathLike protocol can be converted to a str or bytes file system path by calling the os.fspath() function; os.fsdecode() and os.fsencode() can be used to guarantee a str or bytes result instead, respectively. Introduced by PEP 519.From that, given that I provided a string, I take it should be working. So what I'm missing?
Your code:It works fine, but if you re-define a local variable named path, like this:This is just your code I guess, obviously this is a wrong example.I would recommend using the os.path after import os, because the path variable name is very common, it is easy to conflict.For a good example:
Type on shellAnd check result and value, maybe you redefine this import to a variable str.
