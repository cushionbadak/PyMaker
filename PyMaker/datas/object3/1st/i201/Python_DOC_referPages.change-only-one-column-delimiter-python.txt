This gets you what you want given the input:But something tells me that's not too useful/general.But anyway a solution to this kind of problem will probably involve these two string/list methods: split and replacehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splithttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replaceupdateSo if you need to use a spark RDD, you can first create the RDD using the list of strings (not yet a csv)There are several assumptions I'm making, because you only supplied one example row. These assumptions are about the existence of this double quoted string " ", which is the column with commas needing replacing.Further, I'm assuming there are no " in any of the other columns.I'm also assuming this column doesn't need those " in it after it is processed.explanationthe rdd method map will map a function onto each row in an RDD, and the lambda that the map takes returns the new row. So here I'm mapping this replacing chain of commands to each row in the RDD (and then in the example, I take one)
