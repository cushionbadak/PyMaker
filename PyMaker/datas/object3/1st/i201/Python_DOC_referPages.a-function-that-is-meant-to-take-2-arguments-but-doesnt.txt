Hey all I've got a very simple and probably stupid question to ask, i'm trying to write a function that will take in two arguments a potential key and the dictionary name and if the key isn't in the dictionary it should return something along the lines of "x" is an invalid key. This is what i have so far:Now when i run this code it says show_value takes 0 positional arguments but two were given but when i try to put in 2 arguments it says 'tuple' object is not callable. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated

Problems:Function definition does not match with function call. If you pass two parameters, there should be two at the receiving end also.i = () creates a tuple (does not need and replaces i value if you had passed it). Using (i)(..), you are trying to call a tuple object, which is not possible.Working code:
You need to add the function parameters so it can accept two values.Also, your else statement is not properly aligned with an if statement above. Good luck!
docs.python.org is a good place to go for questions like this. In your specific case I think this is the page you want.
Have a look at the tutorial that teaches about writing functions.
