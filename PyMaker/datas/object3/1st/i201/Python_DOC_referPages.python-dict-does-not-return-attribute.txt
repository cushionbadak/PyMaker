Natural Text
I am trying to get the attribute 'full_text' for a truncated tweet from the Tweepy library. I can get a dict that appears to contain that key. However, when I try has_attr to check for that key, or if I access that key, it appears to not exist. If I use PrettyPrinter, I get a printout of the object showing clearly that the 'full_text' attribute is in there. I'm unsure why it isn't picked up.First, the code:And here is the output I'm getting from a truncated tweet:You can see the 'full_text' attribute in there, you can see it is a dict and the length appears to be right, but any attempt at has_attr or accessing that element in the ._json dict behaves as though it doesn't exist. Any idea what is going wrong here?
Assuming tweet is effectively dictionary-like, then just try if 'full_text' in tweet. 'full_text' appears to be a dictionary key, which cannot be accessed like an attribute on the object itself. Here's a short demonstration The point is that an attribute and a dictionary key are not the same thing. Here are the attributes of that same dictionary:You will note that none of them is 'a'. On the other hand, 'a' is in the list of keys:When you type if 'a' in blah that's effectively saying if 'a' in blah.keys().
