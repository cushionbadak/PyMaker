For instance: If I am iterating through a Python list ['a','b','c'] how do I get back to element 'a' once I have reached 'c'?
If you mean to do a loop like if your list was in circle, simply use the modulo operator :
If by "get back to element 'a'" you mean to "cycle" back through the list, Then you can use itertools.cycleI used islice as it's the same as the builtin slice but for iterators as cycle will iterate forever otherwise. This will iterate through data 4 times.
