I'm trying to get 6 random generated numbers between 1 and 3600. But I want that the the individual numbers to have a minimum difference of at least 150. I already have created a function. I do receive my 6 random numbers but not the difference i expected. Where is my mistake? I can't figure it out. I'm very new to python. I tried different methods but I'm not able to find the solution for my problem.
Here is a way to do it, using the same principle of rejecting invalid times until we get all the ones we need:Using all makes the rejection logic a bit simpler, and using the abs of the difference lets us avoid treating two different cases.
The problem is you're only comparing the new number with the last number in the list. You need it to check it against all of the number in the list to get the result you want. Below is this, using a for loop:Note: There's probably a faster way to do this, and maybe already-built in function (see comment above with the suggestion of random.choice).
