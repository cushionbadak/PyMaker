I'm new to Python and could really use some help on this. I want to create a function to filter which files I want to open and which months and day specifically. That way, the users need to input which city(files) they want to analyze on which particular month or day. However, I want the user to be able to input something that is not case sensitive. For example, the user can input 'chicago'/'CHICAGO"/"ChIcAgO" and the it still give you the right output and not the error handling message. Here is the code I use:
Assuming all your city names are lowercase, you can use or .upper(), depending on how your csv is structured
Just use:And compare lowercase with lowercase
You can use inputSTR.lower() for that. It's an in built function for strings.
Use input().lower both while comparing and getting values
