First: I've read these:Issue with smtplib sending mail with unicode characters in Python 3.1Python - How to send utf-8 e-mail?Python 3 smtplib send with unicode charactersNow after reading these I know how to create and send utf8 mails. But I want to forward mails. My (simplified) code looks like this:What I get is this:My problem is: I don't know how the input mail is structured. I can't just encode it correctly. I would have to be prepared for all kinds of multipart possibilities. Any ideas?Note:works fine and includes the unicode characters as expected.
Okay. I found a hacky solution:Instead of the email.Message-based send_message I use the bytes-based sendmail.I would really prefer a solution based on a (Bytes-)Generator or other email tools from the Python standard library.
