It seems that a leading 0 in a number causes error in dataframes. Can anybody replicate?
A leading zero causes a number to be interpreted as octal. 9 is not a valid octal digit, hence the error.Note that in Python 3, octal literals (numbers with leading 0s) are flat-out disallowed to avoid confusion with bases and such. Instead, 0o must be used instead for octal literals.
