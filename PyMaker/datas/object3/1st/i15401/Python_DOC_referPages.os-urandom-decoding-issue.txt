Im trying to get a private_key so, I tried this:But it throws this error:So I check questions and solved that, in Python3x bytes can be only decode. Then I change it to:But now it throws this error:And I really didnt understand why. When I tried this after last error;It says AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'codecs'So I stuck, what can I do for fixing this? I heard this is working in Python 2x, but I need to use it in 3x.
Use binascii.hexlify. It works both in Python 2.x and Python 3.x.If you need a string object instead of a bytes object in Python 3.x, use decode():
In Python 3, bytes object has no .encode() method (to strengthen Unicode text vs. binary data (bytes) distinction).For bytes to bytes conversions, you could use codecs.encode() method:And in reverse:Note: there is no .decode() call because bytes returned by os.urandom has no character encoding (it is not a text, it is just a random sequence of bytes).codecs may use binascii.hexlify, binascii.unhexlify internally.
