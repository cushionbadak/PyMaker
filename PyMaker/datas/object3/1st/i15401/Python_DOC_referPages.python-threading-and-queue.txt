I really need a general question answered.  I have a script that uses threading right now to access 1000s of devices and get information from them.  I now have a requirement to get that information in the the same order everyday..  So I need to have information pull from my list and access these devices everyday in the same order.  I also have to get this information back in the same order.  I can disable threading to do this, but then the scrip takes hours to run.  What type of Queue can i use to keep threading but access these devices and write the in the same order every-time? Is this possible?
Are you sure you need to access the devices in the same order? In that case you can't use any concurrency by definition.Otherwise, the map method of the concurrent.futures module will work perfectly: it executes a sequence of tasks concurrently in a pool of N threads or processes and returns their results in the same sequence as they were provided.You can even try ProcessPoolExecutor instead of ThreadPoolExecutor (they're interchangable) to see if it improves performance further.There is an example that may help you: ProcessPoolExecutor Example (primes).A backport futures is available for old versions of Python.
