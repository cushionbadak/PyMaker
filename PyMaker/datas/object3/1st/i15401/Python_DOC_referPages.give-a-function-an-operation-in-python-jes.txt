It's not possible because the lexer does not make an allowance for it.Note that the defparameter is what you're looking at; it only takes a parameter and optionally a default assignment expression.  The parameter token is then only going to accept an identifier.Besides, even if you were to express something like this (which is closer, but still invalid syntax):beta is undefined until you actually enter the method.
Why not just implement the operation in the function statement?If you want a default value for the beta parameter, you can do that too:
