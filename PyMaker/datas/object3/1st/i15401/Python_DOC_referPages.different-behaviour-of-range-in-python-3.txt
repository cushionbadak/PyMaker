I can't find the answer as why this code for range loop, behaves OK in 2.7 and not in 3.4.output on 2.7 is: "you clicked at: 56 77 "  once I clickoutput on 3.4 is" "you clicked at:" once I click then, 56 77                   "you clicked at:Is it range behaving different or print?
In Python 2 print is a statement, and this:prints the tuple ("you clicked at:", p.getX() , p.getY()), which my default puts a space between each entry.In Python 3, print is a function and you are calling it with the arguments:As the documentation shows:print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Addendum:After some research on the GraphWin, it appears that you are using the Zelle Graphics library. Which has been updated once since 2011 to correct a small 2-to-3 issue, and some universities appear to be using a much older version.I didn't delve much deeper in but I think that there is going to be a few incompatibilities in the library so may not be able to do a straight switch to Python 3.
