I used to work on Linux Mint, and the latest version of Python 3 embedded in it is Python 3.4.  My program takes a hex string as input, decodes it and creates a bytearray so I can decode several information using struct.unpack. For example:Last week my computer crashed, so I had to build a new machine. I decided to give a try to Debian Wheezy. However, I discovered that the only version of Python is Python 2.7. I installed Python 3 using apt-get, but I noticed that the version installed is only Python 3.2. When I run the exact same code as above, I get a TypeError on the binascii.unhexlify line:I don't understand this error, what does it mean?I checked on Google but couldn't find anything: have there been any changes on binascii.unhexlify between the two versions? Do I have to change something in 3.2? I really don't see how to solve this... Maybe there is a better way to achieve that?Thanks. PS: I could go back to Linux Mint, or install Python 3.4 on Debian, but I think my production server is a fresh install of Debian, so with Python 3.2... so I'd better target that version (and I am glad I discovered it now!).
Yes, there was a change in behavior between versions.  From the binascii module documentation:Note: a2b_* functions accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters. Other functions only accept bytes-like objects (such as bytes, bytearray and other objects that support the buffer protocol).Changed in version 3.3: ASCII-only unicode strings are now accepted by the a2b_* functions.So if you want to target Python <3.3, you need to pass in either bytes or bytearray objects instead of strings.
