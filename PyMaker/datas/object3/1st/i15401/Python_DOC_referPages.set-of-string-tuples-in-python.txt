How could i find the the set of tuples of string? For example there is a list of [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'a'), ('c','d')]For me  ('a', 'b') is same to ('b', 'a') . Is there any function in python which can identify and remove one of them? 
Just sort your tuples:Demo:You could extend collections.MutableSet() (collections.abc.MutableSet in Python 3) to encapsulate that behaviour:Demo:
How about:?  Tested on CPython 3.4.
The answers so far do not preserve order at all, if that is important to you then use this:This keeps the order and you said you could remove one of the duplicates (which it keeps the last)Also the answers given so far also alter the elements:This will keep the elements the same
