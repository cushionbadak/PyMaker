This question already has an answer here:check if all elements in a list are identical                    24 answers                I am trying to compare elements of a list u for equality.A possible solution could be all(x == u[0] for x in u[1:]), or simply all(x == u[0] for x in u), but it looks rather weird.In Python, it's possible to write a == b == c, with its usual "mathematical" meaning. So I thought I could, with the help of the operator module, write operator.eq(*u). However, the eq function takes only two arguments. Of course, functools.reduce(operator.eq, u) is of no use here, since after the first test eq(u[0], u[1]), I get a boolean, and it will fail when doing the second test, eq(<bool>, u[2]).Is there a better way than the solution above? A more... "pythonic" way?
len(set(u)) == 1 is pretty Pythonic.
