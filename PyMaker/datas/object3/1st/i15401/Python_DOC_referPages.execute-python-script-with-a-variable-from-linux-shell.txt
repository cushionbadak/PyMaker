This might be an easy question but I don't know the name of what I'm trying to do, so I don't know how to search for it.Basically when I'm in terminal (linux command line) and I typeI want to get the stuff to mean something for my script. So two questions:How is this called?How can I do it?
The simplest way is for the do_something.py script to import sys and access the "stuff" command-line argument as sys.argv(1).  There are many fancier ways, of course.
What you're asking for is called argument parsing.To do this the proper way, you should definitively use argparse.It's a neat and yet very powerful library to make argument parsing more efficient. Plus, it makes your scripts manage arguments the proper Linux way, by default.Basic example:Then you can do cool stuff like:And what's even cooler, it provides an automatic --help (or -h) argument:This is the kind of library that allows you to quite easily do complicated stuff like:Here is a link to a nice tutorial from which the above example has been freely adapted.
