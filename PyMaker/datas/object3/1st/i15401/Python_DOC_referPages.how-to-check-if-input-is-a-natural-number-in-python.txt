Natural Text
Right now I'm trying to make a simple tic-tac-toe game, and while user chooses the sector of the board for their next move I need to check if the input is a single-digit natural number. I don't think just making a ['1','2','3'...'9'] list and calling an in statement for it is the most optimal thing. Could you suggest anything?
You can check if a string, x, is a single digit natural number by checking if the string contains digits and the integer equivalent of those digits is between 1 and 9, i.e.x.isdigit() and 1 <= int(x) <= 9Also, if x.isdigit() returns false, int(x) is never evaluated due to the expression using and (it is unnecessary as the result is already known) so you won't get an error if the string is not a digit.
Using len and str.isdigit:Alternative: using len and chained comparisons:
Why not just useChecking for membership in a small tuple you initialize once is very efficient, a tuple in particular over a set since it's optimized for small numbers of items. Using len and isdigit is overkill.
Following on console could help : 
I don't know why are people pushing this to next level.Simply for natural number you can write,And for the range issue:Obviously numbers lying within the range are natural numbers.
