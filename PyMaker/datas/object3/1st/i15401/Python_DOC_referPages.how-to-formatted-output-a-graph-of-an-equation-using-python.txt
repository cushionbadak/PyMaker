I am a beginner so I don't think I need to use anything complicated.Basically I have to print y=x^+3 for the rangex=0 to x=4 using formatted output and I don't know how.From what I have learned so far, I'm supposed to use formatted output, looping and variable width output to do this.Does anyone know how to do it? Thank you very much.
Check out the module matplotlib, it was made to give plotting visuals in python. I hope this helps a little.
may be i just have to print the line, is there any way to do this?Here is an example:The arguments to the format() method are substituted in place of the '{}' sequences, in order, from left to right.  You can also specify the order yourself:See more examples here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples
