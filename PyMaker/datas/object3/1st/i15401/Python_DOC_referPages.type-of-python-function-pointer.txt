For Python 3, it turned out as a good practise for me, to hint data types for function parameters and return types. For example:This works perfectly for all simple data types and classes. But now I need to use this with a "function pointer":What must be put at the ????? to make clear that a function pointer is required here? I tried function, because type(callback) is <class 'function'>, but the keyword function is not defined.
I would use types.FunctionType to represent a function:You could also use a string literal such as 'function', but it looks like you want an actual type object.
One approach may be to use collections.abc.Callable:This is intended for all objects that implement __call__. This is quite broad as it'll also be True for methods of instances or other objects that happen to implement __call__. But this may be what you intend - it depends on whether you only wish to accept functions or also other callable objects.
