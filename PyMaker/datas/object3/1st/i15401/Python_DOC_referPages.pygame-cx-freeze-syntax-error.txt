I have made a game using 2 python files and pygame, and I am trying to use cx_freeze to turn it into an .exe.Here are the 2 scripts:Move.py:And Enemy.py:I typed up the setup.py to compile the scripts:I typed in the proper Python console command, but I got an error:Can someone tell me what is wrong with my files?
You are using Python 3.2:and yet the nmovie.py file in the pygame package has Python 2.x syntax for print:print is a function in Python 3.x and needs to be called with parenthesis:This means that the version of pygame which you are using is for Python 2.x and is therefore incompatible with Python 3.x.  You need to do either one of two things:Rewrite your code in Python 2.x and then run setup.py with the Python 2.x executable.Use the Python 3.x version of pygame.  You can download it over on their website.
