Lets assume I've got a following python list(this is only example):I need to sort this list in ascending order by score and descending order by a username.Expected sort result:So, I could do something like this if I want everything to be in ascending order:For integers it is easy to solve this problem just adding - in front of it:Unfortunately, strings can not be negative :-|I need a generic solution that doesn't involve 'reverse=True'. Lambda function is dynamically generated based on a user config.Thoughts?
Your current solution will work fine if you set the reverse parameter of list.sort to True:This will sort the list in reverse order.Edit:Since the names and scores have two different sort orders, you will need to use two separate sorts to achieve your desired output:
The ord of a string can be negative:
you need to add the reverse=True keyword for descending order.
