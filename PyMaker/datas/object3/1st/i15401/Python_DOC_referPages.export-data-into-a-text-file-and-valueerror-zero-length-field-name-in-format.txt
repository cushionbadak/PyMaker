Natural Text
I am using this code to export my data into a text file(pl is a list of lists. nested lists have equal length. the columns in the file will be made from the elements of nested lists):But it gives this error:ValueError: zero length field name in formatHere is a small example of my parent list but instead of 3, I have 16 items in each list. as you see each item has 2 units which are separated by tab. the first unit would be the column names and 2nd one is corresponding value. in the text file, each nested list would be a row(2nd units of each pair)
You must be using an old version of Python; namely 2.6 or 3.0.  In these versions, you need to explicitly number the format fields for str.format:As with indexing, counting starts at 0.Note however that this is no longer necessary with modern Python.  Versions 2.7 and 3.1 or greater will automatically number the format fields for you.  For more information, see:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.1.html#other-language-changes
Well I told you in this question, error in writing a text file in python ; change it from 16 to 8 :Because we are going to put 8 items into string, as you see there are 8 items in format().And actually, doesnt matter which length of elements, what I mean this, even this one has 100 elements in it, it will going to place by format() method.For example this one, doesn't matter what is the length of this element, because its still an element in format() function, so format function will place this.
