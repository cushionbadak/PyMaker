I would like to loop through list of lists in the dictionary and delete certain lists based on a value in the list being equal to None. My code is below. Rather than deleting the list that meets the condition, it's always deleting the first list.My code:Output: Desired Output:
Never remove items from a sequence while iterating over it.  Doing so screws up Python's iteration protocol and often causes it to accidentally skip items.Instead, you can use a list comprehension and slice assignment:Demo:Unlike your current code, this will first build a new list which contains all of the items that we want to keep. Afterwards, it will transfer these items into the old list using slice assignment.The [:] makes this an in-place operation.  Meaning, the values['Results'] object is only modified, not replaced.  Had we done this instead:the code would still work, but the list would be replaced with the new one made from the comprehension.
