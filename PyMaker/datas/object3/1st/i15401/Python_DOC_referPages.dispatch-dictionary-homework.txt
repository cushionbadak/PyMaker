p.sthe results of of this code should be : How does the change to gfunc will affect this, i mean what will i will need to change in order for this to work if i do get a  func or i dont get  a func 
get_map_iterator() returns a function object (dispatch). You are trying to treat that object as if it was a dictionary.You want to call it instead:Your dispatch() function does not itself return another function object, so you'd not call whatever it() returns.Your has_more route then fails with:presumably because you meant to use the Next() function you defined, not the built-in next() function.However, even fixing that won't get you your output, because slist[0] != slist[1].It sounds as if you were trying to actually return a dictionary:This return value you would use like you did originally, by looking up the callable via a key, then calling it.
