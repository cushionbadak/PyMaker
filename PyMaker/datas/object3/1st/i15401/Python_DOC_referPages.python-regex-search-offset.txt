Natural Text
I am trying to search for a particular string in a line and print 10 characters after the string in the line.For example : I want to search for "ip=/" in the above line and get the next 15 characters.So effectively, i need "10.234.112.164," value.I have tried using re.search and .end() index. I'm not sure how to further get the data.
I think you want to get the IP address from the 'log?'.If you want to get IP,there must be error if you search for "ip=/" in the above line and get the next 15 characters,because IP is between 'x.x.x.x' and 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'.For example,If IP is 10.24.12.14,the result you get(the next 15 chars) is '10.24.12.14, po',do you want this?so you should make some modifications:
You could use capturing groups.() called capturing groups and {} called repitation quantifier. So .{15} repeats the previous token .(matches any character except line breaks) exactly 15 times.Code:ORPositive lookbehind assertion.(?<=ip=\/) called positive lookbehind which asserts that the match must be preceded by the string ip=/ . And the pattern .{15} matches exactly 15 characters.DEMOCode:
You can do this without regex by using partition:This just gets everything after the ip=/ and before the following comma, so it does not matter what the specific length or format of the ip address is (and if there is no ip=/, it will return an empty string).
