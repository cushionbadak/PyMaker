I'm constructing a dictionary (which I'll later make into a JSON string). I construct it like this:  How can I make that for loop one line?
You can use a dict comprehension:You might also use dict and a generator expression:But the dict comprehension will be faster.As for converting this into a JSON string, you can use json.dumps.
Actually in this specific case you don't even need a dictionary comprehension since you are using duplicate key/value pairs
