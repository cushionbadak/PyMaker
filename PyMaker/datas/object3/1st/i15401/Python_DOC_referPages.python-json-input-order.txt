This question already has an answer here:Can I get JSON to load into an OrderedDict?                    6 answers                I am attempting to read a JSON file containing data which I want to keep in order as it is a mathematical equation which can't change. I have tried using OrderedDict() however this doesn't work (or I can't get it to work).Here is the code I am using:Could anyone shine some light as to why this is not working?Kind regardsCraig
json.load will load the json data into a dictionary. You then convert this dictionary to an OrderedDict. Unfortunately, because it was a dictionary first the order could have already changed before it is "set" in the OrderedDict.To load the json directly into an OrderedDict you can use the keyword argument object_pairs_hook with OrderedDict. See the documentation for more details.
