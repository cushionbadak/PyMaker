Natural Text
I'm reading a .txt file to create a dictionary I've called irTable. It contains the Key which I'm referring to as a dId (device ID) and then 3 values, label, frequency, state.Now I'm reading and appending the dictionary fine, however I'm failing to understand a suitable method to re-write these changes to the .txt file line by line.My current code:Outputs this error:For reference, the formatting for my .txt file:So how can I write my 'new' dictionary to this file?
The file parameter of print expects an open file object as an argument.  You should be passing f instead of the name of the file:That, or you could use the write method of f:Note however that this will not add a newline like print.  You need to manually add it if you want one:Also, the f.close() line needs to be dedented one level.  Otherwise, you will close the file during the first iteration of the loop.  Of course, it would probably be best to just use a with-statement:This will automatically close the file for you when done.
