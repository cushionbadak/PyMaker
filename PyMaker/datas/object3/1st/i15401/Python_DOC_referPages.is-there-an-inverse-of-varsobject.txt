The built-in vars(obj) returns a dict with key/values mirroring the attributes of obj. Is there an inverse of this function?  I.e. a function that takes a dictionary and returns an object.I've come up with two ways of doing it, neither of which would be obvious to someone reading it. The first version involves assigning a new dict to self.__dict__:and the second version uses a non-standard call to the type builtin:Is there an easier/more readable way?
In Python 3.3 and up you can use types.SimpleNamespace:
There is the module attrdict that does what you want.
