Natural Text
Ok I got the following problem the count result is 4 (I don't know how is that possible).The result should be instead of 4 it should be 3
You're code doesn't make much sense, you write lines like:Where you open a bracket and don't close it.Furthermore your algorithm:Doesn't make much sense: you simply count the number of words.The method you look for is:One thus adds a constraint (in case the search is case sensitive):Which checks whether text contains the word w.This gives:"how" is not counted since "How" is not the same as "how"In case the search should be case-insensitive, you can use:which returns you test-case exactly (using python3):
Using that kind of generator expression is a very idiomatic way to construct this function. Basically constructing a list full of 1s for every word in text.split() that is also in words, then returning the sum of those ints
