Is there a way to autogenerate a dictionary list of multiple constraints in scipy.minimize? When I use the following code (where the list constraint is a list of sage multivariate polynomials over the same ring)My output isHowever if I try to create cons byminimize fails withMy list, constraint, of sage polynomials may change in length, in number of polynomials from problem to problem and I don't want to have to hard code the cons dict list as first given above for each problem. Is there a way to automate?The following works but I understand it is not best practices to eval strings
The problem is in your loop. The lambda operator performs what is called a lazy evaluation. At the end of your loop, the lambda the cons is performing the function on the last value of ii, instead of on each index.To perform a strict evaluation, you can use the partial object from the python functools module (in both python 2 or python 3).To exemplify, with lambda:Replacing s by *s to match your definition:Hope it helps!
