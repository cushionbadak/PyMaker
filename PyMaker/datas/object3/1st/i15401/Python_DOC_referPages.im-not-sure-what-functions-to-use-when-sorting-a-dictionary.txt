Im not sure what functions to use to sort a dictionary which gets added to as the programme runs, the format of the dictionary is (name:score,name:score ..... )
A dictionary is unordered.You can sort the data for output.Using an OrderedDict is not an option here, because you don't want to maintain order, but want to sort with different criteria.
