When I want a random item of a list, I normally do:(and then put that in as the index for the list)However, I was wondering if it was more efficient / better practise to do the following:Does it make any difference to execution time, or is better practise, in general, to use one over the other?
You can use random.randrange(..) which works like range:or even better, use more readable random.choice which return random element out of the sequence:
for this choice exists: try
Running some tests (a loop, 100,000 long generating using each technique):Method 1 (random.randint(1,len(lst)-1))Method 2 (random.randint(1,len(lst))-1)So they essentially take exactly the same amount of time - the differences are almost certainly random - linking in to the other activity on my computer.
