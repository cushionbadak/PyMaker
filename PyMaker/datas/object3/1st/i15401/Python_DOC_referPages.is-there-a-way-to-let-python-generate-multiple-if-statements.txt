I just need to add +30 to every number in every if statement. I need 36 of these, is there a way to let turtle make more if statements or something similar? I'm really stuck and the manual way would be crazy. For example:
Use a for loop.
range can take an optional third argument for the "step" value. For reference, see Python's documentation on range.
