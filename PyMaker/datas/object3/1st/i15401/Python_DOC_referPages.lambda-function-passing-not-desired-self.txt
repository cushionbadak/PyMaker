Look this code:My error:TypeError: () takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were givenI need to call the lambda function my_func in the same way as the code above, but a self is appearing from somewhere I don't know and causing this error.What am I missing?
Since my_func is a class attribute of MyClass_2, you should not be accessing it through self (an instance of the class).  Instead, you should be accessing it through the class directly:Demo:For more information, you can check out these sources:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitionsPython: Difference between class and instance attributes
A lambda is just different syntax for defining a function object. Functions in class bodies are always bound and passed a self argument (as they are descriptors).Simply give your lambda that argument:The alternative would be for you to unwrap the method and pass in the plain function object:or to wrap your lambda in a staticmethod object:
You need to give your lambda a self argument.  Lambdas are just ordinary functions.  There is no difference between this:and thisIn both cases, my_func is a method, and self will be passed if you call it on an instance.
lambdas are small anonymous functions and can be written in the parameter list of a method directly. Assigning them to a variable is usually not desirable. A typical use of lambda here would be:
