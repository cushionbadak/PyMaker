Is it possible to check argparse choices in case-insensitive manner?results in:
Transform the argument into lowercase by usingfor the -p switch.As pointed out by chepner in the comments, since str.lower is already an appropriate function, the lambda wrapper is not necessarily needed and you could instead simply usedirectly.
Using lower in the type is nice way of doing this, if you don't mind loosing the case information.If you want to retain the case, you could define a custom choices class.  The choices needs two methods, __contains__ (for testing in), and iteration (to list the choices).The help is:
Keeping the case information would also be possible with a one liner:Where choices would be the same list as passed to the choices parameter.
