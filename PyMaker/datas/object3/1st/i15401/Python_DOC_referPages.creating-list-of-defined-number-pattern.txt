I want to create a list that produces the output of:[001,002,003,004,005]and keeps going until 300. Having the 0's in front of the digits is essential. I tried a method such as:However, for obvious reasons, the append function does not behave in the manner I would like. Do people have any suggestions on how else I could do this?
You cannot produce a list with integers that are presented with padding, no. You can produce strings with leading zeros:The format() function is used to format integers to a field width of 3 characters with leading zeros to pad out the length, encoded as 03d.Demo:
You could subclass list and overload its __repr__ method to call str.zfill on each number:Demo:To make the exact list you want, do NumList(range(300)).Note however that this does not make integers with leading zeros (as @MartijnPieters said, that is impossible).  The output is still a string. All this is doing is telling Python how to display those integers when they are outputed to the console.
