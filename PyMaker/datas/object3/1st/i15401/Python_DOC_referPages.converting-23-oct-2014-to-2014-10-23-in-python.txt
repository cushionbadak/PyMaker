I have date strings in the form of '23/Oct/2014' and want to convert it to '2014/10/23' in Python 3. The final output I need is just as a string. I implementing my own function to do the conversion using dictionary (for month conversion) but I am wondering if there is more pythonic way of doing the same thing.
You can use the datetime library to parse the string, then format back to a string again:This parses the input string using datetime.datetime.strptime(), then formats the resulting object to a string again with datetime.datetime.strftime().Demo:
If you just want a string, your dict mapping and format would work fine, if you don't want datetime objects I don't see the point in using datetime:
