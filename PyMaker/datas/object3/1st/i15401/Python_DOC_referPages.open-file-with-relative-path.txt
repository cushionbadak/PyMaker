\u has special meaning in a Python string literal; it denotes a Unicode character.  So does \f, which denotes a formfeed.You will need to use a raw-string:or forwardslashes:in order to keep Python from interpreting them as such. You could also double every backslash:but that is rather tedious.Also, you need to double the backslash for every '\' since string literals cannot end in a single \.  But this is not a very robust solution.  A better approach for building paths is to use os.path.join:Then, you can replace every '\\' with os.sep as @helloV said in his answer.  This will ensure that your code creates proper-looking paths on both Windows and *nix systems.
Use os.sep instead of '\', to avoid escaping issues.Try:
