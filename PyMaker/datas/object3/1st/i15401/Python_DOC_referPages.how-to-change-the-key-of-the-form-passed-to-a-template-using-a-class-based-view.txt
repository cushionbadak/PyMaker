I have a template that references a form like {{ registeredteamform.team_name }}, but Django's generic class based views pass forms using the key 'form'.  Rather than changing the form name in my template (I'm dealing with a multi-form situation) I'd like to change they key of the form passed to the template.I tried extending the render_to_response method like sobut this raises the error render_to_response() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given.  So, how can I change the form key and is render_to_response the appropriate place to do this?  (I'm subclassing the CreateView),
The error you are getting is because of the way you are using super. The self goes in the super() for Python 2.7, and you don't need to pass the self at all for Python 3.Python 2.7:return super(MyClassView, self).render_to_response(context, **response_kwargs)Python 3:return super().render_to_response(context, **response_kwargs)If you dig into the CreateView you will see that it is in the get() that form actually gets assigned to the form key.You could add in the key the way you are now, but the form key will still be getting assigned too.I might suggest overriding the get().
