I'm using python 3 and have many virtual envs using pyvenv on mac osx 10.9.3. In all of them the command ./ runs my python code. In one of my envs the command has stopped working and I can not find anything about how to get it to begin working again. EDIT: I get permission denied when typing out the whole file instead of tab (i.e. ./manage.py), and when I add sudo it works, but all the other venvs don't require sudo.I'm searching through pyvenv docs and searching through various bash links but can't get it to restore or know where that shortcut comes from. When I type python [file] everything works as expected, but I want to restore the ./[file] I know it's going to be something easy but for some reason I can't figure out what to search to get the relevant solution.
When you type ./[tab] and the file you're expecting doesn't come in linux shell, chances are you need to make the file executable:Or you don't have sufficient permissions to access the file:(Be careful with the last one because it may lead to unexpected behaviour)
