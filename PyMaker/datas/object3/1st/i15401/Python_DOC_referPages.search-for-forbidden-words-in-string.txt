You actually do not need Regex for this.  You can use all and a generator expression:To make your string of words into a list, use str.split:You might also want to call set() on the list to improve lookup times.  Sets have O(1) (constant) complexity with the in and not in operators while lists have O(n) (linear).  So, it is faster to find things in a set than it is with a list.
