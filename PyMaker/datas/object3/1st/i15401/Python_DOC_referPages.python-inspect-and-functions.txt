I am trying to go through the json module and return just the functions. and then I would like to use inspect module to return inspect.formatargspec(*inspect.getfullargspec(func)) on each function from json.This is what I was thinking, this obviously fails because func is a string.
dir returns a list of attribute names of the object, not the attributes. You need to use getattr to get the attribute.
