I like the way Python interactive interpreter prints strings, and I want to repeat that specifically in scripts. However, I can't seem to do that.Example. I can do this in interpreter:However, I cannot replicate this in the python itselfI want this because I want to debug a code with a lot of string with similar non-printable characters.Is there an easy way to do this?
You're looking for repr(): 
Oh, that was fast.I can just use repr() functon. That is, in my example,
Make it a raw string (If possible) EDITAs you said that you cannot make it a raw string, Then you will have to use repr() as stated in the other answer..
