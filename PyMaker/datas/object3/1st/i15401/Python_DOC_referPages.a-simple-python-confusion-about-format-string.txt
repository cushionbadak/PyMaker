New to python and I am learning this tutorial:http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.htmlI just cannot see why the line "But it didn't sing." got printed out with double-quote and all the others got printed with single quote.. Cannot see any difference from the code...
The quotes depends on the string: if there are no quotes, it will use simple quotes:if there is a single quote, it will use double quotes:if there is a double quote, it will use single quotes:"""double quote:" """          'double quote:" 'if there are both, it will use single quotes, hence escaping the single one:There won't be a difference though when you print the string:the surroundings quotes are for the representation of the strings:You might want to check the python tutorial on strings.
The representation of a value should be equivalent to the Python code required to generate it. Since the string "But it didn't sing." contains a single quote, using single quotes to delimit it would create invalid code. Therefore double quotes are used instead.
Python has several rules for outputting the repr of strings.Normally, it uses ' to surround them, except if there are 's within it - then it uses " for removing the need of quoting.If a string contains both ' and '"characters, it uses's and quotes the"`.As there can be several valid and equivalent representations of a string, these rues might change from version to version.BTW, in the site you linked to the answer is given as well:Q: Why does %r sometimes print things with single-quotes when I wrote them with double-quotes?A: Python is going to print the strings in the most efficient way it can, not replicate exactly the way you wrote them. This is perfectly fine since %r is used for debugging and inspection, so it's not necessary that it be pretty.
