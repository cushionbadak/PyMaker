For example, we have a class:what is the function call to replace:I want to apply it with map function.
The functional equivalent of doing  class.attribute is to use getattr(class, 'attribute'):From the documentation:getattr(object, name[, default])Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s  attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example,  getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar. If the named  attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise  AttributeError is raised.
Your question is not very clear but if you want to change the value of A.a in python it is as simple asFrom what I've read from the python documentation, it seems that you can do that without the need of setter() and getter() function like other languages. I took this example from the link hyperlinked above.
