I have to sort my list of strings according to the months name:I have to sort by january, february, martch, .....My trial:But no success, how would you do it?The expected answers is:
list.sort, sorted accept optional key parameter. Pass a key function that returns corresponding number to monthes.months is mapping between month names and numbers using calendar.month_name:
You could make a dictionary of months and their corresponding position in the calendar:And then sort the list by looking up the month in the dictionary. First split each element of the list on the underscore (which gives a list such as ['dog', 'january']) and then use months.get to look up the last element of this list in the dictionary:Edit:A lazier way if you have dateutil installed...No need for a dictionary! dateutil.parser.parse parses the month string to a datetime object.

You can sort your list based on calendar.month_name or calendar.month_abbr :
