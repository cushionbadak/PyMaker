For example I have several thousand strings similar to:I wish to truncate it such thatI have two ways to accomplish thisORFrom a "good engineering practices" standpoint, which one is preferable? Readability vs. Maintainability vs. SpeedI am using Python 2.7
This question is difficult to answer because it is opinion-based. str.replace is definitely faster. Using timeit in ipython with Python 3.4.2:As Padraic Cunningham pointed out, the difference is even greater in Python 2:Which one is better depends on the program. Generally, for Python, readability is more important than speed (because the standard PEP 8 style is based on the notion that code is read more than written). If speed is vital for the program, the faster option str.replace would be better. Otherwise, the more readable option re.sub would be better.EDITAs Anony-Mousse pointed out, using re.compile instead is both faster and more readable than both. (You added that you're using Python 2, but I'll put the Python 3 test first to reflect the order of my other tests above.)  With Python 3:With Python 2:
