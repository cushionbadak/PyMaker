I'm using the following code to produce 2 lists, nameList and gradeList.Producing something like:I want the program to print the lists in 2 clean columns, side by side. Within each column, I want the data to align to the left. The lists (without fail) will always be evenly populated. The first column (nameList) will never be longer than 25 characters. What I am looking for would be similar to the following:I've tried to use pandas and it worked, but the formatting was weird and out of place. It wouldn't align to the left like I want. I believe this happened because the data each has a different character length in both lists (shown above).
Using str.format:output:Alternatively, you can also use printf style formatting using % operator:
Given two liststab separated format.  using zip() two iterate through both lists at the same time
