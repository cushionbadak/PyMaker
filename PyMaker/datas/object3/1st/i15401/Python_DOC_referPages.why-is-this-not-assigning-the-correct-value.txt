I wanted to store the biggest fib number calculated so  far, but the variable biggest is not being assigned to correctly.After doing fib(10), the cache looks good, but biggest is still 1. Sorry for the beginner question, but was hoping someone could enlighten me. Thanks!
You need to declare the biggest as a global using global statement (especially when there's an assignment to the variable). Otherwise, it is treated as a local variable.
If you happen to be doing this in Python >= 3.2 some day, you can also use lru_cachelru_cache allows your to cache something exactly the way you're trying to do, but automatically, much faster, and without you having to do anything. Just using this decorator.Documentation here.
