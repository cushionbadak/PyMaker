six.moves is a virtual namespace. It provides access to packages that were renamed between Python 2 and 3. As such, you shouldn't be installing anything.By importing from six.moves.xmlrpc_client the developer doesn't have to handle the case where it is located at xmlrpclib in Python 2, and at xmlrpc.client in Python 3. Note that these are part of the standard library.The mapping was added to six version 1.5.0; make sure you have that version or newer.Mac comes with six version 1.4.1 pre-installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python and this will interfere with any version you install in site-packages (which is listed last in the sys.path).The best work-around is to use a virtualenv and install your own version of six into that, together with whatever else you need for this project. Create a new virtualenv for new projects.If you absolutely have to install this at the system level, then for this specific project you'll have to remove the /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python path:This will remove various OS X-provided packages from your path for just that run of Python; Apple installs these for their own needs.
should solve the issue.
