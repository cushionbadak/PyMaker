Natural Text
I want my Fraction class to work as a float when it's being added to floats or integers so I can naturally perform operations with it, but it's only working when the Fraction is the rightmost operand. Is there a way to make it work with the operands in any order or should I override another method that I haven't learned of?Code (I guess variable names are pretty self-explanatory):1 + Fraction(1,2) returns 1.5 as it should but Fraction(1,2) + 1 raises:
The __radd__ special method only applies to when you do value + self.  If you want to handle self + value, you need to overload the __add__ special method.Since they both do the same thing, you can just do:An easy way to remember this is to treat the r in __radd__ as standing for "right".  So, you use __radd__ when your class is on the right of the + operator.Also, you'll notice that I used isinstance to do the typechecking.  Aside from being cleaner, this way is preferred by most Python programmers and is explicitly advocated in PEP 0008.
