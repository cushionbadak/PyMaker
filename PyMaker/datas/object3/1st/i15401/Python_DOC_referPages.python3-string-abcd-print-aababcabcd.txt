If a have a string like abcd or 1234 etc. how can I print together, the first character, then the first two characters, then the first three etc. all together?For example for a string = 1234 I would like to print/return 1121231234 or aababcabcdI have this code so far:But it prints/returns it in separate lines. I could write it manually as print(str[0:1], str[1:2] <...>) but how do I make python do it as I don't know how long the string is going to be?
You shouldn't use str as a variable name, because it shadows the built-in str type. You could join the sliced strings together in your loop:It's possible to shorten your code a little using str.join and range:or using itertools.accumulate (Python 3.2+):itertools.accumulate approach appears to be 2 times faster than str.join one and about 1.5 times faster than the original loop-based solution:The code I used to time the functions is
Just use:As @abc noted, don't use str as a variable name because it's one of the default type. see https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrangeE.g.:range(len(s)+1) is because of slicing, see Explain Python's slice notation:Then: Lastly, join list([s[:1], s[:2], s[:3], s[:4]]) using "".join(list), see https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.join:To avoid extract iteration in loop, you can use range(1,len(s)+1) since s[:0] returns string of 0 length:
If you are using python 3 you can use this to print without a newline:So your function could be:
