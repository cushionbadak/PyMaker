Where does the variable __spec__ come from?
From the Python Language Reference, Part 5: The Import System (emphasis mine):The __spec__ attribute must be set to the module spec that was used when importing the module. This is used primarily for introspection and during reloading. Setting __spec__ appropriately applies equally to modules initialized during interpreter startup. The one exception is __main__, where __spec__ is set to None in some cases.New in version 3.4.
According to Python 3 docs, __spec__ is always None if you are using interactive promt:When Python is started with the -m option, __spec__ is set to the  module spec of the corresponding module or package. __spec__ is also  populated when the __main__ module is loaded as part of executing a  directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.In the remaining cases __main__.__spec__ is set to None, as the code  used to populate the __main__ does not correspond directly with an  importable module:interactive prompt-c switchrunning from stdinrunning directly from a source or bytecode file
