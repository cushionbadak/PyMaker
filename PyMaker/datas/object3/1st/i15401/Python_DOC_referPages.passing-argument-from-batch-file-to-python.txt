How to check null point error when I am running .bat to execute this python? I may not be able to see the console log in IDE while executingMy batch file (.bat)My python file (test.py)
In your code, you're skipping the first argument twice.main gets called with sys.argv[1:], skipping the first argument (program name); but then main itself uses argv[1]... skipping its first argument again.Just pass sys.argv untouched to main and you'll be fine, for example.Or, perhaps more elegantly, do call main(sys.argv[1:]), but then, in main, use argv[0]!
Use argparse https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmlEg: In your python fileInside your bat file
