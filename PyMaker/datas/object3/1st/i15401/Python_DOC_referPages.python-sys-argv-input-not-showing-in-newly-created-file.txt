I am new to python and I am trying to read various configuration files, checking for a hostgroup, service or service group. This script will check if a hostgroup exists based on what the user inputs. If it doesn't exist, then a new config file is created with the hostgroup, service and service group. Right now I can't get my sys.argv to provide me with the user's input where needed whenever a new config file(hostgroup, service, service group) is created. The file and hostgroup names are the same as the user input. Here is the script:Here is the config file that is created when the system calls to create a new file.
Sequences of characters within string literals do not get magically replaced by the contents of any variables that happen to have the same name--just imagine the chaos that would create! If you want Python to use a variable, you need to actually use the variable. I strongly recommend that you work through a tutorial if you have questions about this sort of thing.Everywhere in your script that you're using the string 'target_host' (note the single quotes), you should change it to the variable name target_host, to refer to the variable you set from user input on line 12. For example:If you also need to insert the user input into the configuration file name, I suggest you use string formatting to insert the variable into a base string. In the example below, the characters {0} within the format string are replaced by the contents of the target_host variable.
