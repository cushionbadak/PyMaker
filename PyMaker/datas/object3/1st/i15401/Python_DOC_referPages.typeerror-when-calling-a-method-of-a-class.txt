I am still getting an error:and I have no idea what is wrong with this since I just started learning about classes.What needs to be changed?
Your method call is wrong. You should call it with object reference. And one more thing you have to define your list as global then only you will be able to append next element. Otherwise it will give NameError: global name 'inventory' is not defined error. Try this out:Or If you want to have the separate copy of inventory for each object then define inventory as self.inventory = []Hence your code will look something like:
You're calling the method as if it were a static method. It is an instance method. You need to create an instance of Product, then call the method on that instance.
