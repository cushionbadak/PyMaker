Ive been trying to figure this out all night with no luck.  Im assuming that this will be a simple question for the more experienced programmer. Im working on a canonical request that I can sign.something like this:However when I print(canonical_request) I get:But this is what im after: By the way Im using python34,  I would really appreciate the help.
So you want to not have "actual" newlines, but the escape character for newlines in your string? Just add a second slash to '\n' to escape it as well, '\\n'. Or prepend your strings with r to make them "raw"; in them the backslash is interpreted literally; r'\n' (commonly used for regular expressions).For information about string literals, see String and byte literals in the docs.
As an alternative and more elegant way you can put your strings in a list and join them with escape the \n with add \ to leading  : The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.
