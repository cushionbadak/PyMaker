Natural Text
This excerpt is from Python doc. It the doc string says the function is non-blocking(e.g.# non-blocking dict iterator), that is where I don't understand .It appears to me is just a generator function doing the same thing as iter().As far as I know, non-blocking means async or parallel computing, or when you get rid off the lock at multi-thread .The snippet is in synchronous execution. What is non-blocking here meant?  
As I understand it - the non-blocking here is used as not breaking the code execution when a specific error occurs.So these generators don't 'block' my code from running when the exception occurs.
