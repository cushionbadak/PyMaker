Is there a python module/snippet which can decode the integer datestamps contained in OSX - specifically mail - plists?EG, this bit: is likely in Jan 2010.How to deconstruct? I'm aware of the very good plistlib - but this only gets me to that integer.
You can use datetime.datetime.fromtimestampThe value 1264001747 is the timestamp given in seconds from epoch. The returned datetime object is shown in the order (year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
