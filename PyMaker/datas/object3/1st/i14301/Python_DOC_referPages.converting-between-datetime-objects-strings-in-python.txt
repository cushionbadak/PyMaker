How do I turn that into a string?:
The datetime class has a method strftime. The Python docs documents the different formats it accepts:Python 2: strftime() BehaviorPython 3: strftime() BehaviorFor this specific example, it would look something like:
Here is how you can accomplish the same using python's general formatting function...The formatting characters used here are the same as those used by strftime. Don't miss the leading :  in the format specifier.Using format() instead of strftime() in most cases can make the code more readable, easier to write and consistent with the way formatted output is generated...Compare the above with the following strftime() alternative...Moreover, the following is not going to work...And so on...
Using f-strings, in Python 3.6+.
very old question, i know. but with the new f-strings (starting from python 3.6) there are fresh options. so here for completeness:strftime() and strptime() Behavior explains what the format specifiers mean.
Read strfrtime from the official docs.
Python datetime object has a method attribute, which prints in readable format.
This is for format the date?
