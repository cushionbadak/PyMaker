I would like to create something like a permanent storage using Python. What I mean is that I will have some variables coming into my code, and every time I execute my script it might be a different input. Let's imagine I am reading some website that is updating in real time. I want to be able to create a permanent storage that will hold on to the information (internalize it). So that when I get back to my script the next day and run it again, I will still have that internalized data available and it will not get re-set unless I specify so. Is that possible in Python? What should I be looking for? Any modules that do that? I really have no idea where to get started with this.  
There is no notion of an image as smalltalk had it (only heard, never worked with it) in standard python.Depending on your actual use-case, I can see several approaches:use configuration-files, reading on start and writing them in intervals.pickle your relevant data-structures explicitly, and restore whatever graph of objects you have.use stackless python, which allows to serialize interpreter state.
