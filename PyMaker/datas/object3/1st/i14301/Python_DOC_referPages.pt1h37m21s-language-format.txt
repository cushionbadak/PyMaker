Is there a way to convert the following forward into a time object?Or is it required that a do splits and strips, etc. in order to extract the time object?
You can use format strings to parse date/times. You can either use Python's datetime strptime directly or more human-friend Arrow library arrow.get() (see parse string).The format does not look like any common datetime format so you need to write your own parser formatter.
Regular expressions are often better than splits and strips.(I don't know what PT means so I hope it's just a prefix.)
