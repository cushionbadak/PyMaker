Natural Text
I am new to python and have a hopefully simple question. I have a txt file with road names and lengths. i.e. Main street 56 miles. I am stumped on how to call on that file in Python and sort all the road lengths in ascending order. Thanks for your help.
Let's assume that there is a "miles" after every number. (This is an untested code so you can get it edited but I think the idea is right). EDIT: THIS IS TESTED
