I am using Windows 7 and Python 3.4.3. I would like to run this simple helloworld.py file in my browser:What I do is:1) Go to command line C:\Python (where python is installed)2) run: python -m http.server3) Got to Firefox and type http://localhost:8000/hello.pyHowever, instead of "Hello World", the browser just prints the content of the hello.py file.How can I fix it?
From the http.server docs:CGIHTTPRequestHandler can be enabled in the command line by passing  the --cgi option:Put your script into cgi_directories:This defaults to ['/cgi-bin', '/htbin'] and describes directories to treat as containing CGI scripts.Open in the browser:where hello.py:I had to make it executable on POSIX: chmod +x cgi-bin/hello.py. 
I did this some time ago for Python2.7So in Python 3 you just need to change importsI do not know right now if the print-function in python 3 is orbut i guess it was with ()Edit: it is print()
I created a complete example for a friend. It is a complete demo you can run with 8 simple copy-paste ready lines of code. Enjoy.
