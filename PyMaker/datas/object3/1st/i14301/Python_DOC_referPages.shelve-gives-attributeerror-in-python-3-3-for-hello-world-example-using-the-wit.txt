I'm trying to use shelve with Python 3.3. It is recommended to use the with shelve.open('spam.db') as db:... syntax to ensure we close the "connection". However, when I try it I get the following error AttributeError: __exit__. What gives? Any thoughts? Many similar questions here, although couldn't find a satisfying solution. The following shows what I have attempted thus far:The following fails:Error message:The following works:And outputs the expected:Printing the shelve module pathLocation:
In Python 3.3 shelve.open() is not a context manager and cannot be used in a with statement. The with statement expects there to be __enter__ and __exit__ methods; the error you see is because there are no such methods.You can use contextlib.closing() to wrap the shelve.open() result in a context manager here:Alternatively, upgrade to Python 3.4, where the required context manager methods were added to the return value of shelve.open(). From the shelve.Shelve documentation:Changed in version 3.4: Added context manager support.
Shelf isn't a context manager in Python 3.3; this functionality was introduced in 3.4. If you need to support 3.3, you'll need to use contextlib.closing or an explicit close in a finally block. I recommend contextlib.closing.
