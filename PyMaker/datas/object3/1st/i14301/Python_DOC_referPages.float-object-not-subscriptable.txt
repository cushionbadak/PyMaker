I have looked all over, and have not found my answer.What I am trying to do is create a list of every longitude from 71.42 W to 70.87 W, and every latitude from 42.19 N to 42.54 N for every 1/100th of a latitude/longitude.So, kind of like:...etc.,My code looks like this so far: The problem is that when I try this code, (which currently is only supposed to do longitude,) I get a TypeError: 'Float' object is not subscriptable.Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!EDIT: ANSWERED! Thanks, CoryCramer
If I understand what you are shooting for, you want a grid with bounded latitudes and longitudes? Then you could do something likeOutput
The last item in latlong is a float; floats are not subscriptable. However, your question is unclear. If your question is "Why isn't a float subscriptable?" then I would ask what you think subscripting a float should do.  If your question is "Why does it think I'm trying to subscript a float?" then the answer is that you're looking at the last item of latlong, which is now a float, because you appended one; perhaps you meant to append (latlong[-1][0]+1, latlong[-1][1]) instead.If your question is "How could I better approach this problem?" then I'd advise a list comprehension, one of python's great strengths. Observe what this does:  
You can use 2 nested loops.I'm using whole numbers and then multiplying them by 0.01, because the range function only accepts whole numbers.Output:
You can accomplish this with a simple list comprehension:You can find more on list comprehensions (and the language in general) here.
