How might one go about constructing something like a Linked List in python. I realize that python is not low level. But suppose I have a very large object, and I want to contain a reference to this large object in instances of another class:I want to ensure that self.large_object_ref never becomes a deep copied instance of LargeObject in memory, how do i prevent this/ensure this? I admit I know very little about python's memory model or management, as one isn't  really supposed to have to in Python. I am familiar with C/++ though so I am borrowing terms and ideas from that area. 
Python is pass-by-assignment which is basically equal to pass-by-reference for mutable objects (and most of the user-created objects are mutable).
