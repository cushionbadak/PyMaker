I'm trying to learn how to use Mocks for Python. However I've been struggling with some basic application of it.Let's say our piece of code that I want to test is this:Which have a method which is simply create a new object of itself and calls a method of that class.Once again, this is a very simple UnitTest, basically copypasted from 26.5.1.1 of https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html .However, this would test if real.something has been called, meanwhile the one i really want to test is if newone.something has been called. Considering newone is created later when we actually call method()-method how do I use mock to test it?
You can test this by simply instantiate ProductionClass in setUp method and patch ProductionClass in test_one as followsI just modified the production class to show that both object refers to the same instance of the mockOutput:You can verify that both object refers the same instance of the mock object by looking the idPS: I've been using mock package for this example so you probably need to install it using pip.
