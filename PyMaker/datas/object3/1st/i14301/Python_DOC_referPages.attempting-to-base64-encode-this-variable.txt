Natural Text
I'm trying to encode the 'username' variable into Base64, then write it into a text file, and finally decode the Base64, and read/print it.    -TypeError- 'str' does not support the buffer interfaceWhat I did here seemed the most logical out of what I've seen.I am fairly new to Python, and have tried all the method's I've seen online to Base64 encode a variable, and none have worked.
base64 expects and returns bytes (in python3); but strings must be written to files. here the example with explicit writing and more compact reading:btw: file is a reserved keyword and should not be used as variable.
