I have the following code:But I keep getting the error: "Error: 'module' object has no attribute 'PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2'"If I try to use TLS 2 or SSL2 or 3, I run into the bug "Error: "Which has been documented, and I believe the common workaround was to use TLSv1 (which is disabled)Is there anything I can do to make it work, or do I have to wait for admin rights and download and install python 2.7.9+ or 3.4+?(I'm currently using Portablepython, hence the restriction on version numbers)
From https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html:So you need to upgrade to get this option.You might try PROTOCOL_SSLv23 which offers the best protocol version the client can do in a backward compatible way. But lots of servers which are configured to allow only TLS 1.2 will still cause a handshake failure with this option.Apart from that you need OpenSSL 1.0.1 do have support for TLS1.2 at all.
