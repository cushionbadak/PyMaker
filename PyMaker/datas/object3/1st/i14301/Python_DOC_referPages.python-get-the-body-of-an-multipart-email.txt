Natural Text
i get an email with the following code:FYI: This is always a part of the examplecode. But body is now a biiig list of objects. If the Content_Type would be Plaintext, it would be much easier. How can i get access to the body of that mail now? 
Short answerYou have a multiparted email. That's why you're getting a list instead of a string: get_payload returns a list of Message if it's a multipart message, and string if it's not.ExplanationFrom the docs:Return the current payload, which will be a list of Message objects when is_multipart() is True, or a string when is_multipart() is False.Hence get_payload returning a list.Your code for getting the body would be something like:Again, from the docs:Note that is_multipart() returning True does not necessarily mean that "msg.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart'" will return the True. For example, is_multipart will return True when the Message is of type message/rfc822.
