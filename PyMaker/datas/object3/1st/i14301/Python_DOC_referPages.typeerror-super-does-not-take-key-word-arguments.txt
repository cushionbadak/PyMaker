I also have some Kwargs in some other class's supers, but these are the ones raising any kind of issues (as of right now). So what could be causing this?

The arguments to the parent's __init__ method should be passed to the __init__ method:All you pass to super() is the child class (Kidnappers in this case) and a reference to the current instance (self).Note however that if you are using Python 3.x, all you need to do is:and Python will work out the rest.Here are some links to where this is explained in the documentation:Python 2.x super()Python 3.x super()
Option # 1 : Python 2.7xHere you can pass self keywork to super() which inherently refers the instance properties. Option # 2 : Python 3xsuper() no longer need to any parameters and you can simply write
