Also, when I open the csv File in calc the data in each row is all in the same cell, is that normal?
ORchange the delimter to space if necessary.without csv module,
You can use itertools.izip to crate a generator contains the columns and use next to get the first column.Its more efficient if you have a large data and you want to refuse of multi-time indexing!
To get just the first column as a list:
for the second part of your question:when opening csv-documents in LibreOffice Calc (openoffice should work the same way) I get a Dialog where I am asked a few things about that document, like charakter encoding and as well the type of separator. If you select "space", it should work. You have a preview at the bottom of this dialog.
