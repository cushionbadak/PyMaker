I have Python lists saved as string representations like this:and I'd like to convert that string to a list object. I tried to just load it directly, or use list(a) but it just splits every character of the string. I suppose I could manually parse it by removing the first character, removing the last one, splitting based on , and then remove the single quotes.. but isn't there a better way to convert it directly since that string is an exact representation of what a list looks like?
You can try the eval functionJust be aware that eval() could be insecure depending on the input.Edit:Dear google user, if you want to convert a representation of a list to a list use ast as @C.B. suggested. This answer is not correct.From the ast.literal_eval docs:Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and None.
Use the ast module
