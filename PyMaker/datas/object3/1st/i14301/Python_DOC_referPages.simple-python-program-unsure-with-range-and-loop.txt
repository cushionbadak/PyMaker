Here is the psuedo code I was supposed to create in python:Here is what I created in python and its not working and I don't understand why?I tried the in range part, and I got this error when I input one when the program input how many games.
Your lineis not valid Python. If you wanted to use looping here, for is helpful but you need to add a range() function:See the Python tutorial on the for construct. Since the input() function returns a string, you need to convert it to an integer first, using the int() function.Your code otherwise pretty much matches the pseudo-code otherwise, apart from using a lowercase y in your input() line; you may want to correct that as you only test for uppercase Y in the result:You also made a small typo in your PlayerTwoScore update; replace the second = with +:Putting that together would make:
In every language, for loops are more commonly used to iterate over a range of value as inOn the other hand, while loops are used to perform blocks of code while a given condition evaluates to trueAnd so on.It seems to me that your case fits more in a while loop. Something like:Last note:Python has some style guides that are intended to keep your code cleaner. While style is sometimes a personal choice, it would be nice if you take some time to read them. For instance, in your case, your variable names should be divided by underscore as in no_of_games_played. Checkout more here:Google Style GuidePEP-8
If I've guessed your intentions, the code should look like this:
