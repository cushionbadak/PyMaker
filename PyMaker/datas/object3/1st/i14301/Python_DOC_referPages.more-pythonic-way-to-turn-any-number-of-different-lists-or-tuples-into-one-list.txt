This question already has an answer here:How to make a flat list out of list of lists?                    38 answers                I am trying to write a function to take in any number of different lists or tuples as arguments and return one big list.I was learning about args and kwargs, and my code is working all right, but this seems like too much code for something so simple.There must be a better way than writing a long function to check if an argument is a tuple and if it is add convert it to a list and then add it on. That just seems bloated.
itertools.chain is what you are looking for:Note: Calling list is necessary if you want a list instead of a itertools.chain object.
This functionality is already included in Python via itertools.chain:That, or as @Navith said, you could use itertools.chain.from_iterable:Note however that you need to call list() on both because they return iterators by default:Which might actually be a good thing if you do not need all of the items right up front.
