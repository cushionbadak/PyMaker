I'm a newbie in Python and embedding it too. And I have one problem:There is function in my python module that recieves buffer created with ctypes.create_string_buffer(size) and fills it by content from some memory address:How should I call this method with using of (char *) buffer? I want fill my C++ buffer with recieved from python.
If you only want to call the Python function ctypes.create_string_buffer(size), you could easily mirror the Python coding on the C++ side:If you'd like to use another type than unsigned long for the size, you'd need to change the format in PyObject_CallMethod as well. For example O is used for PyObject*. For a complete list of formats see the documentation for Building values.
