Natural Text
I have a text file with some data:and I have a python 2.7 regex like this:The problem is that the regex does not match anything (regmatch is None). If I remove the ^ then it matches just fine. What am I doing incorrectly here? I would like to add the line beginning search symbol.
^ checks for start of the string.. add re.MULTILINE flag.
The modifier ^ forces your regex engine to match the regex from start of string. and since your string doesn't start with DATA_ARRAY it returns None.And as @nanny mentioned If you also want it to match the start of each line, use re.MULTILINE flag :
If you add a re.MULTILINE flag it should work.This will make the flags look like re.MULTILINE|re.DOTALL
