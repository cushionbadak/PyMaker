I am trying to define a table colors which contains various other tables containing tuples which represent colors.However, this gives an invalid syntax error. Why is that?
Lists don't take name-value pairs. You probably want dictionaries here instead:I'm not sure where you found your syntax, but it is not valid Python. Python lists, using [...] square brackets, can only take a sequence of individual Python expressions:See the Data structures section of the Python tutorial.
