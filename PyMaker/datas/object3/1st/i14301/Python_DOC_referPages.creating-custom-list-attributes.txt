I am trying to create functions for the property list. How do you create the attribute function for something like this?should return:The method should be easy but I am having trouble associating the function with the predefined object list.
You cannot add methods or attributes to any of the built-in objects.  This is by design.  Instead, you can create your own list type that is derived from the built-in one:Demo:For more information, see Classes in the documentation, specifically the section on Inheritance.
You can't monkeypatch built in objects in Python like you can in Ruby. You'd have to build a new object, inherit list, and put your method on that.
