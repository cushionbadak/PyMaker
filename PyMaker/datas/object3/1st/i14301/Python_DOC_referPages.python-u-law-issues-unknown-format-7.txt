I'm trying to compare two large sets of wav files to remove duplicates.  The issue is that one set is PCM, the other has been u-law'd.  When I try to read in PCM wav, no problem, but the u-law files give the following error:So I look in wave.py and find: Does this mean python only handles un-ulaw'd wavs?  I don't know enough about audio to want to try hacking my python.I can play both kinds of files no problem, but looking at ulaw'd files in GSpot shows I'm missing codecs.Any ideas?  Maybe don't use python?  I like that numpy has a Fast Fourier Transform, I'd rather not try writing one.
From the documentation (emphasis mine):The wave module provides a convenient interface to the WAV sound format. It does not support compression/decompression, but it does support mono/stereo.You will need to find a module that actually supports decompressing audio.
