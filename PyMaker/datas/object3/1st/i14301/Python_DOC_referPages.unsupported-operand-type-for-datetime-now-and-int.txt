I want to compute elapsed time from request.session['SESSION_START_TIME'] to datetime.datetime.now(). The way I store datetime in request.session['SESSION_START_TIME'] is:The way I want to compute elapsed time is:But as a result I get this error message unsupported operand type for -: datetime.now and int. I guess the solution is to somehow convert values stored in session, but I do not know how.
