Following is the code that I wrote to add two complex numbers. I didn't include the  "i" part of the complex numbers. The code doesn't return the add method.The code correctly prints the z1.real, z1.imaginary, z2.real, z2.imaginary variables. However when I try to add z1 + z2 it doesn't return anything.Sample input:Sample output:Kindly let me know where I am doing the mistake
Your code is actually working. When you print z1+z2, it's printing out the right object. And you can verify that:The problem is that when you just print z1+z2, the way your object prints out is like this:That's not very useful. But Python can't guess what you want instances of your type to look like; you have to tell it.There are two methods for this, __str__ and __repr__. If you have to have one representation for end-user-readable output, and another for debugging, you define both; otherwise, just define __repr__.For example:Python 3.x has added some tools to make this easier for you; in particular, SimpleNamespace takes care of the basic __init__ and __repr__ for simple classes, so you only have to write __add__. But if you're using Python 2.7, those tools don't exist.
It works. (I called your class Complex2 to not to mask the built-in complex.)The last output is a representation of your instance.Add a method __repr__ to see useful output:Now:shows:For real work use the built-in complex. Either with literals:or with explicit creation of a new object:
