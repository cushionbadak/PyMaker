I have a set of 9 elements and I want to write a program which prompts the user for an integer n, then displays n number of elements selected randomly from my set. This is what I tried:
Use the random.sample() function to pick n random elements without repetition:If all you need is an integer from the user, don't use eval(); stick to using int() instead:eval() gives you more than you bargained for; it executes any valid Python expression, letting the user do anything they want with your program.
You neeed to call the random.choice() method inside the for loop so that n random elements are printed.
