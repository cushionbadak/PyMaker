I have a groups.txt file which contains ortholog groups with species and geneID in every groups. it looks like :I made a function that created a list of every species in the whole file (66 total) called listOfAllSpecies. I need to create a function that gives me all the groups which contain 1 species from these 66, then all the groups which contain 2 species from these 66, etc.To simplify it : and I need to get in this example: I thought to tryto get the first species in my listOfAllSpecies and then tell me in which groups OG_XXXX it is contained. Then get the first and the second species, etc. until it takes all the 66 species. How do I modify the range within the for loop, or is there a different way to do this?here is my actual code with function that i need without the part I need that i asked : 
Not sure if this is exactly what you want, but it's a start :)Produces:Just a warning: what you're trying to do will start to take forever with large enough numbers of inputs, as its complexity is 2^N. You can't get around it (that's what the problem demands), but it's there.
What about using a while loop to control the range() parameters?
The list of all non-empty subsets of a set of N items (your set of all species) is 2N – 1That's because it is just like a binary number of N bits, where each bit can be 1 (take that species in the subset) or 0 (exclude that species from the subset.) The -1 excludes the empty set (all bits 0)Therefore you can enumerate all the subsets of species with a simple integer loop:Result:If you also need the code to test if a group contains a subset, you need to specify how the groups are stored in your program.If this post answers your question, you should click the green checkmark ✔ on the top left corner.
