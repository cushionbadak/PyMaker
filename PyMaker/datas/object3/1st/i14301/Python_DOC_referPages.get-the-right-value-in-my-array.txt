I am trying to save only the DateTime, and DateTimeOriginal in an array list.When I run this script, I get the following output when I print my arraylist:I am trying to only get the following output, like I get with the print function:My code:What is the best way to store DateTime and DateTimeOriginal if I have to use them later on? Is it better to put them in a variable? How can I do that?What I am trying to do is:Getting the time dates of images and put them in a timeline. So I have to use my output later on in my script, but I don't know how I can store it.
It is the same tag instances in both cases, but with different string representations.You can either add str(tag) to your list, or use str(element) when reading them out again.Example:
I'm only about 80% sure I understand what you're asking, butâ€¦This prints out the string you want:This stores some complex tag object that you don't want:What you want is just the same string you printed out, not the tag object.If you look at the docs for printf-style String Formatting, the conversion type %s gives you:String (converts any Python object using str()).So, if you want to store the same thing that gets printed with %s, just call str(), the same way it does:I'm not sure why you want to build a list containing the string representations of all the DateTime and DateTimeOriginal tags interleaved like this, but if that's what you want, that's how to do it.
Try to use .printable to get just string representations. Actually if you'll check sources of exifread you'll see that str(tag) returns printable.
