Natural Text
I am working on creating a list from a long paragraph concatenated based on character count. As an example: if the character count is set to 100 the string containing a long paragraph should be split in to several lines with a max limit of 100. Lines should not contain incomplete words (if the line contains part of the word it should move to the next line).I can split the string but I can't think of handling incomplete words (words are set of characters separated from space). Finally, those lines should be returned as a list. 
First, split all text into words:Then loop through the words and add them one by one to the new string, until it's length not breaks the limit. In the case add the string to the list of results and start to create the next string.
Here is an example for using the textwrap library:Output:The method textwrap comes with many additional keyword arguments. Have a look into the documentation for more information.
