This question already has an answer here:Create (L[i], L[i+1]) tuple list from list L [duplicate]                    4 answers                I have an array that looks like thisand I would like a list of tuples that looks like this:What is the most convenient way to do this in python?Thanks!
see help(zip) or the website documentation of zip.Since zip limits itself to the shorter sequence,works too.EDIT: Steven brought up the interesting point that if a is very long, doing the implicit copy to get the separate pyObject that is a[1:] is problematic. In this case, you might want to use numpy and its options to get a view on the same data with but a offset.
This can be done using list comprehension and list slicing, you iterate over the elements upto len(a) - 1 and on each iteration slice the elements form current_index and the element next to it.
