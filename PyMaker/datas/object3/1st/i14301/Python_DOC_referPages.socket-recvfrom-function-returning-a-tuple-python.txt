I'm a python noobie and I must create a Truco (brazillian game, if you don't know) game that connects 4 machines. I'm doing it with classes, using pickles to transfer it to a socket. According to what I could find online, this should work, but my recv is a tuple, and I can't use loads from a tuple. I've tried to convert it to a list, and then to a string, but nothing works!And here is my send method:Where m._dados is self.dados = pickle.dumps(dados, 2)Can anyone help?
You probably want to read through socket and then do something like recv = machine._socketrcv.recvfrom(1024)[0]socket.recvfrom(bufsize[, flags])Receive data from the socket. The return value is a pair (string, address) where string is a string representing the data received and address is the address of the socket sending the data. See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero. (The format of address depends on the address family â€” see above.)
recvfrom returns a tuple with the data and the address (more info can be found in the socket documentation). Unlike some other languages Python lets you put a tuple on the left hand side of an assignment, so if you do something like this:you will get access to all the information you need in separate named variables. In your case you just need the data:
