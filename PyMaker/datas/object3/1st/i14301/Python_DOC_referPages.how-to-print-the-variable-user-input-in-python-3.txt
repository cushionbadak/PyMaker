So basically, I have a python program but there's a point in which I need help.When the user input the variable name, I want it to print the variable value, not the variable name, even if the variable doesn't exist. This is what I've currently got:Oh, and just in case it's not clear, i'm sort of working on a coding language sort of thing.
You can just call eval(CMD[17:-1]).However, this evaluates more than just variable names, so be careful that the user cannot do anything malicious with your code.
To get the value of a global variable by name, use the globals() dictionary:
You can get the local (function's) scope as a dict with locals() and the global (module's) scope as a dict with globals(). Now you may want to read a bit more about parsing, AST etc...
