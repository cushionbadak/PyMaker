I have been trying to create a Caesar cipher program. To make it as inclusive as possible I want to be able to use upper case letters as well. I know how to load a lower case alphabet:(I have timed it by two to allow the user to encrypt all letters)I would really like some help. It is my first time submitting a question and I would appreciate any help I get
There is string.ascii_uppercase as well as string.ascii_lowercase (documentation). For testing if a letter is upper case and do something for uppercase letters in a message you can do this:You can also use isupper() method (documentation):If you want to check whether the whole message is upper case, then isupper() is actually better as it checks the whole string:
If there is a string.ascii_lowercase then surely there is a string.ascii_uppercase. Give it a try.
You can usestring.uppercaseThis is locale-dependent, and value will be updated when locale.setlocale() is called.Please refer - https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html
This loop will make a string with all uppercase letters and save it in letters_str
