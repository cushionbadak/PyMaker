One can can implement the method __str__(self) to return a string. Is there an __list__(self) counterpart? (__list__ doesn't work!)Is .toList() the way to go?
There is no direct counterpart, but list() is implemented by iterating over the argument. So implement either the iterator protocol (__iter__()) or bound indexing (__len__() and __getitem__()).
