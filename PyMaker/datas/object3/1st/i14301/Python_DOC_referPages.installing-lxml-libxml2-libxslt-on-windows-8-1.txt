After additional exploration, I found a solution to installing lxml with pip and wheel. Additional comments on approach welcomed.I'm finding the existing Python documentation for Linux distributions excellent. For Windows... not so much. I've configured my Linux system fine but I need some help getting a Windows 8.1 tablet ready as well.My project requires the lxml module for Python 3.4. I've found many tutorials on how to install lxml but each has failed.https://docs.python.org/3/installing/I've downloaded the "get-pip.py" and successfully ran it from the Windows cmd line with the result:So I don't think that I have a "pip" problem. From there I've run the following from the Windows cmd line:A long list of commands scroll through but there are a couple of lines that appear to be errors that I'm unable to resolve.andAnd the last part, all in redAny assistance in understanding how this should work, or what I'm doing wrong would be greatly appreciated.
I was able to fix the installation with the following steps. I hope others find this helpful.My installation of "pip" was working fine before the problem. I went to the Windows command line and made sure that "wheel" was installed.After that I downloaded the lxml file from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml and placed it in my python directory "C:\Python34"In that directory I ran the following:The results were:I opened PyCharm and lxml module was available. I was able to execute the code without problem.What I learned (though this may be corrected by others more knowledgeable)Need to install the desired module (as a "*.whl" file) using pip and wheel.Using Dropbox to share a code folder with different PyCharm installations causes confusion for the "workspace.xml" file. The two computers kept writing over each other, messing up the installation paths. Hope this helps.
My situation was a lot like this. I have Python 3.4 installed on my Laptop for work, and we're in a tight security, so I can't just install 3.5 without getting system admin to do it.So I hit up Python Extension site here:http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxmlPulled the wheel file for lxml that matched my specs:And then just typed:And it installed right away.
I started working with lxml a little while ago, when there was a need to parse some html files. I somehow installed it and then after some time I lost the installation because of PC format. Installing lxml on Windows from the available binaries/wheels is quite easy. The below link has the binaries/wheels in case you need them.http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxmlAfter downloading the wheel file as per your Windows you can issue the below commandpip install <pathtoyourdownloadedwheelfile>And In case you are using git-sdk-win32 for Windows, You can first search the libxml2-devel,libxml2-python and libxslt-devel, libxslt-python using pacman by issuing the below command.pacman -Ss libxml2and pacman -Ss libxsltthen you can install lxml using the below commandpip install lxmlIt might fail to build the wheel(as it did for me) but will install lxml using the setup.pyI simply have started loving this git-win32-sdk. It helps me work on my Windows with what I have learnt on Linux.https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/releases
This issue appears to be fixed as of lxml version 4.2.5.If you're still getting this error and you're specifying a specific version of lxml in a requirements file, try updating the requirements file to specify lxml version 4.2.5 or above.I had this error with lxml 4.2.1. But it was fixed when I changed the requirement to lxml 4.2.5.
