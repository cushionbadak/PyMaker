This question already has an answer here:What does the Python Ellipsis object do?                    10 answers                I was looking at the source code of a Blender add-on and I saw a new syntax:What is the meaning of ...?
... is a literal syntax for the Python Elipsis object:It is mostly used by NumPy; see What does the Python Ellipsis object do?The code you found uses it as a sentinel; a way to detect that a no other value was specified for the clss keyword argument. Usually, you'd use None for such a value, but that would disqualify None itself from ever being used as a value.Personally, I dislike using Ellipsis as a sentinel; I would always create a dedicated sentinel instead:Using the ... notation outside of a subscription (object[...]) is a syntax error in Python 2, so the trick used limits the code to Python 3.
