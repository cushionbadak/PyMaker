Natural Text
I have a program that polls a servers current Wi-Fi status every minute, and saves that info to a .txt file. The output is:*****CURRENT WIFI SIGNAL STRENGTH*****:           Link Quality=57/70  Signal level=-53 dBm The text file contains many of these lines. What I'm trying to accomplish is:-Find the signal dBm values in all the lines, and append them to an array so I can then I can do other functions such as sort and average. I can't seem to get it working quite right. Does anyone know how to do this?Thank you!
I would go through each line in the file and split the line at =, then get the last value, split it at the space, and then get the first value which would yield -53.Or list comprehension:
Then you can either make use of the re module:Or without it (inspired by heinst's answer):
Assuming that the signal level is the only negative number on any line you could use a regular expression with the findall function to search for all negative numbers in the file and return them as a list of strings (based on MC93's answer).Alternatively, you could get a list of ints with a list comprehension.
