I have a list of items that have X and Y coordinates. Now, there's a method that takes X and Y parameters and should return a the list of coordinates ordered from the closest to the farthest based on the given parameters.Basically, it looks something like this:I'm new to Python so I have pretty much no idea how to order the items. How would I do that?
You can pass a custom function to sort using the key parameter like this:
You can use key in sorted function.   
You need a function to get the distance between two points, I'll leave this function to you.  It will return the distance between two points, one point will be your main point, the other from the list.Use this function in the sorted method on the array of points.
See the sort method of list, especially the key argument. It allows you to put a function which returns the key for sorting. So in your example it could be something like this:assuming that distance(a, b) returns a distance between points a and b. Also note that sort() sorts the list in place, i.e. modifies the original list. If you want to return a new list which is sorted use the sorted function.By the way - the class as you defined it is probably not going to work as you expect - the x and y fields are class fields. For them to be instance fields you have to define them in the constructor instead:
