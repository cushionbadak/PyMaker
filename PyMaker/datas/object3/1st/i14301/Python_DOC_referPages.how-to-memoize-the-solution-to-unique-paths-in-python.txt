I've been trying to solve this problem for a while. A M x N grid is given and we've to find number to paths from top left corner to bottom right corner. Simple problem though; there are many solutions as well. Here're the details.http://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/math/problems/paths/http://articles.leetcode.com/2010/11/unique-paths.htmlI solved this problem in Java, and wrote one more solution in Python. Now I want to modify the previous solution with Memoized table so that the final answer gets collected at the bottom right cell. Value of a cell is the sum of its right and left adjacent cells.Here's the code I can't debug:-And here is my previous solution that works - But doesn't use memoized table. Test Cases:-3, 3 = 615, 9 = 319770
The issue is with the initialization of the matrix. You essentially create the same row duplicated in every column so when you update a cell, all corresponding cells in all columns get updated.Instead of:Use:
