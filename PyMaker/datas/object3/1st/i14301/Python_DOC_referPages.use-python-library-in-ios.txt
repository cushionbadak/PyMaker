I want to use a python library https://github.com/yann2192/pyelliptic in iOS to encrypt/decrypt.I've gone through the following posts:Is that possible to run a python built program on iOS as a static lib?Embedding Python in an iPhone appBut found no luck.Is there any way to do so?
I use pythonista on my iPad and works perfectly with libraries compatible with python 2.7. If the library you wan to use depends only on the standard library (also numpy and matplotlib are supported) then it's easy (dependency to other libraries can be solved too, but takes more work). Simply, you need to copy/paste the library source in a plan script into pythonista and then you can import it from your script also running in pythonista.I am sure there are other software that do the same but I have experience only with that one.
