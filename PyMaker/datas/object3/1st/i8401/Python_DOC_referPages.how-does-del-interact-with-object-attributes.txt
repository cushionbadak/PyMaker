This question already has an answer here:What does “del” do exactly?                    1 answer                Variable scopes in python classes                    4 answers                I'm new to Python and saw this code snippet:I understand why the first and the second print statements print 2, respectively 3. Coming from a Java background however, I don't understand what happens in the line 'del c1.abc' and why the last print statement prints 2 and not some kind of an error. Can someone explain? If possible by comparing to Java?
The sticky issue to a Python beginner here is that abc is a class variable (i.e. a "static" variable), and when you do c1.abc = 3, you shadow the class variable with an instance variable. When you do del c1.abc the del applies to the instance variable, so calling c1.abc now returns the class variable.The following interactive session should clear some things up:It is del.<someattribute> always deletes the instance attribute. It won't delete a class-level attribute if applied to an instance, instead, you have to apply it to the class!In Python, everything written inside a class block is always at the class level. In this sense, it is simpler than Java. To define an instance variable, you need to assign directly to an instance, outisde a method (c1.abc = 3) or inside a method, using the first parameter passed to that method (by convention this is called self but could be banana if you wanted):
