I want to extract the sunrise hour and if I do the followingI got the errorI can print the string r1 but not extract from it (?)I tried solutions from similar problem posts on extraction but couldn't make any progress, apologies if this appears to be a double post.
As I understand your question you want to print only hour of sunrise. r1 is object of ephem.Date type. You could make it with brute forceor you could convert r1 object to datetime, and datetime to str representationor convert it to tuple firstAll available options you could read at this page in section Conversions.
@kvorobiev answered the question of how to extract from a string representation of your data. But the other half of your question was the error: 'ephem.Date' object has no attribute '__getitem__'According to the PyEphem documentation for the next_rising() function, If the search is successful, returns a Date value.Furthermore, Date objects have an important property:Dates are stored and returned as floats. Only when printed, passed to str(), or formatted with '%s' does a date express itself as a string giving the calendar day and time.When you gave the command risehr = r1[10:12], the Python interpreter attempted to get call Date.getattr() to get the fields from a Date object corresponding to the slice 10:12. Without that method, slicing has no meaning to a Date object.But all is not lost! You can still get the Date object's time information:Call .tuple() to split a date into its year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.You can then slice this tuple as needed to get the hour:hour = r1.tuple()[3]Or exhaustively:year, month, day, hour, minute, second = r1.tuple()
