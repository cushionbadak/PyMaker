Consider the following python package structureand say inside file1.py I have defined a function, func1() and I've also imported some functions from numpy with something like from numpy import array. Now I want to import and use mypackage from test_run.py without seeing these numpy functions in the namespace. I want to import it using import mypackage as mp and seeI don't want to see mp.file1.array(). How can I do it?
One possibility would be to use underscores:Although this doesn't prohibit people from accessing mp.file1._array it is a general considered that variables beginning with underscores are 'private'.AFAIK, there is no simple way to disallow access to any variable in python. (one way would be to make it properties of a class, see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property)
