I am trying to run my python file that first reads a string in Chinese language and print it.This is my DockerfileThis is my python file:I then run :docker build -t python-example .docker run python-exampleError i got: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-8: ordinal not in range(128)When i run it locally, it works fine. 
I ran into the same issue while I was deploying a Django application with supervisor and gunicorn. What fixed it was to add the following line to my supervisor config file:For your case make sure that the chinese locale that you want to print is available and installed in your docker container. This blog describes how to do it: example dockerfile (use the chinese locale instead of en_CA.UTF-8):hopefully this leads you into the right direction.
Short versionPut this in your Dockerfile:or as mentioned in the comments above pass it on the command line:Long version:When you start the Python interpreter, Python has to set up stdout in order to send output to your terminal. On your modern O/S, your terminal probably reports that it supports UTF-8 or some other advanced encoding. You can see what encoding is used by running this command:When you run a docker container, the environment variables Python would expect to use a more advanced encoding are not present, and so Python will fall back to a basic character set to ensure compatibility. You can verify this by running the same command in your container:When we pass PYTHONIOENCODING we see the sys.stdout.encoding is set appropriately:Read about PYTHONIOENCODING in the Python documentation. This answer also goes into great detail about encoding/decoding and stdout.
I add the below command in my docker fileï¼šthen build/rebuild docker images, you'd better add this in the base image.
