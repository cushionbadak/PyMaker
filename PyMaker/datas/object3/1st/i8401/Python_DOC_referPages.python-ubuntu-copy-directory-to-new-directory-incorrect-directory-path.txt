I'm trying to write my first Python script, and it is not going well.I am trying to copy an entire local directory on my Ubuntu machine and place it and its contents in a different on my OS. I did some research and found distutils.dir_util.copy_tree(src,dst) should do just that.This is the contents of my backup_images.py file:When I run it, I get error(s) on every line. When I run ./backup_images.py in terminal, this is the output:If I run the same command with sudo (sudo ./backup_images.py), I get completely different errors:Based on the first couple errors of this, (src: not found,dst: not found), it seems Python isn't able to find the directories I assigned the  src and dst files to. Is this correct?Because of the changing errors, I'm unsure of how to fix my code.
Don't use distutils to do this. Instead use shutil.copytree() to perform a recursive copy of a directory and all its files and subdirectories.
