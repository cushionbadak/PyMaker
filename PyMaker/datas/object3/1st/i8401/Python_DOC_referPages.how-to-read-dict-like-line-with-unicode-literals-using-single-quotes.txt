Natural Text
Looking for an efficient way to read a dict-type line containing unicode keys/values which themselves contain one or more single quotes. For example, consider a file with the following single line of text:What is the most efficient way to read this line into a python dict object? I've gotten around it by using regex replace but want to make sure there's not some simpler tool for this.Edit: This is very different from this question about lists because it deals with single-quote unicode literals that contain problematic single quotes inside the string values.
You can use ast.literal_eval for this.As the docs explain: Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. The string or node provided may only consist of the following Python literal structures: strings, bytes, numbers, tuples, lists, dicts, sets, booleans, and None.As long as your values are one of those, this is a good solution.
