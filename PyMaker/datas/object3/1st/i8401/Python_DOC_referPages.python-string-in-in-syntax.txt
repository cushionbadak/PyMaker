Natural Text
It is strange to see a piece of code using 'str in str in str' syntax, e.g.:It seems the 'in...in...' is similar to '<...<...' comparison. But a quick google did not guide me to the official answers. Any help?
Official answer from the Python documentation:The in keyword is a comparison operator. And "Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily". Note that this isn't restricted to "value comparisons" (>, ==, etc.).The code in question checks whether each is a substring of the next item in the chain.
