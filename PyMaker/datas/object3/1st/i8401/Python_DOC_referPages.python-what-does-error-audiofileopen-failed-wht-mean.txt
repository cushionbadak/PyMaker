I am trying to run this code but it causes the following error: Error: AudioFileOpen failed ('wht?'). So here's my code-it's running on a Mac and with a folder of mp3 files if that is any help:Any help is welcomed and greatly thanked
Have a look at this (from your question):and remember what music contains: a list of file names (e.g. "Adele - Hello.mp3"). When you pass them to afplay you aren't telling it which directory to look in. (Note that the error message is not coming from Python, but rather from afplay itself; e.g. see this other question where the same command is called from C.)Try using os.path.join() to include the directory, e.g.That way afplay will receive an absolute path like "/Users/you/Desktop/Music/Adele - Hello.mp3".
