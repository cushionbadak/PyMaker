I'm using python and I'm trying to detect if someone types quit, then stop the program.Here is my code:I run it and it doesn't work. I proceeded to try this code:To see if it has something to do with the word quit, but it didn't work either. Then I tried this code:And it worked, but I don't know why. Does anyone know how to get quit to work?
is is an identity operator. It is used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical. To check if inpt contains '>>>' string use either in or == (if you want to be more specific) operator.
