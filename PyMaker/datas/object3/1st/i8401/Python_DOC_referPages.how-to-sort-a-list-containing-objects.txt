I have the following code:When I print the list I get the following:Now I want to sort the list so that I get this output:So how can I sort the list with the Data objects in it?
You could do this:If you want to sort elements in lst by s[0].sorted function has a parameter key that you can specify a function that returns the key to sort.sorted function in Python Document:sorted(iterable[, key][, reverse])...key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element: key=str.lower. The default value is None (compare the elements directly).
