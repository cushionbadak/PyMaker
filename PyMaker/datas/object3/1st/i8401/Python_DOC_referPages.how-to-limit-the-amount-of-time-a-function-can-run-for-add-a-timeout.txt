How to set a limit on the maximum amount of time a function can run for?For example, using time.sleep as a placeholder function, how to limit the amount of time time.sleep can run to a maximum of 5 mins (300 seconds)?That is, how can time.sleep(600) above be limited and interrupted after 300 seconds?
On POSIX you have a simple and clean solution available in signal module.  Caveats:  Does not work on all platforms, e.g. Windows.  Does not work in threaded applications, only the main thread. For other readers where the caveats above are a deal breaker, you will need a more heavyweight approach.  The best option is usually to run the code in a separate process (or possibly a thread), and terminate that process if it takes too long.  See multiprocessing module for example.  
One of currently probably preferred options to accomplish what you want is usage of Pythons multiprocessing  ( especially its proc.join(timeoutTime) method )module ( see tutorial )Just copy/paste the code example below and run it. Does it what you are after?it outputs:Another known to me option is using a decorator function and the signal moduleCheckout the web page with origin of the code I have provided here (only one small adjustment was necessary to make it run on Python 3.6):The code above outputs:
