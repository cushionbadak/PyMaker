I'm struggling to deepcopy() a class containing a Decimal value. So I tried deep copying a Decimal object on its own and that failed too. What am I misunderstanding here?The class copies but the decimal reference remains the same.
Python's copy module will not produce copies of immutable objects, that'd be very inefficient. decimal.Decimal() objects are immutable, so they just return self for copy operations:See the decimal module documentation:A decimal number is immutable.Because they are immutable, there is no point in creating a copy; everywhere you could use the copy, you could safely use the original too, but without wasting the memory on two completely identical objects that can never diverge.
