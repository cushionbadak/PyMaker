I have a csv file that has two columns in it: one for names and the other for emails. I have been looking for a way to take the csv file and read it into two lists, one for each column, to later be processed into a database. Could someone please be of assistance? If it helps the file is formated like:
You can just read the file and convert it to list, and then split the line with comma:csv:Also you can use csv.DictReader():e.g.Result:Or pandas.read_csv() methodOutput:
file:A csv.reader object will produce ['a', 'b'] for each line/row of the file. You can use zip to transpose the result:You need to ensure that you have as many names on the left hand side of the assignment as there are columns in the csv file - or you could use extended unpacking to handle excess columns.
