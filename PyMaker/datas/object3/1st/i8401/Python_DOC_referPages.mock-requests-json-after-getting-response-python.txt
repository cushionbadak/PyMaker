I have testin the file I haveMy goal is to mock get_product_info() to return the return_value data in the test. I have tried mocking requests.json and requests.get.json, both error out on no attribute, I've mocked the_file.MyClient.get_product_info which doesn't cause error but doesn't work, it returns the real data.How can I mock this get_product_info which uses requests library? Thank you
You should be able to just patch get_product_info().Just switch __main__ to the name of your module. You might also find patch.object useful.
