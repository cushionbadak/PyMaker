I'm using Python 3.5.2, PyCharm Community Edition 2017.1.1 in Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTSI'm a beginner in Python and I'm trying to get this code to work.Actually it works fine in IDLE, but Pycharm is not recognising the builtins. Other common builtins functions like str(), int()... are woking fine.I searched in Pycharm support for solutions.The "Reload" button in Settings | Python Interpreters regenerates the skeletons for binary modules, including builtins. Please try pressing it.But its not working too. I get this in Pycharm...Thank you in advance.
You should not directly use the __builtins__ and instead use the builtins module. In the pycharm python console, the __builtins__ acts as a dict, which in that case, you will need to retrieve print by a = __builtins__['print'].  In contrast, if you run it as a script, the __builtins__ act as the module representation the builtins√∏ module. In that case, you will need to do it your way using either a = getattr(__builtins__, 'print') or a = __builtins__.print. But as I stated before, you should not directly use the __builtins__ keyword. You should do this instead:Perhaps also check this answer.
