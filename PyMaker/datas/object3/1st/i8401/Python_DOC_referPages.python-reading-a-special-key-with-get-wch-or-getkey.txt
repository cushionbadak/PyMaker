Suppose I have following setup:Now, according to the documentation, get_wch should return a character on normal characters, and an integer for special keys. However, when I run the above snippet and press, say, arrow up, the loop above fires up three times and gives three separate characters, instead of an integer. The same happens when I use getkey: three characters instead of a multibyte string (as docs say it should return). How do I read a special key? Is it a bug, or do I miss something obvious? I'm running the code on Linux and Python 3.6.1, if it matters.
You output something so it is read in the next loop iteration! Flush/clear the input after you print somethingâ€¦
