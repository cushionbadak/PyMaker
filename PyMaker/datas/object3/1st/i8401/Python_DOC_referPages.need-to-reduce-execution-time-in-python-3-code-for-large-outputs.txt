This is a program that has the first input for the number of elements in the input array , the second input is the input array and the third input is the numbers to be counted in the list Input format is as shown below:6 1 1 1 2 2 0 6 1 21034Output layout is as follows:3231NOT PRESENTNOT PRESENTI need to reduce execution time for large inputs, any tips on how to do so for this particular problem?
Slowness probably comes from here:since list.count has to read the whole list each time.You can speed it up by putting each number from the input array in a dictionary (number -> how often it appeared in the array). Below I use collections.Counter, which is just a convenient wrapper around dicts:
to answer on the query number faster, you can build a dictionary mapping of number -> count.when receiving query number, use the dictionary mapping to return the result in O(1) amortized (instead of O(n) of the original naive solution)build the mapping O(n):answer a query "how many times x in array" O(1) on averageYour code updated
In addition to the existing answers, you could try Pypy: https://pypy.org“If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum (creator of Python)
