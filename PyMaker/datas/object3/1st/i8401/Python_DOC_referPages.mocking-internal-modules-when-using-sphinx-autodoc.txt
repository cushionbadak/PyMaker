My python package has a module called settings.py which looks for a settings.ini file, and if one isn't found raises an Exception.My package works fine but when I try and use Sphinx Autodoc it fails because it can't find a settings file.What options do I have for getting around this? The ones I can think of arePut a settings.ini file in one of the Sphinx directories so it can be read.Somehow mock the internal settings module if possible. The settings module is unimportant so I don't care if there is no documentation for it to the suerHas anyone run into a similar issue when trying to generate Sphinx documentation on packages that need external files and if so what is your solution?
Pyramid has a command-line script pserve which loads an .ini settings file.To document this script, we use autoprogram as follows:and in your conf.py:It requires the use of argparse in your script.
