Let's say I have the following list of lists of tuples:How would I go about grouping them based off of the first element (date) and adding the other element.For instance I'd like something like this:
The solution using itertools.chain.from_iterable, itertools.groupby and sum functions:The output:
First, flat a list of tuples out of a list of lists of tuples, and then use itertools.groupby,
My way is to convert the nested list to flat list and iterate it:Output:If you want a list, you can use [(k,v) for k,v in a.items()])
Flattening the list then using defaultdict:returns{'2017-04-11': 2000000.0, '2017-04-12': 1472943.0, '2017-04-13': 4000000.0}
