I have a file on my desktop, with the full path:C:\Users\Evgeny\Desktop\f.pybut python was ran from:C:\Users\EvgenyThe problem is, that I can't do exec(open('f.py').read())I include the first path to enviroment variables, but it doesn't work.For example, when I do import f it works completely okay.enter image description hereCan it be possible to run the open('f.py') from another directory  not using full path to the file?
open() is a tool to open any file on the filesystem. It is not a tool to find Python modules.Python's import machinery is fairly complex (it can be extended, adjusting how modules are found or loaded) and out of the box supports cached bytecode files with different extensions (.pyc, .pyd, in a __bytecache__ directory or not), loading from .zip files, and loading native extensions, all from a series of configurable directories listed on sys.path. This machinery is also there to allow you to override modules with different versions, simply by putting them in a different location on the search path.The vast majority of use-cases for the open() function, however, do not need this machinery, you want to open your cat pictures from your Desktop, and not have to worry about the cat.py module in a different directory.You can re-use the module resolution behaviour of the import machinery by using the importlib.util.find_spec() module:This does require that your Desktop folder is on your sys.path module search path.
