I'm new in Python and i have this problem. When I run my scripts it shows this error:  My code has this import structure:graph_lyb.py:dfs_lib.py:message.py:forest.py:race.py:Code is running without inf import.
You do not have to import inf from math module. The math.isinf function exists but for defining an infinite value you can use float('inf').
As mentioned, math.inf is new with python 3.5. inf has always been around as float('inf') and math.inf is really just a convenience. If you like using math.inf, you can restrict your code to supported versionsor you can just add it yourself
Which python version do you use?The inf constants in mathpackage is implemented at Python 3.5(related link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.inf)You should check the version of Python you use.
