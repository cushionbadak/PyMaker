Using optparse, I currently have:which is then feeding into a function that accepts opts:I'm trying to now use argparse, but the formatting for argparse is different:which doesn't allow me to feed the opts into the function. I was wondering if there's any way to use argparse while maintaining opts to feed into the function.I'm using Python 2.7.
The end of the argparse docs page describes the basic differences.In optparse, all flagged arguments are captured in the opts variable.  Everything else is in the args list.In argparse, both flagged (also called optionals) and positionals are collected in the args Namespaceparse_known_args gives an output that is closer to optparse:extras are strings that it can't parse; roughly corresponding to the 2nd variable returned by optparse.Fire up an interactive shell, define a couple of parsers, and play with the different arguments.  And of course print the outputs ('opts','args','extras') to see what they produce.If you have further questions, include sample parsers and outputs in your question.  optparse parsing:argparse parsingparse_known_args:
You can use argparse in a very similar way to optparse. From the documentation you can see that you just need to prefix arguments with either - or -- and it becomes an optional parameter.Here's an example from the documentation:Additionally, you can change the prefix chars if your program needs to have options that are prefixed by different charaters:
