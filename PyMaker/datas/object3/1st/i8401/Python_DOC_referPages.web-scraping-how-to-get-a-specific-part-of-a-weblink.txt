Natural Text
i have the following link:https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jAc7OJyyQboJ:https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnkI have multiple links in a dataset. Each link is of same pattern. I want to get a specific part of the link, for the above link i would be the bold part of the link above. I want text starting from 2nd http to before first + sign.I don't know how to do so using regex. I am working in python. Kindly help me out.
If each link has the same pattern you do not need regex. You can use string.find() and string cuttingThis will return "https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook" and will work if the link follows the same pattern as described (it is the second https:// in the link and ends with + sign)
I'd go with urlparse (Python 2) or urlparse (Python 3)  and a little bit of regex:Output:
