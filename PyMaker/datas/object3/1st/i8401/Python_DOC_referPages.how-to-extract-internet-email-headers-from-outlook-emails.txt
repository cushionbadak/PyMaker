Try using the HeaderParser module. This allows you to parse through html in python to find headlines and headers and such.https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.parser.html
If you are using the Outlook Object Model,  you need to read the PR_TRANSPORT_MESSAGE_HEADERS MAPI property (take a look at it in OutlookSpy - click IMessage button) using MailItem.PropetyAccessor.GetProperty.PR_TRANSPORT_MESSAGE_HEADERS DASL property name is http://schemas.microsoft.com/mapi/proptag/0x007D001F
