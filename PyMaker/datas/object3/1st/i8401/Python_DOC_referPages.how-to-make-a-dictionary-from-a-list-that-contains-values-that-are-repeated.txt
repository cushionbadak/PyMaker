I am new to python and I have struggling for a while in trying to convert the following list into a dictionary. AB_MK1230 is the parent sector and MK12303, MK12301 and MK12302 are the child sectors. My output is to have a dictionary with the key of each child sector and the parent sector and float values as the values for that key, something like the following.I have read some documentation from https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=dictionaries but I still can't figure out the solution.How can I achieve this?
We iterate over the list, unpacking three items at a time in (parent, child, value)-order. Using (parent, child) as a key into a dictionary we then add the value into a set.d is now a dictionary likeIt's not entirely clear how your final data structure is supposed to look like. If you only want parent as the top-level key, you can use a nested defaultdict...
