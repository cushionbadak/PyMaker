I'm trying to run python -m pdb -c continue foo.py, in order to enable debugging upon errors. The -c continue arguments should allow me to do this without specifying 'c' upon program start. However, I receive the error: Error: -c does not exist. I will demonstrate the versions and setup below with a virtualenv example.Then:After installing pdb locally into the virtualenv:Running without -c continue works fine (although I'm surprised to see it using /usr/lib/python2.7/pdb.py instead of the local pdb? even when I retried with virtualenv --no-site-packages, it still showed that same path):
You are using Python 2.7, which doesn't support the -c parameter:New in version 3.2: pdb.py now accepts a -c option that executes commands as if given in a .pdbrc file, see Debugger Commands.By upgrading your Python to version 3.6 would solve the problem.I didn't find any package on PyPI that backports the 3.2+ pdb package to Python 2.7. The one you were trying to install is a "password database".
