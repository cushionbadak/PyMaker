I have a problem with return selfI have already seen this question return self problem but I can't understand what the benefit is of return self?
Returning self from a method simply means that your method returns a reference to the instance object on which it was called. This can sometimes be seen in use with object oriented APIs that are designed as a fluent interface that encourages method cascading. So, for example, Now we can use method cascading:Notice, the last call to decrement() returned <__main__.Counter object at 0x1020c1390>, which is self.Now:Notice, you cannot do this if you did not return self:Notice, not everyone is a fan of "method cascading" design. Python built-ins do not tend do this, so, list for example:The one place you do often see this is when your class implements the iterator protocol, where iter on an iterator returns self by convention, although this is suggested by the docs:Having seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to  add iterator behavior to your classes. Define an __iter__() method  which returns an object with a __next__() method. If the class  defines __next__(), then __iter__() can just return self:Notice, this in effect makes your iterator only useful for a single pass:
This is needlessly complex code. Pay little attention to it. There's no reason on earth to implement it this way.That being said, what it does is this:This is all much easier to express as:Examples:
