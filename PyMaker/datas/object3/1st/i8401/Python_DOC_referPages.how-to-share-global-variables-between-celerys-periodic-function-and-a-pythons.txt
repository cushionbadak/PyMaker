I am using Celery's periodic function to do batch updates of my database. The data to be inserted is stored in a global list by some other function of the same script. The problem is, whenever the Periodic function executes, it see the list as an empty one.Following is the code snippet for the same:Can someone help me with this?
Use your backend. As I can see it's mongo. Store data to the mongodb when you are doing writeLog and read it in your batchUpdate.Please pay attention to nature of the data you want to store. It likely should be serializeable as pickle or json.
