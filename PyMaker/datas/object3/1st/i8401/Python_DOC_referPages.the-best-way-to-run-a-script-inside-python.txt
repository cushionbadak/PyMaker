I would like to call a script inside Python.I tried os.system but I'm afraid it's not the best option.Python version 2.3.4I have the code below:start = /xxxx/xxx/xxxx/_mfgadd.bashmiddle, filename, final and urlfinal are arguments for .bash.Well, when I just tried:It works perfectly. So, what is the best way to execute "runScript"?Thanks
