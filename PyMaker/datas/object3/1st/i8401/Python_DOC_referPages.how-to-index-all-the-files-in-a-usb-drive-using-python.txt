I want to index all the USB files in a dictionary with the path to them and the name of the file. I know I'll have to use recursion to analyse all the nested folders. I'm just not sure how to list those files, and access the USB drive. I looked around and found how to write to a USB but not how to list all the files in it. Thanks in advance.
Sure, you can use a script like this (filling in your own path to the USB):Now to run this, e.g. in unix/mac:Then you should see the contents of the USB listed in somefile.txt.
You can use this script with your usb path
