I have python to generate a random code, in this case, "Lucy", and it prints as follows:I don't understand how it works, can someone explain?Why is the charCount initialized outside the loop? Why does it print the characters the way it does?
The reason why charCount is initialized outside of the loop is because of scope.A variable defined in the main part of the body belongs to the "global" scope. This means that it can be accessed by anything else throughout the file.But a variable that is defined inside a function/loop is "local" to that function. This means that it only exists and is accessible from the point at which it is defined until the end of the function.When we use the assignment operator (=) inside a function, its default behavior is to create a new local variable â€“ unless a variable with the same name is already defined in the local scope.So essentially, when we declare it inside of the loop as demonstrated below. It is re-initalizing the variable to = "" each time it loops through which is why it only prints out one character at a time. I.e. Variable declared outside loop:Variable declared inside loop:
What this does is initialise a variable charCount which is your string. Then we have a for loop. What this does is iterate through each letter of your string. Then it will get the original string (which starts off blank) and adds a letter at a time.Then print displays it. The reason for declaring outside the loop is so that you can concatenation each letter to it.Trying to do the charCount = charCount + mysteryChar when charCount doesn't exist will throw and error. So you create a blank string outside so that you can do this:
From Python's Official Documentation - 8.3 The for Statement"The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list)..."In your example of code, "Lucy" is the string. The string is the sequence. The characters that compose it (i.e. "L", "u", "c", "y") are the "elements of a sequence."I'm going to walk through your code line-by-line to see if it helps.1.You assign sys.argv[1] to the variable mysteryString. Your sys.argv[1] is the string "Lucy".2.The program takes the variable mysteryString, formats the string with it, and prints the output.3.This line initializes the variable charCount. Note that it is empty.4.This line marks the beginning of the for-statement (aka for-loop). The for-statement iterates (or "loops over") every element in the provided sequence. In order to loop over a sequence, you must assign each element in it to a variable. Here, that variable is mysteryChar. The first element of the sequence (i.e. the character "L") is assigned to variable mysteryChar.If it helps, you can think of what is happening at this point as:5.This line does a couple of cool things. First, it takes the value of charCount and adds it to the value of mysteryChar. Second, it assigns the values of charCount and mysteryChar to charCount.Remember when in step 3, we assigned the variable charCount to an empty string?After step 5 executes:6.This line prints charCount.Code:Output:7.Now, try to follow the code.Code:Output:8.Continue to next iteration of the loop.Code:Output:9.Continue to the next iteration of the loopCode:Output:10.This is all of the for-loop's output.Output:Question:"Why does it print the characters the way it does"The for-loop prints the characters the way it does because it loops over each element in the sequence individually.First Iteration Output:Second Iteration Output:Third Iteration Output:Fourth Iteration Output:I started working on learning python about a year ago, so this stuff is relatively new to me, too. Welcome critiques / corrections if my explanation is misinformed.
