I have a configuration file where user can specify a set of shell commands.Commands are basically a chain of pipe-separated shell commands.I am able to read the commands in my Python scripts. My question is how will I be able to run these read command strings in Python and get the output.Any solution with subprocess, plumbum, sh will be acceptable.
Use subprocess.check_output()Something to be aware of is that unlike the other subprocess commands, a subprocess.CalledProcessError will be raised if a non-zero error code is returned.You shouldn't need to do this, but in case it comes in handy to somebody out there, I did run into an experience once where for some reason the above solution did not work, and so, instead, I did the following.
