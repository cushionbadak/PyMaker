I am new to python and have only started working with files. I am wondering how to combine the data of two files into one list using list comprehension to read and combine them.This is what I have so far. Thanks in advance!Update:However, this is only returning none
Like this:Although leaving files open like that isn't generally considered a good practice.
You can use zip to combine iterableshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
If its only 2 files why do you want to use comprehension together? Something like this would be easier:The question is, what if you had n files? lets say in a list ... fileList = ['f1.txt', 'f2.txt', ... , 'fn.txt']. Then you may consider itertools.chainI haven't tested it, but this should work ...
If you want to combine them by alternating the lines, use zip and comprehension:You need two iterations here because the return value from zip is itself an iterable, in this case consisting of two lines, one from f1 and one from f2.  You can combine two iterations in a single comprehension as shown.If you want to combine them one after the other, use "+" for concatenation:In both cases, it's a good practice to close each file:
You can achieve your task within lambda and map:I assume a data in in_file (first file) like this :And a data in in_file2 (second file) like this:And with this piece of code:The output will be:['1 23 45 67 8', 'hello there!']However, it's not a good practice to leave an opened files like this way.
Using only list comprehensions:However it is bad practice to leave files open and hope the GC cleans it up. You should really do something like this:If you want to strip end of line characters a good way is with line.rstrip('\r\n').
