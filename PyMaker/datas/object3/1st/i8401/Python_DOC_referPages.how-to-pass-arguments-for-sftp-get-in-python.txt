I got output for this. But, when I am trying to get output for the below lines of code,I am hitting with the below error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\Python scripts for  writing testcase\Paramiko.py", line 32, in       sftp.get('{1}/{2}'.format(pwd1,b),'{2}'.format(b)) IndexError: tuple index out of rangeHow I need to pass the arguments there, as the path will be changed for different selections.
number in the format string should starts from 0, not from 1.See Format string syntax.If you're using python 2.7+, you can omit the number completely. (auto numbering). And the second format can be just b (no need to use format at all, because b is already a string object)
'{2}'.format(b)You tell format to insert the second argument, yet only provide one. Change to {1}.
