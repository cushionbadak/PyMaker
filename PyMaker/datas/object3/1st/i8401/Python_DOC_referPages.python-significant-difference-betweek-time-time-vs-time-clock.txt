I am trying to test how long a http request processing code block takes inside my flask controller, here is the sample code I used:Here are the outputs:The second output from the time.time() function matches the actual seconds it took to display the results, so I am not sure why the value from time.clock() is so small?Edit: My system is OSX and python 2.7, and my question is that why is time.clock() generally considered "better" if time.time() reflects the actual time a user experiences/waits?
Note that as of Python 3.3 time.clock is now deprecated as the behavior is platform dependent. The documentation recommends using time.process_time or time.perf_counter for measuring performance. Otherwise I would recommend using the timeit module (especially since this allows you much more control over the testing environment)
