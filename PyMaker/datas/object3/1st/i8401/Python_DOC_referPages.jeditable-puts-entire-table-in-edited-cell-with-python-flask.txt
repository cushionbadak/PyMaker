Is there a way to return a response (from make_response() object or similar) with certain properties so that it doesn't render the page again and doesn't do anything else either. I am trying to run a code on the server without generating any output A simple 'return None' produces:This should be possible because the following only downloads a file and doesn't render the template: 
You are responding to a request, your HTTP server must return something. The HTTP 'empty response' response is 204 No Content:Note that returning a file to the browser is not an empty response, just different from a HTML response.
