I want to run a few python scripts in threads with a small C/++ program, but I need different python versions to run these scripts, because the package MySQLdb isn't working in python3 and some packages aren't available in python2. Or via Do you have any ideas or another way to solve my problem?
You can use system() call to execute your python scripts, but there is no need of specifying the version of python executable on the command line.You can use shebang.Use #!/usr/bin/python3 as the very first line for scripts that you want to run with python3 and #!/usr/bin/python2 in scripts that you want to run with python2.If you are working on windows then please have a look at python launcher
