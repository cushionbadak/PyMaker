There are problems with the statement dict[key] = [value] on so many levels that I get a kind of vertigo as we drill down through them:The apparent intention to use a variable called dict (a bad idea because it would overshadow Python's builtin reference to the dict class). Let's call it d instead.Not initializing the dictionary instance first. If you had called it something liked this oversight would earn you an easy-to-understand NameError. However since you're calling it dict, Python will actually be attempting to set items in the dict class itself (which doesn't support __setitem__) instead of inside a dict instance, so you'll get a different, more-confusing error.Attempting to make a dict entry assignment where the key is a non-hashable type (key is alist). You could convert thelist to the hashable type tuple easily enough, but that's not what you want because you'd still be...Attempting to assign bunch of values to their respective keys all at once. This can't be done with d[key] = value syntax.   It could be done all in one relatively simple statement, i.e. d=dict(zip(key,value)) but unfortunately that doesn't get around the fact that you're...Not stripping the newline character off the end of each key and value.Instead, this line:will do what you appear to want.
