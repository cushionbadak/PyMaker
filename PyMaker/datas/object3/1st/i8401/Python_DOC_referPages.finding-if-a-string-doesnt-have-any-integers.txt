This question already has an answer here:How to check if string input is a number? [duplicate]                    24 answers                I have the code:It basically tries to determine if the user's input is (mathematically) an integer or not. This works if the input is 'adgx'; the code recognizes that these aren't within the range 0-9, and print's 'That wasn't an integer.'. I need the program to print 'That wasn't an integer.' if the input is for example 'a3h1d', but it doesn't. I assume because the input technically contained numbers that were within the range, it satisfied the statement. I need it so that if the input is 'a3h1d' that the program prints 'That wasn't an integer.'.
You can also use re.match() plus the beginning-of-string and end-of-string markers:Remember that, in regex:^ Matches the start of a line;$ Matches the end of a line;+ Indicates that the previous pattern should appear one or more times.I would recommend taking a look at Python official 're' documentation for a more complete and well explained list.
If you aren't tied to the idea of using a regex for this, I would suggest simply using str.isdigitThere's also this approach
