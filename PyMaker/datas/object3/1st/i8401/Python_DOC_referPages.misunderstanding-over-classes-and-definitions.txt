This question already has an answer here:Passing variables, creating instances, self, The mechanics and usage of classes: need explanation [closed]                    3 answers                I have been given these two class definitions:The first two questions were fine; they simply asked (which is 7) and  print(w2.getY())What confuses me are the questions and print(w1.getY()) both of whose answers are apparently "error", but I don't understand why this is the case. The errors given are "x is not defined" and "y is not defined" respectively, but I thought x and y are the parameters that we put into the function. What am I missing?
In your first class, x and y are constructor arguments.They are not accessible out of this scope.In the getX function, x doesn't exists. You need to retrieve it from the self reference, such as in your second class.
