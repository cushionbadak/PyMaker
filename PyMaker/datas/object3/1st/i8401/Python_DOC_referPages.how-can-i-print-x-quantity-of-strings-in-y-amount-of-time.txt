Is really bothering me to try figure this out. I can explain myself:I need for example, to print 5 strings per second, so in 1 second I need to print those 5 strings, and the next second another 5.How can I divide the amount of time a loop (as I think it should be) runs in a second, so I can print the 5 strings in that time, and printed in equaly amount of time?each one printed in 200ms?how can I control in a loop the time of each iteration?
will work fine, but might give you some problems if you're looking for high precisionshould derive less from the 1 print every 0.2 seconds rule
Try something like:https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html for Python 2. https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html for Python 3.
