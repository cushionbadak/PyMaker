I have a function that can accept a date or a datetime as one of its arguments.  If the value is a datetime, I would like to convert it to its date components.  What is the pythonic way of doing that?
Since datetime objects are date objects, you should be able to call any date functions on datetime and have it work.But if you must:will normallize any datetime and date objects to date objects... now you only have to deal with them, as date objects are not datetime objects:NOTE: the reverse is not applicable:as datetime inherits from date.
You could first check if it is of type datetime.datetime and then go on to convert it to its date component using datetime.datetime.date().An example of this in code would be as follows.Importing the datetime module, and setting a variable d to be the current datetime.Then checking if d is a datetime object, and if it is set it to be its date counterpart.
