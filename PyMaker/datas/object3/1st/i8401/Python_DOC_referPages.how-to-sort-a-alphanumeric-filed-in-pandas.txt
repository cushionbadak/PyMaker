You can utilize the .sort() method:This will sort the list in place. If you don't want to change the original id list, you can utilize the sorted() methodNotice, with this one, that id is unchanged.For a DataFrame, you want to use sort_values().0 is either the numerical index of your column or you can pass the column name (eg. id)
