How do you obtain html values between tags without using Beautiful Soup with Python 3? I am trying to make a list out of the values between the tags. How would I do this? Would I use Regular Expression?How would I obtain the values like 'Chelsea', 'Tottenham', 'Liverpool'?Thanks 
I recommend bs4, but if you want to use regular expressions :   This will match any string between html tags  Keep in mind that search will return the first match ( if any , else none )If you want all occurrences , you should use findall instead
