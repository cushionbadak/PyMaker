EDIT: The computer in question was a client machine with restrictions on what software could be installed. I'm unsure if that may have been a cause of the issue or if the client's IT department gave the machine a corrupted version of pip. The recommended answers below probably would have worked but were blocked by the company's IT department and required admin login to do. I have since left that project and hope to avoid similar situations.I'm attempting to install a WHL fileWhile attempting to run:I received an Attribute error: I ran help(pip) and was listed as a package content.I'm running Python 3.4 in the console.
they made a refactoring. you can support both 9 and 10 pip by using:and then use pipmain as you used pip.main. for example
easy_install --upgrade pip worked for me.
My issue was related to my IDE (PyCharm). older versions of PyCharm does not support pip v10. Upgrading PyCharm solved it for me. 
For more recent versions of pip (pip>=10.0.0), the functionality described in the other answers will no longer work. I recommend running the pip with subprocess as follows:This solution uses the current python executable to run the pip command as a commandline command. It was inspired by the solution mentioned here.
