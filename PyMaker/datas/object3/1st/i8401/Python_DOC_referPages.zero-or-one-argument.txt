You need to use nargs argument with ?:'?'. One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible,  and produced as a single item. If no command-line argument is present,  the value from default will be produced.  ...NOTE: used type=int to check type and convert to int type. Otherwise returns string if the argument is specified, returns int 4 if no argument is specified.
