I have this list:and I want to get 4 random letters from it, but including repetition.Running this will only give me 4 unique letters, but never any repeating letters:How do I get a list of 4 colors, with repeating letters possible?
In Python 3.6, the new random.choices() function will address the problem directly:
With random.choice:If the number of values you need does not correspond to the number of values in the list, then use range:From Python 3.6 onwards you can also use random.choices (plural) and specify the number of values you need as the k argument.
Try numpy.random.choice (documentation numpy-v1.13): 
This code will produce the results you require. I have added comments to each line to help you and other users follow the process. Please feel free to ask any questions.
