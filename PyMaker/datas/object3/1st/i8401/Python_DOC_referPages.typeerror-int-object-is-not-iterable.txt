There is an error when I execute This code-for i in len(str_list):TypeError: 'int' object is not iterableHow would I fix it? (Python 3)
You are trying to loop over in integer; len() returns one.If you must produce a loop over a sequence of integers, use a range() object:By passing in the len(str_list) result to range(), you get a sequence from zero to the length of str_list, minus one (as the end value is not included).Note that now your i value will be the incorrect value to use to calculate an average, because it is one smaller than the actual list length! You want to divide by len(str_list):However, there is no need to do this in Python. You loop over the elements of the list itself. That removes the need to create an index first:All this can be expressed in one line with the sum() function, by the way:I replaced the name str with s; better not mask the built-in type name, that could lead to confusing errors later on.
For loops requires multiple items to iterate through like a list of [1, 2, 3] (contains 3 items/elements).The len function returns a single item which is an integer of the length of the object you have given it as a parameter.To have something iterate as many times as the length of an object you can provide the len functions result to a range function. This creates an iterable allowing you to iterate as any times as the length of the object you wanted.So do something likeunless you want to go through the list and not the length of the list. You can then just iterate with
