Is there a way, using pandas, to construct a Timestamp based on 3 input: the year (ex: 2010)the week of the year (ex: 3 : the 3rd week)the day of the week: (for instance Monday)In that particular example, the result would be Timestamp('2010-01-18')Anyone have a hint of a clever way to achieve this?
