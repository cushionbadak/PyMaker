What would be the best way to initialize attributes and check provided parameters when initializing a python class? Suppose that there are multiple parameters in the __init__() and some of them have to comply to certain rules. There is also the need to have setters and getters for some of them. I can think of the option from below. How does it look to you? Are there any better options?Option: Initialize attributes None and call the setter, where the check is performed.
If you need to run the validation on each assign, property is your way.Keep in mind that this might have a performance issue when you will have many assignments(like in a loop).Your issue can be solved by validate the input only on the initiation of the class, you better have a clean or validate method on your class, then call it in the end of the __init__ func. Using this method you can call your clean method whenever you need, and omit the call where performance are more important than the validation(This is how django forms works).In your case, your are trying to do overloading/dispatching, take a look at the docs
