I'm trying to launch a function in a new thread because the function makes something not related to the main program. I tried to do this with multiprocessing module as:But I have a bunch of error:Someone knows how I can launch whatever function I want in a new thread and be sure that the main program is still running normally? I'm a little lost with multiprocessing, I admit that :)I aim to launch some displays (graphical or print I don't know yet) for the user in new threads without interrupting the main program.
What you are doing isn't multithreading, it's muliprocessing.Change. with.  Python Â» 3.6.1 Documentation: threading.ThreadSO Q&A: multiprocessing-vs-threading-pythonBeside this, you can overcome the Error adding a time.sleep(0.2)after start(...
This is what I am getting when running the code you have provided: So the answer to your question is that you have to look for the cause of the trouble with multiprocessing elsewhere, but not in the section of code listed in your question. Take a close look at what was provided in answers and comments here - maybe it could help also in your case? Here what was said in comments to one of the answers there: Dave: Would this work if beBusyFor (in your case mp_worker) uses multiprocessing internally?@Dave just try it out and report back here if it worked. Haven't tested such a case yet, so my opinion that it should work leaving some mess of processes with no parents doesn't matter here and therefore shouldn't be taken in consideration.Dave: **No cigar ending child processes unfortunately** :(
