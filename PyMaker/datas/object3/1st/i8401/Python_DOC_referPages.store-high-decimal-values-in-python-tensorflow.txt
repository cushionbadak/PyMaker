value1 and value 2 is an array, has values close to each otherThis would result temp to have very high decimal valuesHowever, when I tried to print temp out, it contains array with 0.0 values due to high decimal values in the array.How do I maintain the precision of all the variables?
You can do that by setting the type of value1 and value2 before applying tf.sub. For example:This prints -1.000000082740371e-10Same for arrays:This prints array([ -1.00000008e-10,   1.00000000e-04])â€‹
