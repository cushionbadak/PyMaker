In the below code, I don't understand why download_progress_hook works without passing parameters when it is called from within the maybe_download method.The definition of download_progress_hook states that there are three parameters that have to be passed: count, blockSize, totalSize.But, when the download_progress_hook is called from maybe_download there are no parameters passed. Why doesn't it fail?Here is the full code:
I get everything, but the point where the function download_progress_hook gets called from within function maybe_downloadThat's where you went wrong. The function is not being called. It is only being referenced. There is no (...) call expression there.Python functions are first-class objects, you can pass them around or assign them to other names:Here spam is another reference to the function object foo. I can call that function object through that other name too.So the following expression:doesn't call download_progress_hook. It merely gives that function object to the urlretrieve() function, and it is that code that'll call download_progress_hook somewhere (passing in the required arguments).From the URLOpener.retrieve documentation (which ultimately handles that hook):If reporthook is given, it must be a function accepting three numeric parameters: A chunk number, the maximum size chunks are read in and the total size of the download (-1 if unknown). It will be called once at the start and after each chunk of data is read from the network.
