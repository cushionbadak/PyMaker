I want to round the float numbers in a list to floor in python, I tried math.floor([i]), the error is: a float is required and I also tried math.trunc([i]), I received this error: AttributeEror_trunc.I couldb't find any proper code to solve this problem. Any help would be appreciated!Here is the code that I have so far:
math.floor() only accepts a single float value argument (or an object with a __floor__() method). To apply it (or another callable taking a single argument) to a whole list you can use listÂ comprehensions as shown below:If you don't need the Speeds list for anything else, you could even combine the two list comprehensions into one and do things like this (although it's less readable):
math.floor requires a float value. But you seem to be passing a list of list instead. You can use list comprehension: That should get a list of rounded values from i. You can also work the map function:
