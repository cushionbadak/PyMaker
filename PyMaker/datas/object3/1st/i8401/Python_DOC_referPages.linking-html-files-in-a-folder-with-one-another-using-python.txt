I have a folder full of html files as follows:All these htmls are created using a python script, and hence follow the same template.Now, I want to link all these html files, for which I already have the placeholders in the html as follows:I want to fill these placeholders with the filenames in the folder. For example, bbb.html will have and the ccc.html file will contain:And so on for rest of the files.Can this task be done using python? I don't even know how to start with. Any hints, suggestions would be really helpful.
You can replace elements from your template by looping over the file list, with list wrapping. Here's an example for aaa.html using aaa,bbb,ccc:To do the list-wrapping I use this concept (After zzz comes aaa)Gives as an output for aaa.html:To complete the code, you'd have to loop over *.html files (see glob.glob)
You can use the beautifulsoup library to modify html:If the filenames aren't as consistent as in your example, and you want to generate the list from the files in the directory, you can use os.walk or glob.glob.
