I'm trying to write a program to display prime numbers in the interval from 2 to 50.  but I'm getting the wrong output (4, 9, 25, 49) when I call it (primeNr(50)) - I have no idea why.  As an extra question - How can I make the following code return a list with the following numbers, and then let's say I want to have two variables p and q which pick a random number from the prime numbers list, like  (Yes, it's linked to RSA).
The second parameter to range is not inclusive, so you need to do the following: (you can check out the document here: definition of python range)There are some opportunities for improvement mathematically, for example, you only need to loop up to math.sqrt, and the first moment you realize a number is not a prime, just break. (still not most optimized, to further optimize, you can check out various prime sieves).Below is based on some suggested edit made by @aryamccarthy (thanks for pitching the idea!). It utilizes a  particular python syntax - for...else (The else clause executes when the loop completes normally without encountering any break):
range does not include its end limit.  Thus you are finding numbers with three divisors (which are the squares of primes).
