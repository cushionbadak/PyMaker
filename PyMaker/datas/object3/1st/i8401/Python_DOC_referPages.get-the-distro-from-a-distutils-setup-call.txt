I want to unit test some Python extensions. To achieve this I'm running setup() in a script: To avoid leaving junk in the test directory I want to cleanup the build after the tests run. I'd like to run distutils.command.clean.clean() in the unittest tearDown(). How do I get the dist object for the distro that must be passed as an argument to clean()?Thanks
It looks like your call to setup() should return a Distribution instance.See the setup() function for a list of keyword arguments accepted by the Distribution constructor. setup() creates a Distribution instance.
