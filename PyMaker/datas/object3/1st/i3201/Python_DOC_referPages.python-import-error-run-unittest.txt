Why am I getting import error for a module I have in the project. All the packages are under the project, they all have __init __.py and other scripts do not give the same error. Python version is 3.6. Code was written in Unix environment.Here is the import error I get. I am trying to run a test here.
Looks like you are missing a project's root path in PYTHONPATHFrom the docs (Modules - The Module Source Path)When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches  for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches  for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the  variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:The directory containing the input script (or the current directory  when no file is specified). PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH). The installation-dependent default.If this solution doesn't work for you, please post the project's tree to make it easier find the problem.
