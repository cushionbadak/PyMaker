This is my code:The statement : print("Grade: ", s.calculate()) returns Grade:  O (two spaces) instead of Grade: O (single space).Since the above print statement is in locked stub code I can't modify it.Is there anyway I can remove the extra space while returning from calculate function?Edit: For better understanding of the problem consider thisimagein which the only difference is in my output's and expected output's third statement because of additional space.
The print function prints each of its arguments with a space as a delimiter already, so by adding a space in "Grade: ", you're making it print another space between the colon and the grade. Simply replace "Grade: " with "Grade:" and it will output without the extra space.
You can specify sep='', i.e. an empty string:Or you can remove the space from your first argument:Alternatively, you can use string formatting:To troubleshoot such problems, you can use the built-in help, which tells you the default argument for sep is a single space:Interestingly, the official docs have got it wrong:print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed  by end. sep, end, file and flush, if present, must be given as keyword  arguments.
Since the above print statement is in locked stub code I can't modify it.Is there anyway I can remove the extra space while returning from calculate function?If I not misunderstand, you can change caculate function, but not print, and you want just see one space in output, and you are in python3.Then you can use backspace \b, change E.g. return 'O' to return '\bO', and other return need to be changed also.A simple code for your quick test:
