I am just beginning with python and I'm trying to place a file inside a directory. The directory has a name with a number behind it that changes depending on the creation date. The function I'm using for placing the file takes only the directory + the file as an argument. So an argument for the function could be: C:\Program Files\example241\file.txt,  C:\Program Files\example948\file.txt etc. How would I place the file in that folder no mather what number it has? Could I use a wildcard?
you can use the glob module append the desired file name with the os moduleand then save the file to file_path
