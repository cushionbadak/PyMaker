Can different classes be operated in python? Like datetime added/reduced date: datetime.datetime(2018,07,18) - datetime.date(2018,07,18) ?
Yes, you can overload all operator methods of a class to make the respective operators work on the class.For example, the following class overloads the subtraction operator method __sub__ to perform subtraction based on its attribute n:This outputs 1.
You can't do that directly. You can add/subtract a specific duration from a datetime using the class datetime.timedelta 
Yes you can do as follows:Note that the subtraction in datetime is defined to give an object timedelta and with methods days it give the number of days as an integer. So type(a) gives <class 'datetime.timedelta's> and a.days the number 15
