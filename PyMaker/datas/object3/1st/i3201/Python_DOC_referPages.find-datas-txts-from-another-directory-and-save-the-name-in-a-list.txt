I need a command in Python to find a data (txt) somewhere on my computer.I wish I could give you example code, but I have none.
If you know the path to the directory containing the txt files, you can use glob:
You could use os, shlex and subprocess combined to achieve this:Hope this helps.
You can use subprocess.check_output() to run a Linux find command on a directory and collect the files ending with .txt:Where <PATH> is the relative/absolute path to your directory containing the files. Note: Since check_output() encodes your content in bytes, you need to use bytes.decode() to decode it to a string instead. Then you can split this string to collect the filenames into a list. If you want to find out more about find, type man find into the terminal.
