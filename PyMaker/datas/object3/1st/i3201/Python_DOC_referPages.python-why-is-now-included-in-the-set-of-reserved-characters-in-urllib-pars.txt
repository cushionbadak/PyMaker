The most recent documentation for urllib states:Changed in version 3.7: Moved from RFC 2396 to RFC 3986 for quoting URL strings. “~” is now included in the set of reserved characters.Why is this the case? In RFC 3986, ~ is not a reserved character:Explicitly in the next section it is included as an unreserved character:2.3.  Unreserved CharactersCharacters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a reserved    purpose are called unreserved.  These include uppercase and lowercase    letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde.Furthermore, later on, the RFC states that (emphasis mine):For example, the octet corresponding to the tilde ("~") character is often encoded as "%7E" by older URI processing implementations;So it seems like 3.7 is inconsistent: it asserts the support for the newer RFC while simultaneously regressing the processing of ~. (In fact, in the older RFC, ~ is also not reserved nor 'unwise')
This bug was tracked and closed in https://bugs.python.org/issue16285And indeed, the most recent version of the code reflects the changes. Ref https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/urllib/parse.py
