I have a script with taking out exif data from images, and putting it into to the list, I sort my list after and that's what i have its a list of lists, on first position its a image time in seconds and 2nd place its a image path, its my list,  [[32372, 'F:\rubish\VOL1\cam\G0013025.JPG'], [32373, 'F:\rubish\VOL1\cam\G0013026.JPG'], [32373, 'F:\rubish\VOL1\cam\G0013027.JPG'],.... etc etc etcThat a script with grouping my images made by @blhsing , with works great, but I want to start my grouping , not from first image , start grouping by given positionThat a script: And that what I have and , its does not work well , its taking only one image, , does no create a group , did somebody can help me please to fix it ??Over here I have my min_list with 2 position means I want to create only 2 groups , and classifier only images starting from those 2 position , with interval as before 5 seconds.   
Since your img list is sorted by time already, you can iterate through the records and append them to the last sub-list of the output list (named groups in my example code) if the time difference to the last entry is no more than 5 seconds; otherwise put the record into a new sub-list of the output list. Keep in mind that in Python a subscript of -1 means the last item in a list.
Sure! I just actually wrote this same algorithm the other day, but for JavaScript. Easy to port to Python...outputsBasically the predicate is a function that should return True if b belongs in the same group as a; for your use case, we look at the (absolute) difference of the first items in the tuples/lists, which is the timestamp.
