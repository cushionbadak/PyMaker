Is there any Python equivalent of Scala's Case Class? Like automatically generating constructors that assign to fields without writing out boilerplate. 
The current, modern way to do this (as of Python 3.7) is with a data class. For example, the Scala case class Point(x: Int, y: Int) becomes:The frozen=True part is optional; you can omit it to get a mutable data class. I've included it for parity with Scala's case class.Before Python 3.7, there's collections.namedtuple:Namedtuples are immutable, as they are tuples. If you want to add methods, you can extend the namedtuple:
If you use python3.7 you get data classes as @dataclass. Official doc here - 30.6. dataclasses â€” Data ClassesMake sure to upgrade python3 to python 3.7.In macos: brew upgrade python3While above data class in scala looks like,
