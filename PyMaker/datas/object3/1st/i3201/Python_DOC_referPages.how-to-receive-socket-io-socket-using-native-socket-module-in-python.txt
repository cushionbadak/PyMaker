When I am trying to receive a message from Socket.IO using the native socket module, instead of receiving the message, I receive this:How do I fix this, and receive the message rather than the data?Client code:Server code:
From  this how to guide:In general, they [socket's recv and send functions] return when the associated network buffers have been filled (send) or   emptied (recv). They then tell you how many bytes they handled. It is your    responsibility to call them again until your message has been completely dealt with.So, from my understanding, connection.recv(100000) won't return any data until its buffer fills up, so to fix this you would need to set buffer to something low, (maybe 2048?).
