I download a python code from my course website, it should work because it is supposed to be used directly in assignment, while my python 3.6 says the following code has error:
The problem is this part:In Python 2.x, this meant the same thing as repr(value). Guido used to call it the biggest syntax mistake in Python. It was apparently never actually deprecated, just buried in the docs somewhere nobody will ever notice it. But, not surprisingly, Python 3 immediately removed it, with this terse explanation:Removed backticks (use repr() instead).So, you could fix it like this:But really, this is exactly what %r is for:From printf-style String Formatting docs:'r'    String (converts any Python object using repr()). (5)'s'    String (converts any Python object using str()).  (5)With that change, this line is now valid as both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 (and 2.1 and 3.8pre, for that matter).If you're lucky, this just means your teacher hasn't quite caught everything when updating their lessons and assignments for Python 3, and it'll never come up again. (Although you should point this one out to them.)But if your teacher is actually teaching Python 2, not Python 3, you probably need to use Python 2.7 instead of 3.6, or you'll have many more problems ahead.If you are using Python 3, and you don't want to learn the printf-style formatting, just update it:
