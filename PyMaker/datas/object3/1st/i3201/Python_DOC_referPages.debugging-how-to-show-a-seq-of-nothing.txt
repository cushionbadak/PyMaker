I'm missing the ability to print based on there being nothing in the sequence. This is my current code using None, which doesn't work.Also tried using ((),) and a few random attempts that didn't work either. The expected outcome isas well as producingfor when there are numbers inputed to the seq.
By convention, Python sequences are falsy if and only if they are empty.
If you are limiting your function to a sequence, you can just test the sequence for False since empty containers are False in Python:The will only deal with sequences and will fail on something like print_median(range(10)) in Python 3.Given you are writing for Python 3 where many items are iterables, I would rewrite your function to use try and except and to handle generators by calling list on the sequence passed:That will now handle generators and lists and empty sequences as you expect:
