I have the following two inputs input1 and input2 ,both the inputs are matching the train variable,the regex should only match input2 as it has the exact train name "Glory" ,regex should an exact match of the train, how to fix this?EXPECTED OUTPUT:
I'm going to take a wild guess at what you want, but I could be wrong.You're asking for .*Glory.*—that is, any string that includes the substring Glory. Greediness isn't going to change the fact that ' to GloryB and GloryE' contains that substring. It could change whether you match '', 'Glory', 'B and GloryE' or 'GloryB and ', 'Glory', 'E', but that doesn't do any good; either way, it matches.I think what you may want to ask for is .*\bGlory\b.*—that is, any string that contains the substring Glory between word boundaries. Like this Regex101 demonstration:See Regular Expression Syntax for an explanation of what \b means:Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of word characters. Note that formally, \b is defined as the boundary between a \w and a \W character (or vice versa), or between \w and the beginning/end of the string. This means that r'\bfoo\b' matches 'foo', 'foo.', '(foo)', 'bar foo baz' but not 'foobar' or 'foo3'.If you wanted to match only Glory at the end of the line, or Glory with whitespace (rather than any non-word character) or EoL, or something else, then of course this is wrong.
