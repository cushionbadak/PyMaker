I am working on this code and I cannot get the "removeLetter" to delete the letter the user chooses from the "chosen" list. I figured out I can't use list functions with strings, but I don't know how to go about making the start.remove() code to work without converting the user's string input to match the item he/she would like to be removed from the "chosen" list. Can someone help me please?
You have a few issues in your code. I took the liberty to make it more pythonic for you.Python 2Python 3Having multiple lists, and repeating your code is not very pythonic. So I've made the "lists" as a tuple of tuples (since you may not plan on modifying this). If so, then change to lists by denoting them with square brackets [] instead of parentheses ().Since you're performing the same operation on multiple lists, you can use the map() function to get the results from all of them into a list.chosen should remain a list, instead of a string, since you'll be manipulating it in the future by removing a letter.You can easily join() all the items in a list together as a string separated by a single space " ".Since list.remove() can send back a ValueError if the value isn't in the list, you'll want to handle that in a try..except block.Can surround your logic with a while loop to keep asking for a letter to remove if the previous attempts failed.chosen.remove changes the original array, so you don't need to save it into keptLetters.I hope this helps you out!Edit: Added equivalent Python 2 code
You have an error in your code specifically in this line:You are calling the variable start but the variable chosen is the one with the list of letters. So this should work:
