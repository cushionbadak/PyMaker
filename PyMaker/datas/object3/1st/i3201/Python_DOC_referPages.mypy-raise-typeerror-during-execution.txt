Contextmypy is great to check whether types are handled correctly.This will work for the first case, but not for the second one.However, just running this viadoes not raise any errors.QuestionIs it possible to use the optional static typing in python to raise errors when the code is actually executed?I was hoping to use this e.g. to check variable types in unittests, where it would be much easier than having various if not isinstance(...) statements.
In short: Python does not check your types even if you have included type-hints.Type-Hinting has been introduced to provide the option for static type-checking. This helps you get rid of many errors before even running your code. But you will need to use a static type-checker like mypy to do this. Python is still a dynamically typed language and therefore doesn't do any type-checking itself.
