I'm looking for a way to associate:A human-readable label: "Option one" or even u'Premi√®re option'A "constant name": OPTION_ONEA integer value (from 0 up)Given that:The code passes the list of labels to some API, that displays it to the userThe API returns an integer value, which is the index of the user's choice in the sequence aboveI want to later compare this integer value to one of the constant names (or something quickly derived from them)I want to be able to easily insert/remove/reorder labels in the sequenceI don't want to hardcode any integer value (except 0 as a the base index, if necessary).Of course this is to make the code look clean, so a reasonable terseness is required. This should run in Python 2.7 using the standard libraries.
Solution using a namedtuple:First define a small functionThe list if options is defined like thisThen in the code it is used like this.
