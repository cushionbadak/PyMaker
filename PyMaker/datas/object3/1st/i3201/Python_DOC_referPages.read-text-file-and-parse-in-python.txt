Natural Text
I have a text file(.txt) just looks like below:Date, Day, Sect, 1, 2, 31, Sun, 1-1, 123, 345, 6782, Mon, 2-2, 234, 585, 2823, Tue, 2-2, 231, 232, 686With this data I want to do the followings:1) Read the text file by line as a separate element in the listSplit elements by commaDelete non-necessary elements('\n') in the listFor the two, I did these.2) Set the first row(Date, Day, Sect, 1, 2, 3) as key and set the other rows as values in the dictionary.The above code has two issues: 1) Set the first row as dictionary, too. 2) If I add this to the list as the below, it only keeps the last row as all elements in the list.3) Create a list including the dictionary as elements.4) Subset the elements that I want to.I couldn't write any code from here. But What I want to do is subset elements meeting the condition: For example, choosing the element in the dictionary where the Sect is 2-2. Then the wanted results could be as the follows:Thanks,
