I have two arrays. column_names hold the column titles. values hold all the values.I understand if I do this:I getHow do I code it so if I pass:I would getThank you!
You can do it as followsAlternatively, you can use grouper defined in itertools
With pandas and numpy it is easy and the result will be a much more useful table. Pandas excels at arranging tabular data. So lets take advantage of it: install pandas with:pip install pandas
itertools.cycle seems appropriate in this case. Here's another version for future readers:gives:
This has two sub-steps that you want to do.First, you want to divide your list into chunks, and then you want to assign those chunks to a dictionary.To split the list into chunks, we can create a function:At this point we will have:    [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]From here, creating the dict is really easy. First, we zip the two lists together:And take advantage of the fact that Python knows how to convert a list of tuples into a dictionary:
You can also use slicing and a collections.defaultdict to collect your values:Which Outputs:This can be imporoved if you create zipped lists with itertools.cycle, avoiding the slicing all together:
