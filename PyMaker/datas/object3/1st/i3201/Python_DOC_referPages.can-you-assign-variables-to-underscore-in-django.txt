Natural Text
It's always struck me a weird that Django uses the underscore as an operator, given that the underscore is normally used to for assignment to variables that you don't want to reference later. E.g.Does this mean that you can't assign a unwanted variable to _ in the same namespace as you want to use the _("column_name") notation?
_ is just another name, perfectly valid even though it looks strange. And just like any other name, rebinding it will make the old reference unavailable.
I think you are confusing a _ variable with Django'sfrom django.utils.translation import gettext as _, the first _ as used by you is a throwaway variable which is commonly used as convention.Django also commonly imports gettext as _ to display translated text, for eg: Also the underscore character (_) is used to represent “the previous result” in Python’s interactive shell and doctest tests. Installing a global _() function causes interference. Explicitly importing gettext() as _() avoids this problem.
