i have this script but counts from seconds while the scripts ends in less than a second.python 3.7 uses a new function that can do that. I have 3.6.5. How do i do that?
time.perf_counter(), available since Python 3.3, lets you access a high-resolution wallclock.
It doesn't count in seconds. It counts in fractions of a second, it's just that the script ends faster than the precision allowed by the string formatted float, ie. much less than a second.Try:Also, for shorter sleep you may want to increase the precision of your float formatter (eg {0:0.3f}), so that for shorter sleeps (eg 0.007) you don't have a 0.0 printed to console.Or just remove the formatter entirely (As commented by Inder):See here for more details of timer resolution: https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html
