I have a logger that I've added a handler to with a custom formatter, but I'd like to access what the resulting message is after going through my custom formatter. So my code looks something like this:Now when I do a logger.warning('hello'), I see the message in the format that I specified in some_formatter (so maybe something like 'my message is: hello'). But I'd like to access that formatted message in the code. How can I get what the resulting formatted message was from my logger.info('hello') in the code?
The default logging level is WARNING, which is the reason why logger.info('hello') since INFO is less severe than WARNING. Just add the following somewhere:This will set the lowest logged severity level to INFO. As for your question, you'll need another handler. You can define your own Handler or create another StreamHandler with the stream set to a StringIO:Output:The first two came from logging, the list from current_streamed.
