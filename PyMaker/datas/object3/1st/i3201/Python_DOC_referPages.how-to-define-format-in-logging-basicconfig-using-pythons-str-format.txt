Python documentation teaches the following syntax:I would like to express format='%(asctime)s %(message)s' using python str.format. How can I do it?I tried but had was returned with NameError, which shows that I did not understand how asctime and message was defined. Thanks.
It looks something like this:Basically, the analogous .format to the % style interpolation string that you have above is '{asctime} {message}'.  Then the only thing to do is to tell the logger to use "{" style format strings instead of "%" style strings.Note that it isn't trivial to be able to use .format style strings in your individual log messages -- e.g. the following does not work:This is described in detail (along with work-arounds) in Using particular formatting styles throughout your application.The gist of it is that you can pass any object to logging.info -- python'll call str on it:Or, you can go through the shenanigans of defining a LogRecord interface compatible object (maybe via subclassing) and registering it with your logger via logger.setLogRecordFactory(MyLogRecord).
