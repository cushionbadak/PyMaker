So my problem is calling the function from within the class. Thanks in advance for any help.
When you declare your class asthe variables belong to the class rather than an instance of the class. In this sense, having the function inside this class is synonymous with not wrapping the variables or the function in a class at all, as a script in Python is essentially just a class.If you want to create instances of your settings class you need to use self in the function calls declared in your class too, and then create an instance of that class to retrieve the values from rather than the class itself:Check out Python Classes for more info on how to implement classes.Also, as noted by @gilch in the comments, these values don't need to be in a class if you only want one instance of them:Assuming settings.py is in the same directory as main:
Based on suggestions I got it going by creating separate .py file with following in itThanks for pointing me to the right directions.
