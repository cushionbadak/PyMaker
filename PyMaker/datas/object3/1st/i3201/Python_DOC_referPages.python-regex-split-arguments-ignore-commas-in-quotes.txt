Lets say I have a line containing arguments splitted with ,I want regex in python that splits this sequence into list containing items (for clarity split one item by line)I have tried to make regex with negative lookahead, what can at least process one comma in comment and my plan was to extend it but I didnt managed to do even that.Callingre.split(r",\s(?!\".*,\s.*\")",args)onresults in 
You can use the csv module with skipinitialspace=TrueEx:Output:
You probably should use csv for this. However, if you prefer a pure Python solution (no regex either, however...) you could try this: Split by " first, then split all the even parts by ,. Regardless of whether the list starts with a string element or not, the contents of the string will always be in the odd posiitons.This is, of course, assuming that there are no nested or escaped quotes.
(Posting this as a second answer, as the approach is very different than the first).If you really want to use regular expressions for this, you could try this: ".+?"|[^", ]+ This just looks for all parts that are either enclosed in ", or contain neither " nor , or space.Again, this will probably break down if there are nested or escaped quotes, and all things considered using csv is probably the better idea.
