I've tried a few approaches, none of which seem to work for me. I then tried:None of these approaches worked, though the second one generally let the array fill up more. (I wrote code to fill up the array randomly).
You need to iterate over all the indices of your list to see if an element is a value in one of the nested lists. You can simply iterate over the inner lists and check for the presence of your element, e.g.:Using any() will serve as a short-stop whenever it encounters an element with a 0 in it so you don't need to iterate over the rest.
I will try to address what you did wrong:if not 0 in board[0] or not 0 in board[1]: this is almost right - but you should use and because to be considered full, both boards must not have 0 at the same time.Some options:
Another try with chain from itertools (that way it works with multiple rows):Prints:
If you can use tool outside the standard library numpy is the best way to work with multidimensional arrays by a long way.Output:
