I searched some sources online but they are not exactly what I am looking for.So for a set of images. I want to generate a color histogram that is in the form of  {color1: p1, color2: p2,..... color100: p100} where colorxxx represent a color from RGB images. and p represent the prob of that color.Is there a easy way to do such things in python?Thanks
Method 1:or a little more readablyWalking through it:dictionary comprehension to generate the mappinga.ravel flattens the image; to list allows it to be cast to a set, which is a container for the unique elements.Count how many times the element is in the image. This is not the most efficient way to do this, but puts the histogram into the format you requestedTaken together, if your image is the 3x3then and the entire expression yieldsMethod 2This works very similarly (using a dictionary comprehension), but makes use of the PIL histogram functionality, and enumerate to fetch the indices. It may have some domain limitations."Binning"If you want to have "bins" of colors, as you indicated, then the remaining work is just defining your bin structure, which an be done many number of ways. For example, in the previous example, we can create fixed size integer bins by
