I'm using Python's Pathlib and I want to take something likeAnd then try a couple of different extensions. I can dobut that feels a little awkward. Is there a better way to do this?
The with_suffix method will return a new path with a different extension, either changing an existing extension or adding a new one. Examples from the docs:In your case, p.with_suffix(ext) would do the job.
