I am trying to solve Kattis problem. The full problem is found in the link: https://open.kattis.com/problems/addingwordsThe part of the problem that I'm confused with is : "Input is a sequence of up to 2000 commands, one per line, ending at end of file."What would be the code for this input? I tried doing this: After this, I continued the program as normal within the indentation from above. My question is, how would I test whether the program is working in cmd? I want to test a few cases, but when I input something, the command prompt keeps waiting for other results instead of printing anything out. And when I press control C the program ends abruptly. How are we supposed to check whether the program is working while taking in user input till end of file? 
The problem here is that readlines() is eager not lazy. That means it will read the entire file into memory (until EOF) and then split it into lines and return a list of those lines. So when working with interactive stdin, sys.stdin.readline() will wait until the end of stdin (Ctrl-D on linux/macOS, Ctrl+Z on windows).But there is no need for readlines() (and in fact, you almost should never use it). Iterating over a file object by default does so by lines:The docs even admit that you should do this. If you do need all lines in a list, then just do list(sys.stdin).
