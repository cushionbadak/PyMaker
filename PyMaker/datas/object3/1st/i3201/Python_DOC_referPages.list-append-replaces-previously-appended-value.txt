This question already has an answer here:List on python appending always the same value [duplicate]                    6 answers                Create List of Dictionary Python                    4 answers                I am trying to append dictionaries to a list here, problem is after appending both "Chrome" and "Firefox" values to the "list" i see only firefox.exe in list for both entries ..any help is really appreciated.See the print statement of dictionary where both values are different.Result:
Define the dictionary in the for loop. You are currently writing to same dictionary object, and list holds reference to this object which itself is a reference. As a result you keep modifying the same object.
Your dictionary object Dict is being overwritten during the second run of the loop. This is happening because you have defined the Dict above the loop. Better to define the Dict inside the loop.
