Natural Text
I have two characters: ⼔ and 匕, which from now on I'll define as char1 and char2 from now on. In the python console, when I run char1 == char2, I get False as a result. When I run char1 is char2, I still get False as a result.I tried to find the encoding with it, because I think it might be returning False because the encoding is different, but when I do char1.encode("utf-8") == char2.encode("utf-8") and same with the is command, it returns False.How do I get it to recognize that these are the same characters?
⼔ and 匕 aren't the same character ⼔ is a radical for spoon (see wiki). Here you have the chinese word using 匕 radical匕 is a kanji (see wiki)That's why there are different
