https://www.codewars.com/kata/best-travel/train/pythonmy code times out, what could i have done better?
Similar to the answer by @Aaron but without sorting the list. Just keep track of the running best.The first thing you can do is just ditch 2333 from xs because that can never be in a combination. I'm not sure why, in addition to creating your own sum, you have while len(distances)!=0 and max(distances)>t: and so much list manipulation (appending and popping). The %timeit result:
Writing your own sum is probably slowing you down a lot. using the built in function is almost always going to be faster: When you go to find the largest value smaller than t, you modify the list a bunch before coming up with your result. Python lists are not terribly efficient at getting longer or shorter, so it would be much better to just sort the list and either just iterate until you find the edge of what is greater than t or you could use a binary search.
