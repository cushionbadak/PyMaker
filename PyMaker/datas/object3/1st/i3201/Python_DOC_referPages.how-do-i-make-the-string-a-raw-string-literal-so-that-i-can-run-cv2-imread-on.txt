So the result of print(imagePath) is:    C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Desktop\RateData\1\'1.1.jpg'The result of print(img) is:    Nonefeature is just the image file name.  I wrote it like that so it would add the unique image file name to the path.So I tried running that through the cv2.imread() function and it returned None.I know that the reason it won't run is that it is just reading it as a string and doesn't recognize that as a raw string literal. I'm not a very experienced programmer so I tried all the ways I could think of (not very many) to get it to read the path as a raw string literal and it didn't work. So if any of you could help me out in making the string into that that would be awesome!Thanks for the help!
So the result of "print(imagePath) is: C:\Users\Sam\OneDrive\Desktop\RateData\1\'1.1.jpgAlmost certainly, you don't have a file named '1.1.jpg in the RateData directory. While Windows does allow apostrophe/single-quote characters in filenames, I can't imagine you would have used one there intentionally. So, it's probably named 1.1.jpg?I'm also not sure how you got that string out of that codeâ€¦ but never mind that.You're making this all a lot harder than it has to be. There's no need to worry about getting path separators escaped and quoted properly, or whatever you were trying to do.Python comes with the os.path module for doing path-related operations. So just use it:Or, since I'd bet feature is already a string, even simpler:Or, if you prefer a more object-oriented API, Python also comes with pathlib:I don't know if cv2 is pathlib-aware, but if it is, you can just do cv2.imread(imagePath). (If you want to use pathlib, definitely try that and see, because it's obviously more readable.)
