I find it odd that in Python, {1} == frozenset({1}) evaluates to True. set and frozenset are different object types, and I don't see this similarity between other iterable object types (ex. {1} == (1,) evaluates to False). Why does this behavior occur with sets? Are there other iterable object types that have similar behavior?
As per the documentation python2  and documentation python3Instances of set are compared to instances of frozenset based on  their members. For example, "set('abc') == frozenset('abc')" returns  True.and in the python3 documentation:Both set and frozenset support set to set comparisons. Two sets are equal if and only if every element of each set is contained in the other (each is a subset of the other). A set is less than another set if and only if the first set is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but is not equal). A set is greater than another set if and only if the first set is a proper superset of the second set (is a superset, but is not equal).
