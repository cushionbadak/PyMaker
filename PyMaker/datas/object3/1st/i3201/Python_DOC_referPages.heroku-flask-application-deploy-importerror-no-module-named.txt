I am following this guide to deploy a python flask application on heroku:   https://github.com/datademofun/heroku-basic-flaskI setup my environment by this guide:http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/The problem is that my custom module (platforms/hitta.py) fail to import when running the application with gunicorn instead of just python3 app.py. Why is there a difference and how do I solve this? I have only problem importing my own modules, not from requirements.txt:File structure (simplified):Command:Output:
You need to create a __init__.py in a folder to make it become a Python package, then you can import modules inside it with from platforms.hitta import Hitta. The file structure may like this:P.S. The __init__.py's content can be empty.
