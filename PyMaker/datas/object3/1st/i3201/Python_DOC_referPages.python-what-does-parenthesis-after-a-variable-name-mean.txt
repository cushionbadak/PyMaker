Towards the bottom at the main loop, I'm seeing this lineresult = result()But I have no idea what it does and I can't even Google it.What is this?The code below imports from task.py and project.py. But both files do not have anything related to result() hence I'm not including them here.
select_menu returns an element of actions, which are all functions (main_menu, exit, create_project....). Thus, result is a function. result = result() will execute that function and replace the value in result with the return value of that function.
You have to see the global loop:it just calls result function until it returns a non-function (probably a result), reassigning back the result name. result is just a name, it can reference anything including a function.you can see that like traversing a tree node by node until you reach a leaf.
