need help on the highlighted lines in the python code:The output which i get is below:Can you guys please help me explain the need for the marked line in the code. Couldn't quite get the concept.
Some references:mapstr.splitinputstarred assignment
The line name, *line = input().split() splits the input by white spaces, assigning the first item into name, and the rest of the items are assigned to line as a list, which, in the next line scores = list(map(float, line)), gets mapped to a list of floating numbers into scores.
