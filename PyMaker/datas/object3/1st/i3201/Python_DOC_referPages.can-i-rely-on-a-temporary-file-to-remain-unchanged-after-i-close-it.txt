I'm using a temporary file to exchange data between two processes:I create a temporary file and write some data into itI start a subprocess that reads and modifies the fileI read the result from the fileFor demonstration purposes, here's a piece of code that uses a subprocess to increment a number:As you can see above, I've used tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) to create the file, then closed it and later reopened it. My question is:Is this reliable, or is it possible that the operating system deletes the temporary file after I close it? Or perhaps it's possible that the file is reused for another process that needs a temporary file? Is there any chance that something will destroy my data?
The documentation does not say. The operating system might automaticallydelete the file after some time, depending on any number of things abouthow it was set up and what directory is used. If you want persistence,code for persistence: use a regular file, not a temporary one.
