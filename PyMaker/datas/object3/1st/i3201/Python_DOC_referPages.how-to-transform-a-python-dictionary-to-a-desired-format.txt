I have the following dictionary, which i got when applied to_dict() method on a pandas dataframe.How do I transform it into the following structure? I tried applying many variations of for loop, but came out as bogus code, if anyone could help or point to some links it would be great, python newbie here :| EDIT: changed the desired structure to a list of dicts, as dicts are not hashble, 
The target structure you display is a set of dicts. Since dicts are not hashable, it is not possible to create.Instead you probably want a list of dicts.Testing:
You could transpose your dataframe before converting it to a dictionary. This will produce a dictionary of dictionaries, where each key is an index value from the original dataframe.Outputs:
You could just pass 'records' as the desired orientation to to_dict():The default orientation 'dict' produces output like {column -> {index -> value}} as can be seen in your example, where as 'records' a list like [{column -> value}, â€¦ , {column -> value}], which is your desired output.
