Natural Text
Have created a simple text file with the contents bellow:The following Python script bellow was meant to search and find a string within the text file and display the result. Where is the error coming from? what amendments can i do to the code?
And the error you are seeing is because of the incorrect argument passed to the re.search function. It doesn't accept an array/list as an argument see the doc here 
You're searching a list but you probably want to search a string.You don't need regex for this. In your case the best solution is probably.
readlines() is returning a list so z=list(y) is unnecessary.If you want to read the file one line at a time you can simply use a for loop on it:
Read it all as text.
