I used to use the same method but I get the performance time in seconds (e.g., 0.0003). This time I do not know why I am getting the time in minus. I used to use the same device. I use Linux Ubuntu 18. This is an example:Output:Is there anything wrong? how to get perf. time in positive values?
time.perf_counter() and time.process_time() don't return the same data... You cannot subtract one from the other and expect anything but garbage.time.perf_counter()Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration. It does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.time.process_time()Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It is process-wide by definition. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.Pick either time.perf_counter() or time.process_time() - but don't confuse the returned values.I suspect you'll want to use time.process_time().
