Natural Text
So I have a database where a bunch of hashed passwords are stored in strings. Now I am trying to then pull them down, and compare them to the plain text passwords the user enters. Here is an example:I don't know how to get around this error and have not been able to find much about it online. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks 
The problem is that you're casting the password to string. Use decode and encode to ensure the password gets converted to string and back using the same format.I'm not an expert on encoding formats by any means, so this may not work in all cases. If you have a character in your bytes object that can't be represented using utf8, it could cause problems. I'd look into best practices for storing passwords. Maybe you could even use pickle which allows you to store python objects directly.
