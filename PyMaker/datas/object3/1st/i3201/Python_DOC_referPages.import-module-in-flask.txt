I am using python flask. I want to import a module from a different directory. I have file called hello.pyPATH = project/app/hello.pyI have another file called tables.pyPATH = project/db/migration/tables.pySo, I need to import app from hello.pyI am executing the script tables.py like, It is saying no module found app.hello
You need to create a __init__.py in the app folder to make it become a Python package, then you can import a module inside it with from app.hello import app. The file structure may like this:P.S. The __init__.py's content can be empty.
