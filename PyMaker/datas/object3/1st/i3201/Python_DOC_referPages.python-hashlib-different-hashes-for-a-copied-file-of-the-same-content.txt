Natural Text
Running python 2.7 and trying to calculate the hash of two different files into variables so I can compare and use in a boolean loop.  To start off I generate content in file1, then I copy file1 to file2 and run against both file1 and file2, I get different hashes with python hashlib, but running powershell get-filehash against the two different filenames I get the same hash (as I expected).There is no content difference between file1 and file2, just create file1 with content and copy to file2.Any pointers or suggestions?
Verified the size of the text files my script was intending to hash and switched to a small single file read with no update per Andrej's pointe to the docs.Getting good confirm able hashes across multiple files now.
