I'm getting acquainted with Atom and its script package so I can run commands off the go. Right now I'm trying to run this code:However, the book can get the value of name to print just by typing:I would like to be able to do this, because when I run the book's code, script runs the code with no output. Also, is there a way to get script to run each single line I'm currently on when pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (like Ctrl+Enter in R Studio?)
Your book is probably running Python in interactive mode, you can access it by typing python -i or just python in your terminal. The reason typing name works in interactive mode is because in that environment, the Interpreter prints the repr of each line, nothing if it returned None. If you already wrote your code into a file, you can still run it using interactive mode by running the following:When you actually want to see the data, you should use print() as it outputs the str of the value and Python files are not automatically ran in interactive mode.I don't use Atom so I can't suggest an "Atomic" solution.
