Here is the my code in python 3.6I want to rewrite this code in python 3.7, how can i initialize self._int_a: int = int(a) with dataclasses module?I know that i can do something like that but i can't get how to initialize _a: int = int(a) or similar to that.Thanks in advance for your ideas and suggestions.
Do away with getters and setters entirely and just use attribute access.  We can define an init only field that accepts a string and then convert that string to an integer field in our __post_init__ call.
