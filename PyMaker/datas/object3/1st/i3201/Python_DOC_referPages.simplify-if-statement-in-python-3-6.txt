I have the following code which is working fine and giving me the expected result, but i know there is a way to simplify it and i don't whats the best to way make to following code can be 3/4 lines instead of 20 odd or so. Python experts need your advice how i can ease the following code.
This could be simplified (or, well, lets say "shortened") further. First, note that checking not isdigit, not isalpha and not isalnum is redundant, you just have to check not isalnum. Second, you could use a regular expression for checking the format of the number, combining your three conditions with |. Also, you can enumerate the items instead of getting the index.Here, the regex is ^.*\.00|0\..+0|.*[^0.]0$. ^ marks the start of the string, $ the end, and | a disjunction, i.e. the string has to match .*\.00 (something followed by .00) or 0\..+0 (0., then something, then 0) or .*[^0.]0 (something followed by neither 0 nor ., then 0).You could also replace the loop with a list comprehension:
First step: combine conditions (+pylint)Second step: refactor if-blocks
The first few if statements can go on one line.
