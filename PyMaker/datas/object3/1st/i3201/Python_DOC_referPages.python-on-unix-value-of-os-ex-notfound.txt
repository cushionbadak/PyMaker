The documentation for the Python os module provides a set of exit statuses available on Unix. macOS is Unix.However, os.EX_NOTFOUND returnsWhat's going on here? More specifically, what should be the value of this constant? My guess is that it should be 79 but I don't know.
At the top of the exit codes section, right above os.EX_OK it says:Some of these may not be available on all Unix platforms, since there  is some variation. These constants are defined where they are defined  by the underlying platform.So the MacOS platform does not implement it. Neither does Linux as it seems. I found it on a Solaris and there it has the expected value of 79
