I need to convert from gdbm to postgresql for my key/value store.It appears that I will have to replacewiththis looks someone scary (especially if I add echo and see all the SQLgenerated for these simple key-value operations).Is there a better way?PS. I could also use psycopg instead of sqlalchemy directly, but that would make me write SQL myself ;-(
You must not use postgresql as a key-value store.The key-value store (except in rare cases) is structured around a schema based on key composition that layout the data in multidimensional space that may or may not map directly the concepts of SQL tables. Otherwise said, there is a database abstraction that lives in the key-value store.There is not enough information to say, simply replace the key-value store with a 2 columns table. If you do that you will mostlikely end up with the worst of both worlds.
