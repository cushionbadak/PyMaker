Hi I have looked up a few recursive multiplication of 2 numbers in python, but none of them take into account the possibility of negative numbers or if they do they don't explain the entire steps.I have coded the following the program but I am getting an error, can someone please let me know what is wrong with it?
| and & are bitwise operators, not logical operators, and their (relatively) high precedence means that a > 0 & b >0 is parsed as a > (0 & b) > 0, which is not what you want.  Use or and and instead.
You have some python syntax errors and some sign problems. This works for mult(-4,5) and mult(5,-4).
In your elif statement, you're using a bitwise "and" operator rather than the logical and operator. Everywhere that you have "&" replace it with "and"
