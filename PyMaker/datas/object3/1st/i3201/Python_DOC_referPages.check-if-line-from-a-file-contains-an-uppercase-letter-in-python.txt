This question already has an answer here:How to detect lowercase letters in Python?                    6 answers                I am reading a file line by line and let's say I don't care about anything except "if" this line of the file contains an upper case letter.

A regular expression is probably overkill for this, but it's extremely simple:
data will contain only strings with uppercase characters.
