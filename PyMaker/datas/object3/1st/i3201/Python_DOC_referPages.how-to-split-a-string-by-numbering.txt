Natural Text
I wish to split the following corpus into its parts:Into the following:I wrote this, but doesn't work:What can I do?
For your example data, you might also match zero or more times a whitespace followed by one or more digits and 2 times a whitespace to split on:*\d+DemoYou might put the whitespace in a character class followed by a quantifier [ ]*\d+[ ]{2} for clarity.
You tagged regex but provided a non-regex solution. This is a non-regex correct solution for your OP.Splitting on spaces is ok, then accumulate text parts into a temporary variable until you encounter the next number, then add the temporary to your overall result. Using list to store temporarty (parts) is more efficient that appending to a string because of immutability. Skip storing the numbers itself:Output:
Using re.split and list comprehension, using str.strip to remove eventual spaces:Result:
Try using re.split() with Regular Expression + strip()re.split() is pretty much split() but it contains demilitmer as well/ strip(" ") removes space from s
