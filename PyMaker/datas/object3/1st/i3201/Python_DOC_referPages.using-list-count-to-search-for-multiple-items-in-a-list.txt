So let's say my code is as follows:How could I get the output to return 2?
The count method of the list object only takes 1 argument. The easiest to achieve what you are looking for is to use a simple addition:
The simplest approach, using sum and map:Once the number of elements that you want to count increases, you will be better off using a collections.Counter and add the counts from there:The main advantage of the latter method is that the Counter obtains all counts in a single iteration while repeated list.count calls repeatedly iterate the list. 
Using list.count repeatedly will have complexity O(m*n). This isn't recommended. You can achieve your task with complexity O(m+n) by using collections.Counter:To cater for potential missing values, you can use dict.__getitem__:
