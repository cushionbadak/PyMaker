I have to do a large number of DNS NAPTR lookups (think thousands per minute).I run a Python script using dnspython, read a file and write back to another file. Request rate is ~ 300 requests/sec.I tried to use asynchronous DNS with Python aiodns, but numbers are the same.It is possible that my script is flawed. Please see below. This is Python 3.4.But if results have to go back to one file, is it even possible to do lookups asynchronously?
But if results have to go back to one file, is it even possible to do lookups asynchronously?If you don't care about the order of the results, it's straightforward to implement asynchronous lookups. For example, you can use asyncio.as_completed to schedule all coroutines to run in parallel and get notified as each completes:
