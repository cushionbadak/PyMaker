This question already has an answer here:Create an empty list in python with certain size                    13 answers                I get this error whenever I try to run my code. I believe both the lists's summary_name and summary lists are not working.Error:Code:
Thisassumes that there already is something that has the name summary_name and that allows access using [i]. Since Python  is a dynamic language, this can be anything. All that is necessary to use [i] on an object is to implement object.__getitem__ for reading and object.__setitem__ for writing. How is Python supposed to know which of the many classes that do this you want summary_name to be an instance of?So you first have to define summary_name, for example as an empty lista tupleor a stringAll these allow read access using summary_name[i].Since you want to use write access, you must define an object that allows summary_name[i] = something. A list with 100 entries, all initialized to None could be created usingOnly after this can you set entries of this list.
