I want to print out from 1 to 1320 like d1,d2,d3,d4 and so onThe command >>> list(range(1320)) will print out like 1,2, 3 etc. so I tried with d(list(range(1320))) but it says NameError: name 'd' is not definedSo my question id how to print the numbers like d1,d2,d3 ..... Maybe I am missing very basic syntax here. Any help?
list(range(1320)) builds a list out of that range of numbers, and when that list is shown in your Python session, it lists the elements separated by commas. [0, 1, 2, ...]If you want to build a list of d0, d1, d2 etc. you can use a list comprehension.But if you actually want to just print those strings separated by commas, you can use join:
You can use list comprehension like this:of for Python3.6 and higher:
This is another way to do the same in one line using basic list comprehension.Just loop till 1230 and concatenate with 'd'.
