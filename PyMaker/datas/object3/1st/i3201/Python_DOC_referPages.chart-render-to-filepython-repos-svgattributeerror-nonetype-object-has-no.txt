I'm learning python with the book: "Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming". In chapter 17 of the book "Working with APIs", I did as the book says, but an error is occurring. I don't know what the error means. Does that mean there is something wrong with the site-packages? How to fix it? the error is below
The error is caused by one of the labels you're setting on the chart being None, which is one of Python's special built-in constants.  When pygal comes to render the chart it expects the label to be a string and calls the decode function.  This function doesn't exist on a None object, so the error is raised.Looking at the name and descriptions of the Github repositories (which you're setting as the x labels and data labels, respectively) we can see that the description for one of the repositories is None.  I wouldn't say there is anything particularly wrong with the code from the book, it's just bad luck that one of the most starred Python repositories at this moment in time has no description.We can work around this by checking for None values in the for loop:In the first part we've added an empty string in place of any None values (because you'll need something there when you set the x labels).In the second part we've created the dict with just the value, then added the description as a label only if the description is not None.
