In a python console:What am I missing here? I want an iterable object so that I can access next() when looping over it. e.g.:I understand that this will throw an error on the last letter but that's irrelevant.
You have bound the name iter to a list:The exception isn't telling you the list object being passed to the call is the problem. You are not calling the my_list object, you are calling iter.Use del iter to delete the global name in the current namespace; The iter() function is a built-in and it'll be found again once you delete the shadowing global:That last traceback could be fixed by asking next() to return a default instead, e.g. next(my_iter, 'no more letters').You could also recover the function reference from the builtins module, so via builtins.iter.
