this is my code and it works pretty well. but it should put every single value against every other one but it doesnt it just put the same Y value and does not change. i have put v+=1 in tons of different places and moved around the a couple variable but it doesnt change. there should be 25 different answers for 5 people but it doesnt it just prints the same number 5 times then restarts.any help would be appreciaredEdit: this is what i will intergrat the code above into
you are adding way too much noise.why don't you simply use the variable you just created? it will be incremented automaticallyyou should learn how to use a loop and a few other basics. there are good tutorials on the official python site. here the for-loop one. most of your variables exist just to repeat what you are already doing.i've avoided some high-level constructs, but i left zip.
