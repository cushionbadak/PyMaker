I'm trying to build a small Python program that reads the input from the user, but does not wait for the new line character.working with Python 3.7My requirements are:Easy to run (No need for Sudo)Can take every keyboard input (Including Fn or any available button)Can work on OSX, Windows and LinuxEvery keyboard input is received immediatelyI took a look at several options, but every one of them had at least one requirement it did not fulfill:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html - Needs line ending.https://pythonhosted.org/pynput/keyboard.html - Needs Sudo.How to Read Keyboard Input One Char at a time with a timer with Python - Not working, I think it is due to the Python version I'm using.Any suggestion would be highly appreciated 
for command line arguments maybe module argparse (e.g. you can control command line arguments for your scripts):https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.htmland for key events maybe pynput will be useful for you (problably without sudo (except MacOS)):https://pypi.org/project/pynput/or use TkInter or PyGames
