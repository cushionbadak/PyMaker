Considering the port number you are using I'd try with SMTP_SSL instead of SMTP and starttls().https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html:An SMTP_SSL instance behaves exactly the same as instances of SMTP.  SMTP_SSL should be used for situations where SSL is required from the  beginning of the connection and using starttls() is not appropriate.  If host is not specified, the local host is used. If port is zero, the  standard SMTP-over-SSL port (465) is used.STARTTLS is a form of opportunistic TLS, it is supposed to be used with old protocols, that originally did't support TLS, to upgrade the connection.The port 465 was used before the introduction of STARTTLS for SMTPS, which is now deprecated.Alternatively you should be able to use port 25 with your original code.In both examples you can completely omit the port number as you are using the default ports.
