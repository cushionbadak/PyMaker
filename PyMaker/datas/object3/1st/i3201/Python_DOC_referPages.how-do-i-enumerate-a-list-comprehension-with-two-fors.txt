I am trying to dobut also pass in i into myfunc, which is an index starting at 0 and incrementing for each new element.For example:should result inI know that I can use enumerate() for just the normal case, ie.But I can't figure out how to do it cleanly when there are two fors. I couldn't find this question posted previously either. 
You are creating a Cartesian product over two lists, so use itertools.product() instead of a double for loop. This gives you a single iterable you can easily add enumerate() to:For cases where you can't use product(), you'd put the multiple loops in a generator expression, then add enumerate() to that. Say you needed to filter some values of a_list:Another option is to add a separate counter; itertools.count() gives you a counter object that produces a new value with next():After all, in essence enumerate(iterable, start=0) is the equivalent of zip(itertools.count(start), iterable).
You can use enumerate on the sequence of pairs.
For a simple nested loop, use itertools.product() as @Martijn suggested.If the expression is more complex you can use itertools.count:
