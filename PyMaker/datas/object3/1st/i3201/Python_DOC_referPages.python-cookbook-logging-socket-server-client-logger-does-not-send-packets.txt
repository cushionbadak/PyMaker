I'm using the recipe directly from the cookbook, with the exception of a single line {ctrl-f for "print(rd,"} printing whatever pumps out of the socket:To test, I use the recipe directly from the cookbook:But the thing just pumps out:Ad infinitum.However, if I start up a basic socket client in another terminal:I get:So the error is in the logging.handlers.SocketHandler, but it doesn't give any errors or anything, it just doesn't work.Any thoughts?UPDATE:This seemed like it might be helpful:UPDATE:It looks like it might be an IPV6 vs IPV4 problem.  Specifically, SocketHandler.makeSocket() calls socket.create_connection, which in turn calls socket.getaddrinfo.  On my machine, socket.getaddrinfo only returns IPV6 stuff, and coincidentally, socket.create_connection goes on to throw a ConnectionRefused error when it gets to the .connect call.
Still only 85% sure this is an ipv6 vs ipv4 problem, but circumventing the call to socket.create_connection solves the problem for me.  Here's a clean way to do it:
