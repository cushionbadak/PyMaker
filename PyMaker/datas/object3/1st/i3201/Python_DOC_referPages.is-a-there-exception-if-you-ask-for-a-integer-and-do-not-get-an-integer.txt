I am trying to make a program where you enter an integer, but if you do not enter an integer, handle it with an exception. However I can not find any exceptions for integers on the internet.-Does anyone know an exception if you ask for an integer input and do not get an integer?
You can always try it in interpreter to see which error gets raised:Now that you know that it is ValueError, just change your code:
Yes, use ValueErrorMore about python try except. Go through the builtin exceptions list, which will help you.Also, when an builtin exception is raised like so -You can seeValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'So python raisesValueError and this is the exception you need to use.
You can use "ValueError" exception
