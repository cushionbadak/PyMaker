I'm iterating through all the img's in a request.POST to see if they are HTTPS (I'm using Beautiful Soup to help)Here's my code:Even though image.get('src')[:7] == "https://", the code still prints Not HTTPS.Any idea why?
Well for starters, 'https://' is 8 characters, so there's no way that a slice of 7 characters can match it.Also, please make your question titles actually indicative of the problem you're having rather than unrelated accusations about the python operators.
to match the https:// string the appropriate slice would be :8 instead of :7if image.get('src')[:8] == "https://":
