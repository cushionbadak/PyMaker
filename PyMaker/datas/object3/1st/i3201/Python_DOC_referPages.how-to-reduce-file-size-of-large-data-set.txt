Natural Text
I am new to python and working on a matrix of dimension 20000x20000. Now I need to store elements of matrix in a file in form of set {i,j,value}, with one set per line. I tried "file.write" function to store all elements into a text file by converting each set to a string but by doing this file size is becoming around 6GB. I want to know is there any way to reduce file size or size of the set so that overall size can be reduced?
You can try compressing the file. Example of gzip compression from the docs
