Natural Text
I am coding a tool in python and I want to put all the errors -and only the errors-(computations which didn't go through as they should have) into a single log file. Additionally I would want to have a different text in the error log file for each section of my code in order to make the error log file easy to interpret. How do I code this? Much appreciation for who could help with this!
Check out the python module logging. This is a core module for unifying logging not only in your own project but potentially in third party modules too.For a minimal logging file example, this is taken directly from the documentation:Which results in the contents of example.log:However, I personally recommend using the yaml configuration method (requires pyyaml):Then to use, for example:This prints:While the contents of the log file is:Of course, you can add or remove handlers, formatters, etc, or do all of this in code (see the Python documentation) but this is my starting point whenever I use logging in a project. I find it helpful to have the configuration in a dedicated config file rather than polluting my project with defining logging in code.
