I wrote two example codes which share a same pattern.As you can read below, I used if statement to not to pass keyword argument down to a sub function if the argument is None.I want to do it in a better way.Please share your thoughts if you have an idea.
The default value of the parameter key of the function sorted is None. Because of this, your first if/else is not necessary. Simple useUse the default value of body of es.indices.create as the default value for mapping in your function create_index. Then you can get rid of the if/else in this function, too.Edit: The documentation says:body â€“ The documentTry to find out if this is a JSON string or a Python dictionary that represents the document. In the JSON string case, use the string "{}"as the default value:Edit 2: Using an empty dict would not work (see link in comment). So in the second case, you would have to use if/else.
For the first example the default value for key is None, so you can just pass it directly:You can also setup a different default value. For instance the new default value of 123 would be passed to sorted.
As already stated, for sorted, you are basically just packing the original function. I don't think you can avoid the if for the second example, but you can shorten it a little.
