A small game that guesses numbers, but there are the following errors in pycharm, opening with IDLE is no problem. May I ask what is the reason?code screenshoterror messageterminal screenshot
Print(words) is a command that accepts parameters. When you use the print function, you have to use the parenthesis, or you will get an error. Use the suggestion that the error message gave you:print("dict['name']:",dict['name'])
