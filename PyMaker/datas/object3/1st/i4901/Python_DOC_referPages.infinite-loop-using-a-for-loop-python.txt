So I'm trying to make a infinite loop that uses a for loop instead of a while loop. This is my current code. If this code works it should produce x infinitely.Current code:
That doesn't work because the first time you enter the for loop the range function generates a range from zero to the value of z at that point, and later changes to z does not affect it. You can do something like what you want using, for example, itertools.count:
range returns an iterator. The iterator is already generated and evaluated before the loop iteration. (It's the returned iterator on which the loop is iterating). The value of z is not used after the iterator is returned hence incrementing or changing its value is no-op. If you really want an infinite loop using for you will have to write your custom generator.For eg: To be used as :for i in InfiniteLoop()
Update list after each iteration make infinite loop
