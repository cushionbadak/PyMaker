I do have a dict of ditcs; This needs to get sorted in a way FAIL group appears first in the dict followed by pass (even if there is one "FAIL" condition they should be grouped together).To add more detailsif I were to sort in alphabetical order of the values I would do like but if I were to find for "FAIL" string in the values and group them, how am I supposed to do that? Kindly help on this
I'm not a big fan of ordering dicts, so here's a list of keys:The keys that contain 'FAIL' come first. Other than that, there's no particular order. If you need to differentiate between 'FAIL and not 'FAIL' and keep the original order (which is signified by the key, I assume), you could make two lists, one with 'FAIL' and one without and just sort those.
