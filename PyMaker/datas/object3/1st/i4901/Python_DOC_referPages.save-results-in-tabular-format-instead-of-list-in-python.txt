I have a small ml model , based on the predictions it makes, I'm calculating its performance metrics and appending them to a list as follows:  So if the model predicts on three files, then the above code block gets executed thrice and the output from ^ ( is rather nasty) saves to txt file and it looks like this: So if I want to compare two such files, it is becoming very time consuming.  Is there any way to save the results into a structured tabular form like an R dataframe or something, but in Python?so that results would be saved in a more readable format like this: i.e each row would belong to a particular filethank you. 
You can use Pandas, or the csv module, which will do this for you. And in fact for this, I'd recommend you use csv.The more general answer though is that what you really want to do is format the string before you write it to the file. Something like this:This will take each of results, replace each escape each of the pipe characters (Always make you escape your separating characters), join the parts into one line, and then write that to the file.
Or you could write to a tab-separated values (TSV) format without any modules. For example, like this:
