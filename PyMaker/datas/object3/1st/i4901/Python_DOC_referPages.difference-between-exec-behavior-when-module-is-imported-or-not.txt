I am running to of the following programs. Importantly, imagine that there is mymodule.py file in the directory where both these programs are located.The first:The second:The first snippet raises ImportError as expected (after all, the directory where mymodule is located is not in path). The second snippet, however, does not, even though mymodule is also not in its path and the environment I am giving it is empty.My question is why
According to The import system - The module cache,The first place checked during import search is sys.modules. This  mapping serves as a cache of all modules that have been previously  imported, including the intermediate paths. So if foo.bar.baz was  previously imported, sys.modules will contain entries for foo,  foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz. Each key will have as its value the  corresponding module object.During import, the module name is looked up in sys.modules and if  present, the associated value is the module satisfying the import, and  the process completes. However, if the value is None, then a  ModuleNotFoundError is raised. If the module name is missing, Python  will continue searching for the module.The second snippets successfully imports mymodule; it's cached in sys.modules, so no search in other places occurs.
This has nothing to do with exec(), and is a simple misunderstanding about what is available on your sys.path when running a script, and when Python looks for files to load.You state:I am running to of the following programs. Importantly, imagine that there is mymodule.py file in the directory where both these programs are located.[...]The second snippet, however, does not, even though mymodule is also not in its pathThe module is on its path. The directory your script is located in, is added at the start of the module search path. See Command line:<script>Execute the Python code contained in script, which must be a filesystem path (absolute or relative) referring to either a Python file, a directory containing a __main__.py file, or a zipfile containing a __main__.py file.[...]If the script name refers directly to a Python file, the directory containing that file is added to the start of sys.path, and the file is executed as the __main__ module.Bold emphasis mine.So, mymodule.py, which you state is located in the same directory as the scripts you are running, is on the path.Once loaded, modules stay loaded. import <module> will only look at the module search path if there is not already a module in sys.modules by that name. It doesn't matter if you use exec or not to do the import.From the import statement documentation:The basic import statement (no from clause) is executed in two steps:find a module, loading and initializing it if necessarydefine a name or names in the local namespace for the scope where the import statement occurs.The if necessary part is the important bit.Further, from The import system:The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope.[...]When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if found, it creates a module object, initializing it.and from The module cache:The first place checked during import search is sys.modules. This mapping serves as a cache of all modules that have been previously imported, including the intermediate paths. So if foo.bar.baz was previously imported, sys.modules will contain entries for foo, foo.bar, and foo.bar.baz. Each key will have as its value the corresponding module object.During import, the module name is looked up in sys.modules and if present, the associated value is the module satisfying the import, and the process completes.So by the time your exec() code runs, the first import mymodule had already succeeded and sys.modules[mymodule] exists. The secondimport mymodule` finds that object, and the search ends.
