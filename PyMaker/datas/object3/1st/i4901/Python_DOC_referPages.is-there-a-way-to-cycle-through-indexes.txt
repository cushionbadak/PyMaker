This question already has an answer here:Getting the last element of a list in Python                    12 answers                Cycle through list starting at a certain element                    6 answers                If I have list1 as shown above, the index of the last value is 3, but is there a way that if I say list1[4], it would become list1[0]?
You can you modulo math like:Code:Results:
In the situation you described, I myself use the method @StephenRauch suggested. But given that you added cycle as a tag, you might want to know there exists such a thing as itertools.cycle.It returns an iterator for you to loop forever over an iterable in a cyclic manner. I don't know your original problem, but you might find it useful.Be careful with the exit conditions though, you might find yourself in an endless loop.
You could implement your own class that does this.In particular this will preserve all other behaviours of list such as slicing.
