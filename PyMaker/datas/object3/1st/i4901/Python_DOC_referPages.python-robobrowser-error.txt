I'm using RoboBrowser to login to a website using this code:But I get this error:OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument:'http://webpage.com'I'v tried all urls related to the site but I always get the same error. Maybe I can use another library or something. I'm using Windows 10 and use Python 3.6
It seems like you are trying to access the open method of the bra variable (RoboBrowser). The problem is that you are using an equals sign and are actually calling the standard library built-in function open. Changing the equals sign to a period should fix this.
