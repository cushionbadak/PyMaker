I am learning python3 and I've hit a blocker regarding an exercise I am doing.Here is the problem I am trying to solve:"Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". Once "done" is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number."Here is my answer:I get an error however when trying to add the numbers in the list? Can someone advise on what I am doing wrong?Here is the Traceback I get:Thanks,Samuel 
When you call input() you get back a string. You must convert your values to a number using int() or float() before you can sum them.The test x is str doesn't do what you think: you are testing for x to be the actual str type, which it isn't. To test whether the value is an instance of str use isinstance(x, str).BTW, you don't need a loop to count the numbers: there's an attribute on the list that will tell you that directly. Also you don't need a loop to sum them, there's a builtin function for that.
