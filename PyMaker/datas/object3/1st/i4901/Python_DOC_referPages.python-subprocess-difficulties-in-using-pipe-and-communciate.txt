C Code of binary format3Python CodeI'm basically trying to run '(./format3 | attackString) | grep searchString' in my python script,but i can't access the pipe of the format3 process (baby in the code), since it's closed after the communicate call.And i need the communciate call to supply my attackString to the binary.I know i could write the stdout of baby into a file and then use that file as stdin for grep, but I feel like there has to be another way to solve this.
Consider using sh library as it addresses piping issues with function composition:https://amoffat.github.io/sh/#pipingIt is a very neat library that seems to solely solve you problem.
