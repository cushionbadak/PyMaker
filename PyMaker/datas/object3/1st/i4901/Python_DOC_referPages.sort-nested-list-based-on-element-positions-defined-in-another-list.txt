Let's say I have a nested list like:I also have another list holding the position based on which sorting is needed to be performed on each element of my_list list. Let's say it is defined as:Now I want to sort list by multiple arguments. First, I want to sort by the list ordering, which should order the items in ma_list at index [1], and after that I want to sort by the items in list at index [0]. Summing up, what I want to have in the end is:Is there any (preferable Pythonic) way to do this? Suggestions welcome!
Using Lambda ExpressionYou may use sorted() function with the below lambda expression as key to achieve it:This lambda expression will return list of values for each element in the my_list list based on the indexes present in the ordering list. Based on the returned list, sorting will be performed. Sample Run:Using operator.itemgetterEven better to do it using operator.itemgetter() as:
To sort based off of ordering, you can try this:Output:
You can use itemgetter from the operator module to construct the key for sorted.
