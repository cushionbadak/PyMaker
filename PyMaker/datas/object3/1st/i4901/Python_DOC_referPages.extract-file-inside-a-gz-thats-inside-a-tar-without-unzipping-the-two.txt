I need to extract .tex files from multiple .gz files that are inside a single .tar file. I wrote some code that does this successfully, but I am unzipping the .tar and every .gz file. Is there a way to avoid doing so much unzipping? I would like to navigate straight to the .tex files and only extract these.
I was able to answer my question with the help of the comments. (Thanks!) My code now extracts .tex files from multiple .gz files that are inside a single .tar file, without unzipping/saving each .gz file to the computer.
