in this code i first ask the user for the trigonometric function and then ask for the angle in radians or degrees. according to the code, the console should print error, but on running the code, the first if statements accept any input as true.the final coputed value is also worng. please suggest what to do and any other relevant changes that can be made to the code. 
.lower is a function and you need to call it to return a string. Right now you are comparing a function to a string which will return False.Change trigFunc.lower to trigFunc.lower().https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower
There are several errors in your code. Here are the things I changed to get your code working:Use trigFunc.lower() instead of trigFunc.lower. You need to call the method to get the result you desire.Use import math instead of from math import *, since you refer to math library throughout.Use math.radians(int(angle)) instead of int(math.radians(angle)), since math.radians does not take a string as an input.
