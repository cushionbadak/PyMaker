Coming from a C++ background, I often made good use of Visual Studio's F1 help functionality to instantly take me to a help page of a function for examples or more explanation. This saved me from having to google the function. Are there similar help pages for Python, as I am just starting to learn it. If nothing official, is there a extension that could serve the same purpose of easily getting help information from the press of one button(s)?I am running Visual Studio 2017.Thanks
No. Visual Studio doesn't ship with Python documentation, and you cannot rebind F1 to do arbitrary things.Instead, you can use the online documentation, or download it in PDF, HTML or CHM form then open it when you need it.
