I'm using terminal on mac, and anytime I attempt to use pip, I get the following error message telling me that it cannot find a module named zlib:I've read several SO posts with the same error message, and have tried their solutions, including attempting to install zlib using homebrew, which fails, and updating my Xcode developer tools. I also installed pip earlier using python get-pip.py, and it said it installed successfully. The reason I need pip is to install a package for use on python 2.7, but doing $ pip install "package-name" produces the same error as above. I have both Python 2 and 3 installed on my machine, if that helps. I'm kind of new to pip and using the command line in general, and I'm super confused; if anyone could help me out I'd really appreciate it.
This is the OP. I was able to fix the issue, and wanted to post my solution here in case it would help others. Essentially I believe it occurred because Python2 is default on my machine, but pip is by default pointing to resources pertaining to Python3, or something like that. Doing pip2 --version instead provided the expected response.
