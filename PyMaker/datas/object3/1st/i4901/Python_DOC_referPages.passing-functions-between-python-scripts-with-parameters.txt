I'm trying to pass parameters between python scripts where one is a GUI collecting information for a login screen and the other is the database adding and searching for the information.then in the database code I have:and when i add the parameters into the function this happens:i'm not sure how else I'm supposed to call this function.Any ideas thanks.
You only need to import the function, then you can call the function.Then you can call the function as normal.or assign it to a variable:It is also standard practice to include imports at the top of the file but it is not necessary..  It just stops imports getting lost inside the codebase.UPDATE:If you also need the cursor to insert data into the database then you will need to either import the whole file:Note: This will run any functions that are executed in the file.or you will have to create a new cursor inside the file you are importing into..Please have a read of the python documentation on importing..https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
