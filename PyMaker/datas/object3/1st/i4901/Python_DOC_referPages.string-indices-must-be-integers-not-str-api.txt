I have an interesting behavior happening with my program.i have the following methods:From section: pumpCoin = my_api.getMarket('OSC') to pumpSellRate = pumpCoin['Data']['Low'], i have no problems getting the information and working with it.Problem seems to be starting with line: pumpSellCoin = my_api.getBalance('OSC') I get the following Error message:if i run: print (my_api.getBalance('OSC'), i am able to see all the private API information that is retrieved by that call, however i am not sure why it is giving me a problem when i try to call 1 specific item in the stack.Let me know if you need any more information on this.Any help will be greatly appreciated.I have looked at the other posts and so far i can't seem to figure out the exact cause.This is the private_api code
Please add this to your code:This will show you that one of your variables is a list or a string and not a dictionary and you need to access is using a number and not a name like "Data" or "Total"Try this example:
if i run the program as follows:i get the following results:So i am definitely able to communicate back and forward, however the issue only seems to be when i try to work with a single piece of information from pumpSellBal = my_api.getBalance('OSC')
