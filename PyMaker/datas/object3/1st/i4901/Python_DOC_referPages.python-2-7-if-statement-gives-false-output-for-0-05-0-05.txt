This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                For my assignment I have to check if a calculated value is within 0.05 of 0.5. To do this i thought subtracting one from another, taking the absolute value and checking if that is smaller or equal then 0.05 should do the trick. However when i try this piece of code.The returns a very weird output.Where y is seen as 0.05 but x is not seen as 0.05, however both values are equal to 0.05 according to python.Am I doing something wrong?
This is just how floats behave. Most programming languages are like this. Usually when comparing floats, its safer to check whether within an allowed error of your value, instead of checking for equality:Python3.5 adds the relevant math.isclose.
By default it's generating long floating valueTry this:-
I would use Decimal in this manner:Output:Then your tests will work fine.
