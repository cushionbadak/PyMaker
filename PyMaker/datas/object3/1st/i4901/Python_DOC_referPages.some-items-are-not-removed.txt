I'm have a problem with remove(). I have to read a string and it convert to a list, then this list I must remove item "", but the last items are not removed.I show you the code:I show the result
Just apply strip() first:str.strip() returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing whitespace removed.If you need to just remove from the left or right, you can use lstrip() or rstrip() respectively.
