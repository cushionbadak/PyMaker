Natural Text
I have a variable with some sort of review text. I want to create a new variable which has  the count of uppercase words in the text.For Example: Review_1: "This was a great product"Answer_1:Uppercase_word:0 Review_2: "This was NOT AT ALL GOOD"Answer_2: uppercase_word:4
str.isupper returns a boolean (True or False) if a string is entirely uppercased.In Python 1 == True and 0 == False so you can sum booleans.The only thing left is to split the original string into words using .split.
