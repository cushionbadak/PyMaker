Natural Text
I have been using this code for a while, the problem I am having is when I pull from Twitter API, commas separate the cells in my CSV file. Some tweets and some data Twitter gives you contains commas, so my cells end up being on different columns. For example, while the text of one tweet might be in the third column, one other could be in the third, fourth and fifth. I need some way to fix this.  Here is my code:
firstly the csv can be generated in a way that commas within a quoted block are treated as part of the block, see this post.it has two answers, one using double quotes and the other inverted, I am not sure what is the actual one that works.if this is not applicable and you need to remove commas from your file altogether, do something like:or whatever your input may be you can manipulate a string and replace commas for spaces.
