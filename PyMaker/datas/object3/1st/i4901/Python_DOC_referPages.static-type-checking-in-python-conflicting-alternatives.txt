Today I was introduced to multiple ways of using static type checking in Python (by the the Coconut tutorial). It lists python 3.5 type hints, python 3.6 variable annotations, and MyPy. I then found another, from Google, called pytype.Do these alternatives conflict? Does any of them rely on any of the others? Does any (subset) of them render any of the others unnecessary?
The first three options you've mentioned are related. Type-hints introduced in Python 3.5 (as a consequence of PEP 484) and supported by Python 2.7 (via stub-files) were inspired by the MyPy project. The whole system is now developed alongside MyPy. Variable type-hints introduced in Python 3.6 are a part of the process: they are perfectly consistent with never MyPy releases. pytype seems to be an alternative static analyser created for the same type-hint system. In other words, MyPy and pytype are designed for the same type-system.
