I am trying to add items to 9 lists that are already in 9 other lists.  I would like to have the first element of every list in the first list. And then the second element of each list into a second list.So for example, I want my first output list using the three lists [1,2,3] and [3,2,1] to be [1,3].  I've come up with this but it keeps returning a KeyError:
Your example code makes little sense. But your question does. Therefore, I will answer your question.zip is a convenient built-in function which iterates simultaneously through items of multiple iterables.This is one application:Notice the unpacking operator *, the fact we need to wrap in list since zip is an interator, and indexer [0] which extracts the first element of each list.
