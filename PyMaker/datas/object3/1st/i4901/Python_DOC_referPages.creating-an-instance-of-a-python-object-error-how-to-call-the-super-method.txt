Natural Text
If I have a class defined as such in one file (called gui.py), (where QtWidgets is an imported module (PyQt5))How in another file do I create an instance of this object? i.e. when I do the following,I get error "super-class__init__() of type Window was never called". Also when I tryI get the error type Object 'Window' has no attribute 'super'.
This should work:(grabbed from https://pythonspot.com/category/pyqt5/)
