You can try this:Output:
Note that your result is no longer a dict, but rather a list of lists, which is better if you want to sort it, since order in dicts isn't guaranteed/implementation detailI would sort the items according to the value of the key in the other dictionary, and convert the tuples that items yield to 2-elements list:result:
