Natural Text
I am making a 'Hangman' game and would like to have python select a random word from a website. But it keeps printing as b'word'  and would like to know how to fix this so that it is just word.My code:I keep getting this error and not sure how to fix it:
A correct version of you code - the problem was that you were having a bytes object instead of the str you probably expected.I added a .decode('utf-8') to the content read from the website, and now the html is an str object.You recieved the error because you were working on a bytes object (the word_chocie), as str.Note that the b prefix you had in word_chocie (b'hello') is python's mark that this object is of type bytes.
