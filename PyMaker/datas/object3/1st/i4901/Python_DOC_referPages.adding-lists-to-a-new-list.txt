Natural Text
I did not get this question right. The function read_words turns a text file with a bunch of names in new lines into a list and it works.the problem arises when I try to get a list of liststhe goal is to turn a text file of the type:into [['A','B','C','D'],['E','F','G','H']] I have already tried playing around with the indices for board_list.append(row_list) call without luck. How can I get this to work?
