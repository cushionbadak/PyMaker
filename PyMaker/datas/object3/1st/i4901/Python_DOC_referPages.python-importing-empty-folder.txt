Why python allows to import any random(including an empty) directory? So, in above the snap shot, am I importing a package OR a module?. Yes, 'test' is a folder but import target is always a module(.py file) isn't it?
You are unwittingly creating a namespace package.  This bug ... ahem ... this feature was introduced in Python 3.3+.  Details are in PEP 420.
You are most probably importing module test not your folder ...https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-path-based-finderhttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import
