Apologies for incorrect lingo, I am still new to this. I want to make a class initialiser that, using a conditional, will decide whether or not the instance of said class will collapse into a simple integer.Simplified Unworking Example:Any help would be very much appreciated!
__new__ is the method used to control the creation of new objects (hence the name).  Here we check if b is zero in __new__ and return an instance of the appropriate type.  In action:
You should use the magic method __new__ for this. __new__ is used as a factory where you can decide which class should be instantiated.
You don't.The behavior you desire is completely unexpected and somewhat bizarre. Calling A() is expected to return an instance of A. Doing anything else is confusing and unintuitive, which makes it difficult to read and understand any code invoking it.AlternativeIf you really need this behavior, create a factory method:Obviously, you need a better name than make_thing, but without any context, I can't give you any suggestions.Avoid the problem if possibleSince A is not a number and is generally not compatible with int, it is also somewhat strange to store both int and A in the same variable.If all you're doing is converting to a string, then you don't need a class at all. A simple method outside of a class is the better alternative:If you're doing more than that, your calling code will probably end up looking something like this:This is somewhat silly: you write a method to choose the data type and then have to write specialized code for each possible result. You're not getting any benefits from having a function that returns the separate types here. I can think of two simpler alternatives:Just move the check to the calling code:If you go this route, you should also modify A.__init__ to throw a ValueError if b == 0, since that would be an invalid state for an A to be in.Modify A so that it works properly regardless of whether b is 0:ThenBut again, it's hard to provide recommendations without knowing how you're actually using it.
