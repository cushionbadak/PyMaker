How can I convert any date to just number of days? This is what I tried:I got 737 158 days but according to https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html I should have 736 755 days. Do I miss something? Is there easier way to do this?
This helps
Are the amount of days in a year correct for you?01/01/0001 - 01/01/2018 has 736,696, you say there is 737,060. This is roughly 1 year too many.After fixing the above, we should check if 01/01/0001 - 01/02/2018 works. The website says 736,727, where you say 736,754. Which is about the entire month of February too many.You have one too many leap years.You can also simplify this code to:This is now the same as datetime.datetime.now().toordinal().
The number of days between two dates can be calculated as below: For more see here. Hope this may helpUpdate:edit2 days difference because start days and end date are excluded.
