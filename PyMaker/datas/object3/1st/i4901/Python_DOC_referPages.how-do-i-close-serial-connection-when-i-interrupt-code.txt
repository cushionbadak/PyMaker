I have the following Python code which is just reading from an Arduino, and writing to a file:Whenever I interrupt the script, I always have to type ser.close() in the console, otherwise I cannot start the script again (in the same console).How can I close the serial communication automatically whenever I interrupt the script?
Use a try/finally block to insure close is called:
You can use the with statement.The with statement will automatically close ser and text_file when execution leaves the with statement. This can be an exception in your case. The with statement has been introduced by PEP 343 to remove try/finaly statements by using context managers.
