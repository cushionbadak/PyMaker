I am writing a function that takes 3 inputs, if all 3 inputs are floats and/or integers it returns the average of the 3, otherwise it returns them as a list. This is what I have:when I input 3 integers it returns the list, how can I get it to recognize the input as integers? Thanks
Here is one way:Explanationall(criteria for t in l) applies a lazy function all on a generator expression, which checks if all items in l are integers or floats.isinstance is generally preferred to checking type.The if / else clause can be replaced by a ternary statement.
You can use exception handling. A TypeError exception is raised if not all elements of l are numeric:
Minimal changes to get the code to work in Python 2 or 3:You just needed to compare type(t) to int or float, and convert s to float before the division.  You also have to complete testing of all list members before the return, otherwise s = sum(l)will bomb for a case like [1, 'str', 6]
