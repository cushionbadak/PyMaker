Hello guys! Just started studying python a week ago from the book "Python Crash Course", I have a little question about this program.Why in the build_profile they write location='princeton' and not 'location' = 'princeton'
What is happening is location and field both become part of **kwargs or, in this case **user_info. kwargs stands for keyword arguments and thus Python recognizes that the user can enter a number of keyword parameters, and will happily accept them.What is happening at a deeper level is a dictionary is passed to build profile that looks something like this:This means that it is possible to pass a dictionary to any **kwargs argument. In the case of supplying keywords instead, Python will, in essence, build the dictionary automatically.
Those are not actually a dictionary that you are passing into your function, they are keyword arguments which you can read about in the Python documentation linked.Keyword arguments have a lot of uses which are too many to enumerate here.In your function definition ** means (and some additional keyword arguments) which allows the user to provide any keyword arguments they want. Try adding random_key="test" for example
you should read up on this question Understanding kwargs in Python to understand what you are doing, but that **user_info is described as keyword argument (and is usually written as **kwargs). When calling that funciton, since it includes a **kwargs input, you can write in any additional fields you might want. Then, this function: for key, value in user_info.items():        profile[key] = valueCreates those variables in the profile dict
