When you open a file with with open(file_name, 'a+') as file_data_2: the variable file_data_2 becomes an instance of a class _io.TextIOWrapper which indeed does not have such attribute. If you want to see what attributes/methods are available for any variable that you create you can easily do that in the interactive mode of Python. Open terminal, run your Python (Python 3 in my case):First, open your file and store it in a variable similarly to what you did in your code:The variable file is now an instance of the _io.TextIOWrapper class. You can check the available methods for the class with the command:And this is the output:As you see, there is no 'append' method. However, there is 'write' and I suppose that is what you need.
