The function fib() below taken from chapter 4.6 in The Python Tutorial includes at the end of the definition a line containing print() with no apparent reason since the same function without that line -fib0()- produces the same output. So what is the reason of including that in the function definition? Which function between fib() and fib0() is more efficient?Output:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597,  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597,
The difference is in print(). Fib has this, and the print function automatically puts a newline at the end. So fib will output an extra newline while fib0 won't. For example:Output: Does not have the newline and prints one continuous list.
The unvarnished print() call at the end of the first implementation ensures that a newline is output. print(a, end=', ') follows its output of a with a comma and a space - the default value for end is \n.If you were to alter your calling code to readyou would observe the difference more easily.
