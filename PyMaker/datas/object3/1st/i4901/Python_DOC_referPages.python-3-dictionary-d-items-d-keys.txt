Natural Text
I'm kind of confused on d.items() and d.keys(). My textbook said that they return view objects that are tuples but they can be changed? For instance, my code is thisIt prints out 20 instead of 27. 
What your textbook means is that if the keys of the dictionary change, then so will the view.The same happens for items.Also, they are not tuples, they have their own class.
-~-~-~-~-~-The above code vill give you all True because every item in the dict_items object is indeed a tuple. a.items() doesn't return tuples yet returns an object which holds tuples.
