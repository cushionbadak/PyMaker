I am trying to parse to hh:mm:ss and store it in another list y[]. I used two codes, one of which is wrong and I can figure out why. Wrong codeOutputRight codeOutput (which I wanted)Can someone tell the reason why there's a difference when I use the .append()?I am aware y[] will just store one value, but why isn't that one value parsed?
append adds to the end of the array [0]. Whereas = reassigns the name to the new contents [1].
