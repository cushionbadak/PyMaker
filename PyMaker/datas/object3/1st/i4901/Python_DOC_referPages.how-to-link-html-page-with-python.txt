This question already has an answer here:How can I connect my python script with my HTML file?                    2 answers                I have a form in an HTML page that reads input from a user (string x), and I have my python script that uses this variable.What is the easiest way to fetch this variable from the HTML page by the python script (.py) and return the result - which should also be a string -  to show it in the HTML page again?
You can use either a modern WSGI environment like Flask or Django, or if the utility is very small, you can take a look at Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
