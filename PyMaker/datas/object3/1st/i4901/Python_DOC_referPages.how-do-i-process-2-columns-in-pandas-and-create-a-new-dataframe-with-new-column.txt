I want to calculate the co-variance of each of the columns with one another in my_list. The formula is in the function def covariance_formula(...):My code is as follows:Questions:How can I create a new df df2 which will have the output of in EXPECTED OUTPUT B? Is there a faster way of doing it?Current Problem:The current problem I am facing is that I cannot seem to get rid of this:NameError: name 'df2' is not definedThings I have tried:How to calculate multiple columns from multiple columns in pandaCalculating sum of multiple columns in pandasOUTPUT A:EXPECTED OUTPUT B:
