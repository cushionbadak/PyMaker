I have written a code where the person inputs the amount of money the have and what computer they want, how would I write a code to tell them if the have can afford it or not. (I am only 11 years old so I do not want it to be over complicated)
@Ten-Coin already answered your specific question, but since it sounds like you're brand-new to programming, I wanted to offer some more general advice and encouragement.When you're first starting out with a language--and with programming in general--it's often helpful to follow some tutorials that give you an idea of how the language works. There are lots of resources to help you learn Python online that will gradually show you how to build simple at first, then more complicated, projects.Programming is a lot of fun, so I hope you keep exploring and learning! Good luck!
This is as an example and you can extend your if-else to some other models. Read this for better idea : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
