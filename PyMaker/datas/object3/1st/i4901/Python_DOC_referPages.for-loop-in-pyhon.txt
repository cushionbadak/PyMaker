so earlier I am learning c/c++ and use for loops intensivelybut now I am learning python and I came across python implementation offor loop which isMy question is how for loop works in python1.) Where is initialization?2.) Where is testing conditions?3.) Where is the increment?or else python does not work like c/c++ please explain how the for loop worksin python
I think you need to understand that range is not part of the for loop but is an immutable sequence type. Range definition:start The value of the start parameter (or 0 if the parameter was not  supplied)stop The value of the stop parameterstep The value of the step parameter (or 1 if the parameter was not  supplied)Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence and hence since range is immutable sequence type what you supply to the for loop is actually a sequence of numbers.So range creates a list of numbers that then the for loop is using to loop over.You could also have:and you have the same result.Now how the for iterates over the sequence is another question. In short, it uses iterators to do this. Your best friend is to read the docs of the language you are learning. Have a look here as well there are some more examples.
