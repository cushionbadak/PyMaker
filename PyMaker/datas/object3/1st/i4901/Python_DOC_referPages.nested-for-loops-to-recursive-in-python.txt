I need to rewrite this awful piece of code using recursion in Python. The depth of the nesting should depend on argument of function rec but eventaully I'd like it to be length of the variable "a", which is string. I'd be grateful for any responses and clues how to approach this problem.  
FWIW, some kinds of combinatoric logic are more easily expressed with itertools than with recursion.  For example, when this pattern occurs:It can be replaced with this:There is more to your question than this, but I wanted to point out that combinatoric functions are a good starting point for the kind of logic posed in this question.
This awful code can be re-written as below in iterative, but it will reduce the efficiency. Same applies to the recursive function.
Just a recursive solution...Demo:
