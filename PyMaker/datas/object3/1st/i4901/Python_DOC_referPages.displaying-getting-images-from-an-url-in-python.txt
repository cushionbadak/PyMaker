I am new to python. But I got a task and I need to Displaying/getting Images from an URL. I have been using Jupyter notebook with python to try to do this.I was trying to do it as in this post but none of the answers work.WithI get:With:I get:With:I get:Etc....I thought it was going to be an easy task, but so far I haven't been able to find an answer.I really hope someone can help me
This worked for meYou are getting an error because you used the line response.read("https://baobab-poseannotation-appfile.s3.amazonaws.com/media/project_5/images/images01/01418849d54b3005.o.1.jpg").decode('utf-8') instead. I'd switch back to using response = requests.get(url)Additionally, for your error: ImportError: No module named 'cStringIO', you are using python3. StringIO and cStringIO from python 2 were removed in python 3. Use from io import StringIO instead. See StringIO in Python3 for more details.
