I tried to test a code written in python 2 in free access here. When I run the code I encountered the following error related to listMany thanks for helpsJane(I'm a newbee in python)logRegression.py 
The issue here stems from a different behaviour of the filter method. You can see that in this question, or read up on it in the python3 or python2 docs.In short: In python 2 it generates a list, so ind_list[:][1] are all lists of integers.However, in python 3 it generates a generator, which is why you get the output TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'filter', since ind_list[:][1] all contain filter objects.You can either convert all the outputs of the filter commands in the creation of ind_list to a list:or use python2. But I am guessing there is a specific reason for you to use python3Hint:Since you are using anaconda, you can simply dofollowed byin an anaconda prompt and it will give you a virtual environment with python2 to use
