I need to calculate just first five prime numbers. I want to check the length of list while building it in list comprehension. The following code doesn't work.Output:Why len(primes)<6 is not working here. How can I achieve that?
The "Pythonic" way is to use a generator, plus the islice function:What this will do is create an infinite "list" called primes that you can use in many ways that a list can be used, but it will only actually calculate the values that you need.
Use itertools.islice combined with filter to make your computation lazy.
List Comprehension creates and returns the new list. In your code, within the list comprehension, len(primes) will always return zero because the length of list will not be updated till the list comprehension is complete and new list is returned. If it is must for you to use a list comprehension, you may create a generator function to return you the next prime in the range. Within the list comprehension call the next() on the generator object (using the range to restrict the count of required values). For example:The final value hold by primes will be:As suggested in robbrit's answer, Pythonic way to achieve this is using itertools.islice (but it is not a list comprehension as you requested):
