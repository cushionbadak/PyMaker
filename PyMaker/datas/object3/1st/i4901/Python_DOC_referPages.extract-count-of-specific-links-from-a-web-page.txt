I am writing a python script using BeautifulSoup. I need to scrape a website and count unique links ignoring the links starting with '#'.Example if the following links exist on a webpage:https://www.stackoverflow.com/questionshttps://www.stackoverflow.com/foohttps://www.cnn.com/For this example, the only two unique links will be (The link information after the main domain name is removed):Note: this is my first time using python and web scraping tools.I appreciate all the help in advance. This is what I have tried so far:
There is a function named urlparse from urllib.parse which you can get netloc of urls. And there is a new awesome HTTP library named requests_html which can help you get all links in source file.
You could also do this:The soup.find_all line checks if every atag has an href set and if it doesn't start with the # character.The Counter method counts the occurrences of each list entry and the most_common orders by the value.The for loop just prints the results.
My way to do this is to find all links using beautiful soup and then determine which link redirects to which location:tld extract finds the correct url name and soup.find_all('a') finds a tags. The if statements check for same domain redirect, javascript redirect or other domain redirects.
