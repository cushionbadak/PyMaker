Beginner here, looking for some help with python!Right now, I have a function defined that returns a list of lists:And it prints out: Now, I want to write a second version of the function that takes as second argument a boolean (i.e. True or False) called flip. The default value for flip shall be False. I can reverse the order such that 'nonmigratory' appears at the beginning, but that's not what I want. I want the order preserved, just flipping to (3, "But') all the way through.I appreciate any help you can offer!
Here's one solution:ExplanationYou only need to apply split() once.You can feed map directly into zip. This means more work is done lazily, rather than building unnecessary lists.Python supports lazy ternary statements for one-line if / else constructs.A print statement with no argument is not useful and can be removed.

Python functions can be called with a single list of arguments, instead of multiple individual arguments.We can use this to make one set of arguments and one reversed set of arguments, depending on the state of flipprintsNotesThe parentheses you were using were superfluousTry to use speaking variable names, not a and bPython's list comprehensions make it possible to avoid writing a function in the first place. The above function could be written as:
