Is there a way I can hide a password in python shell?, like showing dots. This is for an input for a login in a python program.Getpass shows this: Warning (from warnings module):  File "C:\Python34\lib\getpass.py", line 101    return fallback_getpass(prompt, stream)GetPassWarning: Can not control echo on the terminal.Warning: Password input may be echoed.Enter your password: hammadhammadThe password is visible, and I have my own python script for getting a user name and then the password, using a database to check if account exists
You can actually utilise the library getpass as follows:A general rule of thumb is to not show the number of characters in a person's password via the asterisks/dots shown, which is what getpass does.
there is the getpass module. that hides input (but does not show dots or anything).
this getpass module only shows password when using in IDLE. but when you run script in cmd it will notyou can do this by double clicking the .py file and not opening it with IDLEor you can do is open cmd and write.c:\Python27\python.exe 'filepath'.py  this statement may change according to where your python forlder is installer of or which version you are using but the syntax remain same  \python.exe 'filepath'.py
