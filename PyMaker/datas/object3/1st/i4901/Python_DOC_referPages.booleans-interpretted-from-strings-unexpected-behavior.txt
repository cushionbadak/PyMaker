Can anyone explain this behaviour in Python (2.7 and 3)I would expect that because I am using logic operators and and or, the statements would be evaluated as a = bool("Monday") and bool("tuesday").So what is happening here?
As explained here using and / or on strings will yield the following result:a or b returns a if a is True, else returns b.a and b returns b if a is True, else returns a.This behavior is called Short-circuit_evaluation and it applies for both and, or as can be seen here. This explains why a == 'tuesday' in the 1st case and 'Monday' in the 2nd.As for checking a == True, a is True, using logical operators on strings yields a specific result (as explained in above), and it is not the same as bool("some_string").
