I have a column in a sqlite3 db. This column contains one or more value for single entry.I am talking about tags column.What I want to do is to extract them as single element.So I developed this code:Result is this:The problem is that I can't add them to a list one by one.If you print lista_tags this is the output:How can I add this group of values in single ones inside a list ?
Assuming that your tags = ['hansel, gretel', 'cappuccetto, rosso, lupo', 'signore, anelli, gollum', 'blade,runner', 'pinocchio', 'incredibili'] after your fetchall() your can achieve your result with this:The output will be:
List is a collection of value so you are append value in lista_tags so you get all valuefor i in tags:    lista_tags.append(i)if you want to get single value by accessing them using "key"  lista_tags[1]  it will give you single value
