Watching a youtube video to learn how to scrape multiple pages. I copied the video line for line and ran into a few issues. First, is this HTTP Error 404. [Here is my code]I believe after doing some quick searching, I think it is because there is no URL for the letter 'x'. Please correct me if I am wrong. Is there a way to subtract the letter 'x' out from ascii_lowercase?here is my codeMy second question is like I said in the video I copied the code line for line, but I am not getting the players names along with the data. I did notice after inspecting it that the player name was tagged with 'th' and not included in 'td'. I tried adding another for loop, but couldn't get it to work.Thanks for the help!!
It seems that urllib.request.urlopen throws an exception when the http stauts code is 404. I was not aware of that. If that only occurs with the url built with the letter x, usingshould work.If that is not the case, a more defensive approach would be to add an try block to the make_soup call and do something when the error occurs. Something like this:this will just log the url that was not found and skip to the next loop iteration, you may want (or need) to do something else.You may want to take a look here for more information regarding error handling in python.
