It's valid to use my Python program in any of these 3 ways:Each of these do different things. (1) does not dump stuff to a file at all. (2) dumps it to dump.log. (3) dumps it to FILE.I'm unsure how to distinguish between (1) and (2) after I've called parse_args(). Here is my code:What do I do now?
You just need to provide a const argument to parser.add_argument(). This specifies the value that will be filled in if the option is used without specifying a value on the command line. You can then test whether args.etags_filename is the const value (case 2) or the default value 'dump.log' (case 1).
