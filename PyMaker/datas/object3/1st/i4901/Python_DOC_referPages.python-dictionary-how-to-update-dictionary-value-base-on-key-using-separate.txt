I've got two dictionaries of unequal length, e.g.:What I'm wanting to do is replace the values in people with the jobcode value.So youd end up with:nI'd be happy to make another new dict that encapsulates this new data as well but so far the closest I think I've come is this... I think...Any help would be greatly appreciated.
