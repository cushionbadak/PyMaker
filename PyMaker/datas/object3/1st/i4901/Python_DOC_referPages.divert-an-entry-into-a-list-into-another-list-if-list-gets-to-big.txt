I have no idea how to format this, I just want it so that once list[] gets to big the new entries are diverted into list_2[], my original code doesn't have raise Exception() just list_2.append(elapse). I'm only in highschool, week 6 of computer science so I don't know too much jargon.
You can simply use an if / else construct as so:But think about your use case. Consider these questions:Why is your list size capped? Is this something that can be accounted for downstream?Will you have an indefinite number of lists? If so, consider using a dictionary of lists, or list of lists.
simply make a 2 layer list: This means you can have an endless number of 50 item lists rather than limit yourself to a hard-coded number of lists :)
First off, you cannot name a list because list is a python built in name.So call them list1 and list2 (Anything but list.   Of course you do not raise an exception like you did in python.if you wish you can use elif to check the len of list2.You can have as many elif statements as you please but else is always last.If you do wish to catch exceptions, ie if it is not a list you can wrap it in a try / except statemnent.Some reading for you:Error handling:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.htmlif /elif`:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
You an decide which list to append with for instance a ternary operator:So first we check whether len(list1) < 50. If that is the case, we set list_to_append = list1, otherwise we set list_to_append = list2. We then append to that list.Please do not name variables things like list, set, dict, etc. Since this will override the reference to the classes with the same name.
