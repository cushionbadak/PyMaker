Natural Text
works if I give as input -> c:\databut not if:Can someone explain me the reason for this behaviour? Thank you.
Because in literal strings, \ is an escape character - allow putting quotes/tabs/newlines etc. in literal strings. You should use 'c:\\data' or 'c:/data' (forward slash works fine in windows)Another way is to use "raw" strings r'c:\data' but be careful, because you can't use any escaped characters anymore
