I have the current code:I want to be able to call add_for_elmtfor a slice of A.list like this A[1:3].add_for_elmt(). Is this possible to do? If so, how do I do it?
You are looking to apply a function to a list of objects -- specifically one that is generated as a slice of a larger list.For this, we use the map() functionality. This takes two parameters: a function, and a list, and applies the function to each element of the list.
