Hi my conversion finished stops arriving on the client side once the code execution takes too long.This works:while the following fails:also note that this works:First I expected some kind of timeout but the disconnect happened after varying times..so far I observed 90, 94, 100, 104 seconds.On the client side the console looks like following.Working 5 seconds case:Failing 120 seconds case:
There is ping_timeout parameter for SocketIO that has default value 60 seconds. You can play with it to adjust wait time.However for executing any long operations, it is recommended not to block current thread since it is blocking next requests.Consider any of next approaches for your implementation:Async execution using threads or separate processes https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.htmlCelery based background tasks http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/celeryAsyncio's coroutine http://flask-aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coroutine.html
