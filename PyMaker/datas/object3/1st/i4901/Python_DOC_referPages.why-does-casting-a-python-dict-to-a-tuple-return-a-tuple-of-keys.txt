I came across some Python code that had me very confused.Basically, I found that casting a dictionary as a tuple returns a tuple of the dictionary's keys.Why does a tuple(dict) return a tuple of keys? I can make sense of it, but wasn't able to find any documentation or explanation around why. Can anyone explain this?
Dictionary objects are clearly documented here:iter(d)Return an iterator over the keys of the dictionary.Note, this is why I don't like using the term "cast" when you use list or tuple to convert an iterable into a list or tuple. And from the tuple docs:class tuple([iterable]):...The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the  same order as iterableâ€™s items. iterable may be either a sequence,  a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If  iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, tuple('abc') returns ('a', 'b', 'c') and tuple( [1, 2, 3] )  returns (1, 2, 3). If no argument is given, the constructor creates  a new empty tuple, ().
