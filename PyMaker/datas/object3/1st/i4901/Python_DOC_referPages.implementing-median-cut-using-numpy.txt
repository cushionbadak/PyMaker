So I'm trying to implement a basic median cut algorithm in python using python and numpy so far i got some simple code to calculate which medians i need to calculate however I now want to convert the image to values between 0 and cuts where 0 is the would represent the lowest median and cuts-1 the highest.Edit:img is a grayscale image represented as a matrix
at the risk of sounding like a smartass ... you have looked at?:https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.htmlI would assume you can load the image as a data-grid (pandas) or an array with numpy.  And then pass the iterable into a desired stat function ...
