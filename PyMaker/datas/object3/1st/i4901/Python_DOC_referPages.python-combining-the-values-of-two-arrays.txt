This question already has an answer here:How to merge lists into a list of tuples?                    8 answers                I am struggling to combine the values of two arrays in Python. I want to get the values of two arrays as pairs.EXAMPLE: Suppose we have two arrays a and b as below:How can I combine the values of two arrays as pairs similar to:      I am not sure if it can be done as an array or a list.
You can combine list comprehension and zip() to do that:OutputThis works correctly as a and b have the same amount of inner lists and the inner lists have the same length. zip() does only create tuples for 2 lists up to the shorter length of both. For inequeal length lists you can use itertools.zip_longest(...) which uses None or a specified default to fill up the shorter list.
