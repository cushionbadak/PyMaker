I am trying to make the snort effect on the command line. Right now, this code is printing vertically:And when I can get it to print horizontally, I loose the 0.1 seconds wait to create the desired effect.Cheers
@Patrick Artner's answer is correct, but I just wanted to add on a use case that will work in certain IDE's as well as the Windows command prompt.In order to get the desired animation, you have to also include sys, and use sys.stdout.flush() in each iteration of the loop, like so:If you do not do this in the command prompt (or certain IDE's), the program will output the entire string after it has slept for each iteration of the loop.You can actually also force print() to flush the output buffer by including the flush parameter in your print statement.  So you can avoid importing sys if you do this:
Specify the end character of the print command - it defaults to newline if not specificly given. Thats why seperate prints end on new lines: Also useful: the sep='' addon:Output:
replace with below line print statement take end argument with any  string or char
