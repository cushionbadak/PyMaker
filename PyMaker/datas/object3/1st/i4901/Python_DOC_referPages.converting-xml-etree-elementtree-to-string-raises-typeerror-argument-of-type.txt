I have a simple XML element created with xml.etree.ElementTree in Python 3.I can use Element.get() to access individual attributes from my element without any issues.However, if I try to convert my element to a string with .tostring(), I get an error "TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable".Why can't I use .tostring() on an xml.etree.ElementTree.Element with an integer attribute?Full code:Full traceback:
Even though Age is intended to be a numeric value, xml attribute values should be quoted strings:Alternatively, if the data was stored as a variable, convert it to a string with str()
