I wonder if this hint is just for better readability or it really does some optimizations.https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases
No, an alias does not convey any kind of performance optimisation.It just makes it easier to read your code. It is easier to reason about a function accepting a Vector and returning (another) Vector, than it is to use the more generic List[float] type in the signature of scale().Use aliases the same way you would use constants in your code. For example, if your code needed to calculate acceleration in free-fall, you'd store 9.807 as the EARTH_GRAVITY constant, rather than just use 9.807 in your code. Using EARTH_GRAVITY makes your code easier to read.
