I want to have a variable number of variables with the variables equal to an array of numbers. I know similar questions have been asked but none provided the answer I was seeking.I have tried having the variables top and bottom either tuples or numpy arrays but neither worked. I don't care what the type of numbers are because I can convert them later, I just need the variable names changed with each iteration.Thanks for the help. EDIT: Here is an example that probably better explains what I'm trying to do.In the bottom code I'm creating a new variable with each iteration, but I'm only doing it for a set amount of iterations. How can I do it for an infinite amount of iterations?   
For the first example you provided, its behavior will most likely not be what you expected because you modify the list i while simultaneously iterating across it.As for your second example, what you're asking is not advisable and almost certainly not what you actually want to do. See this question and this other one for more information.Finally, I doubt this is actually the best approach for solving your problem, but you can accomplish (approximately) what you were trying to do in your question using a dictionary.
