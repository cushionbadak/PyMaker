I have a CSV file like this one:Each route has an id and an alias that are always the same for the same route. Also each route has a set of points, each of them made of a longitude and latitude. I'm trying to group the points by route, but I want to yield every field of the file.When I use itertools groupby to group by route, I'm only able to yield route and points:I tried different ways to get the id and alias for that route (like using route['id'] or p['id'] to get the id or using another for outside the existing one), but none of them worked. Is there a way to have a composite key when using groupby? Or maybe an easier solution to my problem?I would like to be able to yield this:
You can indeed groupby with a composite key:You just need to access your key by index when you yield the result.Try it online!
You can groupby multiple fields at once if you return a tuple from your key function.You can use operator.itemgetter for that. The for loop would look like:
