I want to do this exercise which I have done well with the following code but I want to do it with the second code but I don't know how to introduce two lists in a Terminal:Exercise: Create a function that receives two input parameters of type list and that returns a list where the two lists are combined, alternately.This is the way I have to do:
Another way is to use argparse: Usage:python module_name.py --list1 x y z --list2 1 2 3['x', 'y', 'z']['1', '2', '3']UPDATEI've noticed your comment for the previous answer. If you want to distinguish between strings and numbers you can do as following:So now your input should be of form:python module_name.py  [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] [1, 2, 3, \"a\"]and you will get:['a', 'b', 'c'][1, 2, 3, 'a']Note that now your input lists can be of mixed types.
You can do it like thatIn your current code you are probably passing each list item as a serperate argument. To pass two lists you need to quote each list like foo.py "1, 2, 3" "a, b, c".Outputs: ['1', ' 2', ' 3', 'a', ' b', ' c'].
