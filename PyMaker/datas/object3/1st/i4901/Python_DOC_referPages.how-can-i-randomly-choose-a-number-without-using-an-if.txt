Basically, I'm messing around in Python (3) and I'm trying to define some functions to do some common tasks in single lines, using as less memory as possibleFor example, in video games, you might want a character to turn some degrees left/right, but not 0 degrees. So, given an integer x, how could you return a random integer between -x and +x` (inclusive) which isn't 0?Note, I'm going for one-liners using minimum memory.I'm posting an answer but I'd also like to know how other people would approach this.EDIT: This isn' school homework or anything, I'm just designing a video game and defining a few functions which will come in handy. I said no 'If's because I was wondering if it was possible, and if so, how.Thanks :-)
I would suggest:
I would use:
random.sample works with ranges which are very small compared to the range of numbers they provide.This create a positive number between 1 and x and multiplies it with 1 or -1. After looking at kch answer, I would probably go his approach.
