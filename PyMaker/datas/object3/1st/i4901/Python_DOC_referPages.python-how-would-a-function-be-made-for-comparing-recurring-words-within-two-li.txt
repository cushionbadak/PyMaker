For example:What would the function be defined to get:I started the code off like this: I keep getting one value of 0, which accounts for q, but I can't get a value for p.
Here is a simpler answer (by simpler I mean one-liner and no use of additional libraries) - OutputExplanation[ p.count(i) for i in q ] is a list comprehension which is like iterating through the q list on the fly and counting for the respective elements in pTimings (depends on the data)
Or if you can't use collections.Counter for some reason:EDIT:It looks like there should be some timings to "clear things up" about which solution is more efficient. Since @chrisz forgot to post his actual test code, I had to do it myself.Unfortunately, Vivek's code took 11min 10sec to run while mine took only 46.5ms.
