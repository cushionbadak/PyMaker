Hello I do not understand why i get the error as shown in title with the following as my forward propagation functionand this as my action_selection function:
Where do you use your forward-function? Meaning in which line does it throw the error? I can't find it.But in general: If you use the function forward not inside your class, but as an object it actually takes one argument. (self is given "automatically", so you can reference inside the class to other stuff. For better explanation just read this: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html ). So for example if you try to do something like this:it will throw exactly this error
