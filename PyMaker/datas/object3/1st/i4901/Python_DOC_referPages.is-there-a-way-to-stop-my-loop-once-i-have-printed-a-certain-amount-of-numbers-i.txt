I am creating a code in Python to get the 10001st prime number, and I am looking for a way to stop printing numbers once I have printed 10001 numbers. Is this possible?
Yea, you can create a variable before your loop, and everytime that it gets a prime number, you add 1 to it, then check if it is the 10001st number already to break the loop. Or even something like that:There's many ways to do it so just find the one that suits you better.
You can add a break inside your for loop which will exit the loop. You'll have to include an if/then statement to break after 10001
A while loop would work here:
