I use the brown corpus "brown.words()" which gives me a list of 1161192 words.Now I want to find any occurrence of the word "have", so whenever in the corpus there is an "has", "had", "haven't" ect. I want to do something (could be pushing them into an array, could be a counter, could be something else.Edit: Note that this question is about finding a matching word. If I search "have" I want a way to match it to "haven't" or "had", thus the .count() would not solve this problem as it dosen't help matching anything.Example code I would use in case stemming/lemmatization would work:But the problem is that: 
Before trying to match the words, you might want to do a little of pre-processing. So "has" or "haven't" end up "transformed" to "have". I recommend you take a look at both stemming or lemmatizing: NLTK's Wordnet Lemmatizer (one of my favorites): http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.htmlNLTK's stemmers: http://www.nltk.org/howto/stem.htmlNote: for the lemmatizer to work well with verbs, you have to specify that they are in fact verbs. Hope this helps!
