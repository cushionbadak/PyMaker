My assignment is:You have been asked to write a program that will give the name of a  shape depending on the number of sides. The user can only enter  numbers between 3 and 8, if they enter any other number then the  program should tell them to enter a number between 3 and 8.And here's my Python answer:After the elif statement I somehow also need to loop it so that if the person inputs other than 3-8 then it will keep asking for them to enter a number from 3 to 8.The elif statement does not work for some reason and outputs this answer in F5:
range() produces an object of a different type; integer != range() is always going to be true.Either test if you integer is outside a range with < or <= and chaining:or use not in to see if the number is outside the range:or simply use elif on all your tests but the first, and else for the last branch; it'll picked only if the if..elif tests did not match:Note that there is only one if now; logically, the elif and else parts belong to that one if statement. Any other if forms a separate, new set of choices, and your sides != range(3, 9) expression was always true, meaning the elif test would be true any time if slides == 8 was not true.You can simplify your code by using a dictionary. It lets you associate a key with a value; make the numbers your keys, and you can simply test if sides is in the dictionary, or return a default value if it is not:Here, the dict.get() method returns the value for the given key, or the default value if the key is not present.If you need to continue the loop, test for the presence of the key and branch based on that:For further tips on how to ask a user for input and handle their wrong input, see Asking the user for input until they give a valid response.
Your elif is only "associated" with the previous if, so it will hit that elif for anything that is not an octagon, then as others have noticed your comparison is not testing if you're in the right range, you're comparing an int against a list.Probably you really want all of your if statements except the first to be elif and the one you have as an elif to be the else clause for that whole block.Better still, you could have a dictionary that maps the number of sides to the message, and if you don't have a key in the dictionary you can print the error message.For the loop, if you put the whole thing in while True you could break after each success and not after the invalid number of sides, which would cause it to repeat the loop until they finally enter a valid number.
range(x, y) outputs a range of numbers between x and y. You're then comparing an integer (which is the value of sides) to a list. Obviously it isn't equal to the list, because it is an integer!
Look at last if 6!= [3,4,5,6,7,8] , so your code will enter elif statement and print ("You should enter a number between 3 and 8") will be executed.
You've already covered all the legal answers with your if and elif statements, so there's no need to do any specific checking of other values.Just change the last statement into an else:
I would do something like this (and it seems to work) :
