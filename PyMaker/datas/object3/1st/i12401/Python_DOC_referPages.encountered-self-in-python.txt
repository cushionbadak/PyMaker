I have just started learning python and I am trying to write a binary search tree. Eclipse does not show any errors but when I try to run there is ann error Encountered "self" at line 5Line 5 is:"self.left = left"What is the problem? Is my way of writing code okey? I have just starded python.
here a few fix to your codeas mention before the special method of python are __init__ and __str__, all magic method start and end with a __.I fix your add_node because your recursive call were wrong, went you do self.add_node(self.left,data) the self instance is implicitly pass as the first argument to that function, self.left is the second and data the third but as defined add_node only take 2 argument so that is a error, so in this case if you want to call the add_node of self.left that is done by self.left.add_node and the same apply to every other call to a method of a classtake a look at: a first look at classesbasic customization and magic methodshere sample usage of this treeOther thing is that in python you dot need to define getter or setter unless you want to control what and how a attribute is set or return it in a especial way that is different to the actual object.run this in the IDLE of python or in interactive mode as python3 -i  binarytree.py or in your favorite interprete of python.
