Suppose I have What if I want to change the value of someObject.field when I call foo.Foo is a test and basically I want to be able to change someObject.field to test different values.Edit: bar and foo are in different files 
Just create the class outside bar() so that foo() can modify it.
Since you are obtaining someObject from someObjectFactory, a possible solution is (for the unit-testing scenario) to modify someObjectFactory / provide an test-specific implementation of someObjectFactory such that it returns, for each test of bar, an object that has exactly the properties needed for that test.
