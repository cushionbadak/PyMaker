How would I go about splitting a string up and then adding up the integers inside, with the code below I am able to add up single integers, but if I get a string like "a12b34" I should be able to do 12 + 34 not 1+2+3+4 like the code below does. I am able to do this in C but I do not know how to 100% do it in python. 
User re.findall to extract all digits, convert them to integer and then sum the resultsThis is valid only if you have integersEDIT: For general cases, where you might have float number as well, consider the following:EDIT2:So what's happening:1 - import re will import and load re module, which is a module used to extract complex string format based on the provided pattern. More details here2 - re.findall will return all matching string in s with the provided pattern r'-?\d+\d.>\d+'3 - The pattern r'-?\d+\d.>\d+ breakdown (which can be found here):4 - Now, re.findall will return a list of all matches:5 - map will convert each element from this list from string into float returning a generator:6 - Passing the result of map to sum will sum all elements to their total:
