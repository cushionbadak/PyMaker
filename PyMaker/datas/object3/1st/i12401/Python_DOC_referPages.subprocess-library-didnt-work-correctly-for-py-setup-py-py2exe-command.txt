I tried to write a code that can execute python codes easily.but when I used subprocess library such:I saw just this resultplease help me please
Most likely the commands you are trying to run are producing a stderr, which your code does not display. It is possible to send the stderr messages to stdout if you don't want to handle it separately.I'll use a different command in the subprocess that is relatively safe. And I will break it up a little instead of having one long line.See that I added the parameter stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, this sends all the error messages to stdout. The subprocess tries to run "python filedoesntexist" and since filedoesntexist is a file that doesn't exists, it will print this message:But you might just want to get the string instead of bytes, and you can add the parameter universal_newlines=True like this:Now it prints just the string like this:For additional information, visit the python documentationEditThe documentation recommends using run(), which can be done like this (updated after comments from J.F. Sebastian) :If you need to handle stdout in some way, add parameters described earlier in the Popen examples.
