Natural Text
I am reading a .txt file but I want to read the file from line number 6 till line number 265. can some tell me how to do that ?Output.txt :the above code is just reading line 6 but how to read from line 6 to line 265 ?
as you mentions in one of yours comments that you want to read the first 4 lines and the finals 12 lines of the file, you can use the answer of @DavisYoshida to the first part and this to the final partthis a recipe from the documentation of itertools with a little changesfor example
I recommend using islice from the itertools package.In response to your comment requesting to read the first 6 and last 12 into a file, and the rest into another file, I would do something like the followingThe idea here is toWrite the first 6 lines to the first fileWrite the next 12 lines to the second file and populate a queue with themPush new lines onto the queue and pop old lines off until the input file is exhaustedWrite the 12 lines remaining in the queue (the last 12 lines) to the first output file.
Here is an example. It prints line number 6 till line number 265.Please note that linenr == 5 for the 6th line and 264 for the 265th line.You can use following example to save the selected lines to another file.
