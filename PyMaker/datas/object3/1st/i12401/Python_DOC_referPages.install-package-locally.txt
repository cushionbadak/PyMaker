I use python's pip to install packages. Now I want to install scipy, which is already installed on the system, but an old version and on a part of the system where I don't have access to. If I trypip rightfully tells me that the package is already installed. If I dopip tries to upgrade the package but I don't have the access rights to do that.How can I tell pip to install the package local to my user and to ignore the other scipy package?
I think the best way for avoid override packages it's using a virtual environment. Python has it's own virtual environment and you could install it by:Python 2.7Python 3With modern python versions, virtualenv is usually included. Once installed, you could generate a virtual enviroment typing:This would create a folder in the current directory named venv (you could name it whatever you want). In this package the libraries will be installed.So, it's time to activate the virtual environmentYou could verify the environment has been activated by checking the prompt changes. If it happens, all the packages installed using pip will be installed locally.You could check this website for more info.Don't forget that you eventually have to clear your $PYTHONPATH variable, in order for it to not pick up other packages.
This tool allows you to install wheels locally.
