I'm using Python3.5 in Windows with pip version 8.0.2. I installed ddt library using 'pip install ddt'. While using ddt library in code, getting import error. How to get rid of this error?
The name of your py file is ddt. This is an error. You cannot name your file after the name of a library that you are importing. From the Python Doc:When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).So when you use import, the first place it searches is your current directory. This is why your error occurred.
