Natural Text
This might be very simple, but I still cannot figure what is the solution. I have this code, it's a sample from a longer code.slotchoose, doctor, and specialistchoose came from input from user by clicking a radiobutton and a check button. I'm trying to add a string value to slotchoose, doctor, and specialchoose, then save it into a text file. But the problem is every time I run it, and open the text file, test2.txt, it will only have the specialistchoose value.
You are overwriting the file every time you open() because that's what mode w does. If you want to accumulate text from several writes to the file, you need to use the append mode (a) instead.Python 2 doc:https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#openPython 3 doc:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#openmode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), 'x' for exclusive creation and 'a' for appending
