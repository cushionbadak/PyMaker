I am a newbie and having 1 week experience writing python scripts.I am trying to write a generic parser (Library for all my future jobs) which parses any input XML without any prior knowledge of tags.Parse input XML.Get the values from the XML and Set the values basing on the tags.Use these values in the rest of the job.I am using the "xml.etree.ElementTree" library and i am able to parse the XML in the below mentioned way.Now the question is if i want to parse an XML without any knowledge of the tags and elements and use the values how do i do it. I have gone through multiple tutorials but all of them help me with parsing the XML by using the tags like belowCan anybody point me to a right tutorial or library or a code snippet to parse the XML dynamically.
I think official documentation is pretty clear and contains some examples: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmlThe main part you need to implement is loop over the child nodes (potentially recursively):
Well parsing is easy as that - etree.parse(path)Once you've got the root in hand using tree.getroot() you can just iterate over the tree using Python's "in":Then, to see tags these child_nodes have, you do the same trick. This lets you go over all tags in the XML without having to know the tag names at all.
