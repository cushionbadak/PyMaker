As I'm reading the Django documentation, I see this in the example:I dont understand why the call to super is:whereas (coming from C programming) I thought it should be:How comes?Yes. And I'm not asking what mean "*" and "**" (link marked as a duplicate), I'm asking why it's not re-sent without the star = why it's re-sent to parent with the stars, which means to me: "dictionary of a dictionary". And my question is different from the duplicate link, and the duplicate link doesnt answer to my question.
The reason you use */** is to unpack the packed values you were given. When your class is initialized, it might be initialized with:Because it receives the arguments using variable length positional (*) and dynamic keyword (**) arguments (to avoid needing to remember and deal with the specifics of what its parent class constructor receives), args is received as (1, 2, 3) and kwargs is {'abc': 4, 'xyz': 5}. If the parent class is defined with a __init__ of:then calling super(HandField, self).__init__(args, kwargs) would pass the args tuple as a1, the kwargs dict as a2, and pass nothing at all for a3 or other arguments. By unpacking args and kwargs, you convert back to individual positional and keyword arguments, so a1 would get 1, a2 2, a3 3, abc 4 and xyz 5.Basically, they're inverse operations; if you accept *, then the caller passes positional arguments one by one and they are "packed" into a single tuple, accepting ** accepts individual keyword arguments "packed" as a single dict. If you want to pass them along the same way, you "unpack" them to make them individual arguments, not collections of arguments.
