I have a list called catalogue given to me like this:I need to create a new list of ID's from above. This is what I have tried:But I get the error: I assume this is because it is a list of dicts, how can this be done?
Ordered Dictionaries are subclasses of dictionaries, as such they behave just like ordinary dictionaries when accessing elements. Use key access x['catalogue_id'] for every element in catalogue to access the values:Note: You might be confusing it with namedtuples which support named dot . access to their elements.
You access the content of a dictionary with __getitem__, not with __getattribute__, i.e. you need to use the bracket notation instead of the dot notation.
