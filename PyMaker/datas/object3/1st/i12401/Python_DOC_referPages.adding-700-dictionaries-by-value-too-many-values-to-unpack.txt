I have a list of 2 lists, each with 700 dictionaries. Each dictionary has a word count, and I want to combine them, such that values of same keys will be added. I tried doing : dicts[0] and dicts[1] are 2 lists of dictionaries. But it throws the following error: ValueError: too many values to unpack.Is there any better way of doing this?
You misused chain; you wanted chain.from_iterable to chain the iterable outputs of your generator expression, not just wrap the generator function as a no-op:That only gets the first list of dicts though; to get both, we need MOAR CHAINING!:
This iterates each dictionary once so memory usage should be efficient.
