Basically I am converting PHP CodeIgniter's Encryption Method into Python but I stuck while converting PHP's mcrypt_create_iv library into Python.Thanks in Advance.
mcrypt_create_iv() is just a PHP interface to OS-level pseudo-random generators (it's not even a part of libmcrypt, contrary to what the function name implies).Python provides such interfaces via the os module and what you need is os.urandom().For example, if you need to translate mcrypt_create_iv(16, MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM) into Python, you'd need to write os.urandom(16).To clarify a possible confusion:You may've used MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM or MCRYPT_RAND in PHP, but there is literally no reason to use either of those instead of MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM - it is just better by all measurable criteria:MCRYPT_RAND in particular is NOT suitable for cryptographic purposes, or in other words - it is insecure.MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM can and will block until new entropy data is available. You don't want blocking in a web application and the myth that /dev/random is somehow better than /dev/urandom because of blocking has been debunked.MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM is both non-blocking and secure.
