What should I do? Reinstall pip? pip-scripts.py file, is not any more in the directory, I don't know what happened. Can't install/uninstall other modules. How can I fix it? I am using windows 7.
What you can do:Python versions python 2.7.9+ and python 3.4+ ship with pip. So you can choose any of them to avoid the hassle of getting pip and stuff. But...I think you don't have any special reason to use python 2.7. So I suggest you remove python 2.7, download and install python 3.5 and start using it! As they say: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language. Read more.Then you can install/uninstall any package using pip, as pip is the default package manager in newer versions of python. Read pip docs.
