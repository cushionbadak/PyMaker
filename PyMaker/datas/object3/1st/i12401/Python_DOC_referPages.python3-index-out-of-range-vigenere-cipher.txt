I'm starting out on making code to carry out Vigenere cipher encryption. First, I want to make the key. The key needs to be repeated over and over till it matches the length of the message to be encrypted so I created a function that would do this for me:The output should look like:But the program just gives me an index out of range error and I have no idea what's going on!Error message:
The reason your code doesn't work:Should have been:You get an IndexError from trying to access key[3] in the line finalkey.append(key[i]) (where i=3) after you deleted that element.And just for fun, here's an alternate implementation.Prints: LOVELOEdit - cryptic one-liner solutionIf you want to make everyone who reads your code roll their eyes at you, you could try this:The cycle function takes an iterable object - in our case, the key string - and repeats it in an infinite loop. So, if we create cycle("LOVE") it will generate "L", "O", "V", "E", "L", "O", "V", "E", "L" ... forever.The islice function allows us to take a "slice" of an iterator object. In Python, "slice" is the term for the [0:3] part of the expression new = old[0:3] - we "sliced" out a sub-set of the original. Since we don't want our string to be infinitely long - which wouldn't be very useful - we want to just take a slice of the cycle we created:islice(cycle(key), len(message)This takes our iterator - cycle(key) - and slices it starting from index 0 and ending at index len(message). This will return another iterator - this time, one that isn't infinite. The contents of the iterator are now: "L", "O", "V", "E", "L", "O".Now, we just need to stitch that islice back up into a whole string:''.join(islice...) == "LOVELO"Just to give you another tool in your toolbox!
