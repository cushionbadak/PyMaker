Natural Text
Using Python 3.5.1, I pulled in a text file where each line is in JSON form:{"a":"windows", "b":"stairs"...}But I received the error:I have no problem printing the first line of file, so I am reassured that the file path is correct.
Open the file in text mode, not binary mode (possibly explicitly passing encoding='utf-8' to override the system default, since JSON is usually stored as UTF-8). The json module only takes str input; reading from a file opened in binary mode returns bytes objects:
Try:records=[json.loads(line.decode()) for line in open(path,'rb')]
You do not want to specify "rb", since binary representation of the file isn't going to be readable by the JSON module. You likely want "utf-8" encoding and "read". EDIT: I originally had said both of these are defaults, but it was brought to my attention that many OS's have different default encoding and that Python uses the system setting as default in open(). I would therefore recommend explicitly providing the encoding setting as "utf-8".json supports loading from an open file with "json.load" instead of "json.loads", which loads from a string, so we can skip the read-in-as-text and go right to JSON. I don't think you'll want to "loads" individual lines, since this likely won't be valid JSON.
