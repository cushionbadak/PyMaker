Natural Text
In my code I am trying to use the if __name__=='__main__' function however the variables I want to share are after the code I don't want to run.For example:ProgramA.pyProgramB.pyNow I don't want this code to run when importing the variables fname and sname to use in my other program, I only want the variables not the code that accompanies them. However when I use the if __name__='__main__' function and try and save the variables afterwards ProgramB says that the variables aren't defined. Sorry if this is already answered in another question, but so far I have found no solution.
When you import ProgramA you can then reference fname and sname which are still the values from ProgramA given from:By referencing ProgramA.fname and ProgramA.sname like this:Alternatively you could import it like this:You shouldn't use if __name__ == "__main__" in ProgramA. __name__ is only equal to "__main__" if Python is loading this source code file as the main program, and as it is being imported from ProgramB __name__ does not equal "__main__" and therefore the variables fname and sname are never declared, which is why you get this error. You can use if __name__ == "__main__" in ProgramB though.
