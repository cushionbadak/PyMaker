Natural Text
Below is my code, when printing the second file i create, i get an indent.Don't see why. Since I'm learning any other comments on my simple code are wellcome, and will be taken gladly. Thanks!
print will add a single space between each argument by default.print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)If you change the separator, you can remove the space character you don't want.
