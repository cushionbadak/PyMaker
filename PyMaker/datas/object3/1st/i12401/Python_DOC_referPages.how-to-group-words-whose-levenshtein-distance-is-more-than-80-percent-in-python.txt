Suppose I have a list:-I am trying to group the list in such a way so the Levenshtein distance between two strings is maximum. For finding out the ratio between two words, I am using a python package fuzzywuzzy.Examples :- My end goal:My end goal is to group the words such that Levenshtein distance between them is more than 80 percent?My list should look something like this :- Code: I am trying to achieve this by sorting but key function should be fuzz.ratio. Well below code is not working, but I am approaching the problem in this angle.Could anyone help me to combine the words so that Levenshtein distance between them is more than 80 percent?
This groups the namesproducingAs you can see, the names are grouped correctly, but the order may not be the one you desire.
