I'm learning Python and I'm following official documentation from:Section: 7.2.2. Saving structured data with json for Python 3I'm testing the json.dump() function to dump my python set into a file pointer:The file testfile.txt already exists in my working directory and even if it didn't, statement f = open('testfile.txt', 'w', encoding='UTF-8') would have re-create it, truncated.The json.dumps(response) converts my response set into a valid JSON object, so that's fine.Problem is when I use the json.dumps(response, f) method, which actually updates my testfile.txt, but it gets truncated.I've managed to do a reverse workaround like:After which the contents of my testfile.txt become as expected:Even, this approach works too:Why does this approach fail?:Note that I don't get any errors from the console; just a truncated file.
It looks like you aren't exiting the interactive prompt to check the file. Close the file to flush it:It will close if you exit the interactive prompt as well.
