I have one file with so many values those are as belowHow to sort these values according to date and time?
If the file has these one per line, you'll need to convert to real dicts, e.g. with json.loads or ast.literal_eval, then sort:
You can use dateutil.parser for parsing dates and add the proper key in the sort function.This works - 
You could use email package from stdlib, to parse the date format into "seconds since the Epoch":It is easy to sort dicts by Date field:To load json objects from the file, you could use code from @ShadowRanger's answer.
