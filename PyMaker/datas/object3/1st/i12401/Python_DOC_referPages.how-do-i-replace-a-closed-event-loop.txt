I work mostly in IPython's interactive shell. Sometimes I copy-paste code from the Internet to test it out and work with examples.If I paste the following code from this tutorial:I will close the loop. The documentation says not to use any methods on an event loop after it's been closed. And async.get_event_loop() will still return that closed loop.What should I do if I accidentally close an event loop? I would rather not restart the interpreter.
You could just create and set a new event loop for the current context;
