Example codeI'm using it to pass to a function but not even this works when running normally or debug without a breakpoint. Using a breakpoint and stepping through it prints everything out just fine (_str is the total path!
I'm really not sure what you are trying to do or print, but, yes, this throws an AttributeError. Probably because, well, ._str is not an attribute of the Path class. This does print the full path.If you want just the names of the files & directories, do print(f.name)
