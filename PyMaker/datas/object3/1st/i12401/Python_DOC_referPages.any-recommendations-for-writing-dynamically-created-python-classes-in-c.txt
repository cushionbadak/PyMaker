I'm working on a project where I need to create Python classes in C. As far as I have read, I've only seen examples where they write the classes statically, for exampleBut in the project, I need to create classes dynamically. E.g.The members and methods all depend on runtime.Is there good examples out there about how to do it? I have concerns on issues such as, when do I have to deallocate tp_members or tp_name, etc.
You should provide more context. What problem are you trying to solve, in particular?For example, if you are creating classes to attach behavior, there is already support in Python for loading and calling C code. You could use that, and create the class interface in python and load the C libraries as part of the module init code.Alternatively, if you are generating code based on a specification, it might be easier to parse the specification in python and generate the appropriate code directly. (Python is a pretty good parsing language. ;-)If you are trying to embed C in your Python, you might consider embedding a Python interpreter into your C. That would give you the ability to set up your C code, then run python scripts, and call back to C.
