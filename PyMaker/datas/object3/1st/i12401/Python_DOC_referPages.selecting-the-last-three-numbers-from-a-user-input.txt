For this task I have to take a seven digit input called account number and use the last three digits to return a disk storage location, my code looks like this so far:It should also ask the user to input another account code and if the disk storage location is full, respond with an error message. what it should return is:but instead it returns:I know hardly anything about coding so any help would be appreciated.
Well Account_num is of type int and the [] slicing notation you're trying to use is supported for sequences (i.e objects that contain other objects). In order to get the last three digits from a number you can use the % operator that yields the remainder from the division, with 1000:So for a given Accound_num = 9230939 
You could just cast your input laterIf you do this, though, you'll need to also convert the Account_num in your comparison
You input However, you try to process it as a string. This would work
You can't use [-3:] on an int, but you can on a string so just get the input and then cast to a string to grab the last three characters and then cast to an int.
