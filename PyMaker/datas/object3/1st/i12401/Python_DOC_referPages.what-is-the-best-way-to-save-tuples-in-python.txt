Natural Text
I have a function which returns a tuple which includes numbers, strings and arrays.For example, (1, 2, 3, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], ['a','b','c']). I need to run my function 100 times and save all the results. I'm thinking of save each result as a text file.  So I can have 100 *.txt fils like this:How to write the python code? Is there better way to save the results for easy data re-visit in future?
yes, you can import pickle and use pickle.dump() and pickle.load() to read and write to a file.Here is how you would write it to a file:To read it back in:
If you want easy data revisit across-language, you can use JSON.Note: The revis_data will be converted to a list and won't be a tuple anymore. If you want it to remain a tuple after reloading, just do tuple(revis_data)
