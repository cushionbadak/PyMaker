I am new to Python (4 weeks in) and I have a problem with my python program that should sort my dictionary. I have IDs in my dict and some of them are connected to each other (via the sets). Out of this example, I should get an array consisting of two arrays [[1,3,4,7,8,9],[2,5,6,50,70,80]] to mark my two different groups.This program worked on an older python version, but now I have problems converting it to Python 3.5, because the sets work differently and I can't seem to get it running. What do I have to change to make it work on Python 3.5? (I am using WinPython 3.5 with the Spyder environment)
Python replaced the sets module with a built-in set type in version 2.4.  To switch to the new type, just get rid of the from sets import Set line and change each occurrence of Set to set.  Also note that set([3,4]) can now be equivalently written {3,4}.
Here's a version of your code that should work on recent versions of Python 2 and on Python 3.I've eliminated the use of the global tmp_array list with a temp_result set which is passed as an argument to the recursive function. It's more efficient to test sets for membership than to test lists. The speed difference is hardly noticeable for small sets, but quite noticeable for large sets.output
