I want to make a mock test for some mongo queries, but I had a problem when I tried to mock two diferent mongo objects (Cursor and Collection) in the same scope.I can't put the original code here, but I made a generic with the same problem.This is the function I want to test (using find and distinct):This is the test code:When I run the test, I have this error message:'%s call not found' % expected_string AssertionError: find({"id" :  "id1"}) call not foundSo I printed the value of id_list:This is the value of id_list:MagicMock name='find().distinct()' id='139719585597776'But the expected is: ["id1", "id2"]When I comment the Cursor's mock, the value of id_list is the same as before:I think the code is always catching the "distinct" value from Collection, not from Cursor.Does anybody had the same problem?
mocks objects in test arguments should be in the reverse order (take a look to Nesting Patch Decorators for details)What you called mock_collection should be mock_findYour test code should be this:
