I'm having issues coverting a ctime string over to %Y-%m-%d format. Now I just want to convert to YYYY-MM-DD. Any suggestions? I'm not having luck with traditional reformatting
The filetime is a string. That means you can use time.strptime to parse it.At this point, cdt is a struct_time object and you can manipulate it as such.
Use time.strftime with time.localtime rather than using time.ctime:I won't tell you the file I used so the output will differ.
You should avoid "Yo-Yo code" and format the file time in the desired format directly without converting it to a string using ctime() first:If you've received ctime()-formated time string from an external source then you could parse this (asctime()) date/time format using email stdlib package:In general, use datetime.strptime() to convert a string into datetime object. See Converting string into datetime.
use      to format the outputhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html
You can use strptime and then strftime:
