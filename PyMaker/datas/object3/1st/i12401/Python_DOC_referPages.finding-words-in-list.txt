I am trying to make something that finds where a word is in a list and then tells you where it is here is what i have so far:no matter what i put in it says the word is in slot 1 and any other slots, i cant think of any ways to pic this, please help :D
Put whenAppears += 1 after the if block. Change wordel == phrase[i] to wordel == word. Delete the line i = 0.Corrected code:You could make your code nicer with comprehensions and enumerate, but these are the errors you definitely have to fix.
You use the loop in an incorrect way.You must compare wordel with word, because any time you loop over phrase, the value is stored in word.
You could rewrite your code more efficiently with list.index:
