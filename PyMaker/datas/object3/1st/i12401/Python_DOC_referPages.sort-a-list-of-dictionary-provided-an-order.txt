I've a listand a list of dictionariesI want to sort this list_of_dct by the order given in order list, i.e. the output should be the following:I know how to sort by a given key, but not when an order is already given. How can I sort it?PS: I already have an O(n^2) solution. Looking for a better solution.
Use index of the order list to sort-Just try if every dictionary has one value and you want sorting by that value-But if you have multiple values for one key then change the index (i.e [0]) on which you will sort.
Make a mapping of 8 to 0, 7 to 1, ..., 11 to 5 using enumerate:And use it as a sorting key:use sort_keys.get(..) instead of sort_keys[..] to prevent KeyError in case of value is misisng in order.
