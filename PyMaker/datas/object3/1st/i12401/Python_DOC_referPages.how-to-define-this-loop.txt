I want to write a program that, when the user types an integer from 1 to 7 inclusive, it prints out the corresponding day of the week. This is what I have so far. What I can't figure out is how to put that when x has a certain value, the program prints the string on another certain value, i.e. when the user writes 1, the program should print str(0) which is 'MONDAY'. Answered! I used a dictionary, and it worked better than using lists and all that loops. Thanks!
Get rid of those nested loops; you don't need them at all. lists are accessed with square brackets, not parentheses. lists are 0-indexed (their first element is element number zero), so you would replace those loops with this:
To answer this directly,would do what you want. But I would store the names in a dictionary instead:
What you want to do here is select the day whose number corresponds to the user's input. However, arrays start at 0, and so you'll want to subtract 1 from the input to match the corresponding day. If you did not perform (x-1), then typing 1 would output : TUESDAY, since TUESDAY is element 1 in array starting at 0. (In this case MONDAY is element 0.) I won't get into the details of why these start at zero, but there is a good reason. I'm not sure what you were doing with the for loops, though. 
You can format the error statement however you would like.
