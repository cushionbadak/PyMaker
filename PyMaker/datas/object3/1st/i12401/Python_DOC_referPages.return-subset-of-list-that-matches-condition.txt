Let's say I have a list of ints:And I want to return a list of the elements that meet a certain condition, say:What's a Pythonic way to return a sub-list of element in a list for which  meetsCondition(element) is True?A naive approach:Is there a simple way to do this, perhaps with with a list comprehension or set() functions, and without the temporary outputList?
Use list comprehension,or you can use the meetsCondition also,you can actually write the same condition with Python's truthy semantics, like thisalternatively, you can use filter function with your meetsCondition, like this
