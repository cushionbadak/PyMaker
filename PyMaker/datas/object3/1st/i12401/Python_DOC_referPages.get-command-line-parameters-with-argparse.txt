I´m trying to use argparse of Python but I cannot get a command line parameter.Here my code:But then when I run my python script like:Instead of getting this path it is getting the default value defined (/tmp/config.json).What I´m doing wrong here?
The standard documentation doesn't mention FileAction. Instead there's a class FileType intended for type argument, not for action.So I would write something like this:This gives me the following:You may subclass argparse.FileType to something like JsonROFileType which would check if the supplied file is actually a JSON of expected format etc, but this seems to be out of the scope of the question.
