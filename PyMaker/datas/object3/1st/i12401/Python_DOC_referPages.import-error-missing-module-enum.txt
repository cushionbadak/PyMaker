I'm trying to run a python file, but I keep getting a ImportError.My set up is I have a project with the following path:/Users/John/Documents/pythonprojects/projectXwithin 'projectX' I have a folder called 'components' which contains two python files titled 'py_file' and 'init'./Users/John/Documents/pythonprojects/projectX/componentsAt the top of 'py_file', I'm importing a namedTuple that is defined in 'init' from components import some_tupleWhen I run python py_file.py run I get ImportError: No module named componentsI tried changing the PYTHONPATH to the project root and running the file again, but then I get this error ImportError: No module named enum.  PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/Users/John/Documents/pythonprojects/projectXexport PYTHONPATHafter exporting the PYTHONPATH, every time I try to open a python shell I get the enum import error. 
enum was added in Python version 3.4.https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.htmlYou are most likely running too old Python.Check with python -v
I was able to get this to work by adding these line at the top of my file:I originally only had from components import some_tuple
