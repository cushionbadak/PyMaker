Given the function that takes x and manipulate x as such:And in a function:I want to change it into a lambda function but how is that possible when it uses an extra variable that not in my loop?Without the complication of j+=1 and considering j as a constant I could do this:But I need the j to change when it if statement is made. How can that be achieved in a lambda function?
You could make j an itertools.count() object; each time you call next() on it it'll yield the next value in the sequence:This works because you only ever ask for that next value when x == 0 is true.However, you now need to reset j each time you want to use the lambda. You could incorporate it into your list comprehension as an extra one-element tuple to loop over:All this is not all that readable. I'd stick with the def function object instead.As a side note, you could use or to replace the .. if xi == 0 else xi expression; xi == 0 makes xi falsey:
