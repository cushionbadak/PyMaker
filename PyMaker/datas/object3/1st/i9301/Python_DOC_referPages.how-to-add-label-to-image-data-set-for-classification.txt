Assuming that you wanted to know, how to feed image and its respective label into neural network.There are two things:Reading the images and converting those in numpy array.Feeding the same and its corresponding label into network.As said by Thomas Pinetz , once you calculated names and labels. Create one hot encoding of labels.
You can use streight forward python i/o utilities (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) like:Then you can use the names array to load in the images and the labels as your y array.
