In modern versions of Ppython one can have static type analysis using function annotations, according to PEP 484. This is made easy through the typing module.Now I'm wondering how I would give a "type hint" towards a "filestream".What would I insert as FILETYPE?Using print(type(file)) returns <class '_io.TextIOWrapper'> which isn't clear at all.Isn't there a generic "file" type?
I think you want io.IOBase, "[t]he abstract base class for all I/O classes, acting on streams of bytes."Note that this includes also in-memory streams like io.StringIO and io.BytesIO. Read the documentation on the module io for details.
You can use typing.IO, typing.TextIO, and typing.BinaryIO to represent different types of I/O streams. To quote the documentation:class typing.io     Wrapper namespace for I/O stream types.      This defines the generic type IO[AnyStr] and aliases TextIO and BinaryIO for      respectively IO[str] and IO[bytes]. These represent the  types of I/O streams such      as returned by open().    These types are also accessible directly as typing.IO, typing.TextIO, and      typing.BinaryIO.
Either this:OR thisThe second approach would avoid to import the class during execution. Although python would still have to import TYPE_CHECKING during execution, it is a good practice to avoid importing classes for type hinting only:  (1) doesn't get executed (just parsed), and (2) it could avoid cyclic import.
