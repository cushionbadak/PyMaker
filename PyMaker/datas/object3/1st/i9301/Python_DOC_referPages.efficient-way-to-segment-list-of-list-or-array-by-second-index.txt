I am trying to segment a list of list into blocks based on the type of data in the sublist's second index (namely NoneType or int).Example Data:This can be treated as a list of lists, as I said, or as a numpy array (i.e., numpy.array(arr)). Whichever is easier.I am trying for something like this (doesn't need to be identical):Sloppy attempt:Then I could simply pull out the data for based on blocks_loc (which now contains [(81, 84, (93, 95)]).However, it is hard to put into words just how terrible and ugly that code is. Something better would be great.
I might use itertools.groupby:which gives me.. and I just noticed that I was using x[1] as the index to group on, and you want x[2] instead.  Well, that's left as an exercise for the reader. ;-)If you wanted finer control over the output (e.g. to handle the case where the start and end indices are the same), it'd be easier just to loop over the key/group pairs returned by groupby and yield whatever you like. Also note that groupby finds contiguous groups.  If your data is not necessarily contiguous, you could sort first instead.
