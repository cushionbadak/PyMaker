This question already has an answer here:Function with varying number of For Loops (python)                    7 answers                In Python, I am trying to add all of the different combinations of the elements in a list of N lists, where N is a variable. Specifically, I'm working with a list containing N copies of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. So let's assume N = 3. I want to cycle through the first list, adding:then increment the second guy once and start adding:after of course I increment the third guy. This specific example can be done with 3 nested for loops, but of course, I need the number of loops to change. I search around the web and this forum for answers and wasn't quite able to grasp what I should do. People have been saying to use recursive functions, but I've never even heard of that until I looked this up. So it's kind of hard to grasp.
In order to achieve this, you may use itertools.product as:which will print:If you just want to store the value in list, you may use list comprehension expression as:
You can use itertools.combinations_with_replacement to solve this problem.If you want to store the sums in a list, you can use a list comprehension as:
