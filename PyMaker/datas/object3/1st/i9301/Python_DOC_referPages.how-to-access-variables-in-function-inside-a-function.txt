I am trying to run following code in Python3.4, but I am getting error.I am not able to access variable "i" in sub function.When I comment out "global i" statment When I add "global i" statmentCan anyone please explain this?
If you're using Python 3 (and it looks like you are), there's an amazing way to tackle this issue:Here, i isn't global as it would've been defined outside both functions otherwise. It also isn't local to another_function as it's defined outside it. So, it's non local. More info about nonlocal:Python nonlocal statementPython 3.6 docsQuick guide about nonlocal in Python 3
