THE python program is as follows, it errors:File "C:\Python\PyCharmProject\FaceBookCrawl\group_download.py", line 31, in      getFeed      params += "&since=" + SINCE.strftime("%s")      ValueError: Invalid format stringthe program it seems SINCE.strftime("%s") is wrong, how to solve it?
Actually, it should be capital S:
ValueError: Invalid format stringYou're using the wrong formatter i.e. it has to be upper case 'S'  - here's datetime's strftime reference.UnicodeEncodeError: 'locale' codec can't encode character '\uff33' in  position 1: Illegal byte sequencethe \uff33 is basically the the full width latin letter 'S' - the one you edited to get rid of previous ValueError.Solution/way-outs:1.Use raw string i.e. prefix your string with an 'r'2.If you're using str() to convert from unicode to encoded text / bytes - instead use  .encode() to encode the string. A helpful SO thread.
