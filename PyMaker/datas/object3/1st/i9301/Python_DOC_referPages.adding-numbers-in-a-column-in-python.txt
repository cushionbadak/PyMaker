I have a list of numbers in a column like I wanted to write a python program which can add these numbers in the following way: 10+12=22, 10+13=23, 12+13=25Can anybody give any suggestion how to do it.Thanks
Using combinations from itertools this can be done rather trivially. For a list a, you can get all of the sums of n elements like thisEdit: If you are using python 3, then use this insteadWith your example
If you didnt want to use itertools for some reason you could achieve this, this way. I have assumed what you want to do by the example result you have given:-If you want to get python to generate this list from a file which is a column of numbers then try this:-
This might work (Using Python 2.7):Output:Updated:Assuming the file has a line: 10, 12, 13
