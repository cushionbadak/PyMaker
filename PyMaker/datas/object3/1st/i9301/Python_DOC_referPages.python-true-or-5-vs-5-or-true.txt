This question already has an answer here:python and / or operators return value [duplicate]                    4 answers                I'm a beginner and this is a relatively simple question but I'm having trouble trying to figure it out. When you type "True or 5" into python, it returns True, and when you type "5 or True" it returns 5. Why is this? Why don't they return the same answer? Thanks!
Basically what happens with or is it looks to the left operand and evaluates bool(..) on it. If that returns True, the left operand is returned. Otherwise the right operand is returned.SoIs equivalent with:And chaining results in a chain of if statements like:is equivalent to:As you might notice, if you do the math with booleans, you see or indeed behaves as a logical or operator. But it is more advanced in the sense that you can feed it all kinds of values.For bool(..) the standard builtin bool(..) is used.The same holds for and by the way:Is equivalent with:
The or operator short-circuits when the first value is truthy (i.e. evaluates to True). When that happens, that first value is returned.So, True or 5 short-circuits on the True, so it returns True. 5 or True short-circuits on the 5 (because 5 is truthy, which is nonzero for integers), so it returns 5.
or returns the first operand that's truthy (or the last operand if they're both falsy). This can be used to check for the validity of data, and default if a value is, say, None.Especially in languages like JavaScript, this is a common idiom to give a function optional parameters.
