I'm working on a small command-line game in python where I am showing a progress bar using the tqdm module. I listen for user input using the msvcrt module to interrupt the progress. Once interrupted, the user can restart by entering 'restart' into the command line prompt. The second time the progress bar is shown, instead of updating the same line with the progress, it creates a new line each time. How would I get it to show the progress on the same line? This code snippet illustrates my use of the progress bar.
Try using tqdm.tqdm.write in place of the standard print()This will print above the progress bar and move the progress bar one row below.I tested this using below code, pressing space will print into stdout but not break the loop.It was not 100% clear what you are trying to achieve, since the interrupt() function of yours only checks the type of the provided string. type() built-in functionEDIT: to include end parameter of tqdm.write() as noted by Paul Netherwoodtqdm.tqdm.write()
Try using tqdm.tnrange()for i in tqdm.tnrange(len(df)):
Try from tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm instead of from tqdm import tqdm.
