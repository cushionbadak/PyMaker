I keep track of some variables that are very small (smaller than 1) and would like to update a label on the screen with their value. However, the labels stay at 0 (sometimes they go to 1) even though the value of the variable is smaller than 1. How do I tell my program to explicitly print an unrounded value?Here is my code:The variables in question are target_x_velocity, target_y_velocity, target_x_acceleration, and target_y_acceleration.
You must change %d to %f, the first shows only the whole part, while the second shows it in floating format. You can also change to "%.Xf", where X is the number of decimal places to display.More Information:Complete Code:Output:
In python 3.0 the % string formatting operator is replaced by a new system for string formatting operations. The % operator is still supported but deprecated since python 3.1, see What's new in Python 3. Details see in PEP3101 and Format String Syntax.   I have implemented some examples of the new style syntax in your string, the first line in the simplest form of the new syntax, the braces are placeholders for the parameters of format():the second line with numbered parameters:the third line parameters formatted as decimalnumber:and the last line signed („+“ sign shown in every case, „-“ sign only shown is -)for further details see links above
