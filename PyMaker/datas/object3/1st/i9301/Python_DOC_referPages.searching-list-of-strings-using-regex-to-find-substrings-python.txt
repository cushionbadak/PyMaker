I have gone through many of the regex questions on here and used the advice in them, but can't seem to get my code to run still. I have a list of strings, and I am attempting to find the entries in this list that contain one of the following patterns:a BLANK of a BLANKan BLANK of an BLANKa BLANK of an BLANKan BLANK of a BLANKthat BLANK of a BLANKthat BLANK of an BLANKthe BLANK of a BLANKthe BLANK of an BLANKFor example, I should be able to find sentences that contain phrases like "an idiot of a doctor" or "the hard-worker of a student."Once found, I want to make a list of the sentences that satisfy this criteria. So far, this is my code:This code turns up no results, despite the fact that there are phrases that should satisfy the criteria in the list.
[.*] is a character class, so you are asking regex to actually match the dot or star character, quoting from re's docs:[]Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set:Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'....So, here is one way to do it:(th(at|e)|a[n]?)\b.*\b(a[n]?)\b.*This expression will try to match either the, that , a or an, then any character up to there is either a or an.Here in this link, there is a demonstration of it's process.And here is the actual demonstration:
As it stands, this code will concatenate your pattern parameters into one long string with no operators between them.  So in effect you are searching for the regex "a [.*]of a an [.*]of an a [.*]of an ..."You are missing the 'or' operator: |.  A simpler regex to accomplish this task would be something like:
