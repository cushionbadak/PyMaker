I have a db record created with Django with a â€˜created_at' field in the format 'timestamp with time zone': 2017-01-13 14:12:18.307877+00:00. I need to check if 30 seconds have elapsed between that time and now.Should I first convert it to epoch time ? If yes how, without being hit by timezone issues ?
With the string we can use the datetime.datetime.strptime function to produce a datetime object that we can then do time arithmetic with.First, we remove the last :, because the format for timezones that datetime uses is +0000 not +00:00.  Then we hand that string to strptime along with a format string.
If this is a datetime object, then you can subtract another datetime object and get a timedelta, where you can ask elapsed time.d1 = datetime(2017, 1, 1) # create datetime at 2017-01-01T00:00d0 = datetime.now()diff = (d0 - d1).secondsif diff > 30:passThe datetime method takes an optional tzinfo, which you can use the set the timezone. This is just a subclass of datetime.tzinfo Example with GMT +1Then you can do
