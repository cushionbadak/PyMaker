Is it possible to have python 2.7 print something at a specific time of the day. For example if I ran the program at 15:06 and coded it to print "Do task now" at 15:07 it prints it. So no matter what time you ran the program once it hit 15:07 it would print "Do task now." In addition is it possible to have it print every week at this time?
I would suggest installing the library schedule, if you're able to.Use pip install scheduleYour code would look like this if utilizing schedule:You can adjust time.sleep(1) as necessary to sleep for longer if a 1s interval is too long. Here is the schedule library page.
If you're not using cron, then the general solution is to find the time remaining until you need the event to occur, have the program sleep for that duration, then continue execution.The tricky part is to have the program find the next occurrence of a given time. There are some modules for this, but you could also do it with plain code for a well-defined case where it is only a fixed time of day.
While python is not ideal to schedule something; there are better tools out there. Yet, if this is desired to be done in python below is a way to implement it:Prints at scheduled_time of 11AM:There are two if conditions with an intent to print within one minute; a shorter duration can be chosen. But the break immediately after print ensures that print is executed only once.You would need to extrapolate this so that code is run across days.Refer: datetime Documentation
