I want to count the occurrence of words which are followed by each other in a given list using python.E.g.In the above list, the count of times when 'ABC' is followed by 'DEF' is 2.Kindly help me out.Thanks.  
A not very efficient way to do this might be:Or in a one-liner using sum(..):Or as @khelwood says, you can exploit the fact that int(..) of a boolean returns 0 and 1:
A straightforward way that does not involve creating an extra slice for pairwise iteration would be to simply use indexes:Or, a bit shorter (thanks to @khelwood):Or, without sum() and expanded:Or:Related materials for one versus the other:Python built-in sum function vs. for loop performanceSpeed of "sum" comprehension in Python
