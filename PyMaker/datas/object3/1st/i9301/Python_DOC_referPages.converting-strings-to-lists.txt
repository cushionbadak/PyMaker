Natural Text
I'm reading a lot of strings from a file in this format: string = [4,1,0.20,26,0.00] that I need to convert to lists. I tried using string.split(), but it doesn't seem to be working as intended. I need to use the string as a regular list, for example when I have string[2] it will point to 0.20.
One way would be to use ast.literal_eval:
If say this is your given string:Then do this:and print(lst[2]) should give you 0.20
