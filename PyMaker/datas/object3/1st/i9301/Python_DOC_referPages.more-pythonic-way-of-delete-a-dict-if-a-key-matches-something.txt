I have a list of dictionaries in the following format:I want to remove the first dictionary where the name equals a value. Is there a better way of doing this?Output:

This is a perfect pandas problem.  pandas is part of the PyData suite (I think) and it's widely accepted.  I would use it for this type of problem fosho. 
If you want a one liner, you could use a generator expression with next(), which short-circuits once you've found the first item to remove, and then use list.remove():Example:Note this will raise a StopIteration is the value is not found, which can be avoided, but it's a bit longer because although next() has a default argument, list.remove() does not:
From python's documentation on dictionaries. https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictd.clear() will clear all the values of a dictionary. If the dictionary is in a list of others, you can simply pop it out of the list or delete it like this.
I would create a separate utility function to do it. The following first determines which (if any) dictionaries meet the criteria, and then pops (deletes) the first one found.

In my opinion using filter is the most pythonic way:However this doesn't remove from the original list and creates a new one in memory. Assigning old_list = filter(...) mimics removing from the original one (in the local scope at least) however there is still the memory overhead. For small lists (and most cases) this won't play a role. If it does then the following might be more appropriate:
