I've been told that in python 3.x it's possible to add a separator between strings that you repeat using multiplication, for example..I would like it to print out "rabble" 5 times with the string | in between each repeat.It keeps printing the repeated string, but without the separator character. I'm having trouble finding info regarding the use of sep in this specific situation. What am I doing wrong?
You can get the effect you want, but it doesn't really have much to do with multiplication per se.The sep argument to print() provides a separator between the non-keyword arguments - for example:You could just pass c to print() 5 times to get the output you're looking for:... but that's clunky, and no use if you don't know in advance how many times you'll want c to appear.To get around this problem, you can use argument unpacking â€“ a special syntax to pass a list or other sequence to a function as though the items in it were being passed as individual arguments:To get the result you're looking for, you can construct a list on the fly from 5 copies of c, and pass that list with the argument unpacking notation:Notice that you're multiplying a list containing c by five, rather than c itself. You might find it helpful to check out what print(*(c * 5), sep = ' | ') actually does, and to try and work out why (hint: strings are also sequences).
