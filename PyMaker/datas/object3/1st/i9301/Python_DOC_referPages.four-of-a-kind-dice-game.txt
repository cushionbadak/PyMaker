I made a simple scoring system for Farkle (a dice game). I'm a beginning student in Python, and have some questions on how to do certain things. First of all I'm having trouble finding out how to have my code check my list (dicegroup) for any kind of matching sequence. I'd like to have it check, specifically, for four of a kind without me having to go in and manually set what happens when there are for of a number for each number. What's the easiest way to do this?Any general feedback on the code is also appreciated. 
To check 4 of a kind:Using Counter from the collections module, we can create a dictionary that counts all the unique items for us in a list:Now all we need to do is filter by however many x of a kind you want by doing. We can achieve this by creating a list comprehensions that filters out all the values and only keep what we want, in this case if the count is equal to 4Now we get back a list of all the items that has a count of 4.To check 4 in a row:This will check 4 in a row in a list. It takes a chunk of size 4 from the list at a time, and checks if everything in that list is the same. If it is, it prints out the item and position. You can change it to fit your program.count() works on a list and you pass in what you want to count in the list. In this case we want to count the first item in our sliced out list, since we want to check if it's all the same, we see if the count is equal to 4.Note: This treats [1,2,2,2,2,2] as 2, four in a row items since it's the first set of 2s and the second set of 2's. If you only want to treat it as 1 set of 4 in a row you can modify the code as following:Using a while loop we can control the flow of i better than a for loop. If we find the 4 in a row, we skip to the end of the 4 in a row.
