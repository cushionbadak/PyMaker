I have trouble to get correct values for an exercise with the following instructions.Write a function that open a file for reading and returns the number of bytes and newlines('\n').I should get values for def readFile(tmp.txt) is (12, 4), but I got (11, 5).Where I am doing wrong and could you explain me in great details why is that.
os.path.getsize(filename) will return the number of bytes, see here. With file.read() the entire contents of the .txt file can be read and returned, see here. You can then use the method .count("\n") to count the number of occurrences of \n. I recommend reading the paragraphs on .close() and using the with keyword as well (see previous link).Note: The following code snippets assume that tmp.txt is in the same folder as the .py file.Shorter version:
Finaly I managed to get correct result. Here is a code, perhaps with unusual approach since some inbuilt functions mentioned above does not work while coding in Pyschool website.
