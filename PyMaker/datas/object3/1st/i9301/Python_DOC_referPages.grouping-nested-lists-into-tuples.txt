I am trying to group nested lists in python (I already sorted the data).  The final output should be comma separated tuples, one per lineCurrent nested list:  Desired outcome (comma separated tuple)I understand the sorting but don't quite know how to group the lists together into one.  The final step I assume is the convert into tuples.
Since you already sorted your data, you can convert the lists to tuples and create a tuple (couple) of tuples 2 by 2:variant using zip and sliced sub-lists:you don't control the way the data is printed unless you use pprint module.Since I chose a width of 50, I get one element per line (it depends on the data, but it seems that it provides exactly the output mentioned in your question, horizontal alignment included)
This looks like a case for itertools.groupby:This groups all items that have the same first two elements (key=lambda x: x[:2]) together in one tuple. Note that the data has to be sorted by the key for this to work, but according to you this is already the case.
