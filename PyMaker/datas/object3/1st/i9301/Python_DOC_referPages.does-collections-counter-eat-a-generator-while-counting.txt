I have been looking at collections.Counter.I am using the following (simplified) code:Now my question, in my implementation Counter takes a generator as input. To first convert the generator to a list would take way too much space in memory. So I wonder if collections.Counter first converts the data to a list and then 'counts' or it 'eats' the generator while counting.If it first converts the data to a list. How would I best go about implementing it without converting it to a list.
No, the iterable you pass in (be it a generator or another iterable object) is not converted to a list.There is no need to convert the iterable; counting is done as you iterate. The implementation is essentially the same as:but a Counter() object does this much faster (the counting code is implemented in C).
