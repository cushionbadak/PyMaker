Natural Text
After a good while of research, I've been unable to find why this code counts the capital letters in a sentence when they're all capitalized, but will count "0" capital letters if I were to enter a sentence that contains any lowercase letters, such as: "Hello World". 
Because the condition in your if clause is flawed; the isupper method returns True if all characters in the given string are uppercase: See the documentation for str.isupper:Return True if all cased characters in str are uppercase and there is at least one cased character in str, False otherwise.(Emphasis mine)Since you're checking on message with message.isupper(() this will return False all the time resulting in a sum of 0.Instead of checking on the full message with message.isupper(), use your if on a per-character basis with if c.isupper() for every c in message:You could also take advantage of the fact that True acts like 1 and False like 0 to slightly trim that down if you'd want:or, if you like functional approaches, map the function to your input:Even though these might, subjectively, look nicer; they are generally more mystifying than the original approach (and slightly less efficient too).
