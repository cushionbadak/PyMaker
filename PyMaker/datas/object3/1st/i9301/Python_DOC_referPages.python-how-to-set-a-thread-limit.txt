I was wondering how I could limit something like this too use only 10 threads at one time
Use Python's ThreadPoolExecutor with max_workers argument set to 10.Something like this:`The pool will automatically allocate threads as needed, limiting maximum number of allocation to 10. The first argument in pool.submit() is the function name, the arguments are simply passed as comma-separated values.pool.shutdown(wait=True) waits for all threads to complete execution.
Use the ThreadPoolExecutor and tell it that you want 10 threads. ...and you will have all the results in result.
(for both Python 2.6+ and Python 3)Use the threadPool from multiprocessing module:The only thing is that it is not well documented...
I wrote this nested loop to cap threads to a variable.This code relies on a preset array of commands to process.I have borrowed some elements from other answers for thread launch.
