Natural Text
this script is meant to parse Bloomberg finance to find the GBP value during the day, this following script does that however when it returns you get this: {'dateTime': '2017-01-17T22:00:00Z', 'value': 1.6406} I don't want the dateTime, or the value text there. I don't know how to get rid of it. and when I try it gives me errors like this: list index out of range.any answers will be greatly appreciated. here is the script (in python3): 
This should work for you.EDIT: To get all the values,EXPLANATION: data[0] gets the first and only element of the list, which is a dict.  ['price'] gets the list corresponding to the price key.  [-1] gets the last element of the list, which is presumably the data you'll be looking for as it's the latest data point. Finally, ['value'] gets the value of the currency conversion from the dict we obtained earlier.
