Natural Text
I have the following list where I need to write the contents of the list to a file separated by a tab character. I tried printing the list but I see the square brackets also showing up. Is there a better way to write this?I get the output as below.But I need the output as below without the square brackets and also insert tab space between each values of the list.
The method you want is str.join():
The best method depends on what sort of data you have and what if anything may want to read it later. The CSV module deals with things like escaping the separator in a column (suppose the column data itself has a tab), line endings and quoting columns. This may best suite your needs
