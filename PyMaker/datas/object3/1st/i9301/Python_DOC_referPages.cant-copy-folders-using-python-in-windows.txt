You're looking for shutil.copytree(), as shutil.copy() only copies single files.Excerpt from the manual:shutil.copytree(src, dst, symlinks=False, ignore=None, copy_function=copy2, ignore_dangling_symlinks=False)Recursively copy an entire directory tree rooted at src, returning the destination directory. The destination directory, named by dst, must not already exist; it will be created as well as missing parent directories. Permissions and times of directories are copied with copystat(), individual files are copied using shutil.copy2().
