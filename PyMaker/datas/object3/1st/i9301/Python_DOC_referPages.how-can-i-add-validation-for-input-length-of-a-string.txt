I am currently testing my knowledge of python programming as a student and can't get Len() to work on a simple program that asks a user for a user name that is maximum 12 letters long 
In extension of the other answers using len() you might want to look into using a while-loop to ask the user to enter the name again if it is more than 12 characters like so:Try it here!
In Python you pass the String into the len function to return the length of the String.
