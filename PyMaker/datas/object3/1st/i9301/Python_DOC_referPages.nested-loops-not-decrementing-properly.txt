Here is my codeThis is what I am getting. The j value on the right should decrement from 5 to 4 after the first complete loop. View code for further explanationThis is what I want
Without knowing what it is you're actually trying to accomplish, it's a little hard to answer. However, this should work:
I would hazard a guess that when you return to external loop statement, j receives its value from range generator - as it should, overwriting meaningless manipulations.And since value of i (one more reason to hate one-letter variable names) returns to 0 - again, by loop - and j is incremented to 6, the result is obvious.
You should never modify a loop variable this way. I think every new loop resets the variable. It seems you want sort of combination of two numerical numbers. Use itertools instead. https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html
