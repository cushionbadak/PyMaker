Natural Text
My goal is to achieve this:Input:Output:Is there a straight-forward approach to achieve this? I tried using another pattern I found:I assume this should find the text inside the quote, but did not manage to find a way to nail it.EDITI also tried splitting using the next regex, but this obviously only gives me spaces separation which cuts my text inside quotes to segments:Is there a way to combine the pattern I supplied with this for loop such that it return an array that each word in a different cell unless it is quoted and then whats inside the quotes gets its own cell?
You could use shlex.split instead of regexresult:
Another fun way to do it: First split on quotes, then split every non-quoted part (every other):To remove punctuation, you need to replace split() on last line with a proper regexp, but I think you had that covered already.This will not remove punctuation inside quotes of course, and you cannot nest quotes. So you cannot be "super "super" happy" :)
