I have two arrays A and B which contain a series of numbers.My goal is to create a dataframe having the following structure:for each element of B I want to correspond all the values of A. For example:if A = [0,2,5] and B=[4,9,8] I want to obtain the following pairs: 0-4,0-9,0-8, 2-4,2-9,2-8 and 5-4,5-9,5-8.I was able to achieve my goal in the following way:Column ZZZ but be calculated as shown above.The code I wrote works fine but it is pretty slow when I increase the values of a,b,c,d.Is there a more elegant way to achieve my goal? I would like to avoid nested for loops and it should be a more efficient way than mine obviously.
You can create all combination by itertools.product.For column XXX convert float to int and then to str for remove decimal, fom column YYY get absolute value and cast to str:
