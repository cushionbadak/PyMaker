Natural Text
I have a class that implement unittest.TestCase; I would like to know when all the tests has been executed; and perform some operation.Although I can't see how can I get this info; the class does not seem to have a clue about the number of tests, or at least I was not able to find out where this info is hidden.I would like to do a simple check, so I can trigger another class in the same file, to perform some analysis and formatting data. Am I looking for something that in fact is not possible?
There is a special class method for that - tearDownClass():A class method called after tests in an individual class have run.
