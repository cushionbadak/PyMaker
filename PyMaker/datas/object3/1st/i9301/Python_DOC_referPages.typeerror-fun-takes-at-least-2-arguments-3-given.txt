This is my code:I am calling it as fun(1, b=2, c=4) and getting error TypeError: fun() takes at least 2 arguments (3 given).I know this error is because of incorrect number of positional and keyword arguments.Instead of this, I want whenever I call my function with incorrect no. of arguments, it should tell me which argument is provided.For example: for above case it should say something like "argument y is nor provided".Can I write a decorator for this purpose?
I want to handle this error and prompt error like it requires these (names) positional arguments. Is it possible to write a decorator for this?I did a bit of research and came across the inspect module. Perhaps something along these lines will suffice? Right now I'm catching TypeError and printing a message, but you may prefer throwing a new TypeError that contains the message instead.Output

You did not provide one of the two mandatory ones:You need to call it using one of the next forms:If you want notification about insufficient arguments, you can use args and kwargs:
