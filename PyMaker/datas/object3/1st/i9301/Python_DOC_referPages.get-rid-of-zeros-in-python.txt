This question already has an answer here:Limiting floats to two decimal points                    22 answers                I wrote a very simple code in Python.I need to print all the numbers between 1 and 5 (including 1 and 5) in steps of 0.1. The integers should be without the suffix .0, i.e. the output should be:Here is my code:Here is my output:I don't need all this zeros .000000001.
Taking advantage of Python's string formatting capabilities, you can reduce your whole loop to one line:Output:ExplanationThis gives you 0 for multiples of 10 for i and 1 for others:Now, you can use this for the keyword argument deci to determine the number of decimals in your output:
You can print the floating point numbers rounded to 1 digit after the decimal point like so:The second line formats d as a string representation of a float number rounded with 1 digit(comming from the .1) after the decimal point. 
You could use round or format 
Change your last line into:This will format your numbers showing only one decimal position.
Output:
you can use the %.1f notation. That will limit the number of decimals to be printedOUTPUT
