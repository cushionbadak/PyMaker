I have a dataset along the lines of:I've searched SO and found ways to return duplicates across all lists using intersection_update() (so, in this example, 'a'), but I actually want to return duplicates from any lists, i.e.,:retVal = ['a', 'x']Since 'a' and 'x' are duplicated at least once among all lists. Is there a built-in for Python 2.7 that can do this?
Use a Counter to determine the number of each item and chain.from_iterable to pass the items from the sublists to the Counter.
