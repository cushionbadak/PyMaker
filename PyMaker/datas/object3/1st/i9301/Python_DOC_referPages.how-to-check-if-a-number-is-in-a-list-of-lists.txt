so I've been having trouble checking if the number 0 is in a group of lists within another list. These rows make up the maze for a pacman type game I'm making so the point of this is to check if pacman has eaten all of the coins.Here's my code:So I have tried if 0 not in maze: But the if statement will execute whether 0 is in (maze) or not. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
You'll have to loop through each list in maze and check whether there is a 0 or not:The great thing about the any() function is that it stops looping through maze once it finds a 0.
With your first attempt, your only testing for 0 in the top-level list. Of course, the top-level list only has lists, thus, your test fails.You must iterate through each sublist in maze. You could use a manually for loop, which is a valid option:but Python provides a better way with the any() function(which is basically a better implementation of the above function):Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return False[...].But you must also use the not operator(know as ! in other languages) to negate the possibly return true value of any(). Thus, the full solution would be:
any was already mentioned but you could also flatten your lists (for example using itertools.chain.from_iterable) and check if the item is contained:Like any this stops as soon as one is found. Just to mention it because it's something that is often overlooked: generators and iterators (like chain) generally support the in operator.
Loop through the sublist. Also use any() It will check if there is any 0 in the list
as long as i understand your problem you can use the following code:
