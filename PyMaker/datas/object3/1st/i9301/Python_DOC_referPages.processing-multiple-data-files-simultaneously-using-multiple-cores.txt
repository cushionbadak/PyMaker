I have multiple data files that I process using python Pandas libraries. Each file is processed one by one, and only one logical processor is used when I look at Task manager (it is at ~95%, and the rest are within 5%)Is there a way to process data files simultaneously?If so, is there a way to utilize the other logic processors to do that?(Edits are welcome)

If your file names are in a list, you could use this code:
