How to convert a human readable time with the format 20.12.2016 09:38:42,76 to Unix timestamps in milliseconds? I found a lot of similar questions, but didn't found this specific question/answer.
In Python 3 this can be done in 2 steps:Convert timestring to datetime objectMultiply the timestamp of the datetime object by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds.For example like this:Output:strptime accepts your timestring and a format string as input. The timestring (first argument) specifies what you actually want to convert to a datetime object. The format string (second argument) specifies the actual format of the string that you have passed.Here is the explanation of the format specifiers from the official documentation:%d - Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.%m - Month as a zero-padded decimal number.%Y - Year with century as a decimal number%H - Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.%M - Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.%S - Second as a zero-padded decimal number.%f - Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left.
For Python2.7 - modifying MYGz's answer to not strip milliseconds:Output:
You need to parse your time format using strptime.
For Python2.7You can format it into seconds and then multiply by 1000 to convert to millisecond.Output:
