In the PyCharm editor, I have a python application named project3 with the following directory structure. The file load.py just has a function (not class py file) def read():, mip.py is a py class file, and has own function method. In the cnn.py, I want to import the load and mip file which I intend to use. My import code is as follows;But I get the error:
In pycharm you must add project3 (and any other directories containing modules) as a root containing sources.Right click on your project3 directory and in the context menu select: Mark Directory as > Sources Root
A similar question was answered, and since I don't have much experience with PyCharm, I'll avoid commenting on how you should go about it within the IDE.Instead, I'll refer you in the direction of the package docs:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path.The easiest solution is to just add a blank file named __init__.py in the same directory:In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.In the IDE, you may be able to do this by simply creating a new file in the project, naming it __init__.py and saving it, then restarting PyCharm.If you'd like to do (or just read about) more complicated things with python modules and packages, you can see distutils.
