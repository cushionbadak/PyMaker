This question already has an answer here:str.translate gives TypeError - Translate takes one argument (2 given), worked in Python 2                    4 answers                I am using Python 3 and I want to translate my file names to have no numbers. The translate function doesn't seem to work in Python 3. How can I translate the file names to have no numbers?   This is the block of code that doesn't work:Thanks 
str.translate is still there, the interface has just changed a little:
I'm using ver3.6.1 and translate did not work. What did work is the strip() method as follows:
.translate takes a translation table:Return a copy of the string S in which each character has been  mapped      through the given translation table. The table must implement      lookup/indexing via getitem, for instance a dictionary or list,      mapping Unicode ordinals to Unicode ordinals, strings, or None. If      this operation raises LookupError, the character is left untouched.      Characters mapped to None are deleted.So you can do something like:
Only remove numbers from leftnew_name = str.lstrip('1234567890')Only remove numbers from rightnew_name = str.rstrip('123456780')Remove number from left and rightnew_name = str.strip('1234567890')Remove all numbersnew_name = str.translate(str.maketrans('', '', '1234567890'))
