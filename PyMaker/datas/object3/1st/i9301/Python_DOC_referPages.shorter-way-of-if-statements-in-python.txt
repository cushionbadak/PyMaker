A generator works like:(with no braces)It thus takes every element in the <other-iterable> and calls the <expr> on it. In this case the <expr> is x in l, and x is the <var>:Further explanation of generators.
You can use sets:

A different approach is using sets:
You may also use set objects for such case:set >= otherTest whether every element in other is in the set.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=set#set.issuperset
