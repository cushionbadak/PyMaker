I'm trying to create a program which scrapes stock prices from a website and then calculate the trend differences between the prices over a series of time. I'm doing this by storing the data in tables marked as buy and sell price.If I run them separately they work fine. But the second I put them in the same program they don't work.I need to be able to be able to calculate a trend from every three values in the list as that is the number of records per stock but they are all put into a single listHere's my codeThe error I get is as follows
You have NULL values in you table, which are translated to None values in Python. You can't convert None to a float. Perhaps you want to select only rows that are not NULL?I don't know what the column name is of that first column, you'll have to adjust the query.I've converted your query to use a SQL parameter for the price (tablenames can't be inserted using parameters, do make sure you only ever use hard-coded table names and not accept untrusted data).The alternative is to skip those rows in Python:Also note that the sqlite3 module can convert values for you, see the SQLite and Python Types section; if the column is declared as REAL in the database, you already are given float objects anyway.
