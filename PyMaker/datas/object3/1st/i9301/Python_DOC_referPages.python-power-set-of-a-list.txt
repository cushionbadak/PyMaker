This question already has an answer here:How to get all subsets of a set? (powerset)                    13 answers                I am trying to implement a function to generate the powerset of a list xs. The general idea is that we walk through the elements of xs and choose whether to include x or not. The problem I'm facing is that withX ends up being equal to [None] (a singleton list with None) because (I think) s.add(x) returns None. This isn't a homework assignment, it's an exercise in Cracking the Coding Interview.
Take a look at the powerset example from the itertools recipes:For a range of integers up to the length of the given list, make all possible combinations and chain them together as one object.
resultSource code for itertools.combinations can be found here which has a few neat optimizations:https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations
Here's a recursive solution that does not use any modules:
