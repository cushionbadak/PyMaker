I have a class that I want to be able to do bitwise operations on in some cases.At this point c = b | a works, but c = a | b gives a type error. How do I get it to work both ways?Also, is there a more elegant way to do this; for example, I had hoped that by just defining __nonzero__, I might get the right behaviour, but that's not the case.I'm using Python 2.7.
By also defining __ror__, as shown below, I get the right behaviour. The second part of the question still stands, however. Is there a more elegant way?
