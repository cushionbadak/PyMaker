Here is my data set:Here are some visualizations of the patterns in my data set:Each element is a list of the indexes that element intersects.  So, the element @0 only intersects element 3.  While the element @3 intersects element 0, 1, and 2.I want to create a list of the intersections between these elements.  I want greater numbers of intersections at the end of the list.  For my sample set, the solution would look like this:That is, 0 & 3 intersect, as do 1 & 2, 1 & 3, and 2 & 3.  Finally, 1 & 2 & 3 all intersect each other.As pointed out in the comments below, it is possible that 1 & 2 & 3 do not all intersect if they were actually polygons, but for my purposes I am assuming all listed elements can and will intersect each other. What is the fastest way to get this data only using the isects list?
As far I understand, isects list does not provide full information about intersection cases - it is not possible to know about triple intersection from it. So geometric approach is needed to get what intersections do occur.Edit If you are not interested in real geometric intersections, then you have to solve graph problem: you have adjacency list, and want to get... what? It seems that all possible K-size cliques with K=2 and more.Wiki example:The graph shown has one maximum clique, the triangle {1,2,5}, and four  more maximal cliques, the pairs {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}.Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is relatively effective for searching for all cliques (while complexity is O(3^(n/3)). It is usually used to find maximal clique but can find all size ones.
I would create a table intersections with the isect data.Each 'x' represents an intersection.  Intersections are sets, so [0,1] and [1,0] are the same.  Thus we get the unique list of intersections: [0,3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3].And if you want to consider when other polygons overlap the same one a common intersection, then look at '-'s which are surrounded by 'x's.  In this case, you'd have just one (at 2x2), thus you'd have [1,2,3] as an overlapping intersection.  However, I agree with everyone else here, the data in isect does not guarantee there is an overlap.
