Starting from two different dictionaries:How can I get the common values even if they have different keys? Considering the above dictionaries, I would like to have this output:
Create sets from the values:This creates an intersection of the unique values in either dictionary:Unfortunately, we can't use dictionary views here (which can act like sets), because dictionary values are not required to be unique. Had you asked for just the keys, or the key-value pairs, the set() calls would not have been necessary.
Try this,
The intersection expression & requires 2 sets but the method counterpart can work with any iterable, like dict.values. So here is another version of the Martijn Pieters solution :My 2 cents :)
