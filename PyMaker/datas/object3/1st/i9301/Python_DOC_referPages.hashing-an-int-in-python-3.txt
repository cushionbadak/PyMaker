I would like to show my students that MD5 collides the two integer "messages" given here. This is my original demonstration for Python 2.7: As expected, it prints twice 79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4.Now when I try to translate the last two lines into Python 3.5 as:All I get is a TypeError: object supporting the buffer API required message. The method decode no longer works in Python 3, but I am not sure it's a good idea to replace it by int(m, base) as above. May be the problem is there, and not with the hash function API?
In Python 2, decoding strings as hex gives you a bytestring still, not integers. Don't try to interpret your hex strings as integers.Use the binascii.unhexlify() function to turn your hex strings into a bytestring:Note that the same code will work fine in Python 2 as well.If you want to use decoding anyway, use the codecs.decode() function:Again, the same code works in Python 2 as well.
