I have following 2D-Array like:I want to transform it to a new list with each element mapped to its position in the overall list like:Position in next sub-list should be the next value from the previous sub-list. Also, the length of each sub-list is same.
In order to achieve this, you may use enumerate() with nested list comprehension expression as:Final value hold by new_list will be:
This should work:Exapmle:You could use list comprehension for this, but I think this is clearer.
I wanted to give you an example as simple as it gets, I created a new list, and counter to know which key I'm on.I iterate my_list through each sub-list, than I iterate through each sub-list item.Than I'm creating a tuple which I'll append to a new list.Since your question included the words: key and value I will add another way to arrange my_list to key and value inform of dictionary.
Same thing but different - using itertools.count.A bit more functional:or
