This question already has an answer here:How to clone or copy a list?                    20 answers                Why do we use ret = list(self.nums)? I tried to use ret = left.nums, but it doesn't pass through the LeetCode solution. I don't understand why we put list() in front of self.nums. My guess is that self.nums is already a list.
Calling list() here will create a copy of self.nums (see How to clone or copy a list? ):This means that shuffle() leaves the underlying list of numbers untouched while returning a shuffled list (since random.shuffle() shuffles the input in place).Keeping this list untouched allows the reset() method to work.
ret = list(self.nums) creates a new list since shuffle does a in place shuffle. So ret holds a copy of the original list which gets shuffled and returned and self.nums holds the contents of the original list.
