Natural Text
this is a dumb question, I know.I am making a request, the request returns something like this"\u003cdiv style=\u0027inline-block\u0027\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0027fbox\u0027\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca"Now if I do print(r.text) (with r being the variable the above string is stored in), it prints it out as it is represented above.However if I do print("\u003cdiv style=\u0027inline-block\u0027\u003e\u003cdiv class=\u0027fbox\u0027\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca")It prints out "<div style='inline-block'><div class='fbox'><div><a".So I am wondering, how do I print like the second version.This might not be clear so to sum it up:When I print the raw string with \u003 etc in it, it prints with \u003 replaced with its unicode character. But if I print it is the response from a request, it prints out without replacing the character.
It seems like r.text is being stored as a raw string. i.e.In order to convert it to unicode, you need the codecs module:
