This question already has an answer here:How do I put a variable inside a string?                    7 answers                I have make a set of names in this form: 's1', 's2', ..., 's100'. I thought I can do that easily via looping:format here does not append the numbers. I only get ss..ss without the numbers being concatenated in single quote. I know how to do this in Java but I am not that much expert in Python. Thank you
You need to have a placeholder in the format string:Perform a string formatting operation. The string on which this method  is called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by  braces {}. Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of  a positional argument, or the name of a keyword argument.
If you use 3.6, then you can take advantage of the new 'Literal String Interpolation', and do the following:For more details on this feature, check out PEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation
