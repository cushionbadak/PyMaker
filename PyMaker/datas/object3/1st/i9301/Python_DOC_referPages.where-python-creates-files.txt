When I make a file in python, using the following command:in what directory is it created?
Document:Open file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot  be opened, an OSError is raised.file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative  to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an  integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file  descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is  closed, unless closefd is set to False.)
You can find the current working directory (of a session or script) withIf NewFile is still around (even if closed)gives the full path of the file.
In the same directory from where you are executing this script. If you are not running this one from command line - then try to print current working directory using methods from "os" module.
