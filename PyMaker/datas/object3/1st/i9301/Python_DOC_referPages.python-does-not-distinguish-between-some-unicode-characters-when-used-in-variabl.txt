This question already has an answer here:Identifier normalization: Why is the micro sign converted into the Greek letter mu?                    2 answers                The problemI for one delight myself by using Unicode literals in my variable names when writing Python 3 code. Today I had a weird bug, which turns out to be due to Python not distinguishing between the variables ρ and ϱ, as this short code show:Is this a bug or a feature? In case of the latter, how/where can I find the set of all such characters which belong together in this manner?Further explorationThis lack of distinction is not present when ρ and ϱ are used inside strings:which makes me confident that this is not some encoding problem with my editor/terminal.We can also confirm that Python is fully aware of precisely which characters we are dealing with, using the unicodedata module:I have found the same behavior between the pair φ (GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI) and ϕ (GREEK PHI SYMBOL).
2.3. Identifiers and keywords ¶All identifiers are converted into the normal form NFKC while parsing; comparison of identifiers is based on NFKC.
