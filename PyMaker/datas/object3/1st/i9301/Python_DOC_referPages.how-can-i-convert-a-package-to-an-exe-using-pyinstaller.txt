I've got an open source python command line program that runs on Python 2.7, Python3+, and is cross platform.I'm trying to package it up into an executable for my windows users more easily. The source for this package is up on Github here: https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-cliI'm trying to package my Python program up using pyinstaller, but am having issues.I'm running the following commands from a Windows 8 box:This successfully generates an EXE file for me, but when I go to run it, I get the following errors:For testing purposes, to help narrow the issue down, I created a test.py script that contains the following code:And then packaged that into an exe as well:When I run this resulting exe, everything works great! Hello world is output as expected.I believe what's happening is that I'm not telling pyinstaller how to properly 'detect' that my project is a python package, and not a single file script.I've read through the docs a lot, and have googled around, but haven't found a way to specify a package for pyinstaller to analyze.What am I missing?
While I think it is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, it looks like PyInstaller simply doesn't support building an application from a package (with __main__.py).See https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/2560.As a workaround, you can write a small stub (outside of the package) that does the same the same thing as your __main__.py. Then point PyInstaller at that.
