I have a function in a file that receives different types of parameters (int, strings, dictionaries, lists...)Usually I call this function from another one, passing the right parameters, but I would like to also be able to call it from the console (for testing purposes)The problem is that the input arguments are stored as strings, so I cannot directly pass them to the function.Is there a way of automatically passing the parameters from the console to the function keeping the correct format?To call my function from console I just do:The first assert succeds since it expects a string, but the second one fails since it expects an int.The print args from the main function returns ['hello', '5', '{age:30}', '[1,2,3,4]']  (so arguments have been parsed correctly, but they are stored as strings).I just need to convert them to the right format.Any ideas?
You could pass them as a python list:and then get the arguments using ast.literal_evalNow args is a list worth ['hello', 5, {'age': 30}, [1, 2, 3, 4]]To be really portable between shells (windows, Linux), the above approach is preferred: double quotes to protect the argument, simple quotes to protect strings. Doing it the other way round works with Linux/MSYS shells but not with Windows (single quotes are not really quotes in windows)
