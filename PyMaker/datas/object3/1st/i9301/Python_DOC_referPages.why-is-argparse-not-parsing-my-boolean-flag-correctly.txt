This question already has an answer here:Parsing boolean values with argparse                    13 answers                I am trying to use the argparse module to make my Python program accept flexible command-line arguments. I want to pass a simple boolean flag, and  saying True or False to execute the appropriate branch in my code. Consider the following. When I tried to execute it with python scrap.py -boolflag False -intflag 314 I got the resultWhy is this?!! The intflag seems to be parsed correctly, yet the boolean flag is invariably parsed as True even if I mention explicitly in the command-line arguments that I want it to be False. Where am I going wrong? 
You are trying to turn the string "False" into a boolean:That won't work because the string "False" is a non-empty value. All non-empty strings have a True boolean value.Use a store_false action instead:Now when you use that switch, False is stored, otherwise the default is True (set by action='store_false').
