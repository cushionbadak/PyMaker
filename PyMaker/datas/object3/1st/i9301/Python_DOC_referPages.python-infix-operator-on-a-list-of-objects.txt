I'm using a library for mathematical optimization (PICOS) in a jupyter notebook. In PICOS, the symbols // and & are infix operators for vertical and horizontal concatenation, to build matrices out of blocks. Note that I cannot use numpy.bmat because the blocks are not numpy objects.If I have a list of blocks, say [A,B,C], I would form a matrix by concatenating them horizontally with the notation A & B & C, for instance. The problem arises when the list contains hundreds of symbols and I cannot build the matrix by hand. Is there a simple way of interposing an infix between each symbol in a list?
orif you want spaces between the &EDIT:also wrap it inside eval
I should have been less hasty. I just did it with a recursive function:and an analogous one for the vertical concatenation. Yay, recursion!
Use the built-in reduce metafunction (Python 2.7 docu, Python 3 docu) with the operators.and_(a, b) representing the & infix operator as a function of two arguments:
