I'm searching a method in python to show me the platform details. So I find platform.system(), but I got shock when I saw the help doc:system()Returns the system/OS name, e.g. 'Linux', 'Windows' or 'Java'.Any idea on why 'Java' is listed there but not 'Darwin'?
Darwin is indeed one of the possible outputs of the platform.system() method. I did a quick Google search and came up with this.Java is probably there for Jython implementations, as someone pointed out above.EDIT: Further Googling led me to this: platform.system() uses sys.platform, so I think this is where the Java comes from.This excerpt is from the book Jython Essentials: Rapid Scripting in Java and therefore can be regarded as conclusive. Link included for reference.
