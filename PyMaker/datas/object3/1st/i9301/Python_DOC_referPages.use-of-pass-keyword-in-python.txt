This question already has an answer here:How to use the pass statement?                    14 answers                What is the use of the "pass" keyword in Python? I don't know why or in what instance you would need to use it, since it literally does nothing. Can anyone give me a reason to use these other than for testing? It serves as a good placeholder, true, but does it have any other uses?
For example you can use pass as placeholder for code, which you want to write later and syntactically you need some statement there.
