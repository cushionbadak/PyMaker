I am writing a python script using beautiful soup, where i have to get an opening tag from a string containing some HTML code.Here is my string:I want to get <p> in a variable called opening_tag and </p> in a variable called closing_tag. I have searched the documentation but don't seem to find the solution. Can anyone advise me with that?
There is no direct way to get opening and closing parts of the tag in BeautifulSoup, but, at least, you can get the name of it:With html.parser though you can listen to "start" and "end" tag "events".
