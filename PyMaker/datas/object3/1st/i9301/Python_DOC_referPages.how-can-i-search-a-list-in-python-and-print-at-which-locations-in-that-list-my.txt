I am generating a list of 12 random numbers:I would then like to search 'nums' for a specific number, say '12' and use an if statement to print if it showed up and where in the list. Something like this:In this case, 'newNums' is the list where I have the locations listed of where '12' is inside of the 'nums' list.I tried a few different things with a for loop that didn't get me anywhere and then I found something on here that looked like this:However, when I try to print that it does not do what I am looking for. I must have misunderstood its purpose. My understanding of the enumerate function is that it provides the index of where the value is located, followed by the value; ex: [0,1], [1,8], [2,6] etc. I am reading that code to mean: give me the i value in a pair of [i,x] inside the list (nums) if the x == 12.I am new to python within the past couple of weeks, so any advice is welcome. I may just be misunderstanding how the code works.Thank you for your time. 
The only problem here is that newNums:is a generator, and as far as I know, you cannot call len(..) on a genrator and the printing does not show it elements, but only that it is an enumerator.You can use list comprehension to construct a list. All you have to do is replace the round brackets ((..)) with square ones ([..]):Finally a small note:My understanding of the enumerate function is that it provides the index of where the value is located, followed by the value; ex: [0,1], [1,8], [2,6] etc.You are correct, except that your syntax seems to suggest that it emits lists, it emits tuples, so (0,1), (1,8),... but this is in this context a minor detail.
the small problem with your code is that is a generator (e.g. len will not work on it). what you want is a list (comprehension):with this the rest of your code works as you expect it.
