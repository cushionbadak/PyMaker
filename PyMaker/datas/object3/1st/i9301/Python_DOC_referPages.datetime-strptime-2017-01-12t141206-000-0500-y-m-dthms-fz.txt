I've been trying to convert this specific date format to a string in Python like so:But it doesn't work.  What am I doing wrong? 
Solution for Python 2.7From the comments it became clear that OP needs a solution for Python 2.7.Apparently, there's no %z in strptime for python 2.7 even though the documentation claims the contrary, the raised error is ValueError: 'z' is a bad directive in format '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000%z'.To solve this, you need to parse the date without timezone first and add the timezone later. Unfortunately you need to subclass tzinfo for that. This answer is based on this answerThe last line prints:
The error was that you used %Z instead of %z. From the documentation, you should use %z to match e.g. (empty), +0000, -0400, +1030Output
Task:"convert this specific date format to a string in Python"Solution:First modify your datetime.strptime code as follows:This is a useful site for your reference and will help you modify the output as per your preference.  Then use strftime to convert it to a string:Out:
Assuming Python 3, the format %f may not be a valid format character for strptime on your platform.  The strptime docs reference strftime for the formats, and %f isn't in the strftime list.  However, the format string reference says that The full set of format codes supported varies across platforms, because Python calls the platform C libraryâ€™s strftime() function, and platform variations are common.On my test system, which is Cygwin with Py 3.4.5, I used:and got I checked the man pages for strftime(3) and found that I don't have %f, and %z should be lowercase.  I therefore usedand got a successful parse.Edit @Tagc found that %f worked fine running under Python 3.5 in PyCharm on a Windows 10 machine.
Having date as the input str:python-transforming-twitter
If you don't have timezone information, replacing the '%Z' with 'Z' works in Python 3.
if it is a string, e.g. load from a JSON file, you can try returns:
