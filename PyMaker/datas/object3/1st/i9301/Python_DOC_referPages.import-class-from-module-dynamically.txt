I have class called 'my_class' placed in 'my_module'. And I need to import this class. I tried to do it like this:but it says:So. As I can see it works only for modules, but can't handle classes. How can I import a class from a module?
It is expecting my_module to be a package containing a module named 'my_class'. If you need to import a class, or an attribute in general, dynamically, just use getattr after you import the module:Also, yes, it does only work with modules. Remember importlib.import_module is a wrapper of the internal importlib.__import__ function. It doesn't offer the same amount of functionality as the full import statement which, coupled with from, performs an attribute look-up on the imported module.
