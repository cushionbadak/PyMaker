Im having to use this json module for an assignment for python https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-jsonAnd I can't figure out how to extract the "llcontinue" value from something like  this example string https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&prop=langlinks&list=&titles=tallinn&lllimit=10The idea is to get it and then run a function again and from that json string to get the language values.
@Hope, you're right, json.loads() works in your example, though I'm not sure how the object_hook option works or if it would even be necessary. This should do what your asking:output:31577|bat-smgWith this you should be able to get the language values you're after.
