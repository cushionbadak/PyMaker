I am new to this, and unsure why this is not working. I have looked for similar problems, but it doesn't seem to help me. The equation is Sn=-7*Sn-1-1*Sn-2, with initial values S0=0 and S1=1
SolutionYou're confusing -7*s(n-1) with s(-7*(n-1)) :ExplanationWhatever the (positive) n is, the recursive parameters will decrease toward 0 and 1, so the recursion will reach an end.For 5 as start value, it calculates s_recursive for n=:and the result is 2255.Note that s_recursive(2) is calculated 3 times. With large n, it would be a good idea to keep a dict of calculated results.Your codeIn your code, calling -7*(n-1) recursively was the problem. With n=7 as start value, it calculated s_recursive for n:
