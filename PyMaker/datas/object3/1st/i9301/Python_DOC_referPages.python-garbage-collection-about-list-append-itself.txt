... is the ellipsis object. Here it is issued because else it would print forever! (due to infinite recursion)and: print(a[1][0]):a[1] is a so a[1][0] is 2, like a[1][1][1][1][0] is 2 too.
Ellipsis ... is used for slicing multidimensional numpy arrays.The ellipsis syntax may be used to indicate selecting in full any remaining unspecified dimensions.a[1] is [2, [...]]so, a[1][0] is 2.
