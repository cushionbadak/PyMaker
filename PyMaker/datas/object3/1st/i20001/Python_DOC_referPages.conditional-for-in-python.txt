Does Python have something like below?I mean Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 both together.
You can combine the loop with a generator expression:itertools.ifilter (py2) / filter (py3) is another option:
You mean something like this: -Or, you can use Generator expression, that will not create a new list, rather returns a generator, which then returns the next element on each iteration using yield method: -
There isn't a special syntax like the where in your question, but you could always just use an if statement within your for loop, like you would in any other language:or a guard clause (again, like any other language):Both of these boring approaches are almost as succinct and readable as a special syntax for this would be.
You could use an explicit if statement:Or you could create a generator if you need a name to iterate later, example:Or you could pass it to a function:It might be matter of taste but I find a for-loop combined with inlined genexpr such as for x in (y for y in items if y > 3): to be ugly compared to the above options.
Python 3 and Python 2.7 both have filter() function which allows extracting items out of a list for which a function (in the example below, that's lambda function) returns True:Omitting function in filter() will extract only items that are True, as stated in pydoc filter
