I have trouble with distinguishing between \r (0x0d) and \n (0x0a) in my PLY lexer.A minimal example is the following programNow creating a file foo as follows:Verifying that it looks ok:Now I had assumed that I would get some CR and some LF tokens, but:it turns out I only get LF tokens. I would like to know why this happens, and how I should do it instead.This is Python 3.2.3 on Ubuntu 12.04
You open the file in the default mode. In that mode, newline=None, meaning (among other things) that any of \r, \n and \r\n are treated as end of line and converted into a single \n character. See the open documentation for details.You can disable this behavior by passing newline='' to open, which means it'll accept any kind of newline but not normalize them to \n.
