Natural Text
The situation is as follows:I have a .txt file with results of several nslookups.I want to loop tru the file and everytime it hits the string "Non-authoritative answer:" the scripts has to print the following 8 lines from that position. If it works I shoud get all the positive results in my screen :).First I had the following code:But that only printed "Authoritative answers can be found from:" the times it was in the .txt.The code what I have now:But when I run it, it prints the first result nicely to my screen but does not print the other positve results.p.s. I am aware of socket.gethostbyname("foobar.baz") but first I want to solve this basic problem.Thank you in advance!
You can use the file as an iterator, then print the next 8 lines every time you find your sentence:Each time you use the next() function on the file object (or loop over it in a for loop), it'll return the next line in that file, until you've read the last line.Instead of the range(8) for loop, I'd actually use itertools.islice:
By the way: don't ever use the name file for a variable because it is the name of a built-in function.
