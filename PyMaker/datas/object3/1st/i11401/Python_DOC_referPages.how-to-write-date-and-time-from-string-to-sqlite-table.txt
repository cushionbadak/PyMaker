I have date and time in one-string format "2016-03-28T20:23:46+0800". How to convert it to date-time format Sqlite3 supports in "datetime" domain? I'm using python to read/write data in database.I know that it's possible to achive using python:but maybe the given string has a convertible format?
date time format does not exist in sqlite, one work around is to use number sequence as date time for example:when select in sql command, you can use 
sqlite3 won't produce an error until you try to select the value back as datetime object if you try to insert a timestamp in the wrong format. To validate the input date/time string, convert it to datetime.datetime first. sqlite3 module can convert datetime.datetime automatically:OutputTIMESTAMP field accepts a string in ISO 8601 format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmmmmm' or datetime.datetime object. To return datetime.datetime() back, you could use detect_types=sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES (if you need the timezone support; define your own converter that returns timezone-aware datetime objects).
