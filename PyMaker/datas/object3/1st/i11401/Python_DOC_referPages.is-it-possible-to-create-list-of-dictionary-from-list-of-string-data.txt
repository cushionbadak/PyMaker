My Input list is of the following type (Note that it includes empty strings): I need to create a list of dictionaries like (Where the empty strings are ignored) What I have tried so far:and got following output:How can I get expected output and exclude empty string value from the list?
There are two separate questions that you ask here.To remove '' from your list you can pass it through a list comprehensionThe syntax of your string follows the general rule that the odd elements baring the first two is meant to be NO and the even ones are meant to be Part_Number.For this we can use following the iter trick: The main idea is that iter returns an iterator and hence each time you pass an element you consume an element. Thus you get the required output when you zip (which returns adjacent elements as you are passing the same iterator as both the arguments).
