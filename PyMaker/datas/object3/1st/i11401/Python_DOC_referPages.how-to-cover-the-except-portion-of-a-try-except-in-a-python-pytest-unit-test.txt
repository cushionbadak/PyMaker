I'm new to Python. I need to unit test the except part of a try-except statement in python. I'm using pytest. The problem is that I don't know how to force the try part to raise an exception. Here is my code:The master.update method is called to make an update to the database. But how do I mock this code so that it somehow raises an exception in the try portion?I'm trying to use monkeypatch with this code. The master object is an instance of the BillTo class so I'm thinking of putting that as the first parameter to monkeypatch.setattr.But for some reason, the error is not raised.
Use mock library and side_effect to throw Exception during test case
Mock master and raise an exception in the update method.
Ok, I figured it out. I learned that you must pass parameters to the method called by monkeypatch. These parameters must match the signature of the method being replaced or mocked. Actually I also renamed the method with a prefix fake_ to denote the mocking. Here is what I did:The BillTo.update method needed all those parameters.
