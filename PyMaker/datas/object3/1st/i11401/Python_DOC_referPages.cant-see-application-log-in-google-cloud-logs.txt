How can I view log messages on Google Cloud?: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs This is what I see in the terminal when I run dev_appserver.py (locally running):Both application log messages and request logging is displayed.However when I view the log of the same code deployed I can only see the requests being logged:  The code I'm using to generate application log messages is something like:But I've also tried using logging.info(...) directly with the same results.I've tried finding an answer to this in various resources but I've come up empty-handed, most refer to how to set log level when developing locally.I'm guessing that I need to enable some setting in order to view application logs on Google Cloud Logs.Resources that I've looked at:  https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logs_viewer https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/logs/How to change the logging level of dev_appserverHow do I write to the console in Google App Engine?Google App Engine - Can not find my logging messageshttps://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html
App engine groups the logs by request. You need to expand the log using the triangle/pointer on the left of the request in the 'new' GAE log viewer.Personally I prefer using the old GAE log viewer, but I am unsure how much longer it will be around:https://appengine.google.com/logs?app_id=s~xxx(This viewer shows request + logs and allows log expansion)
