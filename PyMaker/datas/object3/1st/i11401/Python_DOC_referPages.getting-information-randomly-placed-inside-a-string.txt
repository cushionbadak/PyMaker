Natural Text
I need to extract information from this string (was bytes, but I decoded it):\x00\x00\x00!broadcast "updatedirection 126.0"I need to see whether it contains broadcast, updatedirection and also see what the number is at the end. My first solutions were:but the symbol in that position seemed to change randomly and with no apparent pattern at all. Then I tried:But the string length changed all the time, so that didn't work.I am doing this for a computer science project in school where I am using BYOB (based on Scratch, a simple language to teach young people how to program) and sockets to send data between them to make a LAN multiplayer. This is literally the only thing that doesn't work yet.Hope someone can give me a solution to find this data.
You could hit it with a hammerChecking for different cases,You could make it more robust by changing the first part for null bytes of regex to something like giving it a range(?:\x00){m,n} or something similar.
To check if a string contains a word:Then I would use rfind() to find where the last space is, extract the text after this space and check whether it is a number.You can test for both words in a single statement:
Try this,Refer to re.findall.
