I'm new to Python and I'm trying to zip 2 lists together into 1, which I was already able to do. I've got 2 lists with several things in them, but I'm asking the user to input a number, which should determine the range.So i've got List1: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 and List2: B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6I know how to display the 2 complete lists, but what I'm trying to do is, if the user enters number "3", the zip should only display: (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) instead of the whole list. So here's what I tried:But this doesn't work. I tried to look it up, but couldn't find anything. I would be glad, if someone could help me out.
You can slice the result of zip() with itertools.islice():
You don't need a for loop here - you only need to do the operation you're trying to do once. Also, a generator object returned by zip can't be "subscripted" (accessed using []), so you need to convert it to a list first using list.Here's some modified code that works:Example of usage and output:
When in doubt, use print:As you can see, x is a pair, so x[:number] would only show the number first items of the pair.What you actually want to do is show the number first pairs:(Note that I used list() on the value returned by zip(), because zip objects as not subscriptable)If you want to iterate instead of just printing them like this, it's easy:
