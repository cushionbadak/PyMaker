I have to Python scripts: Tester1.py and Tester2.py.Within Tester1 I want to start from time to time Tester2.py. I also want to pass Tester2.py some arguments. At the moment my code looks like this:Tester1:Tester2:Now my problem: If I run with my terminal Tester2 like 'python3 Tester2.py testString'my console prints out testString. But if I run Tester1 and Tester1 tries to start Tester2, I get an IndexError: "list index out of range".How do I need to change my code to get everything working?EDIT:niemmi told me that I have to change my code to:but now I get a No such file or directory Error although both scripts are in the same directory. Someone knows why?
You need to provide the arguments either as separate elements on a list or as a string:Python documentation has following description:args is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence of program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments.
