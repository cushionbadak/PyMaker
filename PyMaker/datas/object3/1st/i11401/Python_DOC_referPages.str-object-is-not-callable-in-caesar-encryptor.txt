Tried to copy this code from Stanford lecture slide and run it but it gives 'str' object is not callable error, what am I doing wrong? 
I guess the author of the slide didn't actually test the code.The code you produced is trying to use map() to call s as a function:If you wanted to create a dictionary mapping ASCII letters to a letter 3 spots along in the alphabet, use the zip() function instead:zip() then pairs up each element in s with each element in s[3:] + s[:3], and those (letter, letter + 3) pairs are then passed to dict() to form key-value pairs:Next, your last line will completely fail to do any encryption, because your map only handles uppercase letters, but you lowercased your input. Either produce a lowercase map, or lowercase your input.Lowercasing the map could look like this:or you could just use the string.ascii_lowercase constant:Using this method is rather slow, however. For blazingly-fast 'encryption', use the str.translate() method; the input map for that is best produced with str.maketrans:I added a shift parameter to define how much of an alphabet shift should be applied.I'll leave handling both lowercase and uppercase letters as an exercise to the reader!
