Natural Text
I am having some problems with stripping out unwanted characters in Python.The below code is being fetched from a file (although the \rn\n[]' characters are not included in the file.)I want to strip out all the unnecessary characters listed above so that I just have the numbers and text and then write these to another file. I have tried many methods such as line.strip but none of them have worked.Here is how I am writing to the file right now;And here is the resultIf anybody could explain in simple terms what I need to add to this to remove the unnecessary characters, I would be very grateful. Thanks

Here is an example:
Just for some variation:I really like using the built in function map when applying logic to all items in a list. Just makes for a single line rather then looping through. Performance wise not sure how it stacks up I've never dealt with lists large enough where this makes a difference so I prefer the one liner.Map function documentationMap takes a function as one parameter then a list or iteratable type as the second param and applies the function to all items in the list. I passed a lambda function declaration just to make it more concise.
