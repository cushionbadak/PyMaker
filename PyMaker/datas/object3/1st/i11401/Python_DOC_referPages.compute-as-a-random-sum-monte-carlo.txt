I need to estimate the value of pi by evaluating the sum 𝑆𝑁 = (1 / (𝑁 + 1)) ∑ 1/( 1 − 𝑥 𝑖2 )^ (1 / 2) where 𝑥𝑖 are uniformly distributed random numbers.The output is basically giving me this.TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
You're calling sum on the result of Pi. But Pi returns a number, not an iterable. Just remove the call to sum. sum takes an iterable (list, dictionary, tuple, etc) and adds all the values together. So when you pass it something it can't iterate over (like a floating point number), it can't sum anything, because there's no values to iterate over.
I'm pretty sure you want to be running the Pi function N times, not just once. For this you'll need a loop of some sort. Since you want to use the builtin sum, a generator expression would be very natural:This doesn't return anything too close to pi though. Maybe it's pi/2? I don't know how your formula is supposed to work well enough to spot the issue with the calculation.
You're actually sampling pi/2, and you don'rt really need the N in the Pi function. You should apply it at the end, after summationwill produce
