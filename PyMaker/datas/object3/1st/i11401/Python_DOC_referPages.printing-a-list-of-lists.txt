I'm learning about making List of Lists by designing a family tree.  Below is one way of doing it that I came up with but am having trouble printing the result.  For example:if A has 2 children, B & C...then B has 2 children, D & E...while C only has on child, F...I would want the result to print: [A, [B, [D, E]], [C, [F]]]Would appreciate any improvements in my code, advice on how to print the result as above, or print it in a graphical form.
You could use the __str__ method which is called by print() function:
It's a good idea to split the object creation from the input and output. Also, using setattr will make it more difficult to write the output.Here is a solution that allows you to create a FamilyTree with or without reading input from the user:Output
