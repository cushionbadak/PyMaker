Natural Text
I'm writing a Python script where a file path is returned as a string. The file path is something like C:\user\test\2016\1005\text.xml. When I tried to give this string to ET.parse(), it incorrectly treats the \20 and \10 portion of the path as special characters, and so the parsing fails.How can I handle such situations?
You either need to escape the backslashes in the strings:or viaand I would recommend to use the os.path module:Other threads with similar problems: e.g. here.
