Natural Text
I've got unicode strings (from an API query) that should have been encoded as regular ascii strings (as they already contain unicode representations). How can I change the encoding without actually changing the the characters being encoded?To wit:PS I realize \xc2\xba is actually for ordinal number and not the degree sign (\xc2\xb0) but that's what I got. 
What you have is not "unicode" is the byte sequence for the UTF-8 encoding of the string you want. You can retrieve the text by using the "latin-1" codec to transparently transport your byte sequence to a byte-string (from your unicode-string) andthem, decode it normally from UTF-8:Why the latin-1 codec is special and works in this case is described on the second paragraph from here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#encodings-and-unicodeWhen you've got some minutes to spare it would be useful to read this nice article on Unicode to know what are codecs, and what does text in unicode mean.
