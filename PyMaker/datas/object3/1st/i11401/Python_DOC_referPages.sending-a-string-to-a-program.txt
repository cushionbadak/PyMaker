I am trying to send a string from a program 1 to another program program 2, both in python 3e.g.I want to somehow send a string a to my second program so it will print out a:How do I do this?I am still a beginner programmer and would love it if you could help me.I need to be able to enter the string in 1.pyI need then be able to access the string that I entered from 2.py.I have to have them as two separate files.ANSWER:I found a way to solve this.
You have many way communicate between two or N python program, Ex:SocketDatabase - MySQL, Mongodb, SQL Server... etcor maybe you can try ZeroMQ
There are multiple ways to do that, you could use socket, file, pipe, shared-memory, message, ... to transfer a string from one process to another.As an example of using messages, ZeroMQ provides an easy messaging library to do that smarter, than with system (raw, low level) sockets:for more details look into http://zguide.zeromq.org/A HelloWorld server example:A HelloWorld client example:With files, you write a file with program A then poll on it with program B.

Most common way of two programs communicating together is through http, tcp or other protocol. The same way as your browser (one program) communicates with the web server (another program).You can send http request from one program and the second has to listen for that.If you want more info, look for SOA. It is a bit more complicated than that, so if you have any questions, ask.
I found the answer.
