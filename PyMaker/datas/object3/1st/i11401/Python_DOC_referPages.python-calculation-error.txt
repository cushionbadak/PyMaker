This question already has an answer here:python 3 long ints and multiplication                    2 answers                I am trying to implement an LCM finding algorithm. It needs to find LCM for very large numbers. LCM is found using the formula,where A and B are two inputs.Input: 226553150 1023473145So, LCM = (226553150 * 1023473145) / 5It should be, 46374212988031350.But python is finding this as 46374212988031352, which is obviously an error. How to solve this problem ?
You are using floating point math, because you used the / true division operator. Floating point can only approximate large numbers, and the difference you see is a result of that.Use // floor division instead:Floor division on integers never requires conversion to float, avoiding the precision issues.Alternatively, use the decimal module for higher-precision math with real numbers:This is slower than using float.
