I'm trying to implement fair queuing in my library that is based on asyncio.In some function, I have a statement like (assume socketX are tasks):Now I read the documentation for asyncio.wait many times but it does not contain the information I'm after. Mainly, I'd like to know if:socket1, socket2 and socket3 happened to be already ready when I issue the call. Is it guaranteed that done will contain them all or could it be that it returns only one (or two) ?In the second case, does the order of the tasks passed to wait() matter ?I'm trying to assert if I can just apply fair-queuing in the set of done tasks (by picking one and leaving the other tasks for later resolution) or if I also need to care about the order I pass the tasks in.The documentation is kinda silent about this. Any idea ?
This is only taken according to the source code of Python 3.5.If the future is done before calling wait, they will all be placed in the done set:
