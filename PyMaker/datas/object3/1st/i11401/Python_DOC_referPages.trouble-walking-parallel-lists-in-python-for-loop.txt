I'm trying to write code that draws each rectangles represented by the length-width pairs in the list sides at the x-y co-ordinates contained at the same index in the list coords. Where the variable coords contains sub-lists of size 2, with each of these values representing an x and a y co-ordinate.And the variable sides also contains sub-lists of size 2, with each of these values representing the length then the width of a rectangle.I already wrote a function called draw_rectangle which takes as its parameters two integers representing the length then the width of a rectangle.Having said that now I'm confused to make a for loop.This is what I came out with and doesn't seem to workor do I have to go Any suggestions? Thank you
This seems like a problem for enumerate() and structure assignment:
I would prefer to see this handled with a zip:In general, python style prefers to avoid looping over indices in favor of looping over contents. The zip function is a nice way to achieve this, by creating a list of tuples. I am left with a concern about the parallel list pattern, which is in general fragile and prone to breakage, and would prefer to see a data structure representing each object to be drawn, to avoid the danger of location and dimension coming out of sync.
