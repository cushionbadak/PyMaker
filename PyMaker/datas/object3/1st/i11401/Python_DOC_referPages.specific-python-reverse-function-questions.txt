This is a python function, which is to flip each element entered, backward. I have learned indexing, but to_flip[counter] is like nothing I seen. What purpose does to_flip[counter] serve, in flipping each element? Does it have a name for this? And doesn't counter serve to add each number given, and to come out with a sum? Why is it needed here? And are there any other ways of doing reverse like this, for a beginner. Thank you.
The to_flip line is flipping whatever is in that element. For example if you ran it on just one list:flipped_list would now be [5,4,3,2,1]. The [::-1] is a neat little shorthand for flipping any list. For your code, counter is keeping track of what element you are in in to_flip. You could also keep track by using enumerate, which keeps count of what element you are at, on the list too:
