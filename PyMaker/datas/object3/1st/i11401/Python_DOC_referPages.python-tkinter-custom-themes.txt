DescriptionI want to make a GUI using Tkinter / ttk with python, the reason is because I want to learn to style GUI's. I have tried to find information about how to style the "Entry box" not the background but the actual "insert box" but I cant find any information about how to do this and the built in themes is quite well hidden because I cant find those either..Image demonstration:Default StyleHow I want itMy questionsIs this even possible and if so, how?And is there a way to access the default themes in order to learn from them?
The standard style applied to ttk.Entry simply doesn't take a fieldbackground option, which would be what changes the colour of the text entry field. The solution is this to create a new element that does respond to the option.
Yes, it is possible, you can make your default themes and assign the widgets these themes. What you're looking for is the Style option. I learnt pretty much everything I needed to know about styles from this :https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#tkinter.ttk.StyleHere's a small example that should give you the basic ideaThis gives a good description of how to use ttk.Style() aswell:http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/styles.html
