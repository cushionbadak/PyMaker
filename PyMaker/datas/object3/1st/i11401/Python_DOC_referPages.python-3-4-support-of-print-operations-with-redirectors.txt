Natural Text
I'm going through some examples from a text book. The source code below fails with the following Traceback:When I run this code under Python 2.7 it works as expected. Can someone please point me in the right direction. What has changed in the print function that prevents this from working in Python 3.4?
In Python 3, print() is a function and not a keyword. So, if you want to redirect the output, you have to set the optional parameter file (default value is sys.stdout), like this:Take a look at the Print is a function paragraph, from the official documentation about what changed in Python 3.
