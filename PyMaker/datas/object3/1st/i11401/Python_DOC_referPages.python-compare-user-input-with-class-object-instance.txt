I'm creating a program, where people will guess the identity of someone, based on user input and predefined values.class myPeople(object):name=input("What is your name?\n")age=input("What is your age?\n")gender=input("What is your gender?\n")smith = myPeople(name="smith", age="104", gender="female")john = myPeople(name="john", age="14", gender="male") I would like to compare the user input with values that are preassigned to "smith" and "john". I thought that I could do:if smith.myPeople is True:elif john.myPeople is True:I'm getting the error AttributeError: type object 'myPeople' has no attribute 'smith'Also, I'm not sure, if the statement "is True" will work. Thanks in advance for your help.
You can customize your class by adding a comparison method, in this case __eq__.  Then you can just check to see if class instances are equal.  Use the user's responses to create another instance then compare.
