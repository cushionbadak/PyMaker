I want to use Type Hints in my Python program. How can I create Type Hints for complex data structures like lists with stringsa generator returning integers?Example
Use the typing module; it contains generics, type objects you can use to specify containers with constraints on their contents:Depending on how you design your code and how you want to use the return value of names(), you could also use the types.Sequence and types.MutableSequence types here, depending on wether or not you expect to be able to mutate the result.A generator is a specific type of iterator, so typing.Iterator is appropriate here. If your generator also accepts send() values and uses return to set a StopIteration value, you can use the typing.Generator object too:If you are new to type hinting, then PEP 483 â€“ The Theory of Type Hints may be helpful.
