Tried to store twitter stream data into MongoDB. The code is pretty much a copy from http://stats.seandolinar.com/collecting-twitter-data-storing-tweets-in-mongodb/  but always show an error. If I tried to print out the data, it shown json file continuously grow, but it seems never ends in spite of the time limit for the while loop.!
You are using the wrong method to insert the document into your collection. In your case, json.loads returns a dictionary not a list thus you need to use the insert_one method to insert that single document because insert_many only insert an iterable of documents.
