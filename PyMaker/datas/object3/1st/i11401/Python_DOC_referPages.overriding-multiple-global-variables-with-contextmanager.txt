Is there a utility/pattern to override multiple global variables within a context in Python 2.7? IE something like
Yes, but the fact that it's unittest.mock.patch should tell you something about what this is intended to be used for:If you want to patch several things in the same call, you can use unittest.mock.patch.multiple:Just make sure none of the things you want to patch happen to collide with the argument names of that function (target, spec, create, spec_set, autospec, or new_callable). If they do, fall back to the regular patch.If you want to do this for non-unit-testing purposes, you may want to reconsider your design.If you're on Python 2 and unittest.mock isn't in the standard library, you can download the backport from PyPI. This one is called mock rather than unittest.mock.
