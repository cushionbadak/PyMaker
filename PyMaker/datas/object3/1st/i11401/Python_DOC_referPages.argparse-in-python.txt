I came across this Python script:The points I didn't get are:How do we use those arguments in the command line: "-t", "--trainingSet", help="Path to Training Set", required="True"?What does args mean? How was the training path retrieved?Thanks.
Create a parser object:add an argument definition to the parser (it creates an Action object, though you don't need to worry about that here).Tell the parser to parse the commandline arguments that are available in sys.argv.  This a list of strings created by the commandline shell (bash or dos).args is a argparse.Namespace object.  It is a simple object class.  vars converts it to a dictionaryThis is ordinary dictionary accessyou can get the same thing from the namespaceI'd recommend looking at argsWith this parser definition, a commandline like will end up setting train_path to the respective string value. It is up to the rest of your code to use that value.The help parameter will show up in the help message, such as when you doThe required parameter means that the parser will raise an error if you don't provide this argument, e.g.
