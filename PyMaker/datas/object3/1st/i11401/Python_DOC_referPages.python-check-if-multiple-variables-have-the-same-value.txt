I have a set of three variables x, y, z and I want to check if they all share the same value. In my case, the value will either by 1 or 0, but I only need to know if they are all the same. Currently I'm usingLooking for the answer I've found:However, this operates asIs it possible to check if 1 is in each: x, y, and z? Better yet, is there a more concise way of checking simply if x, y, and z are the same value?(if it matters, I use python 3)
If you have an arbitrary sequence, use the all() function with a generator expression:otherwise, just use == on all three variables:If you only needed to know if they are all the same value (regardless of what value that is), use:or
To check if they are all the same (either 1 or 2):The parentheses are optional, but I find it improves readability
How about this?
You could use something similar to what you have:This allows for any number of variables.  For example:Note: Creating a set means that each variable needs to be hashed and the hashed values need to be stored, but all() with a generator expression is short-circuiting and keeps track of only two values at a time.  Therefore, besides its readability, the generator expression is more efficient.
Another way:

Better yet, is there a more concise way of checking simply if x, y, and z are the same value?Sure:which is equivalent toIf you have an arbitrary (nonzero) number of values to compare:
