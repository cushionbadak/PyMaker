This question already has an answer here:Dictionaries: How to keep keys/values in same order as declared?                    12 answers                I have simple list of data which looks like:When I print it I get:{100152385: 66, 100152290: 218, 100152307: 424, 100152405: 130,  100152547: 55, 100152395: 13, 100152365: 50, 100152446: 26}As you cant see first goes 100152385: 66 which in list is third.If I define keys as string I get other order like this:{'100152290': 218, '100152307': 424, '100152385': 66, '100152446': 26,  '100152405': 130, '100152395': 13, '100152365': 50, '100152547': 55}So I need to define dict so that it would be in the order I need?
Python dicts are unordered by their own nature. To get the feature you want use an OrderedDict.
