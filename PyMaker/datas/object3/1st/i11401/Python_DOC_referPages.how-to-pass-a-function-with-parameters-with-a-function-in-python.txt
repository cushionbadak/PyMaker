Consider this:I am getting:I am assuming the func() is not passing parameters and it causes the error. To clarify, the desire result is to be able to call func() with any number of parameters added.Does anyone know what is the proper way to do it? Any advice would be thankful!
Your function2 recieves func=None because that's the (default) return value of nestedfunc(), which is called with the parameter "is called". You could use functools.partial to 'freeze' some function's arguments:
nestedfunc("is called") is the value returned by the function call: None. You should pass nestedfunc to function2 without calling it first.If you want to pass a parameter to nestedfunc, pass it to function2 first.
