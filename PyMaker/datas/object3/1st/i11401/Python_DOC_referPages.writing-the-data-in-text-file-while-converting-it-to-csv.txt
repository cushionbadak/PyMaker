Natural Text
I am very new with python. I have a .txt file and want to convert it to a .csv file with the format I was told but could not manage to accomplish. a hand can be useful for it. I am going to explain it with screenshots.I have a txt file with the name of bip.txt. and the data inside of it is like thisI want to convert it to csv like this csv fileSo far, what I could do is only writing all the data from text file with this code:So is there a solution to convert it to a csv file in the format I desire? I hope I have explained it clearly.
There's no need to use the glob module if you only have one file and you already know its name. You can just open it. It would have been helpful to quote your data as text, since as an image someone wanting to help you can't just copy and paste your input data.For each entry in the input file you will have to read multiple lines to collect together the information you need to create an entry in the output file.One way is to loop over the lines of input until you find one that begins with "test:", then get the next line in the file using next() to create the entry:The following code will produce the split you need - creating the csv file can be done with the standard library module, and is left as an exercise. I used a different file name, as you can see.
You do not use the glob function to open a file, it searches for file names matching a pattern. you could open up the file bip.txt then read each line and put the value into an array then when all of the values have been found join them with a new line and a comma and write to a csv file, like this:
