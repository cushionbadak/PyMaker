I use asyncio for connecting with other peers in a bittorrent client im working on. When some peer cant be connected, the program crashes with ConnectionRefusedError and TimeoutError exceptions. Is it normal that some peers cant be connected or theres something wrong with my code. If that's normal, how should i handle the exceptions? I've tried to put try except around loop.create_connection() but that didnt do anything.Here's my code:Here's the output:I'm very new to asyncio and not sure if i'm doing it the right way.Thanks.
asyncio.Task just creates task and return immediately. You should await for created task to get it's result (including case when it raises exception). See this answer for details.I would advice you to use asyncio.ensure_future instead of asyncio.TaskIf you want to execute some coroutines parallel asyncio.gather is common way to do it. Tasks usually need when you want to start some coroutine "in background".Based on all of it code may look some way like this (I didn't test it):
