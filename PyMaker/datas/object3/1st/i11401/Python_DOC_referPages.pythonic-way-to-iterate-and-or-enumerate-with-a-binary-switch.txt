I'm working with a few things at the moment where there will be 2n possible outcomes that I need to iterate over in a binary manner. I'd like some kind of binary enumeration or similar that I could use to switch on and off operators and/or functions in each iteration.An example where the sign (or +/- operator) is changing over 23=8 iterations may be:Sort of a binary tree, but as a code structure as opposed to a data structure?Is there a helpful builtin?
Just produce the product of binary flags; if you need to switch 3 different things, generate the product of (False, True) three times:You can also produce the product of operators; your sample could use operator module functions:Demo:
As a Numpythonic approach you can create all products of [1, -1] with length 3, then multiply it with your variables then sum the result. In Numpy you can do it with following two steps:Demo:
