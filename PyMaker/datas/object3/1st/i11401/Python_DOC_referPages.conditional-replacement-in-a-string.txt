Natural Text
I have two strings s1 and s2I want to replace all character in s1 which do not appear in s2 to a special character, let's say "+"For instance,
You can use str.join along with a ternary operatorThe logic here is that you loop through the string to check if each of the character is present in the other string. If it is not present then you replace it with +.
