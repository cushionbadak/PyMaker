I am currently doing the Logistic Regression in machine learning for python. This is the code i write.This is the output of the codeThere is no error, but my question is the characters after RM in the output should be 'B' or an other characters. I wonder if it's because I do the code wrongly or is just a format problem with the numpy array. Because I basically just started with Python today, sorry if I just made a stupid mistake.
If I am not mistaken the 'u' is just notation that the string is a unicode string. I am not sure how you are running your code, but when i test in an ipython notebook or in a windows command prompt I get the following output:This is perhaps because I ran this in python 3.5 whereas it appears you are still using python < 3.0. It's not that your answer is wrong, you are just getting info about the format of the data. For other questions on this subject see here and here. The python how-to on unicode may also be helpful. 
I think it will be more easily, when you post some data from Ron95_Price_Class.xlsxRight now I see, that you are not delete target variable (y), from train data. You can do it by  
The Predict method as mentioned in the scikit-learn documentation, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.predict, mentions the return of the predict method is array, shape = [n_samples]. So for you the shape is 1x1 array. To get the desired output you ca try "price[0]".
