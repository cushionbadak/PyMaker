I have this code snippet where it returns the index of the lowest integer in a list points visited and pathValue are all lists and contains the following:However when I compile the program it always points an error to this lineand says What is wrong with my code?
Not all values in pathValue are integers. You have at least one string object in that list.If there are only integers in pathValue, your expression works:But add a string, and you get your specific error:Make absolutely sure your pathValue list only contains integers.Note that I'd use the enumerate() function and a operator.itemgetter() object here instead of range() and pathValue.__getitem__:This too retrieves the index of the minimum value, provided there are only integers in the input list, of course.
