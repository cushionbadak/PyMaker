I am struggling to find the best way to convert the date input given by the user as mm/dd/yyyy to 3 variables. I am unable to split this because I receive an error since it is a 'float'.what do I need to add to this to make sure it doesn't evaluate the date with division?I want the input date given as mm/dd/yyyy, and then a way to convert this to 3 variables as m=month d=day y=yearWhat's the best way to do this?
Try str.split:
I wrote this following piece of code and it works perfectly fine.Like Jessica Smith has already pointed it out, date=3/2/2016 evaluates expressions and divides the numbers. It has to be of string string type to be split.
The error "'float' object has no attribute 'split'" suggests that type(date) == float in your example that implies that you are trying to run Python 3 code using Python 2 interpreter where input() evaluates its input as a Python expression instead of returning it as a string.To get the date as a string on Python 2, use raw_input() instead of input():To make it work on both Python 2 and 3, add at the top of your script:If you need the old Python 2 input() behavior; you could call eval() explicitly.To validate the input date, you could use datetime.strptime() and catch ValueError:.strptime() guarantees that the input date is valid otherwise ValueError is raised. On success, d.year, d.month, d.day work as expected.Putting it all together (not tested):See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response.You could use .split('/') instead of .strptime() if you must:It doesn't validate whether the values form a valid date in the Gregorian calendar.
Try:Output:
