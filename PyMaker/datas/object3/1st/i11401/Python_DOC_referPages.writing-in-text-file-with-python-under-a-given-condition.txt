Natural Text
I'm a newbie in python and I'm trying to write a given sentence in a text file using python:This is my file, and I want to write "T T T" in the lines after "Direct"if the third column is higher than a given value: For example: If the third column "x" has a value higher than 1.00, it will receive "T T T" after the column, otherwise will receive "F F F".Any suggestion to where can I start?Thank you!
Might want to look at something like this.  It reads from one file and writes to another.  It only starts examining the contents after 'Direct' is encountered.  It should get you started on how to proceed. It's probably only a starting place for solving your full problem but should give you some threads to pull on.
