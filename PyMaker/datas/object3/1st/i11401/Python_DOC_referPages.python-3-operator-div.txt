I have a slight problem with randomly generated operators in Python 3.So you see, I have the operator functions add, sub and mul.But when I try and add the div operator I get an alert saying that operator has no attribute 'div'.I've never actually tried using random operators in Python before, so this might sound a foolish question, but it's one which is giving me hell in debugging.
There is no operator.div in Python 3, no; that only existed in Python 2.There is a operator.truediv() function instead, as well as a operator.floordiv() function. The reason for this division (no pun intended) is that the old Python 2 / operator would return an integer if both operands are integers, a float otherwise, while these two functions always return the same type, regardless of the type of inputs.
