I have the probability density functions func1 and func2 (including the support of each) of two random variables. Now I need the probability density function of the sum of these both random variables, which I create via:The problem with that is the huge redundancy. Many values have to be calculated more than once. So I tried to cache but problems appeared due to the dynamically generated functions without unique names.What is a better approach to cache such dynamically generated functions?
Could you use functools.lru_cache?  https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache.  It would be all in memory, so you would lose values between restarts of your program, but the cache would warm up.from functools import lru_cachelru_cache as a decoratorlru_cache as a function
