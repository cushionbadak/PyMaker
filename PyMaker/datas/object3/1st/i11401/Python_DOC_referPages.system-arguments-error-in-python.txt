I have recently started using sys.argv in python and I am trying the following thing:This takes the first three arguments after the script. I want to add an error message which states what arguments a user should provide and what it means. Something like the following:Script Aborted: Following arguments required:  1. Input Filename  2. Max. Lines to be read  3. Max. time step.
You can use len(sys.argv) to check and give the message of course. But a more pythonic way to do this is using try blockFinally, I would suggest you to use a more comprehensive module like optparse or Click.
