This question already has an answer here:How do I check (at runtime) if one class is a subclass of another?                    8 answers                I'm writing a context manager allowing to catch a certain type of exception.This manager works fine when built-in exception raises but fails with such usage:In this example the user-defined excepton raises, but this exception is equivalent to TypeError and I want it to be processed by context manager as TypeError.I checked that `isinstance(MyTypeError(), TypeError) == True' and want to work in the same way (to consider inheritance). Is there any solution?
Either check the exception itself (exc_val) as you've done with isinstance(), or use issubclass():
