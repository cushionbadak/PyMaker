What's the difference between aiohttp's websocket support (i.e. WebSocketResponse) and websockets   (both offer an async support)? Can they be mixed?
They are two different libraries maintained by different people. Both are built on top of asyncio.websockets aims to be a simple easy to use library to implement websockets clients and servers and is maintained mostly by a single developer. On the other hand, aiohttp is a quite bigger library maintained by bigger team, offering not only websockets but, as the name suggests, HTTP functionality as well. Some of its functionality overlaps that of flask and requests, but in a async fashion.In terms of size, websockets is about 4k LOC, while aiohttp is about 40k LOC. If you just need a simple and easy to use websockets client, go for websockets. If you are already using aiohttp and need websockets functionality, use what aiohttp has to offer. I don't see a point in mixing them.
Noting a detail that may force the choice for folks that need to support the system Python in Debian 8: aiohttp sets its minimum supported version at Python 3.5.3 (which is the system Python version in Debian 9).While the aiohttp folks have good reasons for making that decision, the smaller feature set in websockets allows that project to maintain support for the Python 3.4.x system Python in Debian 8, albeit with some adaptation of your own application code to be Python 3.4 compatible: https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#python-lt-36
