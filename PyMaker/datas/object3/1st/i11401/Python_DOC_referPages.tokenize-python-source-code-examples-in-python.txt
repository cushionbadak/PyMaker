Looking to gain understanding in Python'stokenize module. I am interested in calling the tokenize.tokenize method on a given python source file (like the one below) and get its tokenized output with the 5-tuple as mentioned in the docs.Unfortunately, the example in the docs is not clear enough given my inexperience in Python to make it work. Also, I could not find any related useful example code online.Any simple workable code examples will be greatly appreciated.Also, if you know of useful online material with examples/explanations of the tokenize module and its methods that would be great.
tokenize.tokenize is a generator, and it will yield multiple 5-tuples corresponding to each token in the source.
