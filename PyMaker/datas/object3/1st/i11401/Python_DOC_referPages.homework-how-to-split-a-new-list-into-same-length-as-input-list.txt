For this assignment we were directed to write a program that will take two lists of lists and add the corresponding values together. For example, addTables([[1,8],[2,7],[3,6],[4,5]],[[9,16],[10,15],[11,14],[12,13]]) should return [[10, 24], [12, 22], [14, 20], [16, 18]]. My code is: This gives me all the correct values, but displays them as one list [10, 24, 12, 22, 14, 20, 16, 18]. How can I preserve the structure of the original list?
To make your code work, create intermediate lists and append them:Or, you can also use zip():
