just asked a question about multiplying matrices and that can be found here, I have one more question though about multiplying matrices.  Say I have the following matrices:How could I get a result like this:...so that each element is basically being multiplied by the single corresponding element of the other array. Does anyone know how to do that?Thanks guys!
You could express the element-wise product (and matrix product) using list comprehensions, zip, and the * argument-unpacking operator:
The numpy package provides an array object that can do both element-wise and matrix-wise calculations:This outputs:Numpy is available using pip install numpy or by using one of the numerical python distributions such as anaconda or pythonxy.
Since those lists are equal, you can just multiply it with itself. Here is a slightly verbose way to iterate the matrix and store the result in a new one.Ouput
