Let's say I have a list of:5 10 10 20 50 50 20(there are 4 distinguish numbers).I want to convert them to:0 1 1 2 3 3 2(then convert back to the original form).There are tons of ways to do that, but I am not sure what is the best and Pythonic way?(a way is to generate a set, convert the set to a list, sort the list, then generate output by the sorted list, but I think it is not the best one)
The suggested answer by Delgan is O(n^2) due to the nested loops in back. This solution is O(n).An alternative solution is as follows:
I think this is a good problem for make use of collections.defaultdict() and itertools.count() methods.
