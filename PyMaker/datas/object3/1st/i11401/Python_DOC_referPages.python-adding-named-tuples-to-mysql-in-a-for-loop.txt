So I have the following namedtuple, containing multiple items:I would like to add those items to MySQL database, to the table called place_id, this is what I've got so far:And I don't know where to go from there.I would like to add the items via for loop (or executemany, but I am not that familiar with it). I am already connected to the database via MySQLdb module.Thank you for your help.
Assuming item really is a namedtuple and deducing from the order of arguments that it's declared likethere's no need to use named placeholders in your query, unless you really want to. Just use the normal sequence formatting style that works with tuples:To use the named placeholder version you could convert the list of items to a sequence of OrderedDicts (a sequence of mappings) with namedtuple._asdict, but there's really no need for this:
Using 'named' style parameter markers (such as '%(company)s') in the query requires that you pass a mapping with the necessary keys to cursor.execute(). Since you pass it a tuple, you need to change the markers accordingly (e.g. use the 'format' style):or using cursor.executemany():
