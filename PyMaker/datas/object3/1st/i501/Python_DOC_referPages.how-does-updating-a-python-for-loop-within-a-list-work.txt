In Michael Nielsen's tutorial on neural networks he has the following code:I understand what tuples and lists are and I understand what the zip function is doing but I don't understand how the variables nb, dnb, nw, and dnw are updated on these 2 lines of code:Can anyone help explain the magic going on in these 2 lines?
These 2 lines are typical examples of Python list comprehensions.In essence, for your first list:this means:Take the 1st pair from zip(nabla_b, delta_nabla_b); name them nb and dnbadd them (nb+dnb)make the result the 1st element of new list nabla_bGo to step one for the 2nd pair etc appending the results to nabla_b, until all pairs from zip(nabla_b, delta_nabla_b) have been exhaustedAs a simple example, the list comprehension below:is equivalent with the following for loop:See here for more examples and a quick introduction.
The zip function sticks the two lists together element by element, so that if you gave it:zip(a, b) would return:(each element being a tuple)You can unpack elements of lists that are tuples (or lists) using the a comma between each variable in the element tuple:This would print:So in your case, it's adding the two lists nabla_b and delta_nabla_b elementwise, so you get one list with each element being the sum of the corresponding elements in the zipped lists.It might look a bit strange because the for loop is all on one line, but this is called a "list comprehension". Simple list comprehensions read like English.
