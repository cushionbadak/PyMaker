I have a dictionary that looks like this:I want to:1) check if a variable (direction) exists at all in any of the lists in the dictionary2) get the dictionary key of the list the value is in. How could this be done?
I am going to take a stab in the dark and assume you are trying to take an input and return a direction - that's why you have 4 different formats for a direction.If you flip your dictionary around it becomes useful:gives you:now you just put any input you're 'searching for' into your dictionary:
If you are only interested in knowing whether the variable exists:
you can use in to check if a variable exists in a list, and for k,v in dict.items() to iterate the dictionary:In this iteration, k will store all the keys of your dictionary (the strings), and v will store the relative value (the lists)or, as suggested by @Ev. Kounis in the comment, you can use list comprehension:which is more elegant, but you need to have a look on how list comprehension works.you can also see the usage of any, which returns True if any value in an iterable is true
