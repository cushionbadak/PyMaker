This question already has an answer here:What's the difference between str.isdigit, isnumeric and isdecimal in python?                    4 answers                I am using Python 3.6.3 and I encounter a weird behavior from int() and isdigit() with the following code: I understand the bug and I know that I can skip the error with try catch. My question is that if isdigit() return true then the char\string should be cast without error or isdigit() should return false. Otherwise said int() and isdigit() should be coherent.
This is exactly as documented:str.isdigit() Return true if all characters in the string are digits  and there is at least one character, false otherwise. Digits include  decimal characters and digits that need special handling, such as the  compatibility superscript digits. This covers digits which cannot be  used to form numbers in base 10, like the Kharosthi numbers. Formally,  a digit is a character that has the property value Numeric_Type=Digit  or Numeric_Type=Decimal.
