I don't understand what is happening on line 2, with the "-1, 0 , -1". Why does it need to do this, and what does the zero represent?I have run the code, when I removed the "-1, 0, -1" part and it didn't sort the list. I don't understand why it is such a crucial part of code
That has nothing to do with the algorithm. range has 3 argumentsfromtostepIn this case, this meansstart from the last element (index=N-1)continue until the second (index=0)step=-1 (to go backwards)
Those are arguments to range(start, stop, sep)  (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range)In your case you create a range that starts with the length of your list -1 (len(alist)-1), and count to 0, by taking steps of -1.
As comments suggest, if you'd googled the docs for range, you might have worked things out. Your line:Means the range starts at the end of the list (which is the length, minus 1, since lists are 0 indexed), and ends at 1 (one before 0), with steps of -1 (backwards).
