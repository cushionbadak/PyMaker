I have a function that takes a tuple of different lengths as an argument:When I annotate function like mentioned above, I get these error messagesprocess_tuple really works with tuples and I use them as immutable lists of variable length. I haven't found any consensus on this topic on the internet, so I wonder how should I annotate this kind of input. 
Variable length homogeneous tuple we can annotate using ... literal (aka Ellipsis) likeafter that errors should go away.From docsTo specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use literal  ellipsis, e.g. Tuple[int, ...]. A plain Tuple is equivalent to  Tuple[Any, ...], and in turn to tuple.
In addition to the Ellipsis answer as posted by Azat you could make it more explicit by using @typing.overload or typing.UnionOr with the Union:
