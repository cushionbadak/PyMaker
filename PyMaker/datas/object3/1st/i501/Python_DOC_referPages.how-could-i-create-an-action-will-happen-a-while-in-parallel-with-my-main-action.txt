I'm creating a little game where we can fight with characters. But, like in many game of fight turn per turn, I want create some action will occured a certain amout of time. For example, an action will change a stat for 3 turn or less/more. If someone can help me please.                                                       Thank you
Log of scheduled actionsWhat you seem to need (causing an effect that will happen after a certain number of turns) is a log of scheduled actions.One way to implement it is to keep a list of "active effects".For a crude example,(you might want to use a class instead and specify the effect as a function, but this should illustrate the general concept).
