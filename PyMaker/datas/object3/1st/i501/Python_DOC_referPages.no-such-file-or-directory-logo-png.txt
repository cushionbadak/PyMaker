I am running Python 3.7.0When I run my Python code from my C drive -> In my C drive, I have a folder with the py code, the word document, and the logo. The three items are located in the same folder.Summary:1-When I run the code from my computer. It runs perfectly. 2-When I run the code from an Application (This Application runs locally from my computer) pointing to the path where my python code is stored. The code starts to run perfectly except when the code reaches this line doc.add_picture('logo.PNG').  I receive the following exception:File "C:\Program Files  (x86)\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\pythin_docx-0.8.7-py3.7.egg\docx\image\image.py",  line46, in from_file with open(path, 'rb') as f: FileNotFoundError:  [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'logo.PNG'I am trying to update a WORD document using Python directly from an application 
Instead of try:This will make sure the PNG is next to the python script.Also, don't use uppercase.
Use the complete path instead of just "logo.PNG"Ex. doc.add_picture('C:/Users/logo.PNG')
