I have created a get_config function in order to pass two parameters to my main function. I seem to be getting the following error when running my script : Am i passing the args the wrong way ? My script is as follows :
You're not actually calling the get_config function.Change the last line of your get_config function to return args.searchtype, args.Value.Then, change the lines in your main function to search_type, value = get_config().
