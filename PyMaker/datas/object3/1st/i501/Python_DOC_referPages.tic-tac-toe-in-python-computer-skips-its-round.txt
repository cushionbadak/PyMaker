im making a tic tac toe game where the computer has no ai, it just chooses a random position on the board and places the O letter in. i have made a function that checks if the space on the board is free. for the player, if the space on the board is not free the player is asked to make another input until the space they choose is free. it works finehowever, if the computer chooses randomly a position that is filled, it just doesnt add anything and its the players turn without the comp making a move on a free space. tl;dr: i want the compututer to make random inputs but verify the input is on an empty space, it doesn't do that, any help?
One simple method: Use random.shuffe(range(9)) instead of random.randint(0, 9)random.shuffle() will give you a randomly ordered listYou can check the randomly generated position in list one by one.
