I want to make a plot that shows the missclassification error versus de K neighbors using KNN.This the code i've built for that:The problem is at this line:This code seemed to be written in python 2. This was the original line:I added next() and iter() to solve this issue, as adviced by some usersin other threads similar to this. But i'm getting this error:I know why this error is happening, it should be iterting through a list but it's taking only the numbers. I think the problem comes from the filter() use at this line:How can i fix this code to run on python 3 and prevent this from happening??Thanks in advanceEDIT: The KNN version i'm using is not the one in sklearn, for those who would like to try this code. It comes from an anomaly detetction package called PYOD. Link hereYou can also try it with the original KNN from sklearn, but note you will need to remove the contamination parameter and maybe the distance parameter
The issue is that the code is defining neighbors as a generator and exhausting it in the first loop. Solution: use a list.Also your original syntax for getting the optimal was correct (no need for iter or next):
