I am trying to implement Bag of Words model, unable to get it right in below codeGetting this error - AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'
Your code contains a number of bugs and inefficiencies.Before you proceed, perhaps spend a moment to figure out how to get your program to tell when an assumption of yours might not be correct.  A good place to start is to add this after the assignment of ex:which prints out the type of the variable, and its value.  With that in place, you will easily spot the problemA slightly more advanced technique is to use logging, which allows you to easily disable the diagnostic messages when your code is working, and later enable them again if you want to make changes to your code and see that it still does what it's supposed to do.When you are done debugging, simply change the logging.basicConfig() to say level=logging.WARN, which will disable the display of all logging.debug() and logging.info() output.  See the documentation for details.Another useful debugging aid is assert:See the Python Wiki for some guidance.  Notice that assert statements can be disabled e.g. when you enable optimization of your Python code, so you should perhaps add explicit checks instead, or as well, in your code.Now, with that out of the way, here is a refactored version of your script with what I think you were trying to do.Of course, this is not using NLTK at all; the NLTK library contains a somewhat more advanced set of functions which already do some of this for you, starting with proper NLP tokenization etc, but does not actually contain a TF component. Perhaps start with Does NLTK have TF-IDF implemented? which has pointers to some existing implementations.
