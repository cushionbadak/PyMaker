Natural Text
I have a Python app that initiates from a main script, let's say a main.py. main.py (since my app is organized) references and imports other .py files within the same directory, that house other functions. As my app is continuously running, it imports such a function from another script, which is also supposed to run forever until it is explicitly cancelled. Thing is, how would I cancel that specific script, while leaving its affected variables untouched and the main script/larger app still running? I do not how I would go about targeting a specific function to stop its execution.
I use a kill function in my utils to kill any unneeded python process who's name I know. Note the following code was tested/works on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS machines.
not sure of the exact syntax as im not currently in a position to test but something like this is what i was thinking:-
