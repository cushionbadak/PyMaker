You need two underscores on each side of the __init__:This is because __init__ has a special meaning in Python, and by convention all such names start and end with two underscores.Also, in Python 3, there is no need to inherit from object, as all classes inherit from object automatically:There's no harm in keeping the explicit inheritance, though, and it's necessary if you want to support Python 2.
The problem is that parameter object doesn't have take any parameters, so there's no initialization for it. The parameter for your class should import another class and then initialize it in the init function. So just remove object as a parameter. Also add two underscores for init function so it looks like __init__.
