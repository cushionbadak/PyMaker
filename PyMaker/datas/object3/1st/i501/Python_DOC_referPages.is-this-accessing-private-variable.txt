This question already has an answer here:Does Python have “private” variables in classes?                    11 answers                How is a(object of F class) is printing the private variable?The output is 10. I know that the new assignment updated the value of a.__y(or y?). But, I'm not able to understand how y is accessed outside the class. I tried printing IDs of both, they are different. Can someone provide better explanation for this?
Python doesn't really have a concept of private variables. However, due to convention, python programmers prefix an underscore _ behind variables which they don't want accessed publicly. You can read more about this on the official documentation
