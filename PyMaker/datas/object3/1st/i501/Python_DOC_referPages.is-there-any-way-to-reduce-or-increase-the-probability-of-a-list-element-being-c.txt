Is there any way to reduce or increase the probability of a list element being chosen from a random choice in python.example:
Use random.choices instead of random.choice. This will allow you to specify weights for each element, but will require you to specify explicitly that you want to draw one element.Where probability_weights a list corresponding to the probability that each respective element will be selected from my_list.
