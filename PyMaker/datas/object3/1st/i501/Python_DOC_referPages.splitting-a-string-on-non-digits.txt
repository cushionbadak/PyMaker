Natural Text
I am trying to split a string on any char that is not a digit.I expect to get a list of integers in results0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7but instead I am getting a list with a single string element which matches the original string.
Well ... you are using str.split()  - which takes characters to split at - not regex. Your code would split on any '\D+' - string inside your text:You can use re.split() instead: to getUse data = list(map(int,results)) to convert to int.
Try this:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
