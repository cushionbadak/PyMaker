Natural Text
I'm writing a program for an internet module that reads a locally stored file, and writes it to a .txt file on my computer.I write the whole thing in one go. Problem is that when the product is implemented, it's only going to be possible to write 128 bytes at a time.
To write from a stream, the io module can help nicely here. I'm assuming you do not want to write bytes to a file, so we will use the StringIO object, which will treat a string object like a file handlerThe way this works is StringIO will read x number of bytes until it hits the end of the string, then it will return a null string, which will terminate the while loop.The cleaner way to do file opening and closing is using the with keyword:That way you don't need the explicit open and close commandsNOTE:This is assuming the readAll function does indeed read the entire file that you've given it. The only reads 128 bytes at a time might call that into question
