I'm writing an iterative solution for summation, and it seems to give the correct answer. But I'm told by my tutor that it's giving the wrong result for non-commutative combine operations. I went to google but I'm still unsure what exactly it means...  Here is the recursive code I wrote:This is the iterative version I wrote that gives the wrong results for non-commutative combine operations - Edit: accumulate_iter gives the wrong results when lambda x,y: x- y is used for combinerHoping if someone could provide a solution for this iterative version of accumulate
You accumulate_iter works fine when the combiner is commutative, but it gives different result when the combiner is non-commutative. That's because the recursive accumulate combine elements from the back to the front, but the iterative version combine them from the front to the back.So what we need to do is to make accumulate_iter combine from behind, and following is a rewritten accumulate_iter:
