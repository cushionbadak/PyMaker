I have a folder that has hundreds of files in it. I have a list of files that I know need to be deleted, so I am trying to write code to figure out: which files in this list are in this folder, and which are not. I am using the os module, and I know how to walk through all of the files in my folder using os.walk, but what I don't know is how to specify if the file is in my files_list.So I want to check if the file name in my files_list is in "folder" and if it is, then append it to bad_list, and if it isn't then append it to good_list. This is what I have so far:My question is, how do I put in the "is in files_list" part of this? I assume it should go after the if file in folder part, to say something like "is in files_list" but I can't figure out exactly how to write that in the code. I am new to Python, so apologies if this is very simple. 
Why not just try to delete the files you know that are under the folder and ignore any error
Use a set for membership testing.  Assuming folder is a list of file names with extensions (e.g.'foo.txt'), make folder a set then use set methods to differentiate the files.  Use os.path.join if you want to store complete paths in the good and bad lists.
