According to documentation, class serial.Serial() has the following methods. I would like to know when I should use close() and __del__()? Example, I have a GUI that created an instance of serial.Serial() with an assigned port. According to documentation, the assigned port will be opened when the instance of serial.Serial(). Now when I terminate my GUI, am I correct to say that __del__() (and not close()) is the most appropriate method to use to close the serial port?
AnalysisIf we look at pyserial source we see:Aha! Let's look into io.RawIOBase:Base class for raw binary I/O. It inherits IOBase. There is no public constructor.OK. Looking for __del__ in IOBase we see:__del__()  Prepare for object destruction. IOBase provides a default implementation of this method that calls the instanceâ€™s close() method.ConclusionYou can use close() or del or with-context - they all close the port.
