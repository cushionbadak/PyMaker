Assume I have a "constant" like:Now I would like to create an array that contains all entries of ITEMS, plus some more.Obviously, this is wrong:as it would put the whole array into the new array. But I want the new array to contain [ "all", "item1", "item2" ] in the end. Sure, I could somehow iterate the first array, but I am wondering if there is a more idiomatic one liner way to do this. Ideally, it should work for python2 and python3.
Just concatenate them with +:
If you're running Python 3.5+, the closest to your request is to use unpacking:In earlier versions list concatenation would do the same:If you simply need an iterable (i.e. not necessarily a list), using itertools.chain() may be more efficient:
In Python 3 you can do:This is quite flexible because it lets you combine several lists (or iterables in general) and elements in one line:
I'll suggest one more obvious approach: list.insert.It modifies ITEMS in-place.If you don't want to modify ITEMS, you can create a copy... although at that point, you'd rather one of the simpler options like iterable unpacking (*)...
You can also use itertools.chainit is useful when you want to add more than two lists together.
