I'm new to python, trying to get familiar with regular expressions, and string processing. I have written a regular expression by which numbers throughout a string are identified and extracted to an array. I want a parallel array which contains the positions of found terms.To clarify, suppose that the main string is: As I said, I can match nums = ['11', '20', '2019', '11', '20', '2019'] from the string above. Now, I want to form a synced array where stores the positions of each of these numbers. I'm using the following snippet:The positions array contains: positions = ['11 : 0', '20 : 44', '2019 : 49', '11 : 0', '20 : 44', '2019 : 49'] which obviously is not what I want. As there are duplicate numbers (like two 11's or 12's) in the list, text.find(num) returns the first occurrence of the term. So, when the program reaches the next occurrences of the token, it returns position of the first occurrence. Any thoughts on how to fix this?
You can use finditer which returns an iterator yielding match objects, and you can get the matched string and the start position from these matches:Or, if you want it formatted as in your question:
@Thierry's approach is surely pythonic and makes good use of regular expressions. A simpler approach is as follows:
