I have a jagged list in the below format,and I am expecting to group all the lists into one list which are in between the common item, in this case till the next occurance of item 'x01' should be group to one listIt may be simple or repeated question, but I am new to python coding so, please help to achieve the expected format
As pointed out in @PatrickArtner and @aws_apprentice's comments, your desired output does not exists in python: you can't have a list with a key (i.e. item_01, item_02...).Some similar objects let you store information with keys (see Dict), but you can't have many different values for the same key.also your input is invalid, since a comma is missing. Anyway it is possible to understand the general idea of what you want, and I can suggest you an approach:Create a Dictionary where the values are lists of lists:Output:{'item_03': [['x01', 'eeee', 'wefw', 'CDE'], ['x02', 'WEF', '083DV'], [], ['vrev', 'wef3', 'DV23']], 'item_02': [['x01', 'JJJJ', 'LLJU', '2342', '6346CS', 'qras'], ['x02', 'ASF', '10'], ['CAC', '131', 'CDF$#'], ['v32', 'rrte', 'dceg'], ['CS223', 'w34', '4234ye'], [], ['fsdf', 'rwrw', 'cacw', 'fcwe']], 'item_01': [['x01', 'xxxx', 'yyy', '01234355'], ['x02', 'fas', 'gere', '1434'], [], ['y05', 'KLM'], ['1231', 'Port', 'erwe'], [], ['Load', 'Music', 'XF32']]}As you can see, dictionary are not ordered: this means that item_01 could not be the first key of your dictionary.you can also retrieve the value of a specific key:Output:[['x01', 'xxxx', 'yyy', '01234355'], ['x02', 'fas', 'gere', '1434'], [], ['y05', 'KLM'], ['1231', 'Port', 'erwe'], [], ['Load', 'Music', 'XF32']]And many other operations: see the official documentation, and thousand of questions in SO, starting from How to use a Python dictionary?
