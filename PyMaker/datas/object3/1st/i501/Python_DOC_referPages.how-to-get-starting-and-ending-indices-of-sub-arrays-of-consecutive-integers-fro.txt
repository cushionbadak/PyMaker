I'm new to programming, I have a numpy array as (the first column is the indices)I need to get starting and ending indices of sub-arrays of consecutive integers, such as 0 and 3, 4 and 6 etc. I tried to do it like thisIt doesn't work, any suggestions?
Here's a one-line solution using itertools:How does this work?we apply itertools.filterfalse() over the sequence of indices range(len(rows)), i.e. 0..(len(rows)-1)filterfalse() will give the values where our chosen predicate function is false i.e. we want to see the indices where values are not consecutive. Hence we give it the function lambda i: (rows[i]-rows[i-1] == 1).We just need to tweak that so that it also evaluates to False at (i==0), hence we add the gating term: (i>0) and ...finally we wrap all this in list(...) to convert the iterator back into a list
To get first element of an array use: a[0], to get last element a[-1], where a is an array.
Here is one way. Note that I used Python lists to accumulate the desired indices and converted them to numpy arrays only at the end. I did this since numpy arrays are not designed to add new members--they work best with fixed sizes. There are more pythonic ways to do this, but I tried to keep with the knowledge that you showed in your question. One strange result of this code is that if rows is an empty array, start becomes array([0]) and end becomes array([-1]). My code works as expected for non-empty arrays.The result of that is
