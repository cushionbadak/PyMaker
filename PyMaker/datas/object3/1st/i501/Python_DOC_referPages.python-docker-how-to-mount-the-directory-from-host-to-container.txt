By getting the container objectChange your code according to the following:Here, the container object is the key. To get it, you have to pass detach param as True.Then it can print out the result of the executed command(s).By setting streamsAnother way to get the output is to set the stream parameter to True that returns a log generator instead of a string. Ignored if detach is true.docker-py is a wrapper around the docker engine api. Hence everything is executed inside the container and the result of the execution is available via REST.By using subprocessYou can use subprocess module if you want to execute something and get its output on the fly.Doc:docker-py: client.containers.run(...)Engine API: containersSubprocess: subprocess.run
