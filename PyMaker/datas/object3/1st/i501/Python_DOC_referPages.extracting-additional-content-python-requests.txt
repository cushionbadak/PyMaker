Natural Text
I am looking to extract generated content from a web page.I am using the library requests in python 3 to return the page as below The retrieve text seems to be just padding though. What tools should I be looking at to drill into the content and extract the info there ? 
Javascript needs to run on the page to provide much of the content. Using a method like selenium will allow this to run. Note that an additional wait condition is needed to ensure certain content is loaded. You can then use selenium syntax to extract info or dump the html from page_source into BeautifulSoup.
If the content is html, you could look into:https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.htmlhttps://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/If it's json, you would use:https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
