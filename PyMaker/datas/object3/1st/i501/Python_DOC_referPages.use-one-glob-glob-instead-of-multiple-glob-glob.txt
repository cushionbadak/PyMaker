This question already has an answer here:Python glob multiple filetypes                    26 answers                I have a folder containing files in different types. I only need to deal with image files (jpg, png, jpeg, JPG, ...). For that, I use glob.glob to get only files with 'jpg', 'png', ... extensions.The problem is that I have to use glob.glob many times (as much as the image extensions number) to get all the images:  Is there a way to use glob.glob in a more optimized form (something like glob.glob('path/*.{'jpg', 'png', 'jpeg', 'JPG'}) or is there a simpler function to use it instead of glob?
You cannot do complex wildcard globbing like glob.glob('*.{JPG, png..}) because,if you take a look at the source code you will see,And then if you find the source of iglob you will then see,Therefore, you can only do simple globbing using glob :)
