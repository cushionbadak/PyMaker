Natural Text
I have code below :This works fine, I need the IF to check for blank result values before loading to a list.I originally wrote this as :But I get an syntax error on the IF line.  Any ideas why the first code block works but the simpler second block fails?
In python, you simply use the word not for negation. <> is not a valid python syntax in python 3. (Updated) Your code:if result.text.rstrip().lstrip() <> '':Can be correctly written as if not result.text.rstrip().lstrip() == '':Or the much nicer:if result.text.rstrip().lstrip():Which relies on the truthiness of non empty strings. (Empty strings are Falsey, non emptry strings are True)Note that you can also just use the strip keyword instead of applying both lstrip and rstrip
