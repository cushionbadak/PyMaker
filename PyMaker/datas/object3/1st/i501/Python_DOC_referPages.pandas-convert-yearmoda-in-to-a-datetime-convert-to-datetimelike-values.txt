I have the following dataframe:How do I get the date to datetimelike. I want to get the average and standard deviation of the temp by year and by month. I know how to use group, it's just working with YEARMODA that is the problem
Here are two ways to solve this, take your pickEdit: The issue you are having is you are not providing the correct format to your pd.to_datetime expression hence it is failing.Edit 2: To get the std by month according to how you want to do it you would do it as such.
