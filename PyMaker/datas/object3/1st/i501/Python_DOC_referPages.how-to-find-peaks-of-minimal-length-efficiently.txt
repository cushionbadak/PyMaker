I have list/array of integers, call a subarray a peak if it goes up and then goes down. For example:contains which is a peak.Also considerwhich containswhich is a peak.The problemGiven an input list, I would like to find all the peaks contained in it of minimal length and report them. In the example above, [5,6,7,7,7,7,7,6] is also a peak but we remove the first element and it remains a peak so we don't report it.So for input list:we would returnI am having problems devising a nice algorithm for this. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
Using itertoolsHere is a short solution using itertools.groupby to detect peaks. The groups identifying peaks are then unpacked to yield the actual sequence.OutputUsing a loop (faster)The above solution is elegant but since three instances of groupby are created, the list is traversed three times.Here is a solution using a single traversal.OutputNotes on benchmarkUpon benchmarking with timeit, I noticed an increase in performance of about 20% for the solution using a loop. For short lists the overhead of groupby could bring that number up to 40%. The benchmark was done on Python 3.6.
