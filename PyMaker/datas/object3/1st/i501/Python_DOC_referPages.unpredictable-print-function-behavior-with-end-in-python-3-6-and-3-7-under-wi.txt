The following code works strangeWhen EOL == "":While run the code in Spyder console it works predictable: prints "Processing... ", then waits 5 seconds and prints " Done" in the same line.But in "cmd.exe" it waits 3 seconds, then prints "Processing... Done" simultaneously.When  EOL == "\n" it works the same way in Spyder console and cmd.exe: prints "Processing... ", then waits 5 seconds and prints " Done" in the new line.Is it feature or bug?My environment is:('64bit', 'WindowsPE')Windows-7-6.1.7601-SP1Python 3.7.2 (default, Feb 11 2019, 14:11:50) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)]Python 3.6.6 (default, Jun 28 2018, 11:21:07) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)]
It seems like Python is waiting for the current line ot be finished before printing it. This behaviour might vary in different versions or environments. In your case, you can add the flush parameter to force printing of the partial line.Whether output is buffered is usually determined by file, but if the flush keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.
