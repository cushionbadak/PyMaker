I am using matplotlib to generate a graphical animation of some data. The data has about 4 hours of collection time so I expect the animation to be about 4 hours. However, generating a smaller 60 second video takes approximately 15 minutes. Thus, the total estimated run time for generating the 4 hour video is 2.5 days. I assume I am doing something incredibly inefficient. How can I speed up the creation of an animation with matplotlib? create_graph.py
So I am answering my own question here so if you find this enjoy!Here are some factsmatplotlib creates high quality graphsmatplotlib generates graphs slowly relative to some other libraries like PyQWT (c++ bindings are used for speed)Generating a real time graph of 4 hours of data would take about 20 hours on my mac. To solve my issue, I created separate files and later joined them together. I used the multiprocessing library. generate_graphs.pymake_video_graph_mp4.py
