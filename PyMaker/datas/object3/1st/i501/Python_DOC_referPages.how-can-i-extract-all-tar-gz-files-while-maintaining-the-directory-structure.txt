I am working on a program to unzip/extract all .tar.gz files in a given folder. This folder can have several sub directories with multiple .tar.gz files as well. I am trying to extract all of them, while maintaining the folder structure, but running into some issues.My current code is below, extractall() seems to only extract to the current working directory, and I can't quite figure out how to maintain the directory structure.
