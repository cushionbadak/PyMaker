To create a virtual environment using virtualenv you can specify the Python release and point version like so:How can I achieve this using Python3's venv module (as in python3 -m venv .newvenv)? According to the documentation using venv is the recommended way to create virtual environments but I didn't see how I can choose a virtual environement with a specific Python version.
Run venv with whatever Python installation you want to use for the new virtual environment. For example, if you would run your Python 3.6 installation with python3.6, thenwould be how you create a Python 3.6 virtual environment.
