I'm making a volume control knob with Arduino(because they are hecking expensive to buy). To do so I need software that actually controls the volume. Now I know how to control the volume by calling amixer, but I want to do it the way keyboards do it, so that it shows the ubuntu volume OSD to indicate how much volume you set it to. Is it possible to do that with Ubuntu and Python?Thanks!
You can use xdotool to simulate media key presses:Otherwise you might want to try pactl tool if your system uses PulseAudio.
