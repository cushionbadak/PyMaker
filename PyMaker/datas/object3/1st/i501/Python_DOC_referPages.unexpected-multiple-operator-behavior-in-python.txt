This question already has an answer here:When checking if an item does not exist in a list, why doesn't this code work - if item in list == False: [duplicate]                    2 answers                I get that this is a bizarre way to test membership, and thatis the "correct" way.  What confuses me is that its behavior is different from bothandHave I missed something obvious?  (Tested in Python 2.7 and Python 3.4).To clarify, I understand the last three snippets.  I am asking about the behavior of the first snippet, and why it is different.
This is a chained comparison. You may have known that you can doin Python, and it's equivalent to (1 < 2) and (2 < 3). (Or maybe you didn't. Now you know.) Well, the same thing applies to in and ==.is equivalent toSince [1, 2, 3, 4] is not equal to False, the whole expression evaluates to False.
