The key in a Python dictionary should be unique. You have repeated the same key 'animal' thrice, and Python retained the value of the last1 animal key. From the official documentation,It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the  requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).1. Note that last can also be quite vague. Depending on the Python version you have, it might be consistent but that cannot be generally guaranteed.
This line:is exactly the same with this:When you add items to dict, if the key is already is in the dict, the value will be overridden.
As mentioned in @Vijay M's answer, the key in python dictionaries should be unique. I guess you are looking for a solution like this one:Note that the values and the keys are swapped.Hopefully, this helps.
