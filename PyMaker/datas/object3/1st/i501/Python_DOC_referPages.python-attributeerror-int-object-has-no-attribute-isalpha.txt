I'm looking to create a Caesar's Cipher function in python using client/server. The client sends a message with a key and the server encrypts it.Server Code:The line that keeps getting called out is line 6:' if l isalpha(): ' and gives me the error: AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'isalpha'.What does this error mean?Client Program:
In python 3, socket recv returns an immutable sequence of bytes. Each element has type int and is in the range [0, 255]. isalpha is a method of str and is not a method of int.If you'd like to treat the server response as a string, you can decode the bytes.
