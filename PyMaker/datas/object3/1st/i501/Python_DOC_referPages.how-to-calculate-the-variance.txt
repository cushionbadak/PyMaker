Hi the purpose of my code is to find average and variance in a list of lists. The constraint is: if in "linesort" there are two or more lists with the first two equal elements calculate the average of the third element adding the lists. My problem is to include the calculation of the variance as well as the average and to return a list containing [a, b, mean, variance].Thank you so much in advance.Desired Output:As for the variance I thought about this line of code but I can not make it work.
You can make the code simpler by first reorganising the data in a dict, with the tuples of the first two elements as keys and the corresponding values in a list.You can use a defaultdict to make that easier.Then, we just have to calculate the mean and variance for each of these lists.To answer your comment:If you want to omit the cases where you have only one value, just change the last part to:
