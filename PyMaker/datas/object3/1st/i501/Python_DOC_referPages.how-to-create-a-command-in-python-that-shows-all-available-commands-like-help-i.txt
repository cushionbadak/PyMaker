I am making a program witch is basically a terminal interface to a couple of math libraries that i made for school. the flow is an infinite loop in python terminal that gives you the option to call a function in the library, add values and get an answer. The thing is that i would like to make the code less shaky buy being able to call a help input and for that i would like to make a list of all available commands. Or even better show the different categories and make it possible to write sub helps like for example note: this is just some sudo scenario i just created but something like that would work.For now i have created if statements, but when porting in all my different libraries and categories is the the code quickly becomes repetitive.i also now have it that if you type "help" you get every single command just out of the blue.  I would just again remind you that i have not built this part yet.
Use the python module cmd.Here is a very basic exampleThe output of the program will look something like thisThe cmd module takes care of the infinite loop for you and will do a lot of the complex stuff like parsing the help documentation and providing a command history using the  and  arrow keys.
