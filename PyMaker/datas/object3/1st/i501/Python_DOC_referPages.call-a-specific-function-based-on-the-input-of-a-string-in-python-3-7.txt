I am trying to call a function based on user input from the user. For example, if the user inputs "P" into the calculator, then 70 points would be added to the "Points" variable and if the user inputs "M" into the calculator, then 80 points would be added to the "Points" variable, etc. And when all of the various inputs are "P" and "M" and "D" then a function will be called displaying the total amount of points that the user has achieved. I tried doing this myself in the code snippet below using what I know so far, sadly I ran into some errors. I explored the solutions to this issue, but the majority of what I found either was not clear enough to me or was not the answer I was looking for.
Here is a quick stab at a solution that uses loops and the list and dict data structures recommended above to keep the code DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself"). It also uses simple functions to break up the code and make it more readable, and performs validation on the input by checking it against the dict.Note that since you didn't include in your original example how the pass/fail is determined, I have assumed it is based on an arbitrary threshold of 1000 total points. You can change this to the actual method/threshold.
