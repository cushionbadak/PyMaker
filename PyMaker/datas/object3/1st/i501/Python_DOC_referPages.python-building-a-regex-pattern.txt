I'm working with this code and I'm having a hard time finding the correct pattern for this. I can achieve this by altering doing re.sub but I want to match without using re.sub if possible.From var I want to get only 11111. Like my code:From var I want to get the 22222 before the "i" like this:How do I match these 2 patterns? For example, I'm putting different output to variable which will be matched by the patterns?a. 1st possible output is:b. What pattern should I use to match the XXXX and instance that output variable appears like this and I want to get only the No entries. What regex pattern should I use?Thanks

While it is not completely clear what you are trying to match, I am giving it a shot.If you are just trying to get the second and last element, then this can be done without regular expressions.Alternatively, if you really want to use regular expressions or are looking for the number after 77777 a regular expression like this would work:
