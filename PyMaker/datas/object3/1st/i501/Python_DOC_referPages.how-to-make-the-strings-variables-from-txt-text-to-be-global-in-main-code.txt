I'm trying to make Login/Register system. The only problem is now, How could I access the Variables and String globally in Main code? I know that defining them, is not very good idea. But i have tried to do that, and I do get error with variable, when i did this:And tried to use here:I do get this in the terminal.My whole Code:My question would be how to use these functions as global, that I can use them without the defining?Password, Username, Ballance, Regtime, Role, Ban.
You are trying to declare global variables with the same name as your functions. This is why you get the output <function Ballance at 0x7f6f0662bc80> - you are printing the function called Ballance.You need to rename the global variables to something else, or better yet, use a class to collect the functions as methods, with attributes instead of global variables. You could try something like the following:You would use this class like this:You can add the code to initialise the attributes in the __init__ method (either with a default value like 0.00, or by prompting the user with input()). Then as well as get_ methods, you can add methods to mutate the state, like this:It sounds like you would benefit a lot from a good tutorial on Python classes, or about object-oriented programming in general. You should make sure you understand what self and the __init__ method do above.
