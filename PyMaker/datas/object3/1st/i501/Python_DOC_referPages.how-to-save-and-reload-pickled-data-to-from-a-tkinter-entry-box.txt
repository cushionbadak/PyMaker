Natural Text
I am looking for a way to save the data that was typed into an Entry box on my Tkinter GUI and then immediately load that data back into the Entry box when the program is opened after it has been closed. I have done some research and found that the Pickle module is the best way to do this kind of stuff. Here is my code so far:Essentially my code just saves the data into a .dat file after the save button is clicked. How would I load the same data so if I typed "test" and closed the program and then opened it it would still say "test"? This probably the code to load the data, but I do not know how to incorporate it here: 
First, the code you provided has a syntax error. It's text = pickle.load(open("savedtext.dat", "rb")) and not text = pickle.load(open("savedtext.dat"), "rb"))If you want to insert text in your Entry widget, you can use entry1.insert("end", text). It will insert the string in text at the end of what is written in your Entry widget. You can open the file, if it exists, and then, after you create your Entry widget you check if there is something to insert and then, if so, insert it.EDIT: As @martineau said, we should avoid open a file without closing it after an interaction. You could use something like the code below to read the file content and then insert it in your widget.
This could be done using pickle like this:I added a Clear and Load Button along with similarly named functions to make things easier to use (and test).Note: A statement like the btn = Button(root, text="save", command=save).pack() you have in your code would result in btn being assigned the value None because the pack() doesn't return anything. That caused no harm, but only because btn wasn't ever referenced again, but in general you will need to call pack() (or grid()) in a separate statement just like you did for the Entry widget entry1.
