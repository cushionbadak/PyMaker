Due to some architectural reasons out of my control, an object I use frequently and would like full code completion for is a dynamic composite of several features on top of the static features already present in the source code.I've found the re-assign d method to work great, but it feels wrong. Is there no way to type hint with a tuple or something? I tried and couldn't figure it out.I've found jupyter notebook to be great for autocompletion, and I'll jump into either ipython or a notebook session if I really need to explore an unknown codebase, but in this case, I'm pretty familiar with the code base and just would like the autocompletions to be better as I can never remember quite what things are called. I'm mostly in pycharm or atom if that matters. The solution above already solves my problem if there are only a few extensions, but it doesn't work when I have 10 things extending the object. In my use usual case, I have about 20 things extending the object I'd like auto-complete on.
You might be able to use Union here. It's more for when a name can hold different types in different circumstances.Eg.
