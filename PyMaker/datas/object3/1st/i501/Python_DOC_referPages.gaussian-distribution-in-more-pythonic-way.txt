I am new to python coding . I have written a python code to calculate Gaussian distribution and predict the label of the set of values. This was my class assignment for which I got good marks. Now I want to know if my code is correct in more python sense. Can I do any more improvement to the code and make it precise and more "Pythonic". Any kind of suggestion is most welcome. Thank You in advance.
As NichtJens mentioned, try to follow the PEP8 guide, so use lower case variable names with underscores to separate words, and add more spaces between characters.Also try to use consistent and meaningful variable names. For example, why do you have MenArr and WomenList? You have a variable mean but its value is a sum. You have temporary variables with names func1, func2, etc..To make your for loops more Pythonic loop through the items in a list rather than create an index and then look up the items.So:You can do:But even better you can use a list comprehension:You can use this to simplify a lot of your code, e.g. arrayMultiply could be:My version of getMean would filter the data first. I'm not sure if it's correct to use the unfiltered data for the calculateGuassian part:You can also greatly reduce the amount of code required to get up the initial lists:You could reduce the repetition further by having a function that take 'M' or 'W' as a parameter and returns the relevant list.
Your question's title does not reflect what you are actually asking. You might be better fitting to http://codereview.stackexchange.com/ with this...But, on first glance:Read and adhere to PEP8, which defines good Python coding practices: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/Maybe use things like autopep8 (https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) or flake8 (http://flake8.pycqa.org/)Look up how if __name__ == "__main__": is used: What does if __name__ == "__main__": do?Look into NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/) specifically for things like your arrayMultiply() function.You are calling this a "class" in the header comment. However, there's no class defined anywhere here. So, look into what a Python class actually is: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
