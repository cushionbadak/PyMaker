When I try to parse a string to a datetime, I do this (having imported datetime before):However, I receive this errorValueError: time data '22/01/2019 17:00' does not match format '%d/%m/%y %H:%M'anyone know why?
The y should be capitalized. This is referenced in the Python docs found hereThis works finefecha_2 = datetime.strptime('22/01/2019 17:00', '%d/%m/%Y %H:%M')
You need to use a capital Y for a 4 digit year (lowercase y is for a 2 digit year like 19). So:strptime docs
The above is correct. However, to avoid these kind of errors you can use dateutil.parser, which can automatically guess the correct format string. You can install it by doing pip install python-dateutil
