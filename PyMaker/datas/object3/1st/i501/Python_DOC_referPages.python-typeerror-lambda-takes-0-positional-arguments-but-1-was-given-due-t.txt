I am new to making unit tests. I'm currently running pytest. I have this Program.py running but when I run pytest on my Program_test.py I've been failing the tests due to these TypeErrors from my where I had my assert line on the code below. I have the program ask the users for an input value or enter to exit the program. I have the 'import pytest' already included in my Program_test.py program. Am I using lambda wrong? I'm not sure how to best approach this and get those user inputs to work. This is just testing the get_weight function from users. ***It was already fixed. I had a problem with lambda and underneath was very helpful
Here's an example to show where you are going wrong and for the purpose of explanation I am assigning the lambdas to variables:Call zero_arg_lambda with arg (same as your error):Call one_arg_lambda :So in short your code is passing a parameter to the lambda even though you have specified that it does not take one. The one_arg_lambda example takes a parameter and simply returns the value to the right of the colon.I would recommend reading over the docs on lambdaOr if you don't look there the expected lambda format is:lambda parameters: expressionAlso note the docs on monkeypatch.context.setattr which have a good example of using a lambda expression. To pin-point it the error in your code is coming from the context.setattr call inside your test.
