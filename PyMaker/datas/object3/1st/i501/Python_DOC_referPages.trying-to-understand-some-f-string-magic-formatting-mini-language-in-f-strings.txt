Natural Text
In a comment on this post, somebody dropped this line of code:And it looks like magic to me, can somebody explain to me why it works (more specifically f'{a:{a}<{a}}').
It's quite simple if you visualize the iterations:You already know what the f-string f'{a:{a}<{a}' does - when given an {object} within the string it will replace with said object.  In this case, a is range of 1 to 9.Then all you need to understand is what {9:9<9} does.  It's a string formatter as the documentation that the answer has provided:'<' Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space (this is the default for most objects).The x<y portion signifies to left-align the text with a width of y spaces.  For any unused space, pad it with character x.  So you start with {9} as the first character, and for the rest of the 8 unused spaces, fill it with {9}.  This is what {9:9<9} does.Then you apply the same logic and see how each iteration came about.More importantly, it should be noted that what feels like "magic" is often just a lack of understanding.  Once you take the time to digest and understand the process, it becomes very disillusioning and you become enlightened.
You can demistify the output if you substitute some things:and read up on String format mini language:It left aligns the value of a in 5 spaces using 4 as filler:Playing around with code is a good way to get what it does ...
