I am working off this article here trying to parse some command line arguments but the script I built keeps dropping the last argument. To keep it simple I reproduced the problem like so:Here is what I get for output:Where am I going wrong?
The colon (:) is not a separator, it needs to follow each argument as stated in the docs:shortopts is the string of option letters that the script wants to recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a colon (':'; i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).Therefore you should change "c:o:e:q" to "c:o:e:q:"The tutorial you linked to uses it the same way too.
