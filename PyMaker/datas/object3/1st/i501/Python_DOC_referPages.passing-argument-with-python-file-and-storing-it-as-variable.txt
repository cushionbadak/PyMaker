I need to pass some argument when running pythonfile. The argument is a path, /home/user/, where it should be stored as list, so I can use it in the code later.Example: when running file. findfiles.py /home/user/ /home/user2/I want to pass the list to glob.glob('path *.txt'), so it can search for files ending in .txtThis is what I got right now:It searches in current dir after *.txt and list the files and first 2 lines.
you have several options : 1.use Argparse, to read more:   https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html2.use sys.argv which in your simple case seems the simplest :just use that according to what you want.
Thx for tips, but what i used in the end was. printfiles.py /home/user/ /home/user2/where the two arguments would be stored in list. would return the .txt files it found. i could later open them with result.
