Natural Text
I've write sentences and wanna combine it together, but in a permutation order.Each sentence is stored in outputa1.txt outputa2.txt outputa3.txt and combined senteces will be stored in outputone.txt. I've found out a permutation code I believe this code may help me complete the code.But the problem is, because only output() is including outfile=open("outputone.txt","w") code, in def output1(), it cannot cognize the outputone. But if I add outfile=open("outputone.txt","w") to all the def, only one sentence came out, not combined. If I remove def, I can make the code but I lose permutation order. I know this code and my English skill is very sloppy because I've studied them alone without any books.Please anyone to improve my python skills.. I would be really appreciate it!!
the problem is at this line:you need to open this file in append mode: outfile=open("outputone.txt","a")at function 'output' you miss outfile.write(line)for clarity i would wrote a helper function to append a file to another. when you are working with files with statement is the way to go, more info at: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement
