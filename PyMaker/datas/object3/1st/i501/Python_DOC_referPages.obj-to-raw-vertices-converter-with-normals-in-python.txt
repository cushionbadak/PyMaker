Iam asking for your help again. I want to make a script with python that takes an .obj format file of vertices and normals and exports 2 files with the vertex coordinates and another with the normal coordinates of the normaland export them in the format of:vertizesnormals: with the sequence of the faces as they appear. Hoping i can get some sample code if someone has already implemented it in order to save some time. Thank you very much!!
If you want to parse a Wavefront .obj file, then the file can be parsed using a Regular Expression, which gets the lines of the file which contain relevant data:The list of strings can be converted to lists of floating point coordinates and attributes and integral indices:Finally generate the linearized lists of vertex coordinates and normal vectors:Parsing the Wavefront file of the question with the above code will generate the following arrays of vertex coordinates and normal vectors:Vertex coordinates:[1.90047, 2.777519, -3.0, 2.095561, 2.796734, -1.0, 1.90047, 2.777519, -1.0, 2.09556, 2.796734, -3.0, 2.283154, 2.85364, -1.0, 2.095561, 2.796734, -1.0, 2.283154, 2.85364, -3.0, 2.45604, 2.946049, -1.0, 2.283154, 2.85364, -1.0]Normal vectors:[0.098, -0.9952, 0.0, 0.098, -0.9952, 0.0, 0.098, -0.9952, 0.0, 0.2903, -0.9569, -0.0, 0.2903, -0.9569, -0.0, 0.2903, -0.9569, -0.0, 0.4714, -0.8819, 0.0, 0.4714, -0.8819, 0.0, 0.4714, -0.8819, 0.0]
