This question already has an answer here:How to split/partition a dataset into training and test datasets for, e.g., cross validation?                    8 answers                How to split data into 3 sets (train, validation and test)?                    5 answers                I have the following bumpy array:y =I want to generate 3 lists of non-overlapping indices of rows of y as follows:I know how to generate a single list, e.g. list_1:where n_1 is equal to the number of rows that correspond to 70% of all rows. In the above example of y there are totally 14 rows. It means that 70% of 14 rows is equal to 9 (rounded down to 9). Therefore n_1 would be equal to 9.However, I don't know how to generate the rest of lists (list_2 and list_3), so that they do not overlap with the row indices in list_1.
you have y and list1 now, Now from l2 you can run same code of np.random.choice and choose next 15%and save it in list2, then perform
