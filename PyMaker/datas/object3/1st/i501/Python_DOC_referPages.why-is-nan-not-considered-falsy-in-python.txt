This question already has an answer here:Why do “Not a Number” values equal True when cast as boolean in Python/Numpy?                    4 answers                I noticed something today while fiddling with my code:Unlike None and 0. Why is float("nan") not considered Falsy? Cheers
OP : Unlike None and 0. Why is float("nan") not considered Falsy?Ans: Because that's what the language designers decided would be most useful.Hence:OUTPUT:
It's not falsy because it's a valid string argument for float. You can find more information in the documentation.https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=float#floatIf the argument is a string, it should contain a decimal number, optionally preceded by a sign, and optionally embedded in whitespace. The optional sign may be '+' or '-'; a '+' sign has no effect on the value produced. The argument may also be a string representing a NaN (not-a-number), or a positive or negative infinity.
