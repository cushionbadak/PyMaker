This question already has an answer here:Are dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?                    3 answers                popitem() in dictionary guarantee to return last inserted pair for 3.7 and onward. Dictionary is unordered type. So, how dictionary is able to achieve this? 
It is no longer unordered starting 3.6 (implementation detail) and guaranteed as of 3.7. So naturally methods that are based on order have predictable results now.See Are dictionaries ordered in Python 3.6+?
