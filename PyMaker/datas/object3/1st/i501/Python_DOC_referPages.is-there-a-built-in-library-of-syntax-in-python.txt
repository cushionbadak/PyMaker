Natural Text
I'm new to python and I was wondering if there was any way of pulling up a list of functions/symbols and their descriptions? I've tried help(), but that only shows a list of symbols, and only shows their descriptions if you know which one you're looking for. I'm trying to find a way of figuring out which function/symbol to use to solve a problem without the help of a browser.
The Python standard library is massive. You're going to have a bad time of it without the Python docs site. Note that there is a download link so that you can have it locally; that can satisfy your "without a browser" problem, if you use the plain text version.
You can use this page as reference :https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.htmlOr try pydoc or help() or dir().For example in console search anything after help command like this :Or like this for available modules:for example :Have a good time .
