I'm writing a python script to convert .DBC files into .CSV.I've searched a lot some libs to help me but didn't get success with any of them. Do someone know an option/package which could be useful in this conversion task?
I don't know of anything that does an actual conversion, but assuming you mean the DBC BUS format, there's a Python library to read that: https://pypi.org/project/cantools/And Python has built-in tools for writing CSVs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlIt should take only a handful of lines to combine those libraries into a converter.
Convert it to XLS (microsoft excel) and from there you can get it to .csv, I am ubuntu guy but I believe there should be a export option. or at least there is in LibreOffice
