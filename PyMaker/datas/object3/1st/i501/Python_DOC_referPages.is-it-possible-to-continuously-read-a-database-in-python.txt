I am developing a 3D Scanner using a Raspberry Pi and a Canon SLR. To control the reflex and the turntable, I use a simple web interface that I developed. But I have to make the link between a "Start" or "Pause" buttons between the HTML interface and the Python control program. So I create a database to store the settings for the SLR (ISO, Shutterspeed ...). For example, is it possible to have a box in the database with a state true or false for the pause button and then read it continuously on the python program?I made a little test code like this below :Problem is when I change the value of A in the database, the program never displays the new value and never leaves the loop, what is wrong in here?
Consider to use real-time communication like websocket.The simplest way is: When scanner scans some value and saves it to DB, send via websocket command to client, to pull new data from server. Or you can send new data right in websocket message.Very nice tutorial is here: https://realpython.com/python-sockets/
