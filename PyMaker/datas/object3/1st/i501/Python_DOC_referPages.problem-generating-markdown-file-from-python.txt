I have a problem when I use Python to generate pdf files from markdown.My goal here is to transform my documentation to pdf.To do that I already have a shell command which looks like this:To use it you need to install markdown and htmldoc:So now I want to automate the generation. I want to use python with its main library subprocess in 3.6 so here is the code: The problem is located in this part:When I do that only the part with markdown filename.md is run.Why is that? What can I do to fix that?
subprocess without shell=True runs a single subprocess.  If you want to run a complete pipeline, you need to use shell=True or run each process separately.Trivially but unattractively with shell=True:Perhaps slightly more elegantlyYou could also get rid of shell=True and run two separate processes; see Replacing shell pipeline in the subprocess documentation.Just to make this explicit, subprocess.run(['foo', 'bar', '|' 'baz']) runs the program foo with the arguments bar, |, and baz; not two processes where the second is baz and the standard input of the second is connected to the standard output of the first, which is what the shell does when you run a pipeline.
You can Convert Markdwen File To PDF file using a Python Module Named Markdown2PDF, Install it in Python 3 by sudo pip3 install Markdown2PDF. Open the Terminal and write md2pdf <file_name> like md2pdf test.md to convert to pdf.
