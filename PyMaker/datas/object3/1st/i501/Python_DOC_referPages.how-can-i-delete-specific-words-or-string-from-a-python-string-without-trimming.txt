I would like to know how to remove specific words from a string in python without deleting them from other words they composed.For example if I want to remove 'is' from the following sentence:The .replace() function delete 'is' in 'isabelle' and in 'Paris':It gives me abelle in Par But I want isabelle in Paris. Is there a way to delete only 'is'?I tried: s.replace(' is ', '') with a space each side of 'is' but in this case 'is' is not removed in the string s = 'Isabelle is, as you know, in Paris'Thank you
Use a regular expression instead of replacing an ordinary string. You can then use \b in the regexp to match word boundaries.
