Natural Text
I have a datapath to a file couple of data files, let us say data01.txt, data02.txt and so on. During processing the user will provide mask files for the data (potentially also via an external tool). Mask files will contain the string 'mask', e.g., data01-mask.txt.Gives me a list of all the filespath as Path objects including potential masks. Now I want a list that gives me the directory content but not including any file containing mask. I have tried this approach to use fancy regex *![mask]* but I do not get it to work. Using,I can get the desired result, but it seems silly to then convert back to Path elements. Is there a straight forward way to exclude from the directory list?
There is no need to convert anything to strings here, as Path objects have helpful attributes that you can use to filter on. Take a look at the .name and .stem attributes; these let you filter path objects on the base filename (where .stem is the base name without extension):
