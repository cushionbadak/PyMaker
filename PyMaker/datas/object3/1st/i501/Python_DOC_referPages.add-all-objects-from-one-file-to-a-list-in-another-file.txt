I have the following python file constants.py which stores a bunch of constants:I'm trying to import all of the variables and add them to a list called data. This is what I have so far but if I add a constant to constants.py then I need to remember to add it to the data list:Is there a better approach here?
The solution would be to create the list in the constants.py file. It would like as follows:Then you can simply import the list in your main file.
One approach would be to use the importlib module. If your constants.py module contains:You can import those as a module:Due to the bloat of the "dunder" attributes (__spec__, __builtins__ etc.), it can be useful to include the __all__ attribute.
If the variables start with uppercase, you can do thisand you don't have to remember to add them to data.
Somewhat similar to other responses, but no other modules are required.Note that here the import statement should be import constants and not from constants import *.
