I'm setting up a small python age system which would ask user to enter his age, and the system should pick a group for user age. For exmpl. If user writes 19 He would be in "Started Niqa" group. I would like to ask what should i use? Float, int, input, number for age and numbers? What does float, int, input used for? I'm new to python, and i would like to learn something new.P.S You could add some basic sites for me to read. :) I'm using ATOM Editor, Python 3.Photo of the script. (CODE).https://gyazo.com/205f880de49947051a346ab555986a31Age typesInvalid Syntax error.
You may want to read up on the basics of different data types in Python and programming languages in general, particularly the difference between float and int.  In short though, int means an integer, whereas floats are non-integer numbers.  Unless you're dealing with a kid who says stuff like "I'm seven and a half!", then people typically give their ages as integers.Note however that input returns a string typed by the user.  So even if the user typed 7, that comes back as the string 7, not the integer.  You need to convert the string to an integer.Some other problems I fixed in your code:Two of your elifs were missing colonsThey also had bad indentation...and one spelling error<= 100 should be >= 100And although this isn't a bug, you have some ages belonging to more than one group.  In these cases, the first match is the one taken, with the rest ignored.  Still, I changed some "<=" and ">=" to "<" and ">".
Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation.A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.As @koralp mentioned, your last 2 elif statements are not properly indented. They should look like this:
