I'm using virtualenvwrapper. Under my virtualenv with python3, I installed futures successfully, then if I install anything else, it will pop up syntax errors which comes from futures packageerrors are as follows:I checked the answer in this question: pip install error within Python 3 virtualenv, but it doesn't work for me. The futures package is indeed installed in the right version of python which is python 3.6.5.I tried to install futures on python3.6 globally and everything works fine. so it seems something with the futures and the virtualenv. Can anyone please help me solve this issue?Thanks so much
futures package at PyPI is a backport of the concurrent.futures standard library module to Python 2.To use futures in Python 3 you don't need to install anything, it's a standard library module.Now your virtualenv contains a broken Python 2 module. I recommend to remove the virtualenv and recreate it.
