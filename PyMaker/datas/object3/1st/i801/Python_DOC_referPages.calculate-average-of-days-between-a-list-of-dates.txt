I'm trying to calculate the posting frequency of a user on Instagram. Therefore I've built a list of their most recent post dates. Like this:Ideally, I want to get the average amount of days between the post dates. So I end up with a frequency number: e.g. 'the user posts every n days'. I'm taking the timestamp from the JSON code and converting it to something readable like this:How should I best approach this to get a decimal result? 
If you are looking for the average as a float value, then you could do something like the following (since your list is already sorted).Iterates over consecutive pairs in your list by zipping the list with a slice of itself, gets the date difference in days and divides by the number of consective pairs to produce the average.
Just sum up the difference between dates and divide by the total. To keep it simple 
Using statistics.mean with the datetime module:
Four things here: The use timedelta (datetime), zip, list comprehension, and mean (statistics)
