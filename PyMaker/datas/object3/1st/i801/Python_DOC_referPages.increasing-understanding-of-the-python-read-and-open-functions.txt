Using the read() and open() functions whilst using Python 3.7Is there a reason that open() is documented but read() is not?https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html
Because read is not a built-in function, but a method of file object (*IO* / *Reader).You can find documetations of such read methods: io.RawIOBase.read, io.BufferedIOBase.read, io.BufferedReader.read, io.TextIOBase.read, ...
Because read() is NOT a built-in function, as it's not present as builtins.read. Instead, it's a method of _io.BufferedReader class. That means you have to create an object of that class (usually with the built-in function open()), and call read() for the object.
Because read() is a method of a file-object
read is not a Python as others have said. It's a method that you will find for many I/O object such as file objects, http requests, and more.
