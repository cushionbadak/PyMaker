This question already has an answer here:What class to use for money representation?                    6 answers                How to use Python string formatting to convert an integer representing cents to a float representing dollars?                    3 answers                I have been writing this program to add up money in a cash box. when I started multiplying I realized I needed to make a change in my code. int(1) * float(0.05) gave me 0.050000000000000003. I tried searching how to round it and I read that float will not accurately represent currency, I also found information about decimal and quatitize (). I tried to understand how to incorporate that into my code and I am struggling. how can accurately represent currency in my code?
You're on the right track with the decimal data type. You can integrate it into your program by using decimal in replacement of integers and floats.First, import the modulefrom decimal import Decimal as DThen you can use it like so:money['nickles'] = D(input('how many nickels are in your cash box? '))You should define your multiplication factors and initial 0's as decimal as well. Then you can preform arithmetic (between two decimal values) just like the native python types.Note that you should pass a string to the decimal initialization (ex. number = D('0.05')) for exact representation  When you want to print the value, you can use the .quantize(D('1.000')) to round to #0's decimal places
