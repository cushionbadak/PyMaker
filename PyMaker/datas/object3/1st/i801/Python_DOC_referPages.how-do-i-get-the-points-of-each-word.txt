I'm making a program that could count the points of two or more words. How do I get the value of each point in a list in an array? I already have a dictionary of points.I have a list that looks like thiscurrwords = ['PEARS' 'MANGO' 'ORANGE]I have made a code that can get the points of each letter but its output adds all the points. Every time I use this code it only outputs the total points on what is on the list. How do I get the points specifically on each word like PEAR = 6 MANGO = 8 and ORANGE = 7
Let's do it the old school way:OUTPUT:[7, 8, 7]OUTPUT:{'PEARS': 7, 'MANGO': 8, 'ORANGE': 7}
You could use sum together with map:OutputAs an alternative you could use a generator expression:The idea of both map and the generator expression is to map the letters of each word to the corresponding point values.
I think the issue here is that you append trans to total_words at each iteration, but never reset its value. You could add a inside of the first loop. Also, inside of your for yeah in you loop, you define trans twice, so the first one is never used. After correcting that, your code should look like this :
