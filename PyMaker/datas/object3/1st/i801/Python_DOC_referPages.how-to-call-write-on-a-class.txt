I have a set of python classes that represent network data structures (and are also used for disk storage). I'd like to be able to call write() on the class and get its standard binary representation.The classes can struct.pack themselves into a binary representation via a pack() method. I can overwrite the __bytes__ method to call self.pack() so that write(bytes(myobject)) will work, but not write (myobject):Is there something I can override to make write() work without the explicit bytes() cast? Possibly my class would have to be a subclass of Bytes but ... I presume I'd still have to hook up the pack() method call somehow?
You can make the class a subclass of bytearray and make any methods that can alter the object's value update the bytearray's value via the __setitem__ method (that is, using square brackets):
