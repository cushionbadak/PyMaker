Natural Text
Consider this very simple example. I am trying to read line by line from StreamReader and if the line starts with # I skip it otherwise I store it in a list. But there is some strange behaviour when I use seek() method. It seems like seek() and readline() don't cooperate and move cursor somewhere far away. The result list is empty. Of course I could do it in different way. But as I wrote above this is a very simple example and it helps me understand how things work together.I use Python 3.5.
You don't want to use codecs stream readers. They are an older, outdated attempt at implementing layered I/O to handled encoding and decoding of text, since superseded by the io module, a much more robust and faster implementation. There have been serious calls for the stream readers to be deprecated.You really want to replace your use of codecs.getreader() with the io.TextIOWrapper() object:at which point the while loop works and lines ends up as ['Some line without comment\n'].You also don't need to use seeking or tell() here. You could just loop directly over a file object (including a TextIOWrapper() object):or even:If you are concerned about the TextIOWrapper() wrapper object closing the underlying stream when you no longer need the wrapper, just detach the wrapper first:
Your code will work if you simply swap withEDIT: If you want to use StreamReader, you can get rid of the repositioning with tell(), as stream.read() and stream.readline() are sufficient for repositioning. In other words, with your current code you are repositioning twice.The changed code in the loop:Note the change to lines.append()
