I'm trying to generate combinations of elements from multiple lists where the order is very important.For example:The code should be able to do the following:Generate all possible combinations in very specific orders (1st element from list1_mand, next from list2 and so on...): The order cannot be 1st element from list2, next from list5 etc.For Example:'xa1AX' is a valid output whereas 'axXA1' is notThere should be not repetition of elements.For specific lists (list1_mand, list4_mand), the elements from these lists have to be present in the combination, whereas elements from other lists can be skipped.For Example:'xAX' is a valid output, whereas, 'a1AX' is not (element from list1_mand is skipped).Taking into consideration the above three constraints, how can I use the itertools package to generate the required output?
It is the itertools.product you want. The tricky part is being able to omit the non-mandatory lists but for that, there is a workaround1.Either way, here are the first ones produced:1 By adding the "" in the non-mandatory lists, there will be results that will contain that instead and consequently, e.g., 'xA' will also be yielded (eventually).2 Note that the length of the res list will be the product of the lengths of the initial lists after the workaround modification. In this case, it is 384 (=2x4x4x3x4) which is small, but keep it in mind in case, you decide to go big.
