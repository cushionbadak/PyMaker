So i'm building a custom machine learning simulation and wanting to read certain values from a training process, in another one to visualize real time training data.So for example, the training simulation has an array of values under a data structure. Let's say the data structure is an instantiated class called data. Inside this class, there is a list of values, let's call it values.This simulation has a training loop, so while that training loop is going, I would like to run another script that can query data.values and do something with it.Is this possible? - Ideally I would like to keep my simulation code as is so as to not add necessary bulk.
You can use a message queue for that. Add the value to the queue in your loop process and read and visualize with the other application. Take a look at RabbitMQ
