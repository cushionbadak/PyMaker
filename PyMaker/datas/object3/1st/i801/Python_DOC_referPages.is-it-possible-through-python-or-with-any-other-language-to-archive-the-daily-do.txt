I need a utility to archive my daily downloaded files into one new folder.Suppose, I downloaded 10 files today and at the end of the day, all the files should get archived into one new folder with name Archived_TodaysDate.THIS ACTIVITY/TASK CAN BE SCHEDULABLE AND EXECUTE ON DAILY BASIS.IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU HELP IN THE CONTEXT OF MAC OPERATING SYSTEM.I know this can be done through many scripting languages but I wanted to know for mac which scripting language is good for this task and a quick start guide.
If you aren't familiar with setting up a chrontab you can set those up by following this (I looked for a mac-specific one but there are zillions of guides about this.)Your archiving script can be quite simple. Begin by generating a list of files to archive (refer to this answer.)Unlike in the referenced answer we want a list of files, not a printed output. So we initialize a list and append to it at each iteration. Here I assume that your script lives in your downloads folder, but you can change the path given to os.walk as appropriate.We also want a strftime representation of now for our archive file title.Finally write the files into an archive file (in this case I chose zip format).
