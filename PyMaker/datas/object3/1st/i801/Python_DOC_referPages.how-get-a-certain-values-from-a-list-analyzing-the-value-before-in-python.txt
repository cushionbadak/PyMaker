I would like to do this in loop.But the numbers in the list will change all the time.this is my list So, I have the first number 3, then I want to extract the next three numbers, 119 119 119, after these three numbers I have number 10, based in the number 10, I want to extract the next ten positions on the list, 103, 111, 111, 103, 108, 101, 97, 112, 105, 115, afeter that I have number 3, and based on that number extract the next three positions 99, 111, 109, when I find the last number 0 the program stops.this is my attempts
You can try using itertools.islice:Output:If you want it as a list, just make the below modifications:You can even make it a list comprehension if you want:
You can walk over your data get first elementget a list sliced based on current items index and its value skip all those elements you just sliced outrepeat until done:Output:Doku:enumerate(iterable) returns (index,value) tuples from the iterable
