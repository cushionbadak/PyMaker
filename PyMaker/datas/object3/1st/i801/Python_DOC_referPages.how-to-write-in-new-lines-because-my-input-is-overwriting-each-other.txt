Natural Text
I'm trying to save the answers from a GUI that has radio buttons that has different value ranging from A, B and C, but when I'm trying my code it completely rewrite the first letters and not going to the next line. My output in my console is a b c d e but in the text file it has only 1 letter written in the first line which is the last letter.
Every time your code does this:you are opening the file afresh and overwriting what was there before. The same as File | Save does in an application, except that your code doesn't ask "Are you sure?". Use mode "a" instead of "w".From the documentation for open():The most commonly-used values of mode are 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and 'a' for appending.
Confused by python file mode "w+"ps. try to avoid duplication of the code when each function does same functionality ... if possible of course.
