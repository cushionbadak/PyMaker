You can usually use dictionary keys with star unpackingHere the keys are numbers (and not even strings but it doesn't matter anyway: to use the technique above, the arguments must be valid as python identifiers, see what are valid keys according to Python str.format() documentation)When doing print("{1}".format(whatever)), format interprets them as positional argument (2nd argument) and it fails miserably.One solution is to pass the dictionary to format and query it from the format string:result:
The problem with your line is that you are passing a '1' (string), not a 1 (int)Note: the new format() method is the recommended one for python 3.x. You can do something like: 
If you want to order your items by number then use list insteadAlso you can do this:The result will be 
The key in your dictionary is a integer, and the key in the print function is parse as map are string. That give you this error. You can print in this ways:also you can change the keys in dict to string: dic1 = {"1":"hello","2":"python"}
