This question already has an answer here:Check if value already exists within list of dictionaries?                    3 answers                I am using session in my Django Application. request.session['permissions'] is structured in the following manner. The key is same for every values. Basically it is a list of dictionariesNow I want to check if value4 is present inside permissions. I am not getting how to check the value. Whenever I am trying to access value like this It is giving me error I want to do similar like this 
I think you can do it like this using filter:
use a for loop to get the single dictionary and then check the key

As the other answers point out. The issue is that you are trying to use a dictionary accessor on a list object. Since permissions is a list of dictionaries you need to check all the dictionaries in the list for the value4. This can be done in many ways, in my mind the most pythonic way would be to use list comprehension, something like [value4 == d for d['mykey'] in permissions]
