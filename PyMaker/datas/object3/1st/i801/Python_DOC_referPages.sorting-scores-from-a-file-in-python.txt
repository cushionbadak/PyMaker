Here's the part that uses the file: I know the part that prints the scores in quite bulky, but that seemed to be the only way I could get it to print correctly.I've tried loads of different solutions I have found online, but none of them worked to sort the file numerically in descending order (and print the top 5 scores), they all seemed to give errors (when trying to use things such as sort and sorted).The variable winner if defined as:I would like to figure out how I should change that variable or how I can sort it as it is.
Let's store what's in the file.Can you now use one of the methods you found online to sort lines?
To simply append an entry, you don't need to open the file twice, since you can open in r+ mode. This will let you read and write. r mode puts the file pointer at the beginning of the file rather than at the end. When you open files, you should use a with statement to automatically close the file, even if an error happens:The comprehension that assigns to data moves the file pointer to the very end. The print statement then writes to the end.Sorting the data is a whole separate can of worms. You have to split the data and sort by the numerical value of the score. Then you will have to rewrite the whole file. While you can do this with a single open, it would probably be easier to open twice as in your original example:
