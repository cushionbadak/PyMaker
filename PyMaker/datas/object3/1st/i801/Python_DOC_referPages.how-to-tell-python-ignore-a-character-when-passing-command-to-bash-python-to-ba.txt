When I run the same command in a bash script it works. When I want to pass it to shell through Python's os.system it complains because of the {and: characters.
You cannot nest single quotes. The string which starts with os.system(' ends at the next (unescaped) single quote.Python offers triple quotes which provide for a trivial fix:A better solution altogether is to use subprocess.run without shell=True so you don't have to understand both Python's and the shell's quoting mechanisms.For (much) more on this topic, see further https://stackoverflow.com/a/51950538/874188
