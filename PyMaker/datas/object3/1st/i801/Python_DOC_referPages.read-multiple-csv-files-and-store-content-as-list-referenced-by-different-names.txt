So I have code that basically does this:However, I want to be able to assign list a different name each time the function is run. For example list_one, list_two etc. How can I do this?From comment:The end goal is too have the contents of several csv files stored in a few lists with different names. The files contain birds, dates and location in the same file. I have several files as users may have several bird lists they wish to make (one for birds seen in their county/state, another file for birds seen all over the world etc.) 
To read multiple files and its content into lists:Create data:Load data:Usage of loaded data:Output:Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.readerhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries
You could create a dictionary for the lists, with your desired name as the key and the list as the valueIt's generally not practical or advisable to rename variables and should not be done in most cases.
