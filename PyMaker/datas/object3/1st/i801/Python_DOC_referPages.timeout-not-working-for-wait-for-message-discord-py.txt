The timeout for wait_for_message is not working. I even tried to use timeout = time.time() + 60*15 elif time.time() > timeout: instead of elif guess is None: and it still won't time out after 15 minutes. I figured if the while loop is broken by putting winner = guess.author that it would timeout and send the message and send another safe_loop to the channel. Does anyone have a suggestion?
You can't really do elif int(guess.content) == answer5: or winner = guess.author if guess is None (which is what Client.wait_for_message returns if the message times out  You have to check if the message timed out without anyone guessing before you check everything else
