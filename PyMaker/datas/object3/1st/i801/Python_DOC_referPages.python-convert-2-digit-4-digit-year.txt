I am trying to convert the date format '31-Dec-09' to '2009-12-31' in Python with the following code:   Getting the following error: I have read somewhere that matching a two-digit year '00' would require a lowercase y instead of an upper case one. Either way, I am getting the same error so I guess something else is wrong. Any help?
Your %y and %Y patterns are fine, the issue is that you used %mmm here. The datetime.strptime() method patterns are all single letter patterns, and %mmm is seen as the %m pattern followed by two literal m characters. %m matches a numeric month (1 or 2 digits, zero-padding optional). So 19-1mm-19 would match, but 19-Jan-19 does not because the month is not numeric and the two literal m characters are missing.The correct pattern to use is '%d-%b-%y' here, where %b matches an abbreviated month name.Demo:
Since you're specifying month in short hand notation, you should use %b instead of %mmm (That is not a valid format in datetime)
