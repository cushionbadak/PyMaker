I was trying to iterate over the files in a directory like this:But Python was throwing FileNotFoundError even though the file exists:So what is wrong here?
It is because os.listdir does not return the full path to the file, only the filename part; that is 'foo.txt', when open would want 'E:/somedir/foo.txt' because the file does not exist in the current directory.Use os.path.join to prepend the directory to your filename:(Also, you are not closing the file; the with block will take care of it automatically).
os.listdir(directory) returns a list of file names in directory. So unless directory is your current working directory, you need to join those file names with the actual directory to get a proper absolute path:
