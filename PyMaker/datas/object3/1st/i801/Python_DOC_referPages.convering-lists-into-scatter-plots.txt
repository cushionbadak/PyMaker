Natural Text
I was wondering how I would be able to plot values from two lists that I split from a text file, into a scatterplot?
Try -    
Open the file; split each line into words; if a word is a number keep it; add the numbers in each line to the result.
By best guess would be using regular expression [0-9]+this would check for number in the text. I dont know which language you are using but java has a function called match. You match it with the regular expression and the text and you will get the answer 
I think that it should work. I tried it. I dont know if you are using comma or dot.data=[tuple(re.findall(r'\d+,\d+', line)) for line in lines]You need to import re at the top of you python script.
