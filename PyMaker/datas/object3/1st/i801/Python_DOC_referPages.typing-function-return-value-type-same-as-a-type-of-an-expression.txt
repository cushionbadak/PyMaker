Consider the code:How can I say that I want the return type of foo to be the same as the return type of bar()?In C++ I could use decltype, something along the lines of:I couldn't find Python's equivalent. Is there any?
If bar is defined, you can access its signatureThat being said, I'm not sure you need that if you do this for static  type checking, because foo's return type can be inferred from bar's (at least PyCharm's static analyser tends to do that).
Python's built-in typing library enables creating custom types, you can describe a new type class and couple both functions with this class as a return value.
