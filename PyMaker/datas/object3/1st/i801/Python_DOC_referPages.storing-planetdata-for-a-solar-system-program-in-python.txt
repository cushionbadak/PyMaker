I've been creating a solar system simulation as a project for fun and practice in python. The problem I'm facing is that storing the data for the planets in the .py itself is getting rather hectic. Example:This is what I'm currently add, and I plan on adding asteroids, more planets and moons, and all that stuff... What would be a better way to do this? To store the data in a more organized way, something like a spreadsheet perhaps so I could easily add more values if needed.For reference, the full code: https://pastebin.com/L8n23bLt (It's working pretty decently but there's quite a few kinks and bugs I still want to work out. Any tips on stuff I'm doing wrong here are appreciated too!)
it's OK to store values like that if it's OK for you and your project.I prefer to use library configparser or json files.ConfigParser vs JSON files for configHere is short example from my project:
Consider a simple csv or yaml file as the next step. Both will allow you to explicitly name the fields and read the elements as dictionaries. If maintaining a file by hand gets too cumbersome, consider sqlite.
There's a lot of options in this space that work well. At the most simple end of things would be a csv file (a text-based spreadsheet) storing all of your objects, which you could then read in and parse using the csv module of the standard library.Your CSV file could look like this:And the reading code like this:A similar alternative is to format your files using JSON, YAML, or XML, and read in and parse with with the json or xml modules of the standard library.At the more complex end of the space are full relational (and non-relational) databases. Your use case, plus the fact that there is a sqlite3 module in the standard library makes sqlite a good potential option in this space.
