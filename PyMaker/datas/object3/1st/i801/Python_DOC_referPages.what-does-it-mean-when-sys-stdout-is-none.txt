i can silence and restore sys.stdout this way:i know i'd better be using contextlib.redirect_stdout which probably does something similar but my question is: why does the above code work?i'd have assumed python would call things like sys.stdout.write() so whatever i replace sys.stdout with should have a write method (like e.g. io.StringIO) at least.
print has an explicit check for None.
