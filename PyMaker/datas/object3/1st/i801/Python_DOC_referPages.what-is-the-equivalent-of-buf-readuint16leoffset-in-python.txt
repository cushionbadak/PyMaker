I am looking for the equivalent of this function (from node.js) in Pythonbuf.readUInt16LE(offset)offset:  Number of bytes to skip before starting to read. Must satisfy 0 <= offset <= buf.length - 2.  Returns:   Reads an unsigned 16-bit integer from buf at the specified offset with specified endian format (readUInt16BE() returns big endian, readUInt16LE() returns little endian).Example:
There are no such functions that I'm aware of, though there may be a package that does this.Using the standard library utilities, you can use struct.unpack and io.BytesIO for the conversion and handling of a (binary) buffer.Below is an example (Python 3). Apologies if the lines feel a bit compact; I hope it's still straightforward to read.More details at the documentation pages of the io and struct modules.
