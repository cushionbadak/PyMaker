I am extracting the url links from a Wiki page and coming up with an "ValueError" when it tries to parse for certain links. I am looking for a way to ignore the errors or fix the issue. It seems that when the loop is extracting the links, it runs into links that it does not recognize as a link and traceback.Raises:
The url that it is encountering has no schema or domain. It is a relative url meaning it needs to be appended to the current page url in order to go to it.  urls usually start with schema://domain.domain like in https://www.facebook.com.  If you check your urls to be sure they contain the schema and domain then attach them if they are missing then you will avoid this error.An example:/search?q=stack+overflowmight be a relative url for a search on google for stack overflow.To reconstruct the full url you just add https://www.google.com to the beginning and it becomes an actual search link https://www.google.com/search?q=stack+overflow
The reason you're getting the error is because that isn't a valid link. You could try prepending "https://bing.com" to the beginning of the URL, or by catching the errors.To catch the error:To prepend the URL:
