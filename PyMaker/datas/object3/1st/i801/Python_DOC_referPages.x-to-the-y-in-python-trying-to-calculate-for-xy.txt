Obviously I am new to programming and Python so I am trying to learn.  Here is my question below I am trying to answer:“We will pass in 2 values, X and Y. You should calculate X^y and output the final result”  what you see below is what I was provided.  I believe I am to use a nested loop to calculate it. 
Try X ** Y, unless you have some other requirement (like writing it by hand).
You can also use function for powering:
To raise X to the Y in python, you want to use the exponentiation ** operator:this should do it:in terminal:python
