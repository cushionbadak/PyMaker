I am writing a python code to search,delete and replace columns in a csv file I have 3 files.Input.csv:delete.csv:replace.csv:here is my code:my logic is:so my desired output is :so right now i am facing the following problems:1)lines that are not present in either replace.csv or delete.csv dont get printed2)there is a possibility that my input.csv may contain newlines within one entry so reading line by line is a problem,however it is a certainty that the data distributed on the different lines is between quotes.eg:any help in bringing the code and my logic together is appreciated.
I would suggest changing this up a bit:read the things you want to replace in a dictionary set key to what is in your datas 0th spot, set value as what to replace the 0th and 1st spot of your data withread the things you want to delete into a set if your data-row start with it: skip row else add it to the output.Loop over your data and use the both lookups to "do the right thing". I changed your data a bit to incorperate the mentioned "escaped" data including newlines:File creation:Programm:Check result:Output:Doku:csv.writer/csv.reader
