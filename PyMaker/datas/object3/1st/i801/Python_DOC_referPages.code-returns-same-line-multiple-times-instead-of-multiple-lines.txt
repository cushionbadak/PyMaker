What I'm trying to do is to open two CSV files and print only the lines in which the content of a column in file 1 and file 2 match. I already know that I should end up with 14 results, but instead the first line of the CSV file I'm working with gets printed 14 times. Where did I go wrong?
You should be using the csv module for reading these files because splitting on commas is not reliable; it's fine for a single CSV column to contain values that themselves include commas.I've added a couple of things to try make this cleaner and to help you move forward in your learning:I've used the with context manager that automatically closes a file once you're done reading it. No need for .close()I've packaged the csv reading code into a function. Now we only need to write that part once and we can call the function with any file.I've used the csv module to read the file. This will return a nested list of rows, each inner list representing a single row.I've used a list comprehension which is a neater way of writing a for loop that creates a list. In this case, it's a list of all the items in the first column of file_1.I've converted the list in Point 4 into a set. When we iterate through file_2, we can very quickly check whether a row value has been seen in file_1 (set lookup is O(1) rather than having to iterate through file_1 every single time).The indices I print are from my own test files, you will need to adapt them to your own use-case.
if you provide your csv files then I can help you more.
