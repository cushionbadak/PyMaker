I've already tried using the sum function, then the sorted function, but I was wondering if I can write them neatly in a code to just get everything worked out.I was able to get the numbers sorted horizontally, but I wasn't able to get the numbers added vertically. 
You can use itertools.accumulate with sorted:The default action is operator.add, but you can customize it. For example, you can do running product instead of running sum if you needed it:
Apparently, you need a cumulative addition. You can code a simple one using a simple loop and yield the results on the goDepending on your goals, you may also wish to use a library, such as pandas, that has cumulative sum already written for you. For example,
