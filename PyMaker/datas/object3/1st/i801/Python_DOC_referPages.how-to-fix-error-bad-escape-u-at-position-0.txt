Hello I'm trying to export a gmap html using ipywidgets in jupyter notebook but am encountering the following error: - error: bad escape \u at position 0. I'm new to programing and could use help fixing whatever is causing this error to occur. If there is any easier way to go about exporting the html file I'm happy to change approaches. ThanksHere is a snippet of the code: I can add the entire thing if its helpful. Long Form Error Bellow
This is an error in Python 3.7, and an issue with Python 3.6 (but it is OK with Python 2.7).If you use a raw string (prefixed by "r") for the replacement in re.sub function, then the \u is escaped. For instance, r'\u003c\1' is like '\\u003c\\1': this is a string '\u', followed by '003c' and \1.The solution is to write:Quoting the documentation:Changed in version 3.7: Unknown escapes in repl consisting of '\' and an ASCII letter now are errors.
