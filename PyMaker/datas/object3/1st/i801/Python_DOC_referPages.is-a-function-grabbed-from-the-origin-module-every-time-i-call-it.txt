I have a fundamental question:I have two files. One of them, work.py, contains my script and the other, mytools.py, all my functions.In work.py, I import, i.e. the module like so:Somewhere in the code in work.py it'll say something like:Does that mean it'll (i) call the function from an 'imported copy' or (ii) will the function be called directly from the module, in other words, is there a constant link between work.py and the file mytools.py where the module was imported from?As explanation for why I'm asking this... If the call is made directly to the original module, I could make small tweaks to the parameters of single functions while work.py is running -- of course during waiting times/pause.
The import system in Python has 2 phases:Searching the moduleLoading it to create a module objectThe second step consists in reading and "executing" the source contained in the module file to create a module object in memory.In Python 3.4 and later, if for a reason or another the source of the module changes during the execution of your script, you can reload it.This answer gives you details about this.
