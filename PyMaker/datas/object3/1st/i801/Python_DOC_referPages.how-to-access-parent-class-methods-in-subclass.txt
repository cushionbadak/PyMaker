Class 'X' is the Parent Class and Class 'Y' is the subclass of X. How can Class Y subclass get access to class X that is its parent class. 
How can Class Y subclass get access to class X that is its parent class.Python has multiple inheritance, so a class may have much more than one parent. All this his handled by the "mro" (method order resolution) and the super() object, that let you access methods from the "next" class in the mro.Now note that in your code snippet, the real issue is not "accessing the parent class" at all, it's that you're trying to access a global "printThis" name - that is not defined. Python has no "implied this" like Java, you HAVE to use self to reference instance attributes or methods, so what you want is:To illustrate this this has nothing to do with parent class, you'd have the same problem calling printThis() without self in the same class:Also, no need for super() here, Python will resolve printThis on the first class in the mro defining this name. You need super() when your subclass redefines a method of the parent class and still wants to call the parent's implementation, ie:
in the y class init, you have to also init the parent class you want to inherit from.
