I have some group of equals items that I want to combine.I try to explain better with an example:I have some group of people, every group have an ID.So the situation is a list of 5 people like thatI need to place everyone inside some room. Every person with the same code needs to be in the same room.The rooms, for example, are 3: the first one has 2 desks, the second one has 3 desks and the last one has 2 desks again.So finally I expect a list of combinations like that:"None" means an empty Desk.I don't expect a final solution, I'll appreciate some help about the logic process to follow, because I'm really going crazy about that.Thank you very much.
this gets you 95% if the way there
I have created a sample how you could solve your problem:    I highly recommend to dive some deeper into Itertools i am not so deep in there ...
I want to show you my work-in-progress (above).In this way, for each room, I find every possible optimized combination. The problem is that now I have to combine the combinations between rooms without repetitions.I didn't find a way, so I asked you help by also changing mind.As you can see peoples can change and also room places compared to the previous example.This is a test with Python 3 though I use Python 2Thank you!
This is a much faster solution, based on Fabian's approach:Output:My old much-much more inefficient solution:
