I have to remove the capitalized letters from the string givenWhen I try to remove the capital letters from the given string, the return function exists at the end of the function which I wrote to print the output causes to the last character to get printed. Is there any better way to solve it?expected : 153actual : 153D
You print inside and print the return - you return the last i without test .. which is the last letter of your input.Modifications:Instead of checking ordinals and magic numbers, use built in fuction isupper() to decide. do not use pass - simply do only something if it is ok to do socollect all parts into a list and join() them back into a stringFix:Output:You can also append to strings - but strings are immutable so it destroyes the old one and creates a new longer version - which is wasteful:The only benefit this has, is that it does not use lists - it is slower and more memory intensive.
Use list comprehension  
The last unwanted character is returned because of the return i statement at the end of your function. If you just want to print out the non-capitalised letters putting return None and just calling the function (not doing print(remove_capitals("A1H5J3ETD")) : remove_capitals("A1H5J3ETD") should do the trick.
