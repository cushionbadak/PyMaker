I am solving a Python exercise about class:Define a class called Bank that accepts the name you want associated  with your bank account in a string, and a float that represents the  amount of money in the account. The constructor should initialize two  instance variables from those inputs: name and amt. Add a string  method so that when you print an instance of Bank, you see “Your  account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars.” Create  an instance of this class with "Bob" as the name and 100.0 as the  amount. Save this to the variable t1.I wrote the following:And the result I get is "Your account, Bob, has 100 dollars." But the correct answer is "Your account, Bob, has 100.0 dollars."How can I do to fix it? Thank you!
You can change your format:Check out the Format Specification Mini-Language.
Or hack it:Or use float:
