This question already has an answer here:How to print without newline or space?                    26 answers                Output:I am not using '\n'. But the control is being shifted to the next line in the output. Does this always happen when working with a class in Python?
The print function (in Python 3) defaults to printing a newline character:Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end.If you don't want this behavior, pass an empty string for end:
In python it actually add new line at the end automatically. So you need to specify comma at the end of print so that it  will use Space instead  of new line.. Refer New line in python print() function
