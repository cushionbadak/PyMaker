I am trying to build my own dataset for a project. Therefore I need to select  files that have been exported from another program and come with numbered extensions:I know how to select files with a specific extension e.g. '.txt' from a folder and append it to a list or dict. Is there any way to solve this with '.nnn'
You can mix the capabilities of shell globbing (glob) and regex (re).With glob you can get the files ending with a number, so that we get a limited number files for re to do the final check:Then we can match the files precisely with Regex pattern:this will match file names ending in digits after last ..Putting together:Shell globbing is not as flexible as re, otherwise we could have done with glob alone.Also, if you're sure that all files end in a certain number of digits then glob alone would work e.g. for files ending in 3 digits after last .:
If you don't care about the length of the extension, you can use the isdigit method:
You can use the glob module.
