Start by setting t to be the local time 1, 500, 000, 000 seconds from the start of January 1, 1970 UTC:import time      t = time.localtime(1500000000)      Construct the next strings by using the string time format function strftime(): (a) 'Thursday, July 13 2017'      (b) '09:40 PM Central Daylight Time on 07/13/2017'      (c) 'I will meet you on Thu July 13 at 09:40 PM.'
According to your questions the right implementation is:If you are asked to write a function that accepts two arguments, then your function must accept two arguments as here:Then you must read the file, I did it using with statement. with statement will close our file for us, so you don't have to do it manually (and yes, you forgot to close an opened file, it is not a big problem for now, but avoid such things in big projects). You can read more about with statement there: Reading and writing filesWhat about find method. It is a string method, that will return index of found substring in your string, for instance my_string.find('h') is going to return the index of first substring (which is 'h') in my_string string. If find method can't find your substring it will return -1, that's why we do this: As if we will find our pattern in text, then the index certainly is going to be greater that -1. Otherwise we return False or -1 if pattern string's length is less than 3, according to your questionAnd at the end we take input from user and pass that input to our function with the name of file example.txt. We store the return value of our function in out variable and then print it
A couple things, Stack Overflow is not the place for code reviews, for that: try this.Regardless, you have indentation problems, Python is based off of indents, you need to have the code in your function indented one ahead of your def, like so:Second, you're not taking an input with the function, and hard-coding the file to open; this is a simple fix however,Third, you're not going to accomplish your goal with your if statements, if the length of the input is less than 3, you shouldn't even try to search for anything, so you need to reorder and change your boolean expressions a bit; to this:Finally, a.find will not work, rather you can check to see the value of result, so you can replace elif: a.find with:Since result will be -1 if it cannot find anything.Also, the return is useless at the end.
