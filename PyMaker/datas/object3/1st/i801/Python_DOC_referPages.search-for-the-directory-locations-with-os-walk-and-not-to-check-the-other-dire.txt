I'm going to fetch all the filenames and locations in the particular sub directory (if fit the pattern). These sub directories are located in the different locations with different depth (as it was discussed: how to get all the files from multiple folders with the same names). My problem: asap I find 'xyz' in the directory , I don't want to check if 'xyz' is a sub directory for any other directories on the same level (for an example, I don't want to check if 'D:/qwer/lkj' may contain 'xyz'.The code:
You can remove all directory names other than 'xyz' from dirnames in-place so that they will not be traversed:Excerpt from os.walk's documentation:When topdown is True, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place  (perhaps using del or slice assignment), and walk() will only recurse  into the subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be  used to prune the search, impose a specific order of visiting, or even  to inform walk() about directories the caller creates or renames  before it resumes walk() again.
