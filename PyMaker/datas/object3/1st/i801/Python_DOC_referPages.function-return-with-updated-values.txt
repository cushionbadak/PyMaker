This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between `sorted(list)` vs `list.sort()`?                    6 answers                I was trying to sort list elements inside a function without return when I try to print the list by its name it does not get sorted, but it is sorted inside a function.I have to update the list inside the function without returningExpected : [1,2,3,5]actual: [5,1,2,3]
I'm sorry, I made a series of mistakes myself. It's a lesson for me too.  output:sort is an existed fuction in python, need to change it to other name. I changed to isort.  We have to call the function isort to let it do its work.We need to update the elements in the list to make the list update. [:] Slice notation here.It's better to use different name between function argument and the call. (n and m here).Many thanks to DYZ, Primusa, and Tomothy32 :)
