A few issues. First, if you are trying to create a lookup table, dictionaries are the way to go. However, your keys need to be unique, and yours are not. You will overwrite the values in your single dictionary.Let's focus on getting the data into a key-value pair structure to start. Your keys are limited to (as far as I can tell) alarm, job, and machine. Since your keys don't match what's in the data structure, you will probably have to hardcode them. We will use your data structure that you have provided as the starting point:This gets all of the values into associated lists which we can zip together for easy iteration.Now to build your data structure (here are the docs for zip:Your resulting data structure looks like this:Each entry in lookup now is a dictionary with the keys alarm, job, and machine. You can get each value iteratively like so:Note I'm using the get method rather than entry['alarm'], this is a more robust lookup that avoids KeyErrors and instead returns a default value (None if not specified).There are definitely faster and more succinct ways to do this, but I think this covers enough to keep things looking familiar and not bog you down with new concepts
