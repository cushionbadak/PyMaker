Natural Text
I am new to python and I was on this website: https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types suddenly, at the bottom there are these characters like %f %d %s %.Does anyone know what it means???
This is the Exercise:As it says, %s (of string) is to replace a string, %f (of float) is to replace a float, and %d (of integer) is to replace an integer
