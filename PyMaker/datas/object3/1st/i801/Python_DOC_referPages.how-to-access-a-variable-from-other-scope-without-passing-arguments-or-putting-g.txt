Natural Text
I have a function lambda_handler in the lambda module including other module and calling helloWorld function.Passing the arguments in the helloWorld function or putting the variables as global is not an option. Is it possible to access variables from earlier scope?
Use the inspect module to get the calling frame's local variables:Outputs
You might try:Because that should import the variables from mymodule.But it might not import variables created after the import, because it reads the code in the def statements as what to do when called, it doesn't actually create the variables.
