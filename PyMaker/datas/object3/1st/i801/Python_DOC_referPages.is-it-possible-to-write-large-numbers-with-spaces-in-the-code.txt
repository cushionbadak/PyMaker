This question already has an answer here:How to use digit separators for Python integer literals?                    4 answers                I'm trying to run a Monte-Carlo control algorithm, and keep getting frustrated when setting the number of steps in the code. It needs to be a large number (thousands, millions...) and it is hard to read it at a glance so I need to count zeros whenever I change it. I tried entering it as N_EPISODES = 1 000 000 or N_EPISODES = int('1 000 000')or with commas instead of spaces, but none of these work. Is there a way to set large numbers in the code in a human-readable way?
You can try writing your number in a scientific-style way?Like 1e6 instead of 1000000 or 1,000,000...
