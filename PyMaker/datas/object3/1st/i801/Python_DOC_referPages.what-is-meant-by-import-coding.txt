I am working with elffile python module/library. There is one line of code that is giving the following errorI could not find any python file or class named coding. Also, I didn't find anything on the internet regarding import coding.
Import is when you import modules to use in your coding.If it cant find the module you probably have to install it. The easiest way to do this is to use pip.Write: pip install coding (or pip3) and it will install the module.
