Given a list like:how do I split it into a list of sublists:Effectively I need an equivalent of str.split() for lists. I can hack together something, but I can't seem to be able to come up with anything neat and/or pythonic.I get the input from an iterator, so a generator working on that is acceptable as well.More examples:
A simple generator will work for all of the cases in your question:
I am not sure if there's an easy itertools.groupby solution, but here is an iterative approach that should work:Testing on your examples:This is analogous to the result you would get if examples were actually strings and you used str.split(sep):By the way, if the elements in your lists were always guaranteed to be strings, you could simply do:But the mySplit() function is more general.
My first ever Python program :)
For list or tuple objects you can use the following:I won't work with a generator but it's fast.
You can use itertools.takewhile:The it.chain part is to find out when the seq is exhausted. Note that with this approach it's easy to yield generators instead of lists if desired.
I would define the following function to solve that problem.When I try the cases you gave:The output is:
The following is a non-generic solution that (most probably) only works on list of ints:
