I've been experimenting with different Python modules such as pycurl and requests but still unable to get curl -v <URL> output as shown below.DESIRED OUTPUT (In Python code)Since this is in Windows, I don't want to use os.system and subprocess modules as curl.exe is not there by default.Here are my attempts ... But I still did not get similar output as produced by curl -v
If you are looking for information about Last-Modified, Cache-Control etc,in requests you can check out headers.
Without any third-party packages (e.g. requests), in Python 3.7.2:docs
