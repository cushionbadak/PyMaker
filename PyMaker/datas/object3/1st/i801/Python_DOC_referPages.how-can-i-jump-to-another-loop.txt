I have a problem. I don't know how to jump to another loop. Should I use 'continue' or 'break' in the current loop? (python3.x)While True: <-- continue to thisWhile True:continue <-- continue to the first while loop
You can break the inner loop to continue the outer loop
The break key word allows you to exit the presiding loop you are in. So if you have a statement like:The break will send you back to the first loop.
Use break as suggested it exits the inner loop when a condition is met. Consider this example from [here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html][1]results2 is a prime number3 is a prime number4 equals 2 * 25 is a prime number6 equals 2 * 37 is a prime number8 equals 2 * 49 equals 3 * 3
