I'm trying to combine recursion and yield to in-order traverse a treeThis is what I'm currently having. However, when I try to traverse the tree, it seems to only traverse the root nodeWhen I run the code, it only prints outwhich is the element of the first node, not what I want which isDoes anyone have an idea what I did wrong?Thanks everyone
Thanks to 张实唯, turns out I have to use yield from. Calling a generator function does not yield from it:
Mike Pham's answer is great but I wanted to share a back-tracking approach that helps us understand how we can manually build the desired sequence using direct recursion instead of for loops. It's not a better program; it's an exercise to check your mastery of generators -Test it out -This might help give you an appreciation for what yield actually does for you. Here's the same program without it. Minor differences in bold -
