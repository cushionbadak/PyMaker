Have an ordered dict which has duplicate key, value pairings. Want to make those duplicate values unique.For eg. 4244158 & 4244159 combination exist twiceI want to keep one of them.Now the code mentioned below was fine with python2 since ordered dict can be mutated but not with python3 so i made a copy of the ordered dict and compare it with original ordered dictTo clarify, I only want to remove a duplicate of the type x -> [y], y -> [x], i.e. lists with one item.

The idea is to maintain a set of frozenset items, and add to it only when you meet a list with one item.In Python3, you should under no circumstances iterate over a view such as dict.items while adding / removing items.Result:
