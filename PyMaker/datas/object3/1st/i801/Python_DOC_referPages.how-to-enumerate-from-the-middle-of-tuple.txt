This question already has an answer here:Enumerate list of elements starting from the second element                    3 answers                By default, enumerate() starts counting at 0 but if you give it a second integer argument, it'll start from that number instead but how can we enumerate from a particular value of count and elem. for example, we want to pass count as '2' and elem as 'bar'. both values have to pass to enumerate function.
You can iterate a slice of your data and start the enumeration at a specific integer:Output:Documentation:enumerate(iterable, start=0) (specify whatever for start to start numbering the 0th element of iterable with that number onwards)Edit:If you are working with non-sliceable iterators you have to work around it:to get:
the itertools module is where you should look when you want to iterate in a non standard wayin this case use isliceto get the start index, use the .index function of the container(or hardcode it to 1 if you want to iterate from the second position regardless of the contents), the end index is the len of the container
