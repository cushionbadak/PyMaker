I have a mixed dataset where some of them are as strings and some as bytes as follows.My code is as followsSince some of the values are bytes I wanted to convert them to strings. Therefore, I did the following change to the above code.However, then I get an error saying; AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'I also tried:But it did not work for me.Is there a way to resolve this issue?
Following is an implementation of the various suggestions in the comments. Check if the list element is a bytes object and decode if so (since bytes objects are immutable, I am replacing the list element with a decoded version).
