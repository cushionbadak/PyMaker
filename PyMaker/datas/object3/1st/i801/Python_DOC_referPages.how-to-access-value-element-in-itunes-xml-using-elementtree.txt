I'm trying to 'export' from an xml playlist to an html table for sharing. But the iTunes library file uses pairs of key values instead of more meaningful XML tags. Is there a simple way to also get the <value> in these key/value pairs?This gets me as far as the value of the <key>, i.e. Track ID Name Artist Album Artist etc., but I can't seem to find a way to also get the value of the next key, i.e. <integer> 49924, or <string> Ep. 35 | What Do Your... Can (should) I do this with ElementTree or should I move along to Regular Expressions or some other library? Thanks!
