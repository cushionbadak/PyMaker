This question already has an answer here:How do I change directory (cd) in Python?                    14 answers                This isnt a duplicate, as the original answer did not help into implementing it into my raw input command interpreter. Credit to original question/answer where due.So im working on a dos style os in python (you madman) and i was wondering how or even if i could execute a command that would let me switch between directories like a regular command prompt would let you do. Im not sure how well im explaining myself but basically i would have the same command as cd in terminal so i could read files imbedded in folders, change between folders etc. I dont need any sort of limit on how complex it is but i would prefer if it isnt too long. I have yet to find a clear solution to this. in a best case scenario, this is all you would need to inputthis would be inputted into a raw input and then executed so im assuming it would require splits so it knows that before the space there is 'cd' and after the space there is the filenameit would be used like thisdirectory=raw_input("enter cd followed with a directory")This might be a bit much to ask, not even sure if it is possible
import osos.chdir('folder1')or os.chdir('folderinfolder1')
I have done this except using C while creating a shell, in my case I used a library with the chdir function and it looked like this:I used the shell environment to update the PWD and OLDPWD which allows you to implement that into your shell as well.
