Have worked through most examples but am still learning async in Python. I am having trouble why this example of code will not print "i am async".
Your code attempts to submit tasks to the event loop from a different thread. To do that, you must use run_coroutine_threadsafe:Please note that combining asyncio and threads should only be done in special circumstances, such as when introducing asyncio to a legacy application where the new functionality needs to be added gradually. If you are writing new code, you almost certainly want the main to be a coroutine, run from top-level using asyncio.run(main()).To run a legacy synchronous function from asyncio code, you can always use run_in_executor.
