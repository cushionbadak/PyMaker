So I have this list formatted as <self.ID> - <neighbor>:My goal is to have it output as suchSo basically put all of the same self.ID's on the same line and omit the comma after the last pair. Is there something in python that can do this, or does anyone know a fancy algorithm that can help? Thanks.All I have right now is this:This will obviously print line by line. I guess I'm just looking for a push in the right direction toward what i'm trying to doUPDATE:here is my new code:and my new output:I'm close. How do I stop it from repeating those pairs?
How group_by works https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby
Not very clear the inputs, but will share below code toget you started:
Why not just use the zip operator? Not 100% sure whether this is the input you mean.where example[0::2] selects every second element starting from the index 0 and example[1::2] every second element starting at index 1and b[:-1] gets rid of the ","

Solution:My goal was to have a list in the form <self.ID> - <neighbor>, ...My original code with output:My final code with output:Thanks everyone for your help.
