I have the necessity to check if a specific value correspond to the value of a multidimensional dict (specifying the key).I'm coming from a PHP environment and I know that there's a function that does that: array_column There's something like this also for Python?Possible output specifying key1 in order to check if a value correspond:
You can use a list comprehension:Output:If you wanted to emulate the third argument of array_column, the index key, you can use dictionary comprehension:Output:
You can extract all values for a key of all dicts:Output:You should use dict.get(key) to get a None in case a key is missing.Doku:Why dict.get(key) instead of dict[key]? (StackOverflow)dict.get(key) (python.org)
