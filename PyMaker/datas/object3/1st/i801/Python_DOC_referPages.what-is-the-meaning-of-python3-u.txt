When running a Python file from the command line, you use python3 <file>, but VSCode Code Runner uses python3 -u <file> (by default), so I was wondering:What's the difference (since after testing I see no visibledifference)? What is the -u part called?
The -u flag, according to Python's --help statement:force the binary I/O layers of stdout and stderr to be unbuffered; stdin is always buffered; text I/O layer will be line-buffered; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=xThis is documented here in the Python docs.These are known as command line options. There are a number of them, which you can read about using python3 --help.
