This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                python - regex search and findall                    2 answers                I'm trying to understand a seemingly easy case while learning regular expressions.Suppose I have a code like this:For some reason, bonly returns this result: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 66), match='Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element >As you can see, it's not a full result that I was expecting. However, if I use re.findall() I get ['Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element is 20 minutes old']Am I misunderstanding something here? Shouldn't re.search() return the full match as well?
The method re.findall returns a list of matched substrings, but the method re.search returns a match object, you can recover the full matched substring like this.What you were seeing, <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 66), match='Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element >, is only a representation of the object.
