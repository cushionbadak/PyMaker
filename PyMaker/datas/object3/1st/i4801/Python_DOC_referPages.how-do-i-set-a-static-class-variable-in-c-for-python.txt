According to Python documentation, implementing a class in C for Python can be roughly divided into three steps:  defining the Object (the data impl)  defining the Type (the behavior wrapper)  defining concrete behaviors, and set them into corresponding tp_xx slots  For new function, init function, instance members, attributes, and even dealloc, all of them can be found a slot in PyTypeObject declaration, like tp_new, tp_init, tp_members, tp_methods and tp_dealloc. But there is not a slot like tp_statics. Where should I declare the static variables and where should I set them up? I searched for the internet but got nothing. Could anyone give me a clue about this?
Maybe you should check out this question.There is no static keyword in Python, class attributes are stored in class.__dict__.
@avram has mentioned an answer which solved my problem.But for anyone who found that your static attributes does not get updated after modification, you may check PyType_Modified function.
