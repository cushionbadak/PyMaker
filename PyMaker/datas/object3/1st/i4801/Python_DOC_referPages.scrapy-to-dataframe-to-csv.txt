I have a scrapy code here that outputs a json file. I then imported the json file into a dataframe using jupyter notebook to clean the data. However, what I really want to do is be able to run the scrapy spider and output the data as a CSV already cleaned, instead of me saving the scraped data as a json file and going into jupyter notebook to clean it. Is there anyway to connect the two process? Below is my spider code:And this is my code for cleaning the data:EDIT:Per @stranac's help, I've updated my pipeline with the the code below. However for some reason, I seem to be missing/some rows I do not want are being deleted. It seems like if I comment out item['performance'] = datetime.datetime.strptime(item['performance'][26:],'%Y-%m-%d-%H-%p'), it would works fine.
The simplest way to do this would be to write your own item pipeline, and do the cleanup per item in process_item(), instead of doing it all at once using pandas.Sidenote:lstrip and rstrip don't do what you think, they just happen to produce the correct result in this case.EDIT:The error you get is caused by the same item being yielded multiple times from parse_ticketinv.This causes the already-modified item (item['performance'] being replaced by a datetime object) to pass through the pipeline again, causing a TypeError.The simplest way to solve the problem is creating a new item each loop, or yielding item copies:
