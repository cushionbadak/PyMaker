I'm trying to build a simple application with flask and I've decided to also use gunicorn and docker.At the moment I have this configuration:My docker-compose.yml:My __init__.py:This minimal configuration works and I'm able to access my application and get my index page.What I don't like is having my app created inside the __init__.py so I would like to move the app creation inside an app.py file.The new structure will be:app.py will have the content of the old __init__.py file and the new __init__.py file would be empty.This doesn't work. I get an errorFailed to find application: 'myapp'and I don't understand why.Any idea about this?
In the first configuration, your Flask app was located directly in the package myapp; after you moved it, it is in the module myapp.app.Gunicorn expects the app to be specified as module_name:variable_name, somewhat like from module_name import variable_name.Option one: specify the correct module path:Option two: add the app back to myapp. In myapp/__init__.py, add Note that if the variable and the module share the name, the module will be overshadowed (not a good thing, although not a critical either).
