I am creating a seating plan for a movie theater and I am having a problem with adding a seat request after already purchasing one seat. Here is the code I have been working on After choosing option 4 and purchasing a seat and keep answering to input the row you want and the seat when you input another different row and seat coordinates it says "This seat has already been taken"I have been looking everywhere for an answer and I cant seem to find something. Please help if you can, thanks. 
The any method returns:True if at least one element of an iterable is true.False if all elements are false or if an iterable is empty.Refer Python Documentation for any method usageLine 42 if any((str(rowx) + "," + str(rowy)) for x in taken_seats):, should actually be if (str(rowx) + "," + str(rowy) in taken_seats): .That should check whether the selected seat is present in the list taken_sets.
