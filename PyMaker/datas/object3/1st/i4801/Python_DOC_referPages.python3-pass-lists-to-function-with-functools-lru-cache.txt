I want to cache a function that takes a list as a parameter, but when I try to do so with the functools.lru_cache decorator, it fails with TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'.
This fails because a list is unhashable. This would make it hard for Python to know what values are cached. A way to fix this is by converting lists to tuples before passing them to a cached function: since tuples are immutable and hashable, they can be cached.
