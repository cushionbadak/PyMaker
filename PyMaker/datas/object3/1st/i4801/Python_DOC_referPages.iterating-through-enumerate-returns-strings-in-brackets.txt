I have list of teams and I wanted to actually put them in a database but I have problem looping with enumerateSo this the listI first tried out this and simple for loop and no problem with it.returnsThen I wanted to add some bit of format and tried out enumeratereturnsWhy does it return with brackets, quotes e.t.c. and while the other one is not? or am missing something? I am fairly new to python by the way. My expected ouput is this
You can try:enumerate returns the index (1-3 in this case) and each value of the iterable (teams in this case).  The values returned from the iterable will be tuples.  You can expand the tuple as shown above.
The enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable so your num is still each item in your array (i.e. the tuple).
