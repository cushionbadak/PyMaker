I am trying to create a list of regexp pattern which I can use for patter matching like below oneNow while I am checking the o/p of it, its shows And using below code it not able to match the pattern.I check but for raw input also python escaped the "\".How can I prevent this.
From the docs:re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. None of your patterns can be found at the beginning of msg, so it returns None.If instead you use re.search, it will find the part of the string I assume you're looking for:
