I am writing a Python3 program, in which I need to be able to override some method on the fly. My folder structure is more like:In prog.py I want to call a calc() function which is defined both in add.py and minus.py. I wish that the code can work as if:But importing in the middle of a function seems awful and might slow down the whole program. Is there any workaround that can achieve the same effect?I am trying to be flexible so that I can add more methods later on, so I avoid if statements and import all the modules at once.
You have 2 options:Import the modules, and use the module name with calc attributes.Import the calc functions under alternate names with from ... import ... asEither way, I'd store the function references in a dictionary, rather than use if .. elif to pick one.The first approachor the second:If you needed to import modules dynamically, then use importlib.import_module(), no need to worry about name clashes:
