I am trying to parse and extract values from my time data 2018-03-11 13:15:31.734874+01:00. I'm using strptime() to do this with the %Y %m %d %H:%M:%S.%f %Z format but I am getting this error:Also, I don't know how to handle the +1:00 in my time data. Can anyone help?
There are two problems here to solve.First is the format string. It should be %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f%z to match exact date separators and timezone sequence (without space).From strftime and strptime Behavior:%z (lower case)     UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMM (empty string if the object is naive).    (empty), +0000, -0400, +1030Second is the colon (:) in timezone offset '+01:00'. That can be left out using substring: s[:-3]+s[-2:] or string substitute.So the final answer is as below.
%Y %m %d  should be changed to %Y-%m-%d to match with the time string. Also, you need to remove the last : from the input to use with %z.Here is how you should do:
At first:%Y %m %d will not match 2018-03-11. You need to adapt it to the time string! %Y-%m-%d instead should work.Secondly:IF you are in python3, the %z was added for time stamps. However the timestamp has to be without the colon, e.g. +0100instead of +01:00. Therefore, if you use python3 this works:Btw the time_string after the editing looks like that:IF you are in python2, the %z won't work, here you have to use the parse function of the dateutil module, which is straight forward.
