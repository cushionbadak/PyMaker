this is my first ever Python script/question on Stackoverflow/step into real coding.I am looking to count the number of times certain strings appear within the rows I am iterating through then print out the values. I have not set up a delimiter so there is only one column. Essentially I am saying, if the column contains said string, add to the counter.The problem is, I get an output of 0 for all my variables. Any suggestions?Here is the code (sorry it's long).
I have not set up a delimiter so there is only one columnIf you do not specify a delimiter, the default one is used, which is a comma ,. So, there still may be multiple columns and, therefore, multiple elemtns in the list row.Now, the string in googlebot_string also contains commas, so, if this string is present in your input CSV, it never appears in row as a single element. Therefore googlebot_string in row is always false. Some of the other *_string strings have the same problem.You can open the file just as a text file (without using the csv module) and iterate over the lines.A dirty solution would be to specify a character that is not present in your input file as delimiter for csv.reader.
You are reading the file outside the with context manager.Your code should be:otherwise you are opening and closing the file before even reading it.EDIT:As @yann-vernier has pointed out, reader must be consumed inside the with block. That is, the for loop should be all indented.
