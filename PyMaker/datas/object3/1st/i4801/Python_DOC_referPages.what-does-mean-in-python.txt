What is the meaning of _ after for in this code?
_ has 3 main conventional uses in Python:To hold the result of the last executed expression(/statement) in an interactiveinterpreter session. This precedent was set by the standard CPythoninterpreter, and other interpreters have followed suitFor translation lookup in i18n (see thegettextdocumentation for example), as in code like:raise forms.ValidationError(_("Please enter a correct username"))As a general purpose "throwaway" variable name to indicate that partof a function result is being deliberately ignored, as in code like:label, has_label, _ = text.partition(':')The latter two purposes can conflict, so it is necessary to avoid using _ as a throwaway variable in any code block that also uses it for i18n translation (many folks prefer a double-underscore, __, as their throwaway variable for exactly this reason).
It's just a variable name, and it's conventional in python to use _ for throwaway variables.  It just indicates that the loop variable isn't actually used.
Underscore _ is considered as "I don't Care" or "Throwaway" variable in PythonThe python interpreter stores the last expression value to the special variable called _.The underscore _ is also used for ignoring the specific values. If you don’t need the specific values or the values are not used, just assign the values to underscore.Ignore a value when unpackingIgnore the index
There are 5 cases for using the underscore in Python.For storing the value of last expression in interpreter.For ignoring the specific values. (so-called “I don’t care”)To give special meanings and functions to name of vartiables or functions.To use as ‘Internationalization(i18n)’ or ‘Localization(l10n)’ functions.To separate the digits of number literal value.Here is a nice article with examples by mingrammer.
