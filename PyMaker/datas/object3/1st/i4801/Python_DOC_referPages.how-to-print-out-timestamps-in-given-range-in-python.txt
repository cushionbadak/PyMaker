This question already has an answer here:Checking date against date range in Python                    4 answers                new programmer just getting started with Python.How would I be able to print out a list of timestamps, every second, given a date range, for example 4/12/17 through 4/21/17 in date -d format?The output would be something along the lines ofWed Apr 12 00:00:00 CST 2017Wed Apr 12 00:00:01 CST 2017...Fri Apr 21 00:00:00 CST 2017It would ideally be in a nice, vertical list for the output.I am guessing the solution involves nested for loops, but I just can't wrap my head around the process of making it happen.Thanks for the help!
Use datetime: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlAt a high level, I would start with initializing a datetime object with the first timestamp in your range, and a 1-second timedelta object.Then you could use a while loop and an endDatetime object with your last time in the range:Or you can calculate how many seconds are between the first and last end time and use a for loop:
