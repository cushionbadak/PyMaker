I have 2 Counters (Counter from collections), and I want to append one to the other, while the overlapping keys from the first counter would be ignored. Like the dic.update (python dictionaries update)For example:So something like (ignore overlapping keys from the first counter):I guess I could always convert it to some kind of a dictionary and then convert it back to Counter, or use a condition. But I was wondering if there is a better option, because I'm using it on a pretty large data set.
Counter is a dict subclass, so you can explicitly invoke dict.update and pass two counters as the arguments:
You can also use dict unpacking
