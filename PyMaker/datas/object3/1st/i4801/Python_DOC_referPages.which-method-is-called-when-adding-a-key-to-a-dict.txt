I would like to inherit the OrderedDict class to set up a maximum length to the dict.I did : But now I don't see which function to overwrite to catch the "adding a key" event.I Googled for a while without finding the answer. Even special functions are not clearly an answer.
Use the dunder method __setitem__ as mentioned in the comments by  @AshwiniChaudhary. You need to distinguish overwriting and setting a new key, though.Note that while the update method also allows adding new keys, it calls __setitem__ under the hood, as mentioned in the comments.If the dictionary exceeds the maximum size you might want to self.popitem(last=False) until it matches the length (last=False for FIFO order, last=True for LIFO order, the default).
