let say I have a list of lists The number of lists in the list is not known in advance.I want to have all combinations of elements from the different list, so but if there common elements in the different list, all these combinations need to be deleted. So if for example, a1 = c2, then the combinations [a1, b1, c2], [a1, b2, c2] need to be deleted in the resulting list. To get all possible combinations, you can use the answer on All possible permutations of a set of lists in Python, but can you automaticaly delete all combinations with common elements?
1) itertools.product2) filter with lambda
You are looking for the Cartesian Product of your lists. Use itertools.product(), and filter the elements to make sure none are equal:I'm assuming that by a1 = c2 you mean that all values in the combination need to be unique, the above tests for this by creating a set from the combination. If the set length is smaller than the combination length, you had repeated values.You can put this filter into a generator function:then use for unique in unique_product(*input_lists):You can also use the filter() function to achieve the same, but that incurs a function call for each combination produced.
