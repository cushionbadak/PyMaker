Set-upI'm looking for all the integer pairs (x,y) in 2 closed sets: [822,2000] and [506,1231] such that x/y=1.624.Code so farI tried,But this gives a SyntaxError: invalid syntax pointing to the = in the code. And if I do,I get NameError: name 'y' is not defined. How do I solve this?
Comparing float calculations with == is difficult due to the nature of float arithmetics. It is often better to compare like this:By substracting the wanted value from your result and and comparing its absolute value against something kindof small you get better results.Result (using a set):Python rounding error with float numbers
For the first one you are using the assignment operator instead of the equivalent operator so it should be: a = [[(x,y)] for x in range(822,2001) and y in range(506,1232) if x/y == 1.624]And for the second you're probably better off using two for loopsa = [[(x,y)] for x in range(822,2001) for y in range(506,1232) if x/y <= 1.624]The second one would not make sense as you said it because x and y are coming from lists that have an unequal number of elements so you cannot loop over them like that
