I am writing a simple Python program to store user inputted lap times in a list and then have a few functions performed on that list. My problem is, despite explicitly declaring the lap times as 'float' before appending them into the list, they are still getting stored as strings. This means I cannot perform functions like sum() on the list as I am getting error messages such as: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'.Here is the code:After declaring 'lap' as a float in the else clause, I have written written a line to print the data type of 'lap', and when run I get told it's a string!I have done the same thing with the print(type(lapTimes[-1])) line just to make sure, and yep I still get told the data is a string.There are supposed to be more lines of code on the bottom printing the sum of the list and the average lap time, which will not work because of this problem.
My problem is, despite explicitly declaring the lap times as 'float'  before appending them into the list, they are still getting stored as  strings.You have done no such thing. Python doesn't have variable declarations. You have simply called the float type constructor and passed it a string as an argument. It returns the float value you are expecting, but you never capture its output, and it is immediately discarded. Instead, do:
Because you are not assigning the value of float(lap). Writeor better
Please check documentation about float()https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#floatThe return value of float() is a float.In else block, you need write codes like this:
you should write lap = float(lap). Just writing float(lap) does nothing to the original lap variable.
You missed assignment of lap after converting to float. That's why saw error.
