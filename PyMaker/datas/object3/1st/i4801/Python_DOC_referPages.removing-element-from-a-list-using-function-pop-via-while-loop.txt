Python does not return what I seek.What is wrong here?No solutionsHints are appreciated.
Since you essentially want to do left popping, you might want to consider using a deque rather than a list.
Once you have removed the element at index 0, the element now at index 0 is really what was at index 1 as all the elements are "shifted along". So, you do not need the for-loop inside the while, you merely need to call x.pop(0) at the start of the while.So, the code would look something like:completing with x as [].Note that popping the first element is actually O(n) complexity (compared to popping the last which is O(1)). So if you were looking for efficiency, you could use a double-ended queue which permits the use of popleft() (equivalent to pop(0)) but is O(1).So the implementation of that would simply be:which gives x as deque([]) but, if necessary, you could convert back to a list with list().
