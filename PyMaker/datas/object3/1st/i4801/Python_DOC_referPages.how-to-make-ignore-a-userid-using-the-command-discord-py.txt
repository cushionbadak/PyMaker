This is the code:I want to know how to import JSON so that I can stop use abusing my bot, if you can help me.
You can use the json module.Assuming you have a file in the same directory as your bot (named "ids.json"), which you want to load the IDs from:All you need to put in the "ids.json" file isYou are now free to use the ids variable in the same way as you are now.If you want to save the content of the ids variable to the file, you can use json.dump(ids, f)However, you do need to be careful of using the file too much. Dumping a lot can cause issues where data is not saved to the file properly.
