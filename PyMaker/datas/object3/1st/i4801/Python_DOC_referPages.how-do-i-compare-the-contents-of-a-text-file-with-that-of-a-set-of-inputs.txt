Natural Text
so I am trying to create a program that will allow a user to login using a username and password for a school project. however, my teacher (he has allowed me to ask FYI) wants us to think of a way to make it secure.so my thought process is that I would allow the user to create a login and store the usernames and passwords in a notepad file. to make these secure I decided to use the hash() function so that the username and passwords couldn't be seen even if the text file was accessed. the issue that I am running into is that I can't figure out how to get the program to see the saved hash version of the username and password in the text file and then compare it to the inputs for longing in without printing the hashes and or saving them as variables.I can't do this however because if I have more than one login saved in the login file I cant save all the hashed logins as one variable.if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated 
Load the file as a dictionary mapping usernames (or their hashes) to the hash of the password.You can iterate through the file and load each line into your dictionary.However this will be a bit fragile. What if some user want to have a space or comma in their username. A better and easier approach is to use a library to serialize and deserialize the dictionary. The common one used in python would be pickle or if you want the data to still be somewhat human readable json.
