I've created a hash function for an object. The problem I'm running into is that the value I created in the hash function, isn't what's returned from the function.So when I print from hash() I get 93792909800245310080479536979750034401273674738852415427366199722413460820022,but when I print hashkey I get 377513311013302392? Why?EDIT: So I called hash() explicitly and I got the number I was expecting, but since I overrode hash(), shouldn't I be getting the same value from hash()?
From the docs:Note hash() truncates the value returned from an objectâ€™s custom hash() method to the size of a Py_ssize_t. This is typically 8 bytes on 64-bit builds and 4 bytes on 32-bit builds.93792909800245310080479536979750034401273674738852415427366199722413460820022 is way above those limits.Try this:Output:
