I was just tidying up some code and ran into some trouble. I am getting an error I have never come across before ValueError: malformed node or string:['0.000', '37.903', 'nosing']My openLabels function at the top works fine and returns a list of items structured as you can see in the error message. I am doing some debugging and found it is the labelsToFrames function throwing the error. It is not accepting my list of lists as input. I have no idea why. Any direction would be much appreciated! 
The issue is that labelCorpus is a list of lists. As such, when you're executing labelToFrames and passing in labelCorpus, it is iterating over the list of lists, assigning each individual list to line and then trying to run ast.literal_eval on line. This then fails because ast.literal_eval requires either a string or expression node, not a list.The reason that labelCorpus is a list of lists comes from when it is assigned a value from the openLabels function. In the following section, you iterate over the file paths returned by glob.glob and open the files:On each open file you're iterating over the individual lines and then splitting each line in the file (which returns a list) and assigning it back to the line variable, which you then append to the textCorpus list. This list of lists is then what you return from the function and assign to labelCorpus in main.
I'm not at home so can't experiment at the moment but I believe the problem is the real numbers mixed in with the string. Try converting them to string first then pass them onto whatever function is utilizing them. I ran into this once a few months back and converting ahead of time was the answer.
