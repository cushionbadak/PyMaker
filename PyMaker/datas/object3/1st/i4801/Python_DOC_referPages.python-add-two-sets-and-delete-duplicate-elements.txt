How to add two sets and delete duplicates
Try this:Result:set(['a','b','c', 'd', 'e'])
You can get the union of both sets using the logical or operator |{'e', 'a', 'b', 'd', 'c'}If you want the set ordered and as a list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
Use union methodYou want to use the union method of a set:https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.unionhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=sets#frozenset.unionThe union method is the same as the | operator, so the line of code above is equivalent toUse in-place operatorIf you have no need to retain a or b, it would be better to use the update method, which will add the new members in place. That is,will produce the union in the existing data structure a. This is also performed by the equivalent codeSidenote: use set literalIn the code you provide, it would be faster to use the set literal notation with {element, element, ...}:because it will execute twice as fast and not generate the unused list object.
set() return <str set> so can't add two set togetherhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html
