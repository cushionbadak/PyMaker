Your code looks fine.  The problem is the Python version you are running.As mentioned in the comments above f strings were first introduced in Python 3.6 (see official documentation). If you want to use this feature you need to update to Python 3.6.  If you do not (or cannot) switch version you can use format() instead: OR use the old style %s (formatting string) operator:See: What does %s mean in Python?I would suggest format() over the second method though.If you are making code that will be run on Python versions before Python 3.6 it it a good idea to use the alternatives listed above.
