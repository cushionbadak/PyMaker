Update: I realize now that errors can occur when you scale down your code and then post a question. This is the same question but with the sample code matching the true situation. I also learned that you don't need the line continuation "\" when your python expression is ending in a comma ",".I can certainly get my projection/sum dictionary by using for loops, but is there a more Pythonic method? If for loops must be used is there a 'best python practice'.Also, if any of my wording is off please let me know the proper way to frame this using python terminology.Here is the code:
You were asked in the comments whether or not your keys were supposed to be strings (of tuples) or tuples themselves. Since you didn't really answer, here are two versions which account for both possibilities.
here is my solution for your problem:But it has one assumption, the key to your dictionary must be a tuple instead of a stringhere are the steps :I created the list of tuples from your input dictionary, the first element is the name, the second is the number.was to sort the array, it's important for the groupby function.group the items in the list day using the name as a keySum the element in the groups iterator using reduce and put the final results in a dictionary.{'mary': 11, 'mike': 9, 'tom': 2}if your input was is a string as you posted : create the list like this :but it still dirty a solution using regex solution may be better.
