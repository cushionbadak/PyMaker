New here and have been hunting around for the answer to this question. Working on a Project Euler question and attempting to add values of a function to a list using list.append, however nothing is being added to the list and I'm unsure why. Any help appreciated.Have tried defining the list inside and outside of the loop but to no avail.
As I said in a comment, you need to actually call the function somewhere, and you also need to give an argument to append :Moreover, don't use the name input for a variable since it's a Python function.
You need to pass the element you want to append as a parameter to append.
Pass the right argument:And of course, you need to call your function somewhere
