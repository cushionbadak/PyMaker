Natural Text
This should be really simple but I can't figure it out.  How do I extract the details for Stu?  So I want to see Name: Stu, Age:14, Weight: 99.5Side-question, is this the correct format to store this type of dictionary?
I'd use a structure like this and as far as the getting the data out
As mentioned, set is unordered. Here is one solution using lists.
Right now, your values are all sets, so you basically have no way to fetch a specific value. Switch these to a a list, and given you know Stu is the second person, you can assemble Stu:More naturally, you could just store your data like so:So getting Stu's info becomes pets_3['Stu'].
