I have a column called `cc_flags' in a Python astropy table. It looks like::cc_flagsI'd like to pull out every row with the last character of the four if it is a '0'., i.e a '***0' or a '???0' matcher. I'm getting an with What am I doing wrong?!
If you're not limited to regex or regex like, this is simple:This list comprehension will extract out each element from data['cc_flags'] into a variable named line, and return a resulting list that is only comprised of the last character of line being a 0.(Obviously, if you need your if statement to be more specific, you can add whatever else you need into the filter condition.)
? does not mean "any character" in regex. Swap your ?s for .s
As others have said, you need to use . instead of ?. Another way is to use {} to specify how many matches.For example, try this:. means match any character (except for line terminators){3} means match exactly 3 times
The issue is with regex not escaping the special characters in your search term. To get this to work, simply change your statement to the following:data['cc_flags'] should be a string, not a list.
