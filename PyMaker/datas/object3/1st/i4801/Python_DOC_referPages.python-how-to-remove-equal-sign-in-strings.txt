Python how to remove = in strings?how to match = ?
You can replace it with an empty string:For reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace
You can use the replace method (easiest):or the translate method (probably faster on large amounts of data):or the re.sub method (most powerful, i.e. can do much more):
strip removes characters from the beginning and from the end of the string!From the documentation: Since you "=" is neither at the beggining nor at the end of your string, you can't use strip for your purpose. You need to use replace.
