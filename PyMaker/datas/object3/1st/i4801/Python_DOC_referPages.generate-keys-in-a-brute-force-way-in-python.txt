I am trying to generate all possible keys on a known key_length on Python.Keys are defined as list of integers between 0 and 255.I am having trouble to generate all the possible keys...If key_length were a constant number such as 2, I would have known how to handle this - it's just 2 for-loops, you know. However, when it's in a variable then I don't know how many for-loops I need to write. I guess I need a different approach. That's what make it difficult for me.Thanks for the help!
you could use itertools.product:
You can do this probably fastest with numpy's indicesYou you want to do it by yourself, it is gonna be more complicatedx is a list wit all combinations of 1 digitwhile the dimension is lower than the maximal number you give I add all possible digits to all previous combinations. Note, that you have to copy the previously found combination because of the mutuability of a python list.
