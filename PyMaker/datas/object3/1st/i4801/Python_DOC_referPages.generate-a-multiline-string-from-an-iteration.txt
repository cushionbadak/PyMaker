ths is probably a dumb question... I'm working with some data that is generated, line by line, after an iteration and I'd like to store the result for further processing in a multiline string. As an example, let me show you this:The result is: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100But I'd like it to be a multiline string:What is te correct way to achieve this?
In this line is_string  += str(i) use this is_string += str(i) + '\n' instead
You could build a multi line string as follows:Or iteratively as:These methods avoid string concatenation which should be avoided if possible as they are less efficient.Strings have a join() method which takes a list of strings to join together, so:would give you a string:(where \n is the newline character)
Add a newline after each element.
is_string = is_string +  str(i) + '\n'Is this what your are looking for?Be careful dealing with the '\n', you may use something like is_string.split('\n') to retreive each sub string
I think you just have to add \n character at the end of the each insertion and this will solve your problem:hope, it helps!
You can do it in a list or as a string adding a new line \n to each..
