In order to ensure that passwords are always stored, hashed and salted in the database, I decided to use a descriptor which will automatically hash the password when one is provided, e.g user.password = "jinja125".Here is my codeHowever when I try to run some tests, I get this error.How can I best fix this error?
From the documentation:random.getrandbits(k)  Returns a python long int with k random bits.Here k==128 so 1<<128check the size value you're trying to create a bytes array from (for instance):That's way too big for array indexing, not to mention the memory. You may want to reduce drastically your value. I suppose you meant 2**7 (7-bit random) not 1<<128now if you wanted to generate 128 random bytes, you'd do that instead:no need to call getrandbits for that. As Amadan noted, maybe you want 128 bits, not bytes, so make that range(16) instead. Well, now that you know, you can adjust to your actual needs.
