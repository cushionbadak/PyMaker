I use opencv to crop images and I'd like to save them to the models, I load the file directly to computeLogoFromMemoryFILE where it is processed, from there how can I save the image to TempImage model?views.py: cv2:cropped_image variable is an opencv array :
In Django everytime you needs to manipulate uploaded files, similar images and set these to Model-Fields you must use Django File class, you can doing similar this code:Note: After setup file to model field this file cloned on the MEDIA_ROOT, it is better that you remove old image or use BytesIO instead of using file to store manipulated image.
