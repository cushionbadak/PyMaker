For example, if I want to detect all odd numbers in an array and set them to zero, I can use:which works like a charm.But when I try something likeit expects two arguments. Likewise,  does not work. How can I pass that divisor argument from within map()?
Try using lambda functionAnd rather than pass did you mean return n?
You can use functools.partial to make partial functions
You make a function which returns a function:BTW, you can entirely omit empty branches like else: pass; it doesn't do anything. Since it results in a None, I don't think that's what you want either. You probably want return n there instead.
Another approach, instead of using partial, is to supply an infinite (or at least, long enough) sequence of 2nd arguments for the two-argument function:In Python 2, map will append None as necessary to the shorter of the two sequences to make them the same length. Assuming that will cause problems (either because your function cannot handle None as an input value or you end up with an infinite loop), you can either use itertools.imap, which stops after exhausting the shorter sequence:or pass the length of numbers as a second argument to repeat so that the two sequences are the same length.
