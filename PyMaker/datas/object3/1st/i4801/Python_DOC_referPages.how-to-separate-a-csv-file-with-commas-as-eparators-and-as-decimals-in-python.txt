I have this data in a CSV file and i want to read it in python. The problem is that the decimal points and the delimiter are both commas. How can I read the CSV file in a way that the 1,2,3,4,6,8,10,11 and 15 commas are used as delimiters and the other commas are used as decimals?. Thanksdata in csv file
