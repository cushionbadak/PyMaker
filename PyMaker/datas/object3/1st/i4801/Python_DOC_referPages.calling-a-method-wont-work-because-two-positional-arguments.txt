I'm really confused about how classes work, I've written this code but get the error message but surely the object does have that attribute since it is of the class pigLatin_class?edit: okay i see my initial mistake, now if I inputit says I've given 2 positional arguments?
surely the object does have that attribute since it is of the class "pigLatin_class"?But it's not. You do create an instance of pigLatin_class, but then you immediately replace it with an instance of str:And str isn't pigLatin_class, and doesn't have a pLatin_converter method.I think you wanted something like this:But then you need to fix a few more bugs. Most crucially, the __init__ method of your class has to take a self parameter, as well as a string parameter, and then it needs to store things—including that string parameter value—on that self to be used later:And then, your methods will also take self and can use those attributes:You may have instead wanted something like this:In that case, you won't be taking string as a second parameter in __init__ and storing it in self.string, you'll instead be taking it as a second parameter in pLatin_converter. Hopefully you know enough now to change it to work that way, and to understand the difference.
You are passing the string 'Hi I'm Amy' to the pLatin_converter() method.Instead, you need to do this:You need to define variables that are class based with self.var_name and then you can access them throughout the class, by passing self as a method argument. In this case you pass the string to init() and save it in self.string variable, then you can access it when pLatin_converter() method is called.
