I have trying to generate a deck of cards that print out a list of 7 values and then I want to put the list into order. I am a basic python coder and working my way through a python for beginners book I bought. how could I put the list into order or am I completely wrong 

Use itertools.product to generate the full deck of cards. It basically gives you a sequence of every element of the first iterable with every element of the second iterable. You can then shuffle the deck using random.shuffle, just like you would a real deck.Then take a slice of the first 7 elements and perform a sort on them. To sort you will need to provide a key function, as the natural sort order is not what you want. We can provide a tuple as a return value of the key function and it acts as a tie breaker for when the first character is the same. What we want to sort on is the index of a particular character in the input tuples (rank, suit). The first sorting key just uses the tuple.index method to get the indexes of the particular characters in the tuples. This is simple but it is slow, as it has to count up the tuple every time (O(n) or linear time complexity). Those indices never change, so we can precompute them into a dict and get constant time look up in the key function, which is faster. For applications like this where the tuples are small and number of calculations are small the gains may not be so significant, so either solution is probably acceptable.I did the sort as rank first then suit. Your question doesnt specify either way, but perhaps sorting them suit is what you want? In which case you should find it a useful exercise to convert the key functions. Here's the code
