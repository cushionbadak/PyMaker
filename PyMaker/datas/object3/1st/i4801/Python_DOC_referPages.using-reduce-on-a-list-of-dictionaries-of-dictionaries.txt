Here is the given list. I need to use the map and reduce function so that I can have a final result of I have written a function using mapThat returnsIt combines the f1 and f2 of the first and second dictionaries, but I am unsure of how to use reduce on the dictionaries to get the final result. 
Without using map and reduce, I would be inclined to do something like this:Using reduce (which really is not the right function for the job, and is not in Python 3) on your current progress would be something like this:
You can use collections.Counter to sum your list of counter dictionaries.Moreover, your dictionary flattening logic can be optimised via itertools.chain.This works for an arbitrary length list of dictionaries, with no key matching requirements across dictionaries.The second parameter of sum is a start value. It is set to an empty Counter object to avoid TypeError.
You can use purely map and reduce like so:Output:
