With the new formatting syntax, Python can easily be made to print a thousands separator:So the comma takes care for this. How can this be done with the old syntax - without using locale? 
printf-style formatting does not support thousand separator.You need to build a string with thousand separator:Built-in function format uses the same Format Specification Mini-Language that str.format uses.If you can't use format, see this question for alternatives.
