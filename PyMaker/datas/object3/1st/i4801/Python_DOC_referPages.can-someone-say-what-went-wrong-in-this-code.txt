I am working on a problem which takes a nums, row, column as parameters and returns a resultant matrix of size row x column.When I tested for input like ([[1,2],[3,4]], 4, 1) it generates output [[4],[4],[4],[4]] instead of [[1],[2],[3],[4]]
This creates a list of r references to the same inner list. So, whenever you modify m[0], you're also modifying m[1], and so on, because they're the same list.You probably wanted something like this:
[0]*4 gives you four copies of the same object, not four independent lists.Try
