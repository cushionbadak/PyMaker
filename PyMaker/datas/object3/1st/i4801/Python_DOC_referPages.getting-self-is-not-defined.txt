I'm new to python actually and I have a func that will add and sort, so I wanted to print the sorted list table but i'm getting an error This is the code - what am I doing wrong? 
Your method has to accept self as default parameter.change addsort method signature as below.Adding self as parameter makes the method available for all the objects/instances of the class.If you don't want addsort to be called/used by an instance, make it a class method and make sure it is not dependent on any of the self parameters.
