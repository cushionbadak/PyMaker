If what you need is to detect the date and the field next to it, you could use the following regex:Working example:
The string you provided looks like a line from a csv file and another option is to use Pythons csv module.Since I don't know if you have a file or list full of these strings, this example shows how you could take this single string and read it into csv.reader using io.StringIO (Python 3.6.4)If you had the actual csv file with the header, you could use csv.DictReader and then do something like print(line['date']) (assuming the key was 'date').
