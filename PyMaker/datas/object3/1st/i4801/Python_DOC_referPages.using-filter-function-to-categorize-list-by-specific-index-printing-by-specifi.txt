I am creating and manipulating a list in Python, I am having trouble categorizing my lists via filter function...I have 3 lists, that I append into one list, I frequently print (the_list) along the way, here is my code:Is there a way to filter these lists into categories by a specific index number, in this case index [1] (Which is population), and subsequently output these list items by printing, either their list name or their value at index [0]...example 'Georgia' or "list1"
If you want to pass index as argument and maintain some flexibility of your list (you may have population at index other than 1), you can do thisOr more generically,I think this is what you actually want to achieve.
Python filter documentation:filter(function, iterable) Construct an iterator from those elements  of iterable for which function returns true. iterable may be either a  sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If  function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all  elements of iterable that are false are removed.Note that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to the generator  expression (item for item in iterable if function(item)) if function  is not None and (item for item in iterable if item) if function is  None.It's unclear what you mean, but I'll try to help you the best I can.First of all: you're greaterThanTen function takes index as input, at least it looks that way. filter doesn't pass index as an argument to greaterThanTen, but rather the element at that index.Another thing: I don't know if you understand that filter only returns one 'category' as output -- you can only sort one condition at a time. Also, filter doesn't operate on the original list, but creates a new sequence, so filter(greaterThanTen, the_list) doesn't actually change anything. What you should do is: the_list = filter(greaterThanTen, the_list).If you want to sort by the value at index 1 for each element in the list, you can do this:This is similar to the function you're using as a key to sort.Another another thing: Why are you trying to call the_list in greaterThanTen, it makes no sense. The function stops evaluating code after the return statement.Printing:If you want to print a value from a specific index in a list just ask for that index.print(LIST[index])I hope this helps.
You could probably just do some sort of list comprehension and avoid filtering altogether. This to me is simpler/more readable and accomplishes your objective.
