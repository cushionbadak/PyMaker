Say I have the following regular expression and searchesI know that num.group("int") gives 123 and num.group("alpha_num") gives None.Similarly letter.group("int") give None and letter.group("alpha_num") give zHowever, what I want is a way to get the "named category" for an arbitrary match.So if I have an arbitrary match, say new_match, I could call new_match.named_category() and it would return "int" or "alpha_num" depending on how it matched.  Does any such command exist or do I have to create my own?Thanks!
