I have my own local HTML file open in my browser. When I click a certain button, the class to the button changes to "selected." What I want to do is have Python take the current updated HTML of the file in the browser and overwrite it as the original HTML file.

So I'm not sure how to receive the structured HTML into Python for further processing.
You can try using the selenium package. You will need to have the webdriver.exe for the browser of your choice in the same folder you are running this from (code below uses Chrome Web Driver). This example, for brevity, requires you to run it as a live script from the console.This will start the webdriver. It will look just like an ordinary browser.Make some changes to the site, and when you are done:This will return the modified html as a string into html that you can use to overwrite your original html file.
You can use the built in library http.server to serve pages.In one console, change to your working directory:And in another:You'll see log entries in the server window, e.g.
