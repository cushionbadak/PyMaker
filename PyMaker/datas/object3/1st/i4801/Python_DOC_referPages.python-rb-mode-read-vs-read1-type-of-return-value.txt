I've read many related threads here and gone deep into the doc (Python 3.6), but didn't find why this happens (captured from Python shell):What interprets the single-read byte? is it the read(), is it the list? sequence/iterable/generator/yield/...?
The clue is in the type of the objects you are printing. While x and y are both bytes objects, you are printing the "whole" one character string x, while you are printing a single byte of it with y[0].You will probably find that x[0] similarly evaluates to 240.In other words, type('\xf0') is bytes, but type('\xf0[0]) is int.
