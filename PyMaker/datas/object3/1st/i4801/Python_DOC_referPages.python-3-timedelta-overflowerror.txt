I have a large database that I am loading into an in-memory cache. I have a process that does this iterating through the data day by day. Recently this process has started throwing the following error:OverflowError: date value out of range for the linestart_day = start_day - datetime.timedelta(days = 1)This is running in Python 3.4.3 on Ubuntu 14.04.5
You have reached datetime.date.min, or the first of January of the year 1:If you started at datetime.date.today(), then it took your code a little over 736k steps to get there:Your code probably has a bug somewhere that is subtracting too often.
