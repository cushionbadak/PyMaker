Trying to adapt your code to Python 3, I came up with this:There are some things that I needed to take into account:in Python 3, the way to encode/decode into base64 is by using the base64 moduleto cast a bytes object into a string, I used the bytes.decode methodto cast a string object into a bytes object, I used the str.encode functionthe hashlib.md5 function accepts a bytesobject (strings need to be previously encoded)I changed the way you concatenate strings (i.e. str1 + str2) with a more pythonic construction: '{}{}'.format(str1, str2)I hope this will be helpful ;)
