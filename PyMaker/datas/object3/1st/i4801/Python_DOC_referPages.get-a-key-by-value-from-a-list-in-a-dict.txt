I need to get a key from a dict, but the corresponding value is a list and I only have one value (one element) of the list. I already found but this doesn't work, as it produces an value error because of the target value being only one element of the list. How can I get the key only using one element of the list (using only the (16,16)? 
The part you're missing is how to find a given value in a list: it's the in operator.This is the long way to write the comprehension and filter, but it makes the steps obvious.
Dictionarys are great if you need a value by key, not so great the other way around. You can always iterate over the dicts items:Doku:  dictionarys 
Why you are using only a part of the list?Small modification in your code:prints george as expected.Works with python 3.6.0
