is there a regex to find a letter beween two numbers in a string by using Python ?For instance, given a string like this one "AAPL1809A170" I would like to extract A only...again, given "XOM1809C123" I would like to extract C only...To solve my problem I just tried this regex: "\d{1}[A-Z]{1}\d{1}" but it extract 9A1 or 9C1 given examples strings here above.Thank you for replying back if possible
You can use a positive lookahead and positive lookbehind:Output:
You can use a capture group to tell the regex engine exactly what you want it to extract from the string - it'll be returned as a Match Object:
You can use regex (.*\d)([A-Z])(\d.*) - This will give you exact ONE Alphabet between numbers.I find http://rubular.com/ very handy to test regex.
You can use groups to extract what you want from the match:The group is whatever you put between parenthesis (), e.g., [A-Z], and then you print the group. Since there's only one group specified, ([A-Z]), use print(match.group(1)) to print the matched letter. In the case above, this will return A.
