Can some one help me when I try to execute this its return Sorry for my bad English Grammar
You need to change your loop so that i only iterates up to len(inputArray) - 1.Like this:This is because your noob array is essentially just each adjacent pair of elements in inputArray. Naturally, the number of pairs in a list of i elements is i - 1. This means that you need to change your loop to stop one iteration before, as it's throwing the IndexError when t is the len(inputArray) - 1 and b is the len(inputArray) (b isn't a valid value in the last iteration of your current code as there's not that many elements).
Here you set i=0, t=0, and b=1, thus your b always greater than i by 1. So, in the last loop (where t and i should equal len(inputArray) -1), the value of b should be len(inputArray) which is bigger than the length of your array.I am not very sure about your excepted output, but I guess you could fix it like following: 
You can change the while loop for a for loop and use try / except to return the result when it reaches the end of the iteration.  You can also add in extra except clauses to catch other errors and make use of else and finally if needs be .. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
Here zip is used to create the adjacency pair
