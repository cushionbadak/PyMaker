I need to retrieve datetime info from Google Calendar API. I am looking into this quickstart example. It retrieves start time of the meeting in a string format. How can I retrieve the time in datetime format, not in a string format. So I can extract out year, month, hour, minute etc. information. EDIT: An example output from the above statement
How about using dateutil? I think that there may be other methods. So please think of this as one of them.Modified script :Reference :dateutilIf I misunderstand your question, I'm sorry.
