Natural Text
I want to extract strings with labels from text data in python.I have written following code written , but this replaces the actual data with the string , i want to extract that I have following text as input :Expected_output is:How can i get above output Any ideas?
You may fix it by adding .*? before and .* after the pattern you have and replace with r'\1 : DATESTR'See the  regex demo. With .*? you match any 0+ chars other than line break chars, as few as possible, and with .* you match any 0+ chars other than line break chars, as many as possible, and that way you remove what you do not need by just matching and you keep what you capture.You may also use your regex to extract the date and then append : DATESTR to it:See the Python demo.
You can give a try to datefinderHere I have tried to get your example done with it:  I guess this will help you. It can get any date string out of your string.
from your example you want to do 2 things:Find a date-like stringAdd another string at the end of your matchThe solution I propose here might not be the best but it does the thing. I propose you get the match that your regex can find, and then use that match to format whatever you want to print.The output is:There might be some other functions that fit your needs in the documentation. That's what I just used.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
