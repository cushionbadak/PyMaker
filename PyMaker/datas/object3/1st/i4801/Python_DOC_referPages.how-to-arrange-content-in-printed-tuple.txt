Natural Text
I am trying to arrange content in a tuple to fit a specific column layout.Example layout:But when I iterate over the tuple to print the contents, it outputs:Also when I return row, it only returns the first tuple and not all of them. I am returning it because I want to use it in another function.This is the code below:I use the join method, but I couldn't find ljust, which I think is no longer available in python3.
Use Python's string .format() to give each of your elements a fixed width:Giving you:The format() command works by replacing each {} seen in the string by an argument passed to it, in this case *row. The * has the effect of expanding the three values inside row to be the three arguments required to be expanded.To return the formatted text, you would need to first create a list of formatted rows, and then use '\n'.join() to join them all together will newlines at the end:This could also be done very neatly using a Python "list comprehension" as follows:
Use inline formating:Output:Formatting:formatting language<20 for strings is not needed as left-adjust is the default, if you need to right-adjust use >20. See link for more infos about formatting language constructs.
