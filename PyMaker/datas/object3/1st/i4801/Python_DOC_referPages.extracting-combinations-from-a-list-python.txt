This question already has an answer here:How to get all possible combinations of a listâ€™s elements?                    24 answers                I have this list:...and I want to print out all possible combinations such that the output is like:So far my code is this:Which gives my first 3 outputs. Is there a way for me to loop it so that the index goes up by 1 so I can get my desired output?Edit; so I basically want to write a code which summarizes this:I pretty much want to know if I can loop the index so that I don't have to create multiple for loops and maybe apply it to a longer list.       
You are creating combinations of increasing length, so use itertools.combinations() with a length ranging from 1 to len(inputlist):combinations() produces tuples, but those are trivially converted to lists if you must have a mutable sequence for each.
