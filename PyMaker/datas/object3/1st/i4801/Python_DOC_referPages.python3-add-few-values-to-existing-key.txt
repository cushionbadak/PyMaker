I know there is a lot of information about this subject, but I'm really stuck with this problem.I have a dictionary loaded from a file:Now, I need to add more values to the existing key.But instead I receive an error: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'Here's what I've tried so far:and:Result is the same: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'Please help!Full code below:
This can not work, reason see comments:You can try to fix it with:(Disclaimer: Code not executed, may contain typos, tell me, I'll fix)Reads: dict.setdefaulttype()You check if a key that you parsed from the commandline was already stored into the json-file that load as datastore. If you have a file that contains a string for a certain key, loadign it will always recreate it as string. Your code checks if a key is already in datastore - if so the new code reads the value into val. Then it checks if val is of type str - if so it replaces the value in datastore for key with a list containing val. Then it appends the new parameter that you parsed from the commandline. In case the key is not in the dictionary, it creates the entry in datastore directly as list, using the just parsed value as defaultvalue inside the list.Then all is stored back and replaces the current file.
