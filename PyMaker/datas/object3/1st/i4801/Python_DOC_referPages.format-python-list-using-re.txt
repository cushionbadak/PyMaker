How can I format this string in a list from :to :I think the way is to use re.sub() but I'm having trouble with the '\n' not escaping
You do not need re.sub, str.split will suffice.If you want it exactly in the format you provided, you can cast back to a tuple. Note that when you use (...) you are creating a tuple and not a list as you mentionned.
Hope this works-Output-The a.split() splits the string by every occurrence of \n.
Instead of re.sub, use re.findall to grab every run of digits:Output:
It's very simple. Use split function for strings.output you expected as list:If you want to get a tuple, use tuple function to convert.output as a tuple:Differences between tuple and list in python you can get here.
This code resolved my problem
