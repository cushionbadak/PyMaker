I get a Keyerror when doing a for loop on a set of int values. Here is the code: The purpose of the function is a little bit hard to difficult, but my problem here is:(but one time it's 'cuisine', the other time its 'cinephiles', or 'sport', ...
My two cents on these lines being the culprit.final_dict = group del final_dict[str_1_final] del final_dict[str_2_final] .This has to do with the fact that python does not deep copy your dictionary named group into final_dict. Instead final_dict is just referencing group. So when you delete the key from final_dict, it gets deleted from group as well. And the code below it:for cle in group[str_1_final]: .Fails.Here's the sample of what happened: https://trinket.io/python/64f20460d9
