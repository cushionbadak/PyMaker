I want want to multiply values by 10 which have prefix "0.0".Below in the example of my csv file.Thanks in advance

You can use:Input:Output:
One possible solution without converting to floats - check if 0.0 and remove first 0 after 0.. Very important is set dtype=str parameter in read_csv for convert all columns to strSolution with floats - multiple by 10 if some value is less as 0.1:

The best is to use pandas and then do manipulation within that. Your data doesnt seem to have separators .. or maybe they are just spacesalternatively, if you have saved the csv or data in xls formatThe last command is needed because the first column is a time stamp index and mathematical manipulations will not work like on the float/number types on the rest of the data, so best to make it an index
