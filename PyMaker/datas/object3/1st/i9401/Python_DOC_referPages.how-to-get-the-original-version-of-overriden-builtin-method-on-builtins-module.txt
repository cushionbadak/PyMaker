At some arbitrary place in code, this exists:I cannot change that code, but it's broken. I need to make sure any open calls, including those from other builtin libraries use the original open. What I need is something like:In Javascript, I typically solved that issue by creating new window frame and getting the methods from there. How to do it in python?
If the issue here is simply the open function, you can always grab io.open which is an alias for it:I am not aware of any generic solutions to this even though I would not be surprised if one existed.
I'm not exactly sure what you want, but you can use the __builtins__ magic variable to grab the "original" open function:The "magic variable" is simply an alias for the builtins module:You should note however that this is an implementation detail, and other versions of the Python interpreter might not support it. From the Python 3 documentation on the builtins module.As an implementation detail, most modules have the name __builtins__ made available as part of their globals. [...] Since this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate implementations of Python.
