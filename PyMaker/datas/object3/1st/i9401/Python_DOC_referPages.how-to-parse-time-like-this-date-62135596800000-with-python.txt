How do I parse a time like this '/Date(-62135596800000)/' with Python?I searched the internet, but was unable to find a solution. Link:http://211.137.19.74:8089/Ajax/GetStationDetailList?cityName=%E6%B2%88%E9%98%B3 TimePoint:"/Date(-62135596800000)/"and the time should be 2016:12:31: 01:00
/Date(N)/ is usually the format for dates serialized by the built-in WCF JSON serializer in .NET. The value can then be reconstructed by calling new Date(N) in JavaScript.Running that in JavaScript will show why this date is very likely just wrong:As you can see, you get the 0001-01-01 00:00:00.00. This also happens to be the default value in .NET for empty DateTime objects:So, sorry to say it like that, but that server is just broken.That all being said, once you get a valid date, you can parse the number in Python using datetime.fromtimestamp or datetime.utcfromtimestamp:
Using python 3.xLooks like epoch time (in nano seconds starting January 1, 1970 00:00:00.000 GMT). You could use something like this:As for the value you're getting, you can't have a negative epoch time stamp (-62135596800000 would be invalid). If the - indicates negative, it might be another time stamp format.
