When trying to import Request from urllib.request in Python 2.7, it's unable to find the package.
There is no urllib.request module in Python 2, that module only exists in Python 3.Use urllib2 instead:From the top of the module documentation:Note: The urllib2 module has been split across several modules in Python 3 named urllib.request and urllib.error. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3.If you are following some kind of tutorial or course, you may want to install Python 3 and continue using that version; the code you are trying to execute is clearly designed for Python 3.
