Reading the Packet Sniffing in black hat python, some of the codes are:why 'socket_buffer' is set to 'None'?does it mean empty the variable 'socket_buffer' first, then put the content in the buffer to 'socket_buffer' via 'from_buffer_copy'?
socket_buffer is non-required parameter for this func, and if it's not passed in in the func call, it will be set to None
