I have 2 list's in the following form:How can I find the union of these 2 lists?Required output: If this helps: As you can see, the list[0][1] and list[0][2] are integers, we can typecast it to a string if necessary.
You can use set.union, i.e, you can  map both lists to list of tuples and then convert them to sets so that you can call the union method:To convert them back to lists:
You can use a set comprehension. Since list are un-hashable however, tuple()'s must be used instead.
You can useunique_everseen() can be found in the documentation of module itertools. Conversion to tuple is necessary because the list type is not hashable.
