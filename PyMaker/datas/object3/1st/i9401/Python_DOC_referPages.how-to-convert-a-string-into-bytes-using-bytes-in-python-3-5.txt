I need a little help with the bytes();function in Python 3.5.I hope I understand this properly, but bytes are a different way of storing a value, like 52 is 110100in binary. (Except binary is in bits right?) Anyway can somebody please tell me the following:The proper syntax of bytes();(In use of a string)Proper arguments the parameter "encoding" in bytes(str,encoding);If I am completely mis-using this concept please tell me.NOTE:I am using this for weak cryptographic purposes. Please tell me how to:Add a constant to every byteAnd how to reverse aforesaid process.How I am Using It:
By importing codecs I can encode and decode it easily! Thanks @Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre!
