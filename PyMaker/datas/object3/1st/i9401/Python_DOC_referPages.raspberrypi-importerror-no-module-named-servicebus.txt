I am getting this error when running python script for Azure ServiceBus. Is the file in the wrong location, or am I importing it incorrectly?Azure SDK path: pi@raspberrypi:~/azure-sdk-for-python $Python script path: mrrobot.py 
Your Python interpreter does not found the packages. It can be for several reasons:You didn't install correctly the SDK (files are missing). You can use pip, "git clone" from the repo directly, or copy/pasting the "azure-servicebus" zip from PyPI and unzip it. Since you didn't share the content of your pi@raspberrypi:~/azure-sdk-for-python folder, I can't tell. Don't forget the dependencies if you manually install the code.Your path to packages is not well defined. Again, can be fixed several ways, by defining a PYTHONPATH or changing your sys.path
