He defines the following Python function normally:In his program he calls it this way:and it works properly.  But if I remove the bracketed 1 and call it like this:it throws this error:My question is this:  What is the bracketed 1 doing?  I have never seen a bracketed number following arguments in a called function and I can't find the answer anywhere in the Python literature.
[1] is a subscription expression. findMax() returns a list, and [1] picks out a single element from that sequence, the one with index 1.When you remove the [1] expression, you get the TypeError later on when code that expected a different type of object, but is now given that list instead.Perhaps you found the space between the ) of the findMax() call and the [1] confusing. It is much better to leave out that space, and the Python style guide states no spaces should be used there, but spaces are perfectly legal there:Legal, but confusing to new coders.
