I am having difficulty replacing an element in a list within a list.My code is:The output is as follows:However I have indicated what I expect to see with lines that start with '>>>>' in the above output.Q: Within my code, what am I doing wrong?
I think your code is right, but maybe there is something wrong not show in the code.You don't show us the initialization of board, I try use board = [[""]*board_size] * board_size, get the same output as you have shown. In the case, board is actually not your "list in list", it is one list, repeat for "board_size" times, so once you change one of the list, you change all of them.I change the board initialization to board = [[""]*board_size for i in range(board_size)], then I get the correct answer.You can use this code to check if the lists in list are the same list or not:
