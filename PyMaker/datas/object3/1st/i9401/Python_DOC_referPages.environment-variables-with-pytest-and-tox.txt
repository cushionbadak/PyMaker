How can I test environment variables using pytest and tox?validate.pytest_validate.pyIf I set the environment variables in the tox.ini file:The test passes, but I would like to keep the test isolated. 
The environment variables should be provided by your test, not by your test runner. One option is to use mock and patch os.environ. Alternatively you can just provide the environment variables in your test case's setUp() and reset them in tearDown().
I had a problem with the ENV_VAR variable getting set before the test would run.The validate module had to be reloaded within the test to work properly using imp.reloadtest_validate.py
