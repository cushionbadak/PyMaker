I have sqlite and I query two columns from a table like this: then, I want to put each column into a separate list, what I'm doing so far is this: The problem is that, while list1 prints the first column perfectly, list2 appears empty, while, if I remove the first line, list2 prints the second column perfectly as well!So it's like, after the first line execution, something changes in my query but I don't know what.Is there any way to deal with this?
conn.execute() returns a cursor object. You can't iterate over a cursor more than once; when you reach the end, it won't start at the beginning again when iterating a second time. Either load all rows into a list first, or use a different technique that only needs to iterate once. I'd use the zip() function to pair up columns:but you could use results = list(result_set) or results = result_set.fetchall() to materialise all rows into a list first, or you could use a single loop that uses list1.append() and list2.append() to add the column values to the two lists.
