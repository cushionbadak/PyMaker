Whenever I enter 'n2' higher than 255, it shows enter first number. I want it to show enter second number.Image
continue starts the whole while loop over: it doesn't go back to before the last if statement or anything like that. So your second continue effectively starts your program over. You need to get rid of this continue, and use some other method to redo this input.
The problem is the continue statement in the first if. continue does not mean "go on". It means, "ignore the rest of the while/for loop, and repeat from its next iteration". So, actually, the next time you are at the input prompt, are not entering n2, you are again the the same line and entering n1 again. Remove the continue statement.Take a look at how break and continue statements work, they are pretty much the same in all languages (that I know of at least)
