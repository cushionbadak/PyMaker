I am new to Python, I have a following example that I don't understandThe following is a csv file with some dataThen, the example tries to define a function to convert those trees name above to integers. The first question is why is there a "0" after "s"? I removed that "0" and get same result.The last step is to read those data by numpy.arrayI was wondering for the converters argument, what does {1:convert} exact mean? Especially what does number 1 mean in this case? 
For the second question, according to the documentation (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html), {1:convert} is a dictionary whose keys are column numbers (where the first column is column 0) and whose values are functions that convert the entries in that column. So in this code, the 1 indicates column one of the csv file, the one with the names of the trees. Including this argument causes numpy to use the convert function to replace the tree names with their corresponding numbers in data.
