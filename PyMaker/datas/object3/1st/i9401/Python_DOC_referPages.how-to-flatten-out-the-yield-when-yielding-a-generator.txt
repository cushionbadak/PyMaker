I have this function g() my goal is to yield a result similar to product() but with constrained number of appearance for each group of characters. So in the code below instead of doing product(a, repeat=3) g() is supposed to yield all the combinations where characters from a appear 2 times and characters from b appear 1 time. Here is what I have :So the problem I'm facing is that when I yield the result I got a nested iterator that is painful to use and when I use return it just returns the generator corresponding to only the first loop turn, just as if I did : g() only consisted of def g(): return product(*next(permutations(list))). 
If you are python 3.3 or later you can use PEP 380: Syntax for Delegating to a Subgenerator ... just do yield from
