here is the code this's a stupid way.I'll get ids from mysql.I don't know how many ids I need to request.I don't know how to do it with a (for).Would appreciate any advice.
Using simple `for, additional list will be neededOr you can use list comprehensionBut note that there is missing error handling. For example - if one of the fetch raises exception you won't get any results, you should wrap in some function with error handling (maybe use of raise_exception argument in fetch).More information:python list comprehension explainedhttps://emptysqua.re/blog/multiple-asynchronous-events-tornado/
