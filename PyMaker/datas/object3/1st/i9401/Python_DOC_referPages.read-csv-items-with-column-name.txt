When reading a CSV, instead of skipping first line (header), and reading row items by number:is there a built-in way to access row items by making use of header name? Something like:where info.csv has a header line:name;blah  John;Hello2  Mike;Hello2  
You are looking for DictReaderto quote from the link:Create an object which operates like a regular reader but maps the  information read into a dict whose keys are given by the optional  fieldnames parameter.  ...  If the fieldnames parameter is omitted, the values in the first row of  the csvfile will be used as the fieldnames.
Yes, there is. That's what csv.DictReader function does - supplies the rows as an iterable of dicts.
You can use a csv.DictReader instance to get this behaviour.Example from the docs:
