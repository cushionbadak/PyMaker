I have made a Python 3 program to calculate pi for a school project, but it always stops at 16 decimal places. Is there a limit to the length of numbers in python? If so is there a language that I could use that will let me continue?
There is no restriction if you are working with integers and Python 3.x. The precision you get using floating point numbers is however limited. A Python float (like 3.14) is really a C double, which have about 16 decimals of precision, as you say.You can use the decimal module to create and work with other floating point numbers with arbitrary precision. Example code:See the docs for more information on decimal.
