So I made a server script, and a client script and now I (server script) want to respond to multiple client scripts with a single terminal interface on which my server script is running. How do I do that, help. 
Python documentation provides 2 ways using built in to create a TCP server which can handle multiple clients concurrently.  Both ways have source code available tooIn addition to a threading/multiprocess based approach you could use an event loop approach to handle multiple clients concurrently, using a single thread and process
