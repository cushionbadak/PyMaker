This question already has an answer here:perfomance of len(List) vs reading a variable                    4 answers                Let's say that we have to use the length of a list in certain calculations in a loop. Which would be faster, using len(list_) in each calculation or storing the length length = len(list_) and then using length? For example:VersusAssume a generic situation (n can be any value).
Here's a simple test using timeit as @DSM suggested:With above I get following result with Python 3.5 on Windows 8:
Accessing a single stored variable is much faster than accessing a function and passing it an accessed variable.However, as I said in my comment above, it doesn't matter. It might matter if the function you're calling is extremely expensive, but that's not the case this time. Use whatever makes your code look cleaner.
Python's list store its length in a variable, so there is no big difference in this two way.The first get the length(which is just a variable, there is no any calculation in len()function) every time in the loop, the second just do the function once. The time is same in my test.
