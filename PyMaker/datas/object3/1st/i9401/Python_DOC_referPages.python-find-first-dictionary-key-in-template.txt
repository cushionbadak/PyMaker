If you don't want to show the first iteration of a for loop in a Django template, you can omit it by checking for forloop.first
You can use a filter tag. For example:template_tags.pyhtmlThis should allow you to loop through all of the items in durationDict except for the first item. Keep in mind that dicts are not ordered by default. If you have a custom key/value pair that you want deleted every time, you can simply replace del dict[first_key] with del dict['latest_year'] (or replace latest_year with the key name you want to delete).
What I finally done was as following:creating an OrderedDict out of my Dictionary, making sure that it's sorted by dates Descending:So now I can be sure that the first key is also the latest year.and for presenting all the key,value pairs without the first year I used forloop.first, as suggested by @bozdoz:
