Natural Text
I've been messing around with a collatz program I wrote a couple of days back to learn python, recently incorporating a list.Now I want to be able to save the data output so that I can use it in excel for example, but also so that I don't have to keep starting from 1 (say I run it once up to 10, and then run it again, I want it to start from 10 up to 20 instead, just like if I ran it once up to 20).  If possible, I'd also like it to generate its own text file if none is found.Cheers.
What you want to do is append your data to a CSV:the 'a' means append.  It creates a new file if none is found.  'w' writes a file and overwrites it if you run the program again.Use writerow to write a single list (single row), use writerows to write a list of lists (all rows)Then you can later read your csv again:
You could create a data frame which you then could write to a new .csv fileCreating a DataFrame, at the end of your code: df = pd.DataFrame(data=*some data e.g. list*, index=i)From data frame to .csv file: DataFrame.to_csv()
