Natural Text
I have a GUI program on python 3 and a file.txt which contains some launch options. One of them is :The thing is i want to display or not the console if there is a "Yes" or a "No".I found a way to do so :In script1.pyw:In script2.py(w):Fortunately it works but as I work on Linux and I want to share my program with people on Windows I encountered a problem : when they launch script1.pyw everything goes well but whatever they put in file.txt, the python's shell opens with it (and it is absolutely not what I want...)Do someone have any idea?
You will need to change the os.system call to subprocess.call in order to skip the black window, maybe something like this:The shell=True part is what keeps the console from showing...
You need to call the pythow.exe on Windows:Better don't use os.sytem. It is recommend to use subprocess:The os.sytem docs recommend subprocess:The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function.
