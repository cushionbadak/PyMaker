I'm very confused here. I'm trying to pass an optional string parameter to my function, but once the parameter is added, it converts the string to a tuple? How can I stop it from doing that or convert back?I have this:With this when I call it:now... the print is supposed to print a period. Just .This is just a test before I use it in the function and it seems to be a good thing that I'm testing it.What it prints is ('.',) I need the period because I need to work with that (it can be any other symbol too)Any help would be appreciated!
*args reads an arbitrary number of arguments and encloses them as a tuple. To access them you can simply do print(args[0]) or [print(x) for x in args]Edit: Keep in mind that neither args or kwargs are keywords, you can replace them for any other placeholder preceded by * or **
I'm trying to pass an optional string parameter to my function*optional isn't quite how you do that. At least not for default/keyword argument like you are trying to use. That is a tuple. Try For more details, see about Defining Functions.
