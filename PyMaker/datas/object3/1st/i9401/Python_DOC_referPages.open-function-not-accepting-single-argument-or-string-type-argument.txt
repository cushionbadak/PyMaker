I'm learning Python and I'm trying to just simply read file into my program but the open() function is not accepting "r" or any sting as argument, I don't know how it is possible.
os.open isn't the function you should be using. Just call open directly which uses the built-in. From the docs on os.open:Note: This function is intended for low-level I/O. For normal usage, use the built-in function open(), which returns a file object with read() and write() methods (and many more). To wrap a file descriptor in a file object, use fdopen().
just like Jim said : try below if you want to read the file line by line then use a loop :
