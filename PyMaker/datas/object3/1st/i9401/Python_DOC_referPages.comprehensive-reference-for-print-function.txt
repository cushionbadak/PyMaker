I have searched all over but can not find a comprehensive reference and  explanation of this Python construct,
That's all covered under string formatting, which you can read up here.Basically, the {...} sequences are placeholders which will use the arguments given to format() to construct a single result string.These placeholders identify things such as which argument to use and formatting information for the argument (justification, padding, decimal places and so on).By way of example, the following expression:gives you the value 27 in binary:That's because the format string works as follows (spaces added for readability, but they're not in the actual format specifier):
Here is a summary of the syntax by using the str method format:"{}".format(42) ==> "42""{0}".format(42) ==> "42""{0:.2f}".format(42) ==> "42.00""{0:.0f}".format(42.1234) ==> "42""{answer}".format(no_answer=41, answer=42) ==> "42""{answer:.2f}".format(no_answer=41, answer=42) ==> "42.00""{answer} = {answer}".format(answer=42) ==> "42 = 42"For your example, {0} means the first argument in the format method which is key in this case and {1} means the second argument which is value in this case.
