I want to list all folders containing docx files using os().walk method in Python 2.7. I managed to do that with code written below, but I want to know if it is possible to limit this list to show only folders containing exactly two specific file types (for example "docx" and "pdf")?
Just skip directories where you don't have at least those two extensions; per-directory file lists are limited so it's cheap to use any() to test for specific extensions:When the list of extensions to test for gets a bit longer, you may want to just create a set of all available extensions:>= tests if the right-hand set is a subset of the left (so extensions is a superset of the right-hand set); so extensions should at least contain all for extensions named on the right:
This?
