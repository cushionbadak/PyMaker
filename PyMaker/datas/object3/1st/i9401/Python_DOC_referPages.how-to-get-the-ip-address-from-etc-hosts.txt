I have the following line in my /etc/hosts file  What I'm trying to do is, find the line gs2 in the /etc/hosts file and get the current IP address.  This is what I have, but it doesn't find the DNS or return the IP address. It tells me that my current IP address is 'None'.Not sure what the problem is. Any help would be appreciated.
Do this using .split(), which will split your line based on whitespace into separate indexed elements.Also note that using this approach removes the need for host_ip[0].strip(), because all whitespace between IP address and hostname is removed during the split() operation. You can just use host_ip[0].From https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split:(See URL for further discussion of split()).str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)...If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns []....
Your regex was working, I think the way the script was reading the lines was skewed a little bit as when I tested it didn't read my lines after a blank space. I ended up adding the lines variable. I am sure there is a more pythonic way to achieve this but it works.
