This question already has an answer here:Inverse of Tan in python (tan-1)                    3 answers                I'm trying to find the angle made by the line joining a point with the x-axis with the x-axis. So in effect I'm trying to find plain old tan inverse.Here's the code I'm using in Python 3I'm feeding in the point(1,1) as y_from_centre and x_from_centre and I getMy expected result is 45, but naturally. What am I doing wrong here?
math uses radians. For degrees use math.degrees:
The math module operates in radians. 0.785 radians is 45 degrees. From the docs:math.atan(x)Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.
The math.atan() function - and many of the other functions in the math module - return their results in radians. The documentation clearly states this:Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.(emphasis mine)The math module does however provide a way to convert radians to degrees, and visa versa:You can also create a helper function to wrap this logic:
