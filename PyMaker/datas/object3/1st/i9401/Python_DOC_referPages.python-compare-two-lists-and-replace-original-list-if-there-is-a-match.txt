I have two lists containing strings. I want to take each item in the base_list and search to see if there is a match for the first 3 characters in any values from the custom list. If there is a match, replace the original value in base_list with the one from custom_list. If there is no match, keep the original value.Desired Output:Eventually I also want to write this new modified_base_list as a file containing the items, one per line.I've tried:***EDITING QUESTION to account for lists that have 15k+ lines to find a faster way to do this.
You could use a list comprehension containing a generator expression:Note that I'm assuming if the same 3 character prefix occurs multiple times in custom_list that you only wish to take the first instance.
This is a solution that mutates the original list, replacing only those where the desired match exists:Of course if you don’t want to modify the original list, you can create a coopy of it first using modified_base_list = base_list[:].You can also follow your own idea but in that case, you have to make sure that you are primarily iterating over base_list and won’t add items multiple times:You can also use for…else here instead of that utility variable found:
Try the following with filter():Output:
You can use a combination of list comprehension and map for this:I hope this helps.
