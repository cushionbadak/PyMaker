I have a C++ Program in which I call Py_Main to get into Python. Now I would like to execute some commands inside of Py_Main but cannot seem to figure out how to pass that.I saw that Py_Main calls Py_Initialize so I wonder whether it is possible at all.EDIT:I currently try to do:And in Py_Main have myfoo not available. I can do import myfoo then fine.
If you need to execute simple commands from C/C++ in Python you should be using the PyRun_SimpleString function which takes a const* char containing the command to execute. You shouldn't need to dabble with Py_Main, just set the program name and initialize Python with Py_Initialize before you call PyRun_SimpleString. If you need to import a module and use it you can use PyImport_Import.
