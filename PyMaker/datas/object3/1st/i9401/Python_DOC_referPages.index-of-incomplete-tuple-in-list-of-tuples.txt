Here is my problem:I have a list of tuples (a,b,c) and I want to find the index of the first tuple that starts with a given 'a' and 'b'.Example:list = [(1,2,3), (3,4,5), (5,6,7)]I want, given a = 1, and b = 2 something that returns 0 (index of (1,2,3))Here is a solution I've found but it's very inefficient:
You can use filter():Output:
Here's one way to do it using a generator expression that returns the index of the first matching tuple by calling next on the gen. exp. enumerate returns the index of each tuple and the tuple itself:You'll get an error if no tuple containing the given values is found.On another note, you can use a list comprehension if you want to collect all tuples that match the criterion.
Here is a fault-tolerant way. Note, it returns -1 if it doesn't find any matching tuple:
