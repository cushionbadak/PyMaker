This is a code that try from a csv file (with in 3rd column to extract a name of a company) to check for emails on google. The first column contains an information i want to extract in the csv as "SIRET".How can I do it? If i extract it in start_urls when reading the csv, my url will be bad. If I use it it parse I will not : have the good data related to the data parsed, and I may have an error because accessing a file 2 times. How can I make the information out of the first reading going to SIRET in the parse function? I am struggling for hours on it :( Best,
We can use zip for this.Now you have one list containing the SIRET values and another list containing urls
This is an extract from the csvEach time I have an "SIRET" as a sirets value, but the other var increments and changes everytime Thank you so much ++
