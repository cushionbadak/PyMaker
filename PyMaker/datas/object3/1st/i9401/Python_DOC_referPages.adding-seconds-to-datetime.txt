This question already has an answer here:How to add seconds on a datetime value in Python?                    2 answers                I'm struggling to add different amounts of seconds to a timestamp. Let's suppose I want to add 1136 seconds to 2016-12-02 13:26:49. This is what I have thus far:I saw in another post something similar to what I want, but that is not for Python.Should I use datetime.datetime.combine()?I have a big amount of data and I do not want to manually input the date for every sum.Thank you in advance for any help.
Simply add a timedelta to the timestamp:Running this in the console:So the result is December 12, 2016 at 13:45:45.
You could use timedelta to add seconds to datetime object.
Add a timedelta:
Use timedelta.
I know, there are already four answers but consider using the arrow module. It makes many date and time manipulations easier.In the first statement after the import you can see that arrow can convert your timestamp to an internal time format and do the shift in one line of code.In the next statement I save that result and show the it's easy to manipulate the internal format in the usual ways. (More are available with arrow.)
