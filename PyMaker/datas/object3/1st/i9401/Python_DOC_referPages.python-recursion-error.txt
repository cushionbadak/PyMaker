Can someone explain to me why this doesn't work?I am trying to create a change machine using recursion. The first parameter is the amount of change that we need to give back, and the second parameter is an array of the number of bills with the first element representing $25, the second representing $50 and the last representing $100.When I call checkchange(125,[0,1,1]) it now does not return "T" or "F"instead it just prints out lets goBills: 011 Money: 125ok the money is greater than 100lets goBills: 010 Money: 25this is the money 25Here is the code:
The ampersand & in Python is the bitwise AND operator.  It's not the same as the boolean and operator. When you have a statement likeThat's actually being read as money == (25 & bills[0]) == 0, because & binds more tightly than ==.  Here's a useful chart on operator precedence
I assume the condition is wrong tot > money should be !=.Outcome:
