I have a directory structure like the following:and my render.py reads from ..sound.echo import echo_test, but every time I run it it says Attempted relative imports beyond top-level package.How can I fix this?
Do you need a relative import? Can you use from game.sound.echo import echo_test?Though, since you haven't shown the exact stacktrace, the error could be coming from echo.py. An attempted "import beyond top-level package" is self-explanatory, though. PEP 328 could be worth a read
I'm guessing that you are trying the following, or something similar: python render.pyBut this is treating render.py as a script and not a component of a package.  If you write an external script, where youimport render, and then test render functions, the imports should work fine.You may want to have a look at Hitchhiker's Guide to Python
