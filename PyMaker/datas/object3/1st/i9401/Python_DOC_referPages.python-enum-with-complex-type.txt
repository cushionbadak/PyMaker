I have en Enum type:I would like to create an enum variable based only on an int value:Of course i got a nice excpetion:Question: How can I create a complex-typed enum based only one value?

From the docs,if your enumeration defines __new__() and/or __init__() then whatever  value(s) were given to the enum member will be passed into those  methods.So you can't pass an arbitrary value, you'll need to pass a valid enum member value, say (10, 5)
Thank you Ari, I modified your answer, to be a little more Object Oriented:So now i can use it like this: 
If you want to pass multiple values to the Enum constructor but only have one of them be the actual value, then you need to write your own __new__ method:and thenThe process is considerable easier if can use the aenum1 library:1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum) library.
