How do I return the index for the array element whose sub-element value is the closest matching Int to my query.eg:If the array looks like this:and my query is 1483311700 then I want to return 2 as that's the index for the closest matching element.
This can be done using the built-in min function with a custom key function that returns the absolute difference between the value of a 'time' key and query.min(it, key=keyfunc) returns the smallest element from it according to keyfunc. If you use enumerate(it) instead of it and tweak the key function accordingly, min will return both the element and its index:Here data is the value of the 'data' key in your input.
Simple solution using bisect.bisect(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a)) function(returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in a.):https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#module-bisect
Isolate the time values in a list.Then generate a list of the absolute difference between the list items and your query.Last, find the index of the lowest difference.
