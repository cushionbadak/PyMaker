My problem here is when I enter the value of p, Nothing happens, It does not pursue execution: is there a way to fix it please?
You have to distinguish between to different cases:Script submitted with $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit script.pyIn this case you execute Scala application which in turn starts Python interpreter. Since Scala application doesn't expect any interaction from  the standard input, not to mention passing it to Python interpreter, your Python script will simply hang waiting for data which won't come.Script executed directly using Python interpreter (python script.py).You should be able to use input directly but at the cost of handling all the configuration details, normally handled by spark-submit / org.apache.spark.deploy.SparkSubmit, manually in your code.In general all required arguments for your scripts can be passed using commandline and accessed using standard methods like sys.argv or argparse and using input is neither necessary nor useful.
You can use py4j to get input via JavaLike this
