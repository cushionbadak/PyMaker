I want to copy a big file (>=1GB) to memory:Output:Obviously 6684 - 4632 = 2052 MB (which is almost 2x the size of expected 1 GB).Tests with dd show expected results:What's the problem? Why python was 2x as large?What are the best practices to replicate desired output *  in Python 3x?* Desired output - python uses the same amount of memory as dd.
See How is unicode represented internally in Python?.Because you aren't specifying that your file is binary, you're reading unicode characters, which require 2-4 bytes per character to store in-memory, even for a codepoint represented as a single byte on-disk.Use:...to open your file to read bytestrings.
