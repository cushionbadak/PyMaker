In my programming class we have a practice problem where the objective is to replace the second of two consecutive numbers in a list with a zero, if the numbers are equal.For Example:def zeroDuplicates([1,5,2,7,7]) would output [1,5,2,7,0]However, when I attempt to do this, I always get an error.What I have so far is the following:Error message when I run this program:
n is an element in your example; not an index. Your program as pseudo-code would replace an element if it equals the element with index of its value minus 1. Lets make your problem more definitive (robot friendly): you want to iterate from 1 to the length of the list, and if the current elements equals the previous, replace it with a zero.Now lets translate from English to Python (we use i to indicate index):Bonus: You can "pythonize" it using list comprehensions and zipping:(for every element and its successor, if they equal the successor equals 0, otherwise it will remain unchanged).
You have another problem that above code won't handleWhat If the repeat value occurred not at index -1 place but much before that?output:
Note that your approach also wouldn't work if several values are identical, I would advise to create a new list so you don't compare to potentially changed values. I would recommend using itertools.groupby which seems a perfect fit in this case:
You can try like this,Output:Additional info:Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.Link: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names
