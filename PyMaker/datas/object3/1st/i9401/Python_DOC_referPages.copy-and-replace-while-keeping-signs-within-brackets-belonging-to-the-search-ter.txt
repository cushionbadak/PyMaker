I need to replace thousands of matches in a source code file.Does anyone know how to replace "bar" with "foo" while exchanging the brackets and keeping what's inside?This is how the copy and replace should work:replace with:
The solution using re.sub() function:The output:https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/re.html#re.sub
regex allows you to precisely match strings and reuse the matched groups in a substitution:you can capture the number in a named group ((?P<number>\d+)) and reference it in the substitution with \g<number>:which prints:you are free to name and reference more groups (i also named <bar> which is a bit pointless here as i don't reference it in the substitution...).
