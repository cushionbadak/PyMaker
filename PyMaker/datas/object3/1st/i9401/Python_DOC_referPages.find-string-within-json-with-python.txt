I'm currently getting a very long JSON and I'm trying to pick out 2 pieces of information from it through Python 2.7.The JSON looks roughly like this:Within this JSON I'm looking for a specific serial that might match with one in the JSON. If it does, it should print out the registered_id as well.I've tried using a simple script, even without the registered_id but I'm getting nowhere.:Thanks for your suggestions!
date['device'] contains a list of objects, so you should treat it as such and iterate over them:This is using the somehow lesser-known for-else construct: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops
first, your input isn't json. Json uses double quotes. But suppose you successfully loaded it with json, it's now a dictionary, called d.Then you can scan all sub-dicts of d and test serial key against your value, stopping when found using any and a generator comprehension:returns True if serial found False otherwise.
Maybe this will help you:Python: List Comprehensions can be used to construct lists in a very natural, easy way, like a mathematician is used to do.
