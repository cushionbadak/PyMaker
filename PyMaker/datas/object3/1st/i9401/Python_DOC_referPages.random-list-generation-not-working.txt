I am working on a game where I need to randomly generate classes for a list. I use a self-made function randList to do this. The code for that function looks like this:I am using that to randomly generate monsters and items in a room like so:Just so you know, goblin, dwarf, slimeball, etc. are defined earlier in the code. I don't think they have anything to do with the problem. I generate the room later like this:I want it to print out a list with two random monsters in it from room.generate(), but it always prints Enemies: []. There are no errors in the code, and after trying to troubleshoot for 10 minutes, I decided to consult he web with no fruits in result of that labor. Thank you in advance for any help you give.
As Oliver points out, the reason you get always get an empty entities array is because self.entities is set to randList([goblin, dwarf, slime, naga, troll, beholder], 1) within generate (I assume the global variable enemiesBeat is less than 500 in your tests).In your randList function you have an off-by-one error that I mention in the comments which means that the generated list will contain one fewer items than specified by num. As you try to generate a singleton list for self.entities (num = 1), you'll actually have it assigned to an empty list.You can correct this issue by changing for i in range(num - 1) to for i in range(num) in your randList function.As an aside, I don't think you need to pass entities and floor as parameters to the roomParent constructor, since it doesn't seem to have any effect. Instead, you could modify the class definition:And instantiate it like this:
Use the random.sample library function.Also, you might want to rethink your capitalization...snake_case is preferred over inCaps for function names.
