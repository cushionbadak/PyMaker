I would like to compare lists in python in the following manner. For example, if i had 3 lists: I would like to compare (list name - element name): So I would like to compare each list element with every other matching element from other lists, but only once. Number of lists may by variable.Is there some elegant way to achieve that?
Function combinations in Itertools can be helpful here. for example (assuming all the list are of same size);This is give you full sets of combinations as required;you can add integer values instead of strings, and further do the comparison things with them.
