Natural Text
I've just written some code to convert a list of points into a list of to/from tuples but it doesn't feel very efficient.I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to make this more concise?Input: [1, 5, 2, 4, 7, 9]Output: [(1, 5), (5, 2), (2, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9)]Edit: Changed points to be non sequential.
