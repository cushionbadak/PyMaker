This is a piece of Python code to learn inheritance. But when I try to run it in Pycharm, I get the following error: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3.5  /Users/venkat/PycharmProjects/PythonOneVideo/main.py The Tiger has the  sound  roars Senegal Traceback (most recent call last):   File  "/Users/venkat/PycharmProjects/PythonOneVideo/main.py", line 41, in        leopard.ToString()   File "/Users/venkat/PycharmProjects/PythonOneVideo/main.py", line 35, in  ToString      print(self.__name) AttributeError: 'Panther' object has no attribute '_Panther__name'Process finished with exit code 1What's wrong with calling the super class constructor?Why this error has happened and how to solve this?Any help would be appreciated.
several issues:python 3 syntax for super: super().__init__(name, sound)name mangling: instance variables starting with __ (two underscores) will get _ClassName prepended to them. child classes will not be able to access them the usual way.ToString: why not __str__ (and do not print inside __str__; just return a str)?and what are the class variables (_name etc) for? why not just have them as instance variables (self._name)?this works bus is incomplete...
Remove the two leading underscore from your attributes:Output:The two leading underscores make your attributes "private".This is done my name mangling, i.e. adding _ClassName in front of all attributes with two leading underscores. This prevents the inheritance you do from working.
Your error stems from the name mangling Python performs when you prepend a variable name with __.  If you simply use names without the double trailing underscores, this works fine:and prints out:
