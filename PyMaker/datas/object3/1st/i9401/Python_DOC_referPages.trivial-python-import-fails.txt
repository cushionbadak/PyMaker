I'm confused on why a simple absolute import is failing.  Following the Python packages tutorial, I have package with a single subpackage:a.py contains:b.py contains:top.py contains:Both __init__.py files are empty.  From sound/formats/, running b prints foo as expected.  But from sound/, running top produces the error:(Note the strange appearance of forward slashes in the first line and back slashes in the second.  Python 3.5, Windows 7 Pro.)  This shouldn't be that complicated -- what syntax is necessary to allow b to consistently import a?----- EDIT -----Running unittest is the question I should have found before asking this one.  It also contains a great pointer to the Python Project Howto.
That's really not how you should be running your code.With Python packages you shouldn't be in the folder that contains the files when you're running the code. That'd be like going to C:\Python35\Lib\site-packages\http\* and then running py -3 server.py. Ew. Don't do that.Instead, use Python the way it expects to be used!You're creating modules, but you want to be able to run them as a script. Turns out that you can do that!*I think that's the path but it's been a while since Windows for me. If it's wrong, I'm just trying to make a point here!
