When i run the following code, i get an error saying "need more than 1 value to unpack" . Can anyone please tell me how to iterate through this dictionary in order to run the following code
The statement expects two values for each iteration, but iteration over a dictionary only gives you single objects, the keys. This is why you get your error.You probably want to use dict.items():dict.items() lets you iterate over the (key, value) pairs in the dictionary. If you are using Python 2, you may want to use dict.iteritems() instead to avoid having to create a whole list first.
