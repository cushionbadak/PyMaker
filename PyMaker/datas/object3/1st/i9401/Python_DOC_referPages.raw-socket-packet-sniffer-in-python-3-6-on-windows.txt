I am trying to sniff packets but i am getting strange output and i don't understand the reason.. So that's my code please help me(I'm using Python 3.6 on Windows 8.1)Code:From this code i get this output:IP: 192.168.1.12Ethernet Frame:Destination MAC: 45:00:00:43:00:00Source MAC: 40:00:2C:11:48:D3Protocol: 4266Ethernet Frame:Destination MAC: 45:00:00:42:11:E7Source MAC: 00:00:80:11:00:00Protocol: C0A8Ethernet Frame:Destination MAC: 45:00:00:33:04:D6Source MAC: 00:00:80:11:00:00Protocol: C0A8...According to EtherType list this protocols don't exist and analysing my traffic with Wireshark i am sure that this MACs don't exist in my LANSo I'm definitely doing something wrong but I do not understand whatThanks in advance
The hint is that all your Destination Mac addresses start with 0x45.  That's  the first byte of the IP header. So your code is getting all the IP packets, but not the MAC header for those frames.
Ok thanks to selbi i understand the problem, thank you very much But to catch Ethernet header with Python in windows you have to use:1. PyPCapTo install pypcap2. DpktTo install dpkt just open cmd as admin and type:py -2 -m pip install dpktHere references of Python Docs3. Python 2.7But you need to install Python 3.4> to get pip And finally that's the code:Output:Ethernet Frame:Destination MAC: 5404a6f2740c <- My NIC MACSource: 6459f81dc690Protocol: 0800 <- Right protocolEthernet Frame:Destination MAC: 6459f81dc690Source: 5404a6f2740cProtocol: 0800Ethernet Frame:Destination MAC: 5404a6f2740cSource: 6459f81dc690Protocol: 0800I hope you enjoy thanks again selbie(Sorry i can't put more links cause of my reputation)
