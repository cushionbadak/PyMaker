Right now I use this to catch the output of a Python function and store it in a variable:This works fine, but it also mutes the console until the func call finished.Does anybody know if I can write/pipe the live output of the func to the console and store it in a variable at the same time?
You can redirect stdout to a custom file-like object that forwards writes to multiple files:
As per the suggestions from the comments I've made and example turning our function into a thread so we can simultaneously check for output from that function periodically and copy it to the real stdout.
This is what I ended up using. I thought I leave this here for people who have a hard time with classes and oop, like me.
