I need a function to convert a float number to a fixed-point number, represented in binary so that I can put it to the hardware accelerator which can only accept fix-point number. for example, when I input a float number 5.625, giving data width 8, precision 4(4 bits for mantissa), it will return b'01011010, or h'5a or d'90. Is there any functions like this in python libraries?
That's the same as multiplying by 16 and converting to an int.The 16 depends on the number of bits in the precision, but it's easily calculated.If the number has to go in multiple bytes (like 2 or 4), use the struct module. E.g. for 300.625 with 32 data bits, 8 of which are precision:
Try to use decimal module.You may pass it a float formatted as a string with required format and precision:
