I am making a program that creates an separate python web server, the server being:and then original program runs that server from command line:All of this is done with buttons in a Tkinter window.  When this function is called, the Tkinter window freezes and the next button cannot be pressed (one which would pull up a local html file in Safari, through the server).  I've looked around and it looks like I might need threading or something...I have am left clueless as to how I would go about this.  Can provide more of my original program if necessary (it's a bit clunky).I'm looking for a simple solution or maybe a specific reference to get me heading in the right direction.Very new (3 months) to Python, so please keep this in mind.
Use subprocessor maybe it will need python to start scriptor you can run and later you can stop processPopen (without argument shell=True) expects argument as list after you close program subprocess still works so you have to kill them before you close program.
Since the exit code of the called program is the return value of the function os.system, the program is blocked until the called program exited. Try using the non-blocking subprocess.Popen instead.
