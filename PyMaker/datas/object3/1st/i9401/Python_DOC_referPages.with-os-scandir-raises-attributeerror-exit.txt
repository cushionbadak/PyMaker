An AttributeError is raised when I use the example code from python's documentation (here). The example code is as follows:The result is an AttributeError:Although, assigning os.scandir() to a variable works fine.Could someone tell me what I'm missing?
The context manager support was added in Python 3.6, trying to use it with previous versions will raise the error you see since it isn't a context manager (and Python tries to load __exit__ first).This is stated in its documentation (right under the code snippet you saw) for scandir:New in version 3.6: Added support for the context manager protocol and the close() method. [...](Emphasis mine)You can either update to Python 3.6 or, if you can't, don't use it as a context manager.
The docs sayNew in version 3.6: Added support for the context manager protocolYou are probably running an older Python version.
