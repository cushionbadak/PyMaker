I have a list of Objects and each object has inside it a list of other object type. I want to extract those lists and create a new list of the other object.I need this:L = [O1, O2, O3, O4, ...., O9];I tried extend() and reduce() but didn't workP.S.Looking for python flatten a list of list didn't help as I got a list of lists of other object.
using itertools.chain (or even better in that case itertools.chain.from_iterable as niemmi noted) which avoids creating temporary lists and using extendor (much clearer and slightly faster):small reproduceable test:result:
You can achieve that with one-line list comprehension:
list.extend() returns None, not a list. You need to use concatenation in your lambda function, so that the result of the function call is a list: While this is doable with reduce(), using a list comprehension would be both faster and more pythonic:
Not exactly rocket science:
