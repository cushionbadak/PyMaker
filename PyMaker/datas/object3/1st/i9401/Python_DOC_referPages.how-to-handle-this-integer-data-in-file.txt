Natural Text
I have a fileA.txt as :The file is about 25kb with some random number on every line.I want rearrange all these numbers with 8-digits fix length like the below output:I tried this :output:I want to rearrange this numbers and even the list-compression gets hanged here for original file. How to do this?
out:List Comprehension:out:.width is a decimal integer defining the minimum field width. If not  specified, then the field width will be determined by the content.  Preceding the width field by a zero ('0') character enables sign-aware  zero-padding for numeric types. This is equivalent to a fill character  of '0' with an alignment type of '='.format string syntax
You can use the zfill method, to fill your numbers with '0'.
Use str.format to do this:The 0 is the fill character, > specifies right-alignment and 8 is the width of the filled string.
if file is too large don't load all the data together and process it. Instead read line one by one and process each line one by one.
