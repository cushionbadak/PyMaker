I work on a project and I want to download a csv file from a url. I did some research on the site but none of the solutions presented worked for me.The url offers you directly to download or open the file of the blow I do not know how to say a python to save the file (it would be nice if I could also rename it)But when I open the url  with this code nothing happens.Any ideas?
Try this. Change "folder" to a folder on your machine
You can adapt an example from the docs
