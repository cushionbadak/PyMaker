Natural Text
I am new to python and want to split what I have read in from a text file into two specific parts. Below is an example of what could be read in:So what I want to achieve is to be able to execute the second part of the program is:I have tried using:However, this removes the double bracets from the two new variable which means the second part of my program which recreates the original text does not work.Thanks.
I assume f is a string likethen we can find the index of ][ and add one to find the point between the bracketsoutput:
Another Alternative if you want to still use split()
If you can make your file look something like this:then you could simply use Python's json module to do this for you.  Note that the JSON format requires double quotes rather than single.Documentation for the json library can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html
An alternative to Patrick's answer using regular expressions:Output
If I understand correctly, you have a text file that contains ['Cats','like','dogs','as','much','cats.'][1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,6] and you just need to split that string at the transition between brackets. You can do this with the string.index() method and string slicing. See my console output below:Note that this will leave you with a python string that looks visually identical to a list (array). If you needed the data represented as python native objects (i.e. so that you can actually use it like a list), you'll need to use some combination of string[1:-1].split(',') on both strings and list.map() on the numbers list to convert the numbers from strings to numbers.Hope this helps!
Another thing you can do is first replace ][  with ]-[ and then do a split or partition using - but i will suggest you to do split as we don't want that delimiter.SPLITOutputPARTITIONOutput
