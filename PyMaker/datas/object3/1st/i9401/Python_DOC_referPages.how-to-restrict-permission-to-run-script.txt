I would like to restrict ability to run my Python 3 script to certain host and users on Linux. Is there any Python 3.x build in function or library which would allow me to do this relatively easy please?
Not exactly a Python answer, but a Linux one - you may add all users who can run a script to some group:Then change group of the script and restrict read access to it only for group (if user can't read a script it can't run it).
I'm sure there is a better way of doing that but below is my first attempt.
