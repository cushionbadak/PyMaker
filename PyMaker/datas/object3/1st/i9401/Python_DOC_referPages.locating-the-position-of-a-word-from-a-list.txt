AwkwardnessFirst, you should not use list as a variable because list is one of the default Python functions. If you do so, the list() function (which is also a type) is replace by your variable in the local scope. So I renamed it alist.ExplanationThe following statement is a comprehension list:This comprehension list can be written like this:For instance:This comprehension list returns all the positions of the word "carrot" in ["apple", "banana", "carrot", "pear"].The loop:Is vainly complex because it iterates the comprehension list.You can simplify like this:Or:Note: alist.index(word) + 1 can give the first word position in the list.
