Natural Text
I'm writing a code that looks in a text file, and sees if the input is in there.e.g.I input "pizza"My textfile contains:I want to find a way to print the the line number the word pizza is on. Any help? 
Part (1) of the code reads each line as a separate list in variable "content".Part (2) populates out the line # of content only if 'pizza' exists in that line. [x for x in range(len(content))] simply populates all index values, while 'if 'pizza' in content[x].lower()' keeps the line # that matches the string.
There are two ways of accomplishing this:Storing the entire file in memory so you only read it onceReading through the file on every search, but not having to store itFor method 1, first read in every line and then get the index that the word is on:Alternatively, go through the file to find the index:
Something like this ?By doing this, you can input a regular expression and it should work (i.e. if you input "p.zza" or "^p.*", it will work.). The list matches will contain all indices of lines that match the input pattern.
