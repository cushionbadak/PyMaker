Suppose I have the following dict object:Now, if I run test['tree'] + test['flower'] + test['pets'], I get the result:which is what I want.However, suppose that I'm not sure what keys are in the dict object but I know all the values will be lists.  Is there a way like sum(test.values()) or something I can run to achieve the same result?
You nearly gave the answer in the question:sum(test.values()) only fails because it assumes by default that you want to add the items to a start value of 0â€”and of course you can't add a list to an int.  However, if you're explicit about the start value, it will work:
One liner (assumes no specific ordering is required):
Use chain from itertools:
You could use functools.reduce and operator.concat (I'm assuming you're using Python 3) like this:
