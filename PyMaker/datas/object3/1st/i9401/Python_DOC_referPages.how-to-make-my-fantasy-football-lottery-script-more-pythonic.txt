I've built a simple script that chooses a number from a list of set lottery numbers pre-chosen by our fantasy football commissioner. Per the results of this years fantasy football results, each team depending on how well or poor they did in the regular season receives a designated number of chances to pick a lottery number.The problem is that the script I've written chooses all numbers for one team before it moves onto the next team. I would like the script to pick numbers one at a time moving down the list of teams. There is an added level of complexity because not all teams have the same number of chances of picking a lottery number.So I'm using counters for each team which decrements down to zero, which would mean they have chosen all the numbers allotted to them. I'm not sure how to make this script pick numbers one at a time.Here is my code:
Mathematically there's no difference between assigning all the numbers for a give team first, or going round robin. At least, that's true as long as your numbers are being selected at random, which it seems they are (if inefficiently). So you don't technically need to change anything.But if you want to change things anyway, there are much more elegant ways you can go about it. For one thing, using separate variables for each person in your league is very awkward (you should use a list!). A big performance improvement would be to shuffle the list of numbers just once, then take values from it in order (rather than selecting random items and needing to delete them from the middle of the list).Here's my quick (minimally tested) attempt at solving this, using the roundrobin recipe from the itertools documentation:
Round-robin isn't necessary for a random selection.You really should think of factoring out your common code. In addition, you might want to consider a different data structure - namely a dict:Output:
