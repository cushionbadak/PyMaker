Natural Text
My overarching goal is to write a Python script that transforms each row of a spreadsheet into a standalone markdown file, using each column as a value in the file's YAML header.  Right now, the final for loop I've written not only keeps going and going and goingâ€¦ it also doesn't seem to place the values correctly.I'm using tab-separated values because some of the fields in my spreadsheet are chunks of text with commas. So ideally, the script should output something like the following (I figured I'd tackle splitting this output into individual markdown files later. One thing at a time):But instead I getting misplaced values and output that never ends. I'm obviously learning as I go along here, so any advice is appreciated.
This is all I can do without the sample CSV file.
