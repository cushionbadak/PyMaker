I am currently learning how to code python 2.7 but I have run into a confusing error in the following code which attempts (very inefficiently I assume) to return the median of an input.above is my code and it keeps giving me the following error:it seems as though it is having an issue with me calling len(lst) where lst = [1] because python seems to think it is a None variable? I'm quite confused.On the console terminal for python I can type len([1]) and I get a result of 1 without any issue. Also keep in mind I am fully aware this is not the best way to do what I am trying to do but I am just starting to learn python!Any ideas?
lst.sort() sorts the list in-place and returns None. So lst = lst.sort() sets lst to None.I think the best fix is to doThis doesn't change the list in-place, so that variables referring to the same list outside of this function are unchanged.
Your title is mistaken. list.sort() returns None because it operates by side effect; the first line discarded the list. 
Instead of using lst.sort() which returns None, you can use sorted() built-in function like below:Now, lst contains your sorted list.
think your problem is that lst.sort() returns None. "TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()"see how to solve it here.Why does '.sort()' cause the list to be 'None' in Python?
