This is my code, I need to find a median value of a list (x) but I'm getting this error :I don't really know what to do, please help.
You could also use NumPy's built-in functions, which could potentially be faster.NumPy has a whole suite of array-based data analysis functions, such as Mean, Mode, Range, Standard Deviation and more: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.statistics.htmlHope this helps!
range(1, len(x)) is an iterable. It can not be divided by a number, 2 for that case.I believe you meant to use simply if len(x) % 2:.In adddition, sorted(x) will return x sorted, not sort it. For that task you have x.sort().If you just want to find a median, use the built-in statistics.median:Otherwise, see that answer.
In This program at first user will take five values.Then the values will be sorted and give the median value.It will also print the larger values and smaller values compared to the median.So, This is the code where you will get the median values.if user want to take many values then the code is:
