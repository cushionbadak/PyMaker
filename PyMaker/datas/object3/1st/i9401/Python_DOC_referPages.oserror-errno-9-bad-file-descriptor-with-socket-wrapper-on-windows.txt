I was writing a wrapper class for sockets so I could use it as a file-like object for piping into the stdin and stdout of a process created with subprocess.Popen().I didn't use socket.makefile() as it gives a io.UnsupportedOperation: fileno error, but with my present code I'm getting the following error on Windows (works fine on Linux):
According to the Python documentation about socket.fileno(), it is stated that this won't work in Windows. Quoting from Python Documentation:socket.fileno()Return the socketâ€™s file descriptor (a small integer). This is useful with select.select().Under Windows the small integer returned by this method cannot be used where a file descriptor can be used (such as os.fdopen()). Unix  does not have this limitation.Note:The above code will work in Linux and other *nix systems.
