In standalone pytest test cases I would like to use assertions like unittest.TestCase.assertNotIn (and unittests other asserts) without any dependency on the uniittest module. Is best practice to use libraries like python-assert?
The best practice is using the language assert statement, which yields the unittest's assert* methods unnecessary. ComparewithThe latter is much more pythonic. It is also one of the key features that pytest names in the docs:Detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names)Should you be missing any unittest methods, pytest aims to provide replacements for them: becomes ,becomes etc.
