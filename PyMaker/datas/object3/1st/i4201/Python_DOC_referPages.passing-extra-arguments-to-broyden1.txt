Im trying to execute scipy broyden1 function with extra parameters (called "data" in the example), here is the code:Pixlinexyx_2Bsolved is the function whose root I want to find.start_xyz is initial guess of the solution:And data is this list containing a lot of numbers, that will be used inside the Pixlinexyx_2Bsolved function:When I call the function broyden1 (as in the second line of example code) I get the next error:What I'm doing wrong?Now, seeing the documentation of fsolve, it seems to be able to get extra args in the callable func... Here is a similar question as mine.
