I have a bash script (fifo1 and fifo2 are created with mkfifo):which realizes the graph:How would I go about doing this in a python script ?
To play with system processes you can use Subprocess and Popen.Then to share data between processes you can use PIPE.Example codes are also provided hereHere is a simple implementation:p1.pyThis code will call temp2.py program thentemp2.pyThe temp2.py will then execute ls command in your current directory and then save the result. To get more details of how to use the stored value from pipes check this there are many variation to use system input output and it depends on your implementation so check the above docs for further help.
