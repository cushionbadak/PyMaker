I would like to know if there is a way to find the path of a temporary file without it returning an int (15 in my case). I would like to return a string (or an object in which I can then turn into one, please detail how) path is the path to the temp file (and the name of it). Example: /Users/FooBar/Python3.6/Modules/TempFile/Opus/THE_TEMP_FILE or something like that. I have already written a small .wav file to it and would like to get the path to get the playing time/duration of it using os .stat(). I want to use a temporary file because I am lazy and I do not want to do a lot of 'special' code for the four different operating systems I am trying to this program on. Here is my code:  Let me know (comment) if you have any suggestions. I have looked at a few sites, one of which was on stack-overflow, one that you could mistake to be a duplicate of this question. It was about Django which as I understand is entirely different then python. Thanks for possibly answering this question. Remember, I am not looking for a confirmation on this is an issue, I already know that. Please give me a possible answer to the question as soon as you can.Thanks!-User 9311010
The whole point of tempfile.TemporaryFile is that there is no name for the file, if at all possible:… Under Unix, the directory entry for the file is either not created at all or is removed immediately after the file is created. Other platforms do not support this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this function having or not having a visible name in the file system.If you want a temporary file with an accessible filename, use NamedTemporaryFile:This function operates exactly as TemporaryFile() does, except that the file is guaranteed to have a visible name in the file system… That name can be retrieved from the name attribute of the returned file-like object.However, I don't think you need a filename in the first place. Do you only want one so you have something to pass to stat? In Python 3.3+, you can pass a file object (like f) to stat instead of its name. In older versions, you can use fstat with the file's descriptor (fileno()).
