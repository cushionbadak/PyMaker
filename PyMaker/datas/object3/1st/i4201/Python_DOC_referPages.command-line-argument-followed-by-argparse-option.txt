I'm new to python and currently playing around with argpase. I'm trying to call a function using a directory path given as a command line argument followed by an argparse option(-name) and a regex that goes through all the files in the directory and spits out all the matches to the regex as so: ./find.py ../seek -name '[a-z]*\.txt'However, I'm getting a error that looks like usage: find.py [-h] [--path PATH] [-name] [--regex REGEX]find.py: error: unrecognized arguments: . . / s e e k / p r o g r a m . cAnd without the -name its just printing all the files inside the path.Here is what I have so far:Any thoughts?
In order for your program to operate, you need a path. So, the --path option must take an argument. Modify your parse() function to change the linetoYou need to call parse_args() only once. Remove the parse() invocation to the top of the loop.And you needn't doif you are using argparse.re.match() returns a match object, which is probably not what you want to print.You might want to take a look at match() versus search(). The match() function only checks if the RE matches at the beginning of the string while search() will scan forward through the string for a match.If you wanted to print the file names matching the regex, you could doSo main() should be something likeIn order to specify the regex matching the file names, you must specify the regex using the --regex option. By default, you've made it to match names having only numbers and (English) letters.or
Argument Parser PATH Example : Different type of arguments with custom handlers added. For path here you can pass '-path' followed by path value as argument
