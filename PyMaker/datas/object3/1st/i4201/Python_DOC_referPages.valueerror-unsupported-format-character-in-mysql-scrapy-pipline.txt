I am working on a scrapy crawler, and this issue really bothers me since I already been trapped by this for days.This placeholders function works fine when I using "?" instead of "%s" for SQLite db. But while using "?" as the database switching to MySQL, it shows: "TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting  "even I pay lots of effort modifying codes and changing the placeholder(supposedly?) it still shows :"  query = query % self._escape_args(args, conn) ValueError: unsupported format character ',' "more specifically :the pipline for mysql version the SQLite version(what i was using b4)data settings of main scrapy crawler programitem setting
The problem is that this line:placeholders = ",".join(len(item) * "%s")isn't doing what you expect.",".join(len(item) * "%s") does two things - computes  len(item) * "%s", then joins the result with ','.The result of len(item) * '%s' is the string (or iterable) '%s%s%s'.  str.join(iterable) returns a string consisting of all the elements of iterable separated by the string that provides the method.  So the result of calling ','.join('%s%s%s')is'%,s,%,s,%,s', not '%s,%s,%s'You want to do or so that str.join is operating on an iterable of '%s' strings rather than a single string like '%s%s%s'.`
