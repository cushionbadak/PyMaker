How can I define a list that is empty at first and append to it but not have it clear when I restart my app? I am using python languageThe list has the proper values in it when the app is first ran, it is only when I restart my app that the list clears because of the empty list variable over rides the list that was just created. Thanks in advance
A list doesn’t get saved when closing a python program. If you want this you should save the list in a specific file and load this file everytime your python program opens. One of the basics of python is that lists, dictionairies etc don’t get saved on change or exit.
