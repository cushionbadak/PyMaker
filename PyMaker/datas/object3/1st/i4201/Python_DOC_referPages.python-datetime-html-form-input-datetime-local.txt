I have an HTML form which receives date-time and stores it in a Django model. How can I compare this date-time with python's in build date time to check if there are equal?For example, a date-time receives from the template might look like this (Jan. 1, 2018, 1 a.m.), how can I write a script which will be able to compare html_time and python date timeI have tried the following and it returns False
First of all, your data must be consistent, in the question you put your date format like "Jan. 1, 2018, 1 a.m." and in your code you put it like "april. 26, 2018, 1 a.m.", its two different date format. I'll assume the question one.You can do something like thisNow you can do comparison between the two dates.To see how to format your date specifically you can see this hereThe dots between a.m. are a bit trick though
