Natural Text
I have an array with 7 columns, 52 rows. I want to create an array of just the 4th column but only based a 1 or 0 value from the 7th column. Can someone help? My desire is to actually add up some numbers in the 4th column, but only add numbers that correspond to a 0 in the last column. My dataArray is as such: the last column consists of 0's and 1's. Hope this clears up confusion.
If your 2D list is A, thenX will be a list such that for each row in your 2D list, only those 4th column values will be included if the corresponding value in 7th column is '0'.This syntax is called List Comprehension and you can read more about it here.
It sounds like you want boolean indexing. I'm assuming we're talking about numpy. Note that if you want the values corresponding to zeros in your last column, you just need to negate the boolean logic with ~.
