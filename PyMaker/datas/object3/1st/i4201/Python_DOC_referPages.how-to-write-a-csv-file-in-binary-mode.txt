Does python's csv writer not support binary mode anymore?I haven't had to write in 'b' mode until now and i'm getting very annoying errors like so:Code:If anyone could explain the error that would be great. I'm passing in an iterable where every element is a byte sequence but I still get an error about the input not being 'bytes' but instead being 'str.' This behavior seems unexpected.I know the above code snippet can write to a normal file if I turn off the binary mode. If anyone has a solution or suggestion that is constructive I would very much appreciate it. 
The csv module in Python 3 always attempts to write strings, not bytes:To make it as easy as possible to interface with modules which implement the DB API, the value None is written as the empty string. [...] All other non-string data are stringified with str() before being written.That means you have to pass it a file object that accepts strings, which usually means opening it in text mode.If you are stuck with a file object that wants bytes, wrap it in an io.TextIOWrapper to handle str->bytes encoding:
