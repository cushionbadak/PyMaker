I'm trying to create a program where python will take multiple inputs to calculate the average of the input but it doesn't work though I search a lot but my problem differs from the rest as I use class.my code is as:Objective:I want to take three input to find the average.
Such a solution works for me.
The __init__() method for your class requires 3 positional parameters (in addition to self) but your code passes only one - a list of the numbers entered by the user. You need to pass each of those numbers as a separate argument. You can use the * operator to unpack the items in the list and pass these as separate arguments:That will solve the immediate problem, however, it would be more flexible if your class accepted a list of the numbers, binding that to an attribute of the object. Your average method would then calculate the average using the list, or it could simply use statistics.mean():The advantage of this approach is that you can collect an arbitrary number of values from the user.
You can call your Script with: scriptname n*<param^n>So for You it would be python script.py number1 number2 number3You can access them in Python with sys.argv[1-3], sys.argv[0] is always the Script Name
You are passing a list as a single argument, you need to expand the list, to unpack the list you can use *
