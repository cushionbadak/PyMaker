I'm using this Amazon reviews scraper I found on Github: https://github.com/philipperemy/amazon-reviews-scraperI want those results to be sent to a CSV file. But I'm just a beginner with Python so I'm not entirely sure. I'm using Python on Windows.With the help of Akshat I've got this, but I'm not sure it's correct:
Your problem is here:writerow expects a sequence. Do this instead:That line needs to be inside a loop through reviews.
Apart from the error pointed out by @BoarGules. I would suggest you to explore DictWriter from CSV module
