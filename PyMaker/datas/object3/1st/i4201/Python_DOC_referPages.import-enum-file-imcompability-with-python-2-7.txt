I am having issues running a Python file that uses "import enum", giving me this issue:I know I have Python 2.7 and "import Enum" exists only with Python 3, but I am having troubles going about how to create two different environments where I have both Python 2.7 and Python 3. How would one go about doing this on Mac Unix terminal, which I also am not very familiar with.
auto didn't show up until Python 3.6, and is not in the enum34 backport.  If you want 2/3 compatible code you'll need to use aenum1.I do not have any experience with the Mac Unix terminal.1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
