How to make two functions. One to Encrypt and one to Decrypt the message and implement it in the already using code. Sample of encryption: 'My test text is here'.upper() Output: UJ 8ZV8 8Z08 AV DZOZDecrypt sample: 'V845X6QZO3Y6L AV 4LZV6UZ' Output: 'STACKOVERFLOW IS AWESOME'That is the two List above, I am New to Programming and still grasping the basics, The program needs to take the message from user and using the two lists provided decrypt and encrypt the message and display it, I have tried searching for similar questions but the soloutions are commands and methods we have not learned in class, Id appreciate any help and explanation on how to program the situation above. 
To 'encrypt', you could dostr.maketrans() builds a table to map the input characters to their corresponding output character.This table is then used by translate() to do the actual translation.Do the reverse to obtain the table for decryption.
