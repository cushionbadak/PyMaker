I'm sure there must be a better way to convert a string like 00:04:11.723 to microseconds like this:but yet I didn't find it.
This is one way using only datetime.timedelta:
If you're not opposed to third party libraries, pandas.Timedelta might be useful for you:This returns: 251723.0
The basic idea is to use strptime() to parse your string to get a datetime object.  Since datetime objects don't have a nice method for total seconds, but timedelta does, we subtract another datetime, which results in the timedelta we're looking for.  Now we can take total_seconds().  Multiply by 1000 and you have your answer (as a floating point number).
