I am trying to return a matching string where every even letter is uppercase and every odd letter is lowercase. But the code doesn't show this exact result, any solution?
The problem is that you're only incrementing index after the loop, rather than each time through it. So, inside the loop, it's always 0. The smallest fix is:But this kind of mistake is very easy to make (and sometimes not as easy as this to debug)â€”which is exactly why Python has nice tools like enumerate, that make it impossible to get wrong:
People, including myself, have already pointed out your programming error. Here is an alternative one-liner solution to your problem using a generator expression and a ternary conditional operator:enumerate will return a tuple of the form (index, value) for each item in the iterable. In this case, the iterable is the string word.At each step in the iteration, we check to see if the index i is odd. i%2 will return 0 for even numbers and the if statement will evaluate to False. Likewise, it will evaluate to True for odd numbers. Respectively, we call lower() and upper() on the current character w.Finally we use str.join to concatenate all the individual letters back together. Here we join the characters using an "" with is the empty string.
The problem was with how you were incrementing. You only set up your index to increment inside the "Else" block of your code. It was missing from the "If" block. As such as soon as you entered the "If" block you would be stuck there.     
You weren't increment your index in the correct spot ;)If you execute myfunc(word) it will print hElLo
