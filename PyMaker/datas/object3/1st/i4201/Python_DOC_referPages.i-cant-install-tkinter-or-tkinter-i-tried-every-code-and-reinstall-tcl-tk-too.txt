I try every solution on stackover and many other sites. But it's still giving same faults. I even couldn't install it.
It looks like you are on Windows, in which case you have tkinter already (if you run 2.7 or above). It seems you use Python 3 so run import tkinter. See the documentationIf you are on Linux/Mac/similar variant then you need to run sudo apt-get install python3-tk.  It is not a pip package and cannot be installed in this way.If the python -m tkinter command fails on Windows then your installation is broken, or if on Linux/Mac/Similar then the command above should work.On Windows there are two things that could have gone  wrong:Your installation is brokenYou forgot to check option for tkinterIf your installation is broken then reinstalling your should work, but more likely you forgot to check the tck/tk and IDLE option when installing.  To check or to install re-run your installer and press modify.  You should see a box like the following.  Ensure then the tck/tk and IDLE does have a tick on it:And press Next
