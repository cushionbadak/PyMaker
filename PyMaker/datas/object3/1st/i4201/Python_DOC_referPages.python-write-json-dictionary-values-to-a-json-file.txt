Natural Text
I am attempting to:Load data from a JSON list of dictionariesWrite the values of a specific key from each dictionary to a fileYet, when I attempt to dump the key pairs to the new .json file, it only prints the very last dictionary key pair. Anyone know how to loop through each dictionary and append the key pair? I have tried a few methods but I can't seem to figure out what i'm missing and where.Here is my code:A sample of my JSON file:My current output:But, I want to loop through every dictionary and eventually print only the values from each "text" key. Expected Output:Any hints will help! Thanks!
You have opened file in w mode, you need to open it into a (append mode)from docs:1. 'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased)2. 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the endContents of comments.json,File modes in Python,
If I did understand you correctly, this should do what you want:Just change 'w' to 'a' so you don't overwrite but append to the file
