This is my code -urls.pyviews.pytemplateThis is working fine, but when writing form = ProfileForm(request.POST or None, instance=my_form) after if request.method == 'POST': likeit gives UnboundLocalError at /post/2/edit/local variable 'form' referenced before assignment error, i want to know why such thing happening ! why earlier this didn't happen and later such error occurred and what is this UnboundLocalError?Please be guiding me.Thanks in Advance
In side else part write this:
The variable form in the else has not been assigned any value:else:        return render (request, 'edit_view.html',{'form':form})The variable form was only assigned in the if. Python has specific scoping rules, and if those rules are broken, Python throws an exception. Python won't execute your code because your variable is unassigned in the event that the else is executed.This question is answered in detail here: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-am-i-getting-an-unboundlocalerror-when-the-variable-has-a-value
