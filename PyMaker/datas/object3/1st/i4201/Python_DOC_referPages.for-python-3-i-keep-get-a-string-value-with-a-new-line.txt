You need to strip the newlines off each of the dictionary lines. In other words:When you iterate a file like for word in a:, you get a string for each line in the file, including the newline at the end. So, your dictionary ends up full of entries like 'y': 'why\n' instead of 'y': 'why'.
You can strip the trailing newline from word.split(",") by calling str.strip.You can also use read() to load the contents of the file which doesn't include newlines.
