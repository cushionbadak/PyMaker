I want to make a simple math function that takes user input, yet allows the user to not input an integer/float. I quickly learned Python does not identify type by default. Quick Google search shows using literal_eval, but it returns with ValueError: malformed string if a string is the input. This is what I have so far:
Like you mentioned you will get malformed string error (ValueError) if you get input like ast.literal_eval('c1').  You will also get SyntaxError if you do something like ast.literal_eval('1c').  You will want get the input data and then pass it to literal_eval.  You can then catch both of these exceptions, and then return your 'Not Possible'.
Just answer your query why ValueError: malformed string occurred if you read the literal_eval doc :Safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python  expression.  The string or node provided may only consist of the  following Python literal structures: strings, numbers, tuples, lists,  dicts, booleans, and None.so string should be inclosed by "" as used to write in editor like s = "string"raw_input takes the input and convert to string data type so i have tried this and able to convert using literal_eval
