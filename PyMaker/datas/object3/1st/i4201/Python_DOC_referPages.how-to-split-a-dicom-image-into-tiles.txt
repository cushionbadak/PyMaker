I'm trying to use the image_slicer function to split a DICOM image into tiles, but it's not recognizing the DICOM. I've already read the DICOM and converted them into np arrays:dcm_files[0]and am able to view the image through:and then trying to slice it:Error: 'Image' object has no attribute 'read'thanks! 
The module image_slicer uses filenames, not file instances. Therefore you have to save the array to some localisation. You can use tempfile module for that purpose.
