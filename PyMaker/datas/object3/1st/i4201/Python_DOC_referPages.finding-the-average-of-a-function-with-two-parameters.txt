I'm relatively new to python and had a quick question about the code I'm trying to write...I'm finding the average of the values of two lists: latitude and longitude. Here's my code:So I understand how to find the average if I just had one parameter, but I don't know how to write the code with two parameters. If I run this function, it tells me that ave_list() takes exactly 2 arguments but I only gave one. I understand that, but again, I'm not sure how to get separate averages with the two parameters. Thanks in advance.
The simplest fix is to redefine ave_list to take a single list, and from main, call it once for latitude and once for longitude:Python allows a function to return two values as a tuple, so you could recode your original function to return (ave_lat, ave_lon).  But why add that complication?  Here it is for learning purposes, though:Of course, as @bla points out in a comment, better to use statistics.mean:It's in python3; not sure about python2.
To get rid of the error you should pass two values to your function. Instead of using it a better approach would be with statistics.mean:If that module is not available you may use:if you have only ints and want the result as float in python2 just convert one of the sides to float:
You should remove long_list from ave_list since it isn't even used. If you want to calculate the separated mean of two lists you can either call ave_list twice, one call passing each list or making ave_list retur mutiple values (as a tuple, for an example)
The same thing that you do for a list, do for the other, and return 2 values as a tuple. ([SO]: return tuple from a method)Here's an implementation that uses [Python]: sum(iterable[, start]). Note that it can be written in a much more compact manner, but I'm keeping all steps separate, so it's clearer:The results can be retrieved via tuple unpacking (check [Python]: Tuples and Sequences):and this should give you 2.0 for lat_ave, and 4.0 for long_ave.
Just to add to the other answers, you can have a two argument function to calculate the average latitude & longitude as followsUsing statistics.meanExample of storing returned tuple of average latitude & longitude in separate variables (tuple unpacking)Printing average latitude & longitudeResult (in console)Or, defining your own mean function as ave_list:Then define the function for average latitude & longitude Printing average latitude & longitudeResult (in console)
