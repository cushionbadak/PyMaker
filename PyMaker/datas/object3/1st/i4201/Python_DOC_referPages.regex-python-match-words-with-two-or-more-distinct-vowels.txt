I'm attempting to match words in a string that contain two or more distinct vowels.  The question can be restricted to lowercase.string = 'pool pound polio papa pick pair'Expected result:pound, polio, pairpool and papa would fail because they contain only one distinct vowel. However, polio is fine, because even though it contains two 'o's, it contains two distinct vowels ('i' and 'o').  mississippi would fail, but albuquerque would pass).Thought process: Using a lookaround, perhaps five times (ignore uppercase), wrapped in a parenthesis, with a {2} afterward.  Something like:However, this matches on all six words.I killed the {1}s, which makes it prettier (the {1}s seem to be unnecessary), but it still returns all six:Thanks in advance for any assistance.  I checked other queries, including "How to find words with two vowels", but none seemed close enough.  Also, I'm looking for pure RegEx.
Your \w*((?=a)|(?=e)|(?=i)|(?=o)|(?=u))\w* regex matches all words that have at least 1 any vowel. \w* matches 0+ word chars, so the first pattern grabs the whole chunk of letters, digits and underscores. Then, backtracking begins, the regex engine tries to find a location that is followed with either a, e, i, o, or u. Once it finds that location, the previously grabbed word chars are again grabbed and consumed with the trailing \w*.To match whole words with at least 2 different vowels, you may useSee the regex demo.Details\b - word boundary(?=\w*([aeiou])\w*(?!\1)[aeiou]) - a positive lookahead that, immediately to the left of the current location, requires \w* - 0+ word chars([aeiou]) - Capturing group 1 (its value is referenced to with \1 backreference later in the pattern): any vowel\w* - 0+ word chars(?!\1)[aeiou] - any vowel from the [aeiou] set that is not equal to the vowel stored in Group 1 (due to the negative lookahead (?!\1) that fails the match if, immediately to the right of the current location, the lookahead pattern match is found)\w+ - 1 or more word chars.
You don't need 5 separate lookaheads, that's complete overkill. Just capture the first vowel in a capture group, and then use a negative lookahead to assert that it's different from the second vowel:See the online demo.
