Natural Text
I have files with names like centerOne_camera_2_2018-04-11_15:11:21_2.0.jpg. I want to change the last string i.e. image_name.split('_')[5].split('.')[0] to some other string. I can't seem to find a neat way to do this and ended up doing the following which is very crudeThat is, my output should be centerOne_camera_2_2018-04-11_15:11:21_<some string>.0.jpgAny better way is appreciated. Note: I want to retain the rest of the string too.
I think you may be looking for this:That is for the last element. But from the comments I gather you want to split at delimiter n.I'm not sure what your objection to using + is, but you can do this if you like:
You can try rsplit:
