I am trying to access a dictionary in python. I have a list containing airport codes and for each code I want to use the code to enter in my dictionary and get the airport information that is in airportDict from my Airport class I used something like this earlier in my code to make a weighted directed graph. this worked fine but in the one above I get an error TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'In the above case airport input is also a list and was declared as such Just for more clarification this is the main function that I am trying to use my permute function isand cost is 
@rhanly, what does print(perm) print?@palivek ['LHR', 'SYD', 'JFK', 'AAL', ['DUB'], 'LHR']There's your problem. If i == 4, then itinerary[i] == ['DUB']. ['DUB'] is a list, which is not a valid dictionary key, because it's mutable. 
Looks like your trying to use a list as a Key to a dictionary.airportInput = [row[0], row[1], row [2], row[3], row[4]]Error is probably here graph[airportInput[0]], and also here a1 = Airport.airportDict.get(airportInput[0])You are effectively trying to do, graph(row[0])The error suggests row[0] is of type List?Either way, try adding a few print statements to see what the actual values are just before the exception is raised. I think you will be surprised.As an aside, do you know about splices... you can airportInput = row[0:5]. If you haven't already, perhaps take the time to go through the latest Python tutorial Python 3 Tutorial or Python 2 Tutorial. It doesn't take long, but it should really help you.Hope this helps.
