I'm trying to match/index a string filled with gaps. Can this be done with regex? Below is my current solution:It just feels messy...
If I understand correctly what you're trying to do, you want to allow dashes everywhere in the match but preserve them in the output.Let's do exactly that:['k-l---mno']You may need to make some minor adjustments so the output is exactly how you want it but the idea is identical. The only somewhat tricky part is the re.escape (which might not even be necessary for you).
I had a solution that didn't use REs.The idea is to remove the hyphens but remember where to insert them and then to do a regular string search. And then insert the hyphens into the matches. would become:Then to find the substring:The one would reconstruct it via:I'm sure that the above code could be improved but the idea is there.Note that idx could be stored compactly gap encoded.
