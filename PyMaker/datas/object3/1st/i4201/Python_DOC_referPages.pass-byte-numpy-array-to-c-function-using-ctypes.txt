I want to pass byte numpy array to a C function using ctypes. The C function takes void *mem_address so I thought to pass it as the following:This gives the error AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute 'ctypes' which means ctypes does not handle numpy. Is there a workaround?
lst = np.asarray(lst).tobytes() generates a plain bytes object ([Python 3]: class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]]) which is not handled by ctypes.The original lst object on the other hand ([SciPy]: numpy.ndarray), is. So, removing the above line of code, would fix the error.
lst is now a python bytes object, not a numpy array. Thats what .tobytes() does. Why not do ? I'm not even sure why you tried to convert to a byte which is 8 bit when c pointers are 32 or 64 bit.
