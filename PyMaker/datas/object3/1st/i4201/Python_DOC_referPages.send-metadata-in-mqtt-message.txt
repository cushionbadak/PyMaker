I am using mqtt for the first time to transfer some binary files, so far I have no issues transferring it using a code like bellow However together with the file itself there is some extra info I want to send (the original file name, creation date,etc...), I can't find any proper way to transfer it using mqtt, is there any way to do that or do I need to add that info to the message byteArray itself? How would I do that? 
You need to build your own data structor to hold the file and it's meta data.How you build that structure is up to you. A couple of options would be:base64/uuencode encode the file and add it as a field in a JSON object and save the meta data as other fields then publish the JSON object.Build a Python map with the file as a field and other meta data as other fields. Then use pickle to serialise the map.
