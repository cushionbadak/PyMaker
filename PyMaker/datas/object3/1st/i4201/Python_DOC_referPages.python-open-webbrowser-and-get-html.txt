Now let me start off by saying that I know bs4, scrapy, selenium and so much more can do this but that isnt what I want for numerous reasons. What I would like to do is open a webbrowser (chrome, ie, firefox) and extract the html from the page after loading the site in that web browser from what webbrowser. 
There is no need to bother a webbrowser with this. If you just want to get the HTML of a website you can simply use urllib.request.urlopen.
