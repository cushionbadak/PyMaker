I'd like to iterate through a list multiple times. For example:should print:The list is very long and I don't want to create nested for loops for indentation/style purposes.Is there a better solution (e.g. from the point of view of auxiliary storage) than the following?
No, what you have is about as good as it gets. Both repeat and chain.from_iterable are lazy, you aren't creating copies of the whole list. You may want to extract that into a separate function if you use it multiple timesSee Itertools Recipes
You could use nested for loops in a generator expression:
Other than using itertools primitives, you can multiply the list:Or create your own procedure:Not much in standard libs/builtins I'm afraid.
