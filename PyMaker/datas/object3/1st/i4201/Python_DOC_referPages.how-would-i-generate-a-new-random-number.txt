how would i get this to generate a new random number after you guess the correct answer
The main problem here is that you do actually generate a new number each time, even if the guess was wrong. Instead you should generate the first random number outside of the loop, and only generate a new random number if the guess was correct:
I am not sure I understand your comment correctly. You can use random.randint(a,b) to get integer, not decimal number. (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint)
