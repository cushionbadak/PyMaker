I'm using an API that sends a date in a wierd format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ".So the date comes out as 2018-04-27T23:59:18Z, I have never seen a date and time formatted like this. Its a string and I would like to format it as MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS. I can't even wrap my head around removing the T and Z. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!

Use this pattern:Then to get a datetime string use strftime:
