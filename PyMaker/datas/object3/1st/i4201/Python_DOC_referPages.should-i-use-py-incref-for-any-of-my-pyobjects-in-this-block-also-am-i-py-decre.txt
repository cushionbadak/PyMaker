Whenever I call this function, memory usage is increases a lot per call, so I think there is some memory leak here.I am leaking some memory when this C++ snippet in my code calls the python script and I want to know why. I think I am doing something wrong with my Py_DECREFs. Any help would be much appreciated.
I spotted one missing decref from a quick glance:This will leak any non-callable attribute matching operation.The two reassignments of pValue… I think that's OK, because PyTuple_SetItem steals the reference to each of the original values.For this line that you asked about:The PyList_GetItem returns a borrowed reference, so the fact that you don't decref it is correct.But I don't see the declaration for value anywhere, or GetPyObjectString, so I have no idea what that part is doing. Maybe it's just getting a borrowed buffer out of a PyUnicodeObject * and copying it into some C++ wstring or UTF-32 string type, or maybe it's leaking a Python object or a copied buffer, or returning a raw C buffer that you just leak here, or… who knows?But I certainly wouldn't trust that some guy on the internet found all of them on a quick scan. Learn to use a memory debugger.Or: You're using C++. RAII is almost the whole point of using C++—in other words, instead of using raw PyObject * values, you can use a smart pointer that decrefs things for you automatically. Or, even better, use a ready-made library like PyCXX.
