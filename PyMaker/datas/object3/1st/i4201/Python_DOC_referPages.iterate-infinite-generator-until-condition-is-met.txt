I'm having a little trouble understanding generators in python. Lets say I have the following simple generator:That will just yield some numbers. Lets say I want to keep printing values from the generator until the value is more than 10. My first attempt was justBut this just prints 1 forever. I found that doingworks as expected because it just iterates through each value in the generator until StopIteration is raised. I then ran into the problem of an infinite generator such as this one that generates prime numbers:Then if I do something likethen it will print everything up to p, but then get hung up. I think it's getting hung up because it's trying to check every value that primes generates, which going on forever. What is the correct way to iterate through an infinite generator until a condition is met like this? The only way I have found is doingbut I feel like there's a more pythonic way of doing it.
itertools.takewhile()
Your break method is quite Pythonic, but I would consider wrapping the generator:
