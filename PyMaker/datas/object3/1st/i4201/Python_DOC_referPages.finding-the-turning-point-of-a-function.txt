I'd like to the first value that outputs True for my function. I currently have a search that works fine, but I think is still a bit inefficient. Could anyone suggest a better binary search? My code is below, simplified.
This is the classical problem of finding a level-crossing of a monotonically increasing or decreasing function. As you guessed, it is solvable by binary search. Your code has some bugs, which is not surprising:Although the idea is simple, implementing binary search correctly requires attention to some subtleties about its exit conditions and midpoint calculation.So, you should avoid writing your own binary search when possible. Fortunately, Python offers a library module bisect which can do the job for you. Don't be confused by the fact that bisect only works with indexable objects: there is no need to create a list with 2**35 elements. You can use a generator object instead using the __getitem__ syntax. To do that, encapsulate your function in a class and define the getter method that would return False for all argument values on the left side of the point of interest and True otherwise.
