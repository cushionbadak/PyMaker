I've got a problem while I was doing a program. My program is to create a class student and there are some variables under that and my task is to add the students in a serializable file and delete the students  whenever user wants to. I have written the code for adding the students but I am stuck while delete the object. I am very thankful if anyone could help me how to delete a pickled object from a file?my code is:and my student class is:
One way could be to pickle a list of students. Then when you want to delete, you can read from file, delete as normal e.g. students.remove(), and then pickle again. 
Pickle files aren't editable, and they were never meant to be. If you need to track individual pickled items, look at the shelve module - this lets you treat an external collection of (pickled) objects like a dictionary with string keys.
