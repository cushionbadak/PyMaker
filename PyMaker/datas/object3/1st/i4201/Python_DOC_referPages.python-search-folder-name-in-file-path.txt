I'm using python 2.7thank you 
I find regex powerful but less readable, especially if you haven't used it in a while, so here's a solution without it using other native modules.This example produces this result:'ep001' # episode 'Y:\work\ep001\comp' # new_path (I'm on Windows so I get double  backslashes)It's better to use os.path methods to make it work cross-platform instead of using + to build your paths.This has been tested on Python 2.7.11
