I need the dependencies because I want to add these to my RPM meta-data.To build I use:When I build the package cryptography-2.2.2 it creates a file /src/cryptography.egg-info/requires.txtIt contains:How can I read all dependencies, evaluating the expression between []?I'm using Python 2.7 (don't ask)I need the following output:I want to omit other sections like [doc], [test] etcetera.
The requires.txt is part of the dependency metadata, so you can use the same tools easy_install uses when installing the egg. Assuming the file requires.txt is in the current directory:Now you can filter all dependencies for your current platform with Distribution.requires():The list would be different if I used Python 2.7:or PyPy:Now, if you want to generate a list of requirement strings (like when you want to generate a requirements file for pip), convert the requirements to strings:PEP 508If you also want to take PEP 508 environment markers into account independent of the current platform, things can get a bit trickier, but still manageable. First, convert the requirements with env markers:Now handle the platform-independent deps, these house under the None key in dist's dependency map:Combine both lists to a string ready to be written to requirements file:
So I was able to find one working solution for the same, there might be other possibilities as well, but i think this should work on most versionsThe output of the same is belowIf I change the requirements.txt like belowThe output changes to
You could test the beginning of each line to whether or not it is a match to the pip dependency declaration format.Regex is probably the best solution to pattern matching:Where:^ matches to beginning of line/file[\w\d_-]+ matches any word (\w), digit (\d), underscore (_), and dash (-) more than once.All in all:Result:
