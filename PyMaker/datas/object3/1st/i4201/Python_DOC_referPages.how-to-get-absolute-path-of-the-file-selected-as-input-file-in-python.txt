I want the absolute path of the file selected as input file (from file browser in the form) using the python code below:This prints the path of current working directory along(where the python script is executing) with the 'orig_filename' appended to it, which is the wrong path. I am using python 2.7, flask 0.12 under linux OS.The requirement is to find the hash value of the file before uploading it to the server to check deduplication. So I need to use the algorithm by passing the file selected for hashing to another function as:In this function I want to read file from absolute path of the orig_filename before uploading. Avoided all other code checks here.
First you need to create a temp file to simulate this required file then make your process on it
You can use pathlib to find the absolute path of the selected file.
