The problem lies somewhere in how I'm parsing and or reassembling urls.  I'm losing the ?id=1 and getting ?d=1.What I am trying to do is have the ability to manipulate and query parameter and reassemble it before sending back out modified. Meaning the dictionaries would be modified than using urlencode(modified_dict) I would reassemble url + query.Can someone give me a pointer on what I'm doing wrong here. 
Can someone give me a pointer on what I'm doing wrong here.Well quite simply you're not using the existing tools:1/ to parse a query string, use urllib.parse.parse_qsl(). 2/ to reassemble the querystring, use urllib.parse.urlencode(). And forget about dicts, querystrings can have multiple values for the same key, ie ?foo=1&foo=2 is perfectly valid.
first of all, your variable url is a bad name for the params variable and this could create confusion.The error is in the url[1:].split("&")Solution:
