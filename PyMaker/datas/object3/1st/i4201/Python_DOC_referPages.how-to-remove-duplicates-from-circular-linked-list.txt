My code is given below. It appends some numbers to the circular list. My program works fine. It gives an exact output of [5,3,3] or any numbers entered. But I want to make some changes in the output. without adding any new function what kind of changes to make in the def append(....) and def add_before(...) so it gives a unique number which means it gets rid of the duplicates. for example, will give [5,3]Test 
Two options (I can think of): Don't add duplicates:Or simply do not print duplicates:You would have to modify your printall() accordingly if you want it to mimic this behaviour  - you would still store all duplicates though so does not make much sense to me, unless you create a seperate def printNoDuplicates(self) specificly for this purpose.
