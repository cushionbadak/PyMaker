I have three functions that want to change a global variable and can't combine into one function, the way I know right now is keep define "global" keyword in each functions to be able to access global variable. Is there a better way to do the same thing with out keep redefining the global variable? for example:Thank you
Why don't you define another function, which changes the value of the global variable with the argument provided as parameter. And call this in rest of your function. For example :Otherwise, if the scope of your global variable is supposed to be confined within your class then declare it as a member of the class, and let the functions change it's value. For example :
You can make the global variable a mutable class and then mutate in place. This works, but personally I wouldn't call that any better. With the global it is at least 100% clear that you change a global variable. Best would be to change your architecture to not need any global variables.
it seems like the function are part of a class , based on the self keyword , if so they all can access class variable without the need of global keyword, if they are not part of a class you can:define  each function with a given parameter to the function and make that function return a value.
