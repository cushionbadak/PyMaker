What would be an efficient/pythonic way of managing a header list and an associated variable list (changing one and automatically/easily changing the other)?In the example here, I would have liked to define the list of variables next to the header list, and not far away in the middle of the code. (In my actual code of 20+fields, hundreds of lines of code, and several places where I wish to call add_row(), it is very burdening)---Update---i guess this does what i want the code to do, but it doesnt seem to be the "pythonic" way ...
There are various ways to do this. The best way depends on the details of how the contents of the row are actually calculated. For the simple example given in your question you can create a function that computes the row contents. Eg,outputBut if the computations are more complex you may find it better to use a class to manage things. And you may wish to use @property decorators to perform the calculations.
