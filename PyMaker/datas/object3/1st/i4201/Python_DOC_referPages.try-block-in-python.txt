am I using the try block correctly? I am using treehouse and am getting the error that task 1 is no longer passing meaning something has gone wrong with my def add(num1, num2)is my try in the right spot? it says "Add a try block before where you turn your arguments into floats."
Place the try-except block inside the function.Ex:
Try needs to be inside a function definition and does not need an else. Basically, the except functions as the try's else.
you should do:The problem is that you are trying to create a function but returning values outside that function, and for the case of your else statement, the function is not even defined at that point and you are calling it.
