I am doing this array pair sum problem which says:Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that sum up to a specific value k.So the input:would return 2 pairs:Seems a pretty simple problem. This is what I my script looks like:And I is working fine with few test cases except this one:pair_sum([1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5,5,13,14,11,13,-1],10)My code is returning 5 but it should return 6. I know that this can be manually calculated and then I can check which pair is missing but what if the test case is sufficiently large. I can't check manually for each case.Can anyone tell what am I doing wrong here because I might have considered almost every possible pair. Also, like what if I don't want to use set here like can there be a more general solution which is not specific to any language. Because how can you get unique pair without using set?
I can't vouch for the efficiency of this, but:Just loop over all pairs, keeping only those whose first element comes before the second so as to avoid duplicates. 
What I did is I added the elements to the set and took the difference between my sum and the element of list. If difference is in my set then I paired them 
You can do this by using the pairwise() recipe shown in the itertools documentation as shown below.Output:
