I am running a code with pdbI would like to pass a file on the command line, where I can specify the breakpoints. The code selects some dataset thought the passed parameter -- in this case 3. I am running this script on a cluster. I know it is possible setting up .pdbrc, but I have some jobs running this code on different datasets (on those datasets the code works properly) and I don't want to interfere with that -- actually the other jobs are on the cluster queue and they could start anytime.EDIT: would it be possible to set breakpoints, continue to next breakpoint, set a variable, continue to next breakpoint?
You can use -c option (python 3 only). Docs quote (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html):New in version 3.2: pdb.py now accepts a -c option that executes  commands as if given in a .pdbrc file, see Debugger Commands.to set a breakpoint on line 3 (and go to it - second '-c' need for this):about sequence of instructions: yes, multiple -c options = multiple instructions. But it seems that with this method you cant set variables: -c "aaa=1" not works. You can try to use alias command to predefine some vars through command line args - additional manual command in pdb and all needed will be set:
