I recently made a program in Python that calculates the prime numbers under 1,000,000 and puts them in a list, primelist. Here it is:In no way is this program optimized; it's just a basic implementation of the sieve of eratosthenes. Recently I decided to learn how to code in C++. I wrote a direct translation of my Python code into C++, here it is:From what I've heard, C++ is much faster at number crunching than Python. But, the Python script took 0.74 seconds to run and the C++ script took 13.29 seconds to run(according to the outputs of both)! Why is there such a big difference? Is there something wrong with my code?I ran the python script with python itself and I compiled and ran the C++ script with Visual Studio 2017. Could Visual Studio be causing this delay? If so, how do I compile and run a C++ program without Visual Studio? I'm having trouble figuring this out.Thanks for any help!
https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html time.clock in python is in floating point secondshttp://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/clock/clock in c++ is in clicks, (this varies per machine, but every machine has > CLOCKS_PER_SEC) in c++ I corrected the output line tofor second level outputon my machine the python output is 0.4045815671380151 s and the c++ output is .02s
