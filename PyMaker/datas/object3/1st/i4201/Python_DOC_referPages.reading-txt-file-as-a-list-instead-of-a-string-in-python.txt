Natural Text
I have a file that is made of lines of the following format:-eg:-Now i want to read this as list directly into python instead of a string first and then spliting the string by , and joining it back and all because the text section can have a ',' and I dont want to split that.I am looking for something like this:
Your input is obviously generated by calling just printing out Python lists (or calling str or repr on them).This particular example can be handled by using literal_eval:However, that won't work for all Python list displays in general. And when it doesn't workâ€¦ well, there's not much you can do in general. But you can just literal_eval until you get an error, and then, for each error, laboriously work out how to pre-process things to work around it.The right thing to do is generate output that's actually parseable, like JSON, and then you can just parse it trivially.
