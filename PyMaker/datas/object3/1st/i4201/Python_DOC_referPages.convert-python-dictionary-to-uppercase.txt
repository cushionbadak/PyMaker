For some reason my code refuses to convert to uppercase and I cant figure out why. Im trying to then write the dictionary to a file with the uppercase dictionary values being inputted into a sort of template file. 
In python 3 you cannot do that:because it changes the dictionary while iterating over it and python doesn't allow that (not with python 2 because items() returns a copy of the elements). Besides, even if it worked, it would keep the old keys (also: it's very slow to create a dictionary at each iteration...)Instead, rebuild your dict in a dict comprehension:
You should not change dictionary items as you iterate over them. The docs state:Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may  raise a RuntimeError or fail to iterate over all entries.One way to update your dictionary as required is to pop values and reassign in a for loop. For example:An alternative is a dictionary comprehension, as shown by @Jean-Fran√ßoisFabre.
