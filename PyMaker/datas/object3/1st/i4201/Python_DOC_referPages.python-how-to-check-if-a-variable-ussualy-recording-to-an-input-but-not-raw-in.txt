I'm new at stackoverflow and learning python now. I have a question and searched for it everywhere but couldn't find anything suits my idea.So the problem is I want to check if an input (or variable) is a letter or a word or contains any letters. For an example, if the variable or respond of input is a it will return False but if the respond or variable is made of just numbers it will respond True.I really am new in python and don't know so much commands so if there is an existing command (Or tag) which is doing just my work pls don't blame me! Thx by now and here is the code I wanted to test if the input is a letter because it was going to give an error if  a letter put in. 
From your code it is visible that you want your code to stop when the user inputs none and give output when the user inputs a digit.Until that you want to keep taking inputs.code:I have used from future import print_function since i m using python 3 and from your code it seems you are using python 2.So this code will work for you too :)Do tell if it worked. 
You can use the built-in function for strings: isdigit().Here you can find the documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit
