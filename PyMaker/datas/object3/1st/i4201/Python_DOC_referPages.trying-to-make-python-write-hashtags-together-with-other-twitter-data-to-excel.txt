As we all know Python can be used to parse Twitter data from Tweepy. I'm teaching myself some Python, but I'm struggling in some parts of the program. I'm able to collect data and let Python write that data to .txt files, but letting Python filter that raw data is another thing.One new thing I'd like to learn is to attach hashtags to certain rows, but the hashtags are encoded in entities in the .json file. (Edit: example file removed, answer given below should be enough.)Edit: I deleted the sloppy code I made, since it was not helpful nor do I want that here for several reasons. It is also not needed for the anser given below, which perfectly explains how to extract hashtags!
