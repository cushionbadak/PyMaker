pop takes an index that is removed from the list and the value that was on this index is returned.  You are not giving it an index - but a max value - indexes into lists must be integers of course. You could work somthing out with .find() - or overthink your whole approach:Sometimes it is easier to do things with some knowledge about python libraries.Especially: collections.CounterIt is a specialized dictionary that is good in counting, it will pass your whole text once and add/increment its keys for each character. You are invoking .count() 26 times - once for each character inside string.ascii_lowercase - each time traversing the whole string to count the occurence of once character in it.Output:
