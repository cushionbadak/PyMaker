Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I couldn't find the exact answer or a close-enough in other questions. I am also fairly new to Python. I am looking for a way to check if a users input is valid when selecting pizzas out of the tuple. (e.g if the user inputs anything over 11 in my case I would want the program to restart the function.) Here is the full code of my program so far. The function in question is this one below - def selectFunction():How would I go about checking if a users input is on the list/tuple of pizzas? (e.g if a user inputs 999 for selected_pizza I would want the program to repeat selectFunction() again until a valid pizza(s) is selected then move on to totaling the price of the pizzas and then moving on to the next function totalFunction() )I have tried using IndexError: but it appears that I don't understand how to use it as it doesn't seem to work either skipping over and giving me an error or getting into an infinite loop. Essentially I need a way of handling an index error. Below is an example of what happens at the moment. Would highly appreciate it if somebody could help. ThanksIlyas. 
Read the input, validate it, then add it to the selected_pizza list.while selected_pizza is not int: is not correct. That condition will always be true, since selected_pizza is a list, and a list is not int.You should also stop using so many global variables. amountFunction() should return the amount, and then it should be passed as an argument to selectFunction().
From what I understand, I would do it like this. I created a separate function for selecting one valid pizza and then added to function to select many pizzas.I hope it helps.
