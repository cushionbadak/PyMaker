I'm trying to make the code display Grade B and Grade C when I am giving it a certain exam score and attendance. However, it isn't doing this. The Grade A bit is perfect though. It's coming up with an invalid syntax error for examscore, although I've used the same 'syntax' on the two lines above it and it's not working. I'm only new to Python and this is one of my first projects.This is the error I got.Thanks in advance.
Actually, you don't need to check the upper range at all since it is always covered by previous checks and you're using elif.
You need: instead of:
You cannot write elif examscore >80 or <=90, the correct syntax is elif examscore >80 <=10
You have a couple of problems.First off:is not valid syntax.  Think of it as [examscore > 80] OR [ <= 90 ] AND [attendance > 90].  I think you'll see that [ <= 90 ] is not something that can be evaluated.  Instead, it should say [examscore <= 90 ].Secondly, different languages follow different rules in how they "bind" AND and OR conditions.  Without parentheses, it's hard to determine how you intend for this logic to be evaluated.  I'm guessing that what you're hoping for is:meaning that anyone who scored over 80 or less than 90 but had an attendance of greater than 90, gets a "B" (which is a funny metric for getting a B -- they could score 0, and as long as they where in class, they get "B"? -- but that's not relevant to your question).  Without the parens, it's hard to be sure.
Your syntax error is due to invalid or condition. <= expects variables on both sides. You can fix this by using
