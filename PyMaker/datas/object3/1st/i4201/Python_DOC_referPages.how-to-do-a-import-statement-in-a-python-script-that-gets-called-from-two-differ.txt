I'm trying to import a file but I can only get it to work from one context at a time.This my project structure:script.py is usually called externally directly it imports utilities1.pyutilities1.py imports utilities2.pytest.py Is a file that contains tests and includes both utilities1.py and utilities2.pyMy question is how to do the import statement in utilities1.pyWhen I call it from script.py it needs to beBut when I call it from test.py that results in an error requiring it to beIs there a way I can get the import statement right in both contexts?Or do I need to change something structurally in my project?Thank you :) 
If what you want is being able to use import utilities1 from test.py you could modify the search path of modules. sys.path is the list of paths where the interpreter will look for modules to import. Do print(sys.path) and you'll see. You can also modify it while running your script.For example, keeping with the file structure you described   In test.py I have inserted module in sys.path which is the relative path where the running script will to be looking into for modules utilities1 or utilities2. That's why it is able to acess directly yo those two modules.If that's not what you were trying to do, please explain further.
