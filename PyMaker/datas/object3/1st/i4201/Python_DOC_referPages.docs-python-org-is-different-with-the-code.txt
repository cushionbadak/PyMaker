Natural Text
I'm a beginner in Python. I noticed the DOC said the function decimal.getcontext().divmod(x,y) returns the integer part of the result.But the code is:and the a.__divmod__(b, context = self) is（I just paste the end of the function）:Does that mean that the function returns a tuple includes quotient and remainder? If that is so, why the doc said 'returns the integer part of the result.'I tried to find that it did return to a tuple.So, does the doc wrong?
In answer form:The doc is just wrong. divmod does what its builtin equivalent does.
