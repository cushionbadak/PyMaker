I have a list with N elements and a list of booleans with N Truesi would like to place the elements of a into a list b using ind as index, which result inIs there a way to do so in an efficient and easily-readable way?The best way I could achieve this is doingbut that looks a bit overcomplicated to me
Since you have N elements, and N True's in your list, using an iterator works great here.  You can use the iter() function to convert your list to an iterator.Now you can get your desired result using a simple list comprehension.  This list comprehension will replace True with the next value in your iterator, and will replace False with 0:Which results in:Calling next(a) will keep grabbing values from your iterator at which point it will raise a StopIteration exception.  However, since you have an equal number of elements and True's, this exception will not occur.
