So when I have objectsand use tuple-unpacking, is there a way to subscript the tuple-unpacking notation which could look like this:Without using subscript on the whole comprehension?
No, you cannot slice an unpacking operation.There are various possible workarounds though:If the iterable you're unpacking can be sliced, just slice it directly. For example, to get the 3rd element of a range:So why are we using [2:3] here? It's simple: range(4)[2] would return a single integer, and integers can't be unpacked:But range(4)[2:3] returns a single-element list, so the unpacking succeeds.If the iterable can't be sliced, slice it anyway by using itertools.islice:If you only want a single element of a slice-able iterable, just don't unpack the iterable at all:
