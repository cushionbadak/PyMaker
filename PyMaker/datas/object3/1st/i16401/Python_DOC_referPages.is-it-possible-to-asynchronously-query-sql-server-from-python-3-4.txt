Is it possible to perform asynchronous queries against Microsoft SQL Server from Python (3.4), i.e. in the context of an asyncio event loop?The following is a skeleton asyncio program, where the (async) SQL query should be fitted into the do_it function:
For now there is only PostgreSQL native asyncio support via aiopg library.But you can run synchronous calls to MSSQL by loop.run_in_executor().
The one option I have found so far is the commercial product mxODBC Connect, which unfortunately costs several hundred dollars. By providing a proxy server to SQL Server, it is able to support asynchronous calls. Supposedly the async support is implemented via gevent, so I don't know how well it'll fit into asyncio. From Python's ODBC wiki, mxODBC is the only product listed with async support.
I hate a "don't do that" answers, but the article by Mike Bayer, the creator of SQLAlchemy makes me think exactly exactly that: "when it comes to stereotypical database logic, there are no advantages to using it versus a traditional threaded approach, and you can likely expect a small to moderate decrease in performance, not an increase
