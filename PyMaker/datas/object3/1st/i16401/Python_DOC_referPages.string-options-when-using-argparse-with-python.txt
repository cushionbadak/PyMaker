I'm not quite understanding the following behavior of argparsein case of option1, args.option1 is an integer, when provided.in case of option2, args.option2 looks like an array of strings. I have to use args.option2[0] if I want to get the actual string passed with option2
This is explained directly in the documentation on nargs. Summarizing:For nargs=N, if N is an integer, you get a list of N values. Even if N is 1.For nargs='?', you get a single value (which may be the default).For nargs left off entirely, you get whatever the default is for the action. If the action is, e.g., store, that means a single value, not a list of one value.It even explicitly points out exactly the part that's surprised you:Note that nargs=1 produces a list of one item. This is different from the default, in which the item is produced by itself.
