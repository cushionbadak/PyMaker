Is file a keyword in python?I've seen some code using the keyword file just fine, while others have suggested not to use it and my editor is color coding it as a keyword.
No, file is a builtin, not a keyword:It can be seen as an alias for open(), but it has been removed from Python 3, as the new io framework replaced it. Technically, it is the type of object returned by the open() function.
