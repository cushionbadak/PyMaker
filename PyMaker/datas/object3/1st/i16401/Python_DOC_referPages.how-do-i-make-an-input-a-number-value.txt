This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I just started coding today and I'm trying to write a simple program to add vectors. So far I have When I run the script everything works but the inputs aren't treated like numbers.For example, if VectorAx=1, VectorAy=6, VectorBx=3 and VectorBy=2, VectorC should be [4,8], but instead it is displayed as [13,62].
input always returns a string object.  If you want the inputs to be numbers, you need to convert them into numbers with either int or float:Demo:
You'll want to use the built-in int() function.Per the documentation, this function will "convert a number or string x to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments are given."This converts input passed to it to an integer.So, the resulting code should be:
Cast your vectors to floats (if you plan on having decimals) or ints (if they will always be simple integers) then add. Right now they are being taken in as strings. Thus "1"+"3" == "13"Whereas int("1") + int("3") == 4Therefore:or you can simply cast here:
