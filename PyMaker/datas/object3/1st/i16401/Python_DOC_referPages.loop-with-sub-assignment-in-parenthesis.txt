Is there a way to do this in Python? (I know you can do it Java.)E.g. In java the above pseudo code translates to:EDIT:... answered... but is this the only way?
Edit:In this particular case, you could use a for-loop and iter:iter(input, 'quit') will keep calling the input function and assigning its return value to inp as long as this value does not equal 'quit'.No, you cannot perform inline assignments in Python.  The grammar simply doesn't allow it (remember that assignments are statements in Python).You can however do something like this:It is roughly equivalent to what you wanted to do.
You can define inp before your loop and reassign inside the while:If you want to quit before entering the while loop set inp = input() initially.
