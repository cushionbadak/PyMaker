Regex is not the right tool for this because you are not matching patterns, just looking for substrings.  Instead, you should use any and a generator expression:As a bonus, this solution is lazy like your current one (it only performas as many in membership tests as needed)

You may not need regex to do this but if you still want to, here's a way:http://regex101.com/r/jH8fO4/3 <-- see the regex in action.^.*\.(jpeg|jpg|png|gif)$you can of course add more to the end of the expression in order to handle cases where there's a request or variable attached to the url.edit - updated to comply with the possibility of more than 1 dot in the filename: http://regex101.com/r/jH8fO4/4 ^[a-z0-9]*\.{1}(jpeg|jpg|png|gif)$
Doing the same thing using regular expressions would look something like this.
I would use os.path.splitext:
