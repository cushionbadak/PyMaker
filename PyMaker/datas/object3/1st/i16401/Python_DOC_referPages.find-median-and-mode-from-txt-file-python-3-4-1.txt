I am trying to determine the median and mode from a list of numbers in "numbers.txt" file. I am EXTREMELY new to python and have ZERO coding experience. This is what I have so far calculating mean, sum, count, max, and min but I have no idea where to go from here. 
If you want to find the median and mode of the numbers, you need to keep track of the actual numbers you've encountered so far. You can either create a list holding all the numbers, or a dictionary mapping numbers to how often you've seen those. For now, let's create a (sorted) list from those numbers:Or shorter: numbers = sorted(map(int, f))Now, you can use all sorts of builtin functions to calculate count, sum, min and maxCalculating the mode and median can also be done very quickly using the list of numbers:
Maybe there is a reason for it but why are you avoiding using the python libraries? Numpy and scipy should have everything you are looking for such a task. Have a look at numpy.genfromtxt() , numpy.mean() and scipy.stats.mode().
