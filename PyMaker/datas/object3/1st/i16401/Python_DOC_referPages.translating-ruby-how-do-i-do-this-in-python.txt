I want to find a particular element in a list like this:I know in Python I can do:But this returns a list as opposed to the element I want.I know how I can do this by iterating through the list, but I want to know if there's a more concise way of doing it.
You can find the first matching element with a generator expression and next():This sets match to None if no elements matched.Because a generator expression is used, only enough elements in my_list are inspected to find the first match, after which the search is stopped.The sample search you gave is rather pointless, of course, as you are basically using simple equality. For more complex attribute searches it makes more sense.
You could use list.index, whichreturns the index in the list of the first item whose value is x. It is an error if there is no such item.If all your app does is searching for exact keys, you could also use a dictionary (called Hash in Ruby, I guess) instead - to reduce lookup times from O(n) to amortized O(1).
