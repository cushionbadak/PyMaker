Natural Text
I am working with python-3.x on windows 7. I have a string that consists of millions of characters. Consider for example:I want to get the ranges that are N. In here, [[4,7], [13,18], [23,24]].I can not just take positions of Ns and then convert them to ranges because it's a huge data and this method will be too slow.It seems such an easy problem but actually no good way comes to my mind.Is there a fast way to do this?
Not sure how this scales to a string of millions of characters, but you could try regular expressions:Update: Tried this with randomly generated strings of A, C, G, T, and N. For 1,000,000 characters, list(spans) takes less than one second, and for 10,000,000 it takes about 10 seconds on my not-at-all-new computer, finding about 1,600,000 groups of Ns.
A solution without re:Measuring with ipython's magic %timeit:EDIT: Added a guard to the end with chain, in order to make it work when the last item in the sequence is the searched element.
