I am writing a simple checkers program. I am trying to get a nice ASCII output of the game state. Here is the function I am trying to use:(outside the class definition):I cannot see what is wrong with it, yet here is what is happening.The desired output isEDIT: For those who get stuck in a similar place, here is the working solution:
A common mistake. list*N does a shallow copy, e.g. in x = â€¦; l = [x]*4 the l is the same as l = [x,x,x,x]. Now if x is a list, then you edit the references in multiple places.See How do I create a multidimensional list? in the official Python FAQ for more details. But the short version is: instead of [x]*4, write [x for _ in range(4)], and you'll get four separate copies of x instead of four references to the same x.
