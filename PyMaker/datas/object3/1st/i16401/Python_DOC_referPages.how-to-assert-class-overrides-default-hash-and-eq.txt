I'm writing a class decorator in python. As part of the decorator I would like to assert that the class does not use the default __eq__ and __hash__ methods. How can I do this?I've explored these (besides googling, and looking in docs):Testing the class's __dict__ appears to work, but it doesn't seem to work if the class inherits the methods from a super class. So I could traverse the inheritance graph looking for the methods, but I want to know if there is a cleaner implementation first.This is in 2.7, but would also like it to work in 3.x
If the whole class hierarchy needs to count, you could use:This only returns True if there is no __eq__ attribute in any of the classes in the MRO, except for object. This won't work for old-style Python 2 classes, as they don't have a class.mro() method, however.
