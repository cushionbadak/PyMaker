Natural Text
This example works fine example:Now, I want to do the same thing but with a variable: var= "hash me this text, please". How could I do it following the same logic of the example ?
The hash.update() method requires bytes, always.Encode unicode text to bytes first; what you encode to is a application decision, but if all you want to do is fingerprint text for then UTF-8 is a great choice:The exception you get when you don't is quite clear however:If you are getting the hash of a file, open the file in binary mode instead:
Try this. Hope it helps.The variable var has to be utf-8 encoded. If you type in a string i.e. "Donald Duck", the var variable will be b'Donald Duck'. You can then hash the string with hexdigest()
