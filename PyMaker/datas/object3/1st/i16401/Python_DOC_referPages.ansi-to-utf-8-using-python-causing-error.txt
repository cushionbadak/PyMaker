While I was trying to write a python program that converts Ansi to UTF-8, I found thishttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14732996/how-can-i-convert-utf-8-to-ansi-in-pythonwhich converts UTF-8 to Ansi. I thought it will just work by reversing the order. So I codedBut it causes error.So I changed to Then it causes another error:How should I fix my code to solve this problem?
You are trying to use the Python 3 version of the open() function, on Python 2. Between the major versions, I/O support was overhauled, supporting better encoding and decoding.You can get the same new version in Python 2 as io.open() instead.I'd use the shutil.copyfileobj() function to do the copying, so you don't have to read the whole file into memory:Be careful though; most people talking about ANSI refer to one of the Windows codepages; you may really have a file in CP (codepage) 1252, which is almost, but not quite the same thing as ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1). If so, use cp1252 instead of latin-1 as the encoding parameter.
