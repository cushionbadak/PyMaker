So I have a double problem. I have selectedCards list, which contains 2 elements - card rank and suit, in this format: ['6', 'c'] club = u"\u2663" # Unicode codepoint for clubnewList = [club for i in selectedCards if i == 'c' else i]I want to change 'c' into graphical representation of club, but this expression not working. I tried searching a lot but couldn't find what's wrong. It says: SyntaxError: invalid syntaxSecond problem, If I remove else statement, then it works, but it does not output what I want, it looks like this: [u'\u2663'], even thought print(club) outputs â™£.EDIT: newList = [club if i == 'c' else i for i in selectedCards] is the correct syntax, thanks to xtofl.
Probably you are better off with a dict:(or if you want to go functional:)As for the 1st problem: cfr https://stackoverflow.com/a/4260304/6610For the 2nd, printing, problem: python just gives you 'a' list representation; if you want it in string form, this did the trick for me:(hint: it would be wise to represent you card in a Card class containing all this logic, somewhat like)
