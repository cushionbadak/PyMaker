This question already has an answer here:Get filename from file pointer [duplicate]                    1 answer                pretty straight forward to you guys but how do you modify the values output from the %s?I have tried using ()'s, {}'s, but nothing is working?iFile is the name of the file and I want it to be displayed with .txt at the end when its displayed.Edit:I get the output Successfully created the file: <open file 'test', mode 'rb' at 0x14cef60>.txt
Use str.format(*args, **kwargs:Example:EditSince you seem to have a file, not a file name, you could do this:Note that now the output is foo.txt.txt with a double extension. If you don't want this because the name of the file already is foo.txt, you don't should print the additional extension.Using % is the old way to format strings. The current Python tutorial explains format in detail.
The problem is that you're not passing it a string with the file name - you're passing it a file handle object, which is totally different. To get a name out of a file handle, use iFile.name.That will print what you're looking for.
you can try the following code. I tried in in Python shell and it works. I think you were just missing the parentheses. or
