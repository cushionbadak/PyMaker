How can I check if a dictionary (actually dictionary-like object) has all of a given set of keys (plural)?So far, I have used:Is there a more elegant and Pythonic way of doing this?
Use the builtin function all()
You may also try like this:
You can just use keyword "in"ex:d = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 }if 'd' in d:    print 'yes'else:    print 'no'
