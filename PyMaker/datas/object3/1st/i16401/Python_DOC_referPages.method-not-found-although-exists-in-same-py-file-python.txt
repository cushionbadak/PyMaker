I am new to python, my background is VB.  I am receiving the error as "NameError: name 'GetASetting' is not defined". Log:Both the class and def are in same .py file.Code:I did a work around by placing the def in class, but, the above code should work, could you please enlighten me as to what error I did above, I checked the names and they are correct?
As Ignacio said, GetASetting needs to exist before you can use it. The exact reason is this: Class definitions as well as function signatures (where default values for arguments might contain executable code) are executed when the Python interpreter comes across them for the first time – hence, your function GetASetting needs to exist at this time already. (On the other hand, this also means that you could use if/else and other control flow statements in your class definition, too.)Anyway, if you do not want this (and you usually don't—due to unintuitive errors like the one you encountered), you should use a constructor for your class:This is also a good idea in terms of testability – now every instance of SettingList is initialized upon creation such that, in theory, you could mock out dependencies like file access, i.e. the settings file on your disk.
GetASetting needs to exist before you can use it. With the way your code is structured, it does not. Define GetASetting before the class definition.
