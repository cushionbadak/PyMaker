I'm in my 101 level class and the instructions that I am operating under dictate that I have a parallel lists.  One list will be student name and the second will be student test scores.  The goal is to average four test scores per student and issue a letter grade.  I've seen numerous topics here regarding passing lists as arguments to functions but so far I haven't seen any that address how to have a function only use a set number of elements of a list per iteration.Now my question, I am writing a function to average four test scores per student (5 total students).  The scores are stored in a list of 20 (one of the two parallel lists that I have to have with the other being the student names).  How, or can I, write the code to only look at four list elements per iteration (5 total iterations) and average those?  
I believe what is meant is the code below.. for example...how can we "for-loop" through the list Scores, and break each four elements and calculate the average of the corresponding student...why not just loop through the student ????Result would be:On the other hand, if you want to solve it with only one "for = loop", you can do below:
I'm not sure of what you are asking.There's many way to do something like this:
