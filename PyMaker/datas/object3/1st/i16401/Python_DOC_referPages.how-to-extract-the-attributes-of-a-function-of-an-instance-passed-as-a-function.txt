How can I extract the attributes of the "SimpleSubscriber object from the following method object?This object has been passed as a function, but is a function of an instance as we can see above. I would like to reference the above object (saved in a list in different class than its own) from the instance where this function resides.Nothing in dir() seems to help.self within the instance returns:so this instance cannot reference itself in its own method, from within the other class.So basically, I am trying to access the attributes offromI'm trying to extract unique identifiers of the instance. Is that possible?
A bound method holds references to the original function and the instance it is bound to; this is how it passes in the instance as the first argument when your method is called.If you wanted to access the instance it is bound to, use the __self__ attribute:You can then access any attributes you need on that instance, including the method itself again:Attributes like these are documented in the Datamodel reference, but for a quick overview the inspect module has a handy table.
