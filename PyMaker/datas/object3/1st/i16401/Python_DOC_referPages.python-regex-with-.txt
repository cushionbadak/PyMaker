I'm trying to split a string containing Swedish characters with re.split, but I can't get the code to work.The output is:EDIT: The third word is supposed to be "gå". The Swedish character "å" is missing.I'm on Mac OS X Mavericks, using Python 3.4 and "locale" in Terminal (Bash) outputs:I've found this thread on Ubuntu Forum, but I can't see why it's not working for me although the locale is correct. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1534940
Small Typo: use \w, not \WThis will work:In Python:Output:Explanation\W matches chars that are not letters, digits or underscores, which is the opposite of what we want to match the wordsIn Python 2, \w matches an ASCII letter, digit or underscore (unless, as @MartijnPieters points out, you use the re.UNICODE option)In Python 3, \w matches a unicode letter, ideogram, digit or underscore, (unless, as @MartijnPieters points out, you use the re.ASCII option) so the accented letters are unneeded (\w+ is enough)
You are including å in the characters to split on. It appears you have misunderstood what the split does.re.split() will split the words on anything that matches the characters class; in your case that means anything \W matches (anything that is not a letter, a number or _), and you added the characters åÅäÄöÖ to that set.Omit those characters if you don't want them to be split on:In a Unicode regular expression, they are not part of the \W character set to begin with.Demo:As \w is the inverse of \W, you can also use re.findall() instead of re.split(), using the \w pattern to extract the words rather than remove the non-word characters:with the added advantage that there now is no trailing empty string left.Again, when using a Unicode pattern, all letters are included, the character set is not limited to just the ASCII letter characters.
