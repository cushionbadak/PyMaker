I'm trying to run this script using the codeand I'm getting this error:i have tried changing path but nothing seems to work, any ideas?
Eitherorshould work.
Try this:From the documentation:args is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence  of program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally  preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required  escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file  names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see  below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed  without specifying any arguments.Also note that in python, like many other languages, the backslash in a normal string has special meaning. You'll have to use double backslashes or a raw string to get the behavior you want.
