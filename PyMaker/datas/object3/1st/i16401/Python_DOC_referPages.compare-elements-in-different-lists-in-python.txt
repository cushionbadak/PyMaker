So I have a question about how to compare elements in different lists in python. I have lists like this:So what I want is to compare element2 in each list, if element2 are the same, I want to keep only one list which contains the largest element 3 (assume element 3 is integer). So in the end the element2 in all lists are unique.I'm new in Python, appreciate your patients!
It may not be the most elegent but this works:Hope this helps!edit: Useless line
Check if all second element are equal:zip(l1,l2,l3) looks like [(1, 1, 3), (2, 2, 2), (6, 4, 6), (6, 5, 5)] where    zip(l1,l2,l3)[1] = (2, 2, 2), as set values are unique if the len is  > 1 then we don't have all common second elements.Get list with largest third element:If you have a tie for the biggest third element you can go to the fourth:
First it groups the list by key value.  Then finds largest element based on another key
