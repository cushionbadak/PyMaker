I have seen methods for list comparison on stackoverflow before, but they all seem to return the matches for a list - not the non matches. I am interested to find the method that returns the non matching values (and possibly which list they came from).I would like to return at least which words were NOT found in bouth;If not this;Please offer any solutions for this comparison method(s).
Use set.symmetric_difference for this:
You can use sets for this:The ^ operator finds the symmetric difference between the two sets.
In other words this is what you are looking for: set(listA) - set(listB) | set(listB) - set(listA)
Alternative solution, which does not involve set():
