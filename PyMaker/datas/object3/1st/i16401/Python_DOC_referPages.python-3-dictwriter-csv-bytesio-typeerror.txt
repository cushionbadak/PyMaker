I'm using python 3 trying to generate a csv on the file.I want to ensure that I'm writing utf8 so I'm converting values of my list of dicts into byte stringsI'm getting an exception on the writer.writeheader() callThere doesn't seem to any way to change writerheader to write bytes.What am I doing wrong?
csv mdoule operates on strings according to the documentation:Writer objects (DictWriter instances and objects returned by the  writer() function) have the following public methods. A row must be a  sequence of strings or numbers for Writer objects and a dictionary  mapping fieldnames to strings or numbers (by passing them through  str() first) for DictWriter objects. Note that complex numbers are  written out surrounded by parens. This may cause some problems for  other programs which read CSV files (assuming they support complex  numbers at all).How about using io.StringIO, and later encode it utf-8.
