I am using Python 3.4, and assembling a url to request a json object. But I am having trouble with using the .join() function to add key:value pairs from a dictionary into a string:What I need is for it to return this:But what I get is this:Why is .join() or .format() giving me single quoted values from the dict?
The !r format code calls an object's __repr__ method, which automatically adds the quotes.  You want to use the !s format code, which calls the __str__ method:Note however that explicitly writing !s is unnecessary because it is the default format code:
This has nothing to do with the join() method, but with the format method.You are telling him to do so with the !r format specifier. Use !s or nothing instead:Consider reading the Format Specification Mini-Language to learn all the functionalities of str.format.
