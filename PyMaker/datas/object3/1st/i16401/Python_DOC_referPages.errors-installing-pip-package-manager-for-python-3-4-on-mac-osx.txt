I'm trying to install pip for python 3.4. Here's the error message that I get.The python version information of my system is hereunder:This is my pathHow do I install pip and then virtualenv. Any help will be appreciated.
Since you are putting the Python 3.4 bin directory at the end of your PATH, running python in Terminal is resulting in /usr/bin/python being called, which is the system version 2.6. Try just running python and you'll see.To fix it, set your PATH up like so:2.7/bin contains a python executable, while 3.4/bin should also contain a python3 executable. Now, when you run python from the command prompt, the Python.org version of Python 2.7 will start up, and if you run python3 then version 3.4 will start. Download get-pip.py from here, then run it using python3. Depending on your system configuration, you may need to prefix the command with sudo (i.e., sudo python3 get-pip.py).Python 3.4 already comes with venv, so you should be able to run pyvenv /path/to/virtual_env to set up a virtual environment.
