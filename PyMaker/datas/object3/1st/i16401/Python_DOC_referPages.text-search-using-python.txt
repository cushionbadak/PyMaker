Natural Text
I am working on a text search project, and using text blob to search for sentences from text.TextBlob pulls all the sentences with the keywords efficiently. However for effective research i also want to pull out one sentence before and one after which I am unable to figure. Below is the code I am using:
If you want to get the lines before and after the match, you can either create a loop and memorize the previous line, or use slices, like [from:to] on the blob.sentences list.The best way might be to use the enumerate bultin function.Here, blob.sentences[i-1:i+2] will extract the sublist spanning from index i-1 (inclusive) to index i+2 (exclusive), and map turns the elements in this list into strings.Note: Actually, you might want to replace i-1 with max(0, i-1); otherwise i-1 could be -1 and Python would interpret this as the last element, yielding an empty slice. If i+2 is higher than the list's length, on the other hand, this will not be a problem.
