Python amateur here again... I'm making a simple greeting program. In the following function the user is to enter their gender. I want it so that the user can enter M for Male or F for female, so it's simple. So I've used the following code:What I want it to then do is from the M or F, create a new variable called 'gender' and either make it Male or Female. I'm unsure how to do this from the M/F input. Can anyone help? Please remember I'm new to this stuff. I tried it by doing this:However it didn't like this, which I knew it wouldn't, but it was worth a try.Thanks in advance! :)
There are two problems here:Male needs to be enclosed with quotes so that it becomes a string literal:Otherwise, a NameError will be raised because Male is undefined.The name choice is undefined because you named the input genderInput.Here is what your code should be:You'll notice too that I called str.upper at the end of the line that gets the input.  This saves you from having to call it once per if-statement.
instead of doing choice = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n) you can put it into gender right away, like so: gender = input("Enter 'M' for Male or 'F' for Female\n)then if you want to check if the user is, male for example, you might do something like: it doesn't really matter what you call gender, you could leave it as choice if you wanted. it's just easier to read and understand if you have it as gender.
