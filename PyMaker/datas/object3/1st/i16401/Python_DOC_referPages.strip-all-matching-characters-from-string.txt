Given any of the following strings:I'd like to run a function on it that will remove any/all '=' characters from the end.  Now, I could write something like this in two seconds, in fact, here goes one, and I can imaging a dozen alternative approaches:But I was wondering if anything like that already exists as part of the Python Standard Library?
str.rstrip() already removes all matching characters:There is no need to loop.
All you need is str.rstrip:From the docs:str.rstrip([chars])Return a copy of the string with trailing characters removed.It should be noted however that str.rstrip only removes characters from the right end of the string.  You need to use str.lstrip to remove characters from the left end and str.strip to remove characters from both ends.
