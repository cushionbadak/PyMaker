Instead you can create the dictionary with values as list:
You can't have duplicate keys in a dictionary. However, you can have multiple values(a list) mapped to each key.An easy way to do this is with dict.setdefault():The other option is to use a collections.defaultdict(), as shown in @YOLO's answer.
