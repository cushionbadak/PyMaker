This question already has an answer here:What are variable annotations in Python 3.6?                    2 answers                What are Type hints in Python 3.5                    3 answers                I was asked recently what this means in python:>>> char : strI had no idea.  I'd never seen that before.  I checked the docs and there isn't anything like that.  One person's suggestion was that it is static type declaration, but there is absolutely nothing in the docs about that either.  With the above, if I>>> type(char) it failsIf I >>> char : str = 'abc' it works, and the results of type(char) is <class: str>.  It can't be static declaration though, because I can >>> char : str = 4 and type(char) becomes <class: int>.So I come here to collect the wisdom of the many SO overlords.  What does that mean?
You are looking at an annotation for a variable. The hint is moved to the __annotations__ mapping:Variable annotations are there to support third-party tooling, such as type checkers; the syntax is new in Python 3.6.See PEP 526 -- Syntax for Variable Annotations, and What's new in Python 3.6:Just as for function annotations, the Python interpreter does not attach any particular meaning to variable annotations and only stores them in the __annotations__ attribute of a class or module.
