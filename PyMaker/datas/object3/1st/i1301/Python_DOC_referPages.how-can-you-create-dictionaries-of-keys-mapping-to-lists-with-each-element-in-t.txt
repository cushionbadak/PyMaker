I think, you're trying to do something like this:However, where are you going with this? This might not the best way to do this with Python. :-) If you can get your current code to work, you can post it to https://codereview.stackexchange.com/ afterwards. You will get valuable feedback on how to improve your code.By the way, you can then look at the "branches" of the "tree" with dict.keys:Which prints
Being interested in how to do trees in python, I searched around and came across some example code on GitHub for a One-line Tree in Python.Create a tree from a defaultdict:Build your tree structure:And print it out;{"New York": {"Manhattan": {}}, "San Francisco Bay Area": {"San Francisco": {}, "South Bay": {"San Jose": {}}}}There's further information on iteration and, in the comments, more useful code and suggestions on loading it from json and pretty printing the structure.
