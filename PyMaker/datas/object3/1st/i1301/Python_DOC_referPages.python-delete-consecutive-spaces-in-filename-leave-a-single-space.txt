Natural Text
1.st step: underscore to spaceOUTCOME:(cant post picture yet.. so:)!This is fine :Dnow i like to delete the surplus spaces in the (changed to) state.PS: im a bloody rookie so please dont kill me yet.tyOutcome, I think the text here doesn't show the spaces..?SOLVED STATE: 
Edit: As was pointed out in the comments, this will only work if there are an even number of spaces.  To generalize it, that is to find how many spaces there are before doing the replacement, something like this could be employed:Of course, now, unfortunately, it isn't any simpler than the other responses, but at least a little for loop and a join is a bit more beginner-friendly to parse the logic of than a regex.
Use regular expression:
Use regex to replace the surplus spaces to just oneTestoutputOr in a single step replace surplus _ with just one spaceTestOutput
