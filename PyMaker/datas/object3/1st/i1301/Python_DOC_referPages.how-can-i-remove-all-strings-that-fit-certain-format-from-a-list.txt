Question: Say I have a list a = ['abd', ' the dog', '4:45 AM', '1234 total', 'etc...','6:31 PM', '2:36']How can I go about removing elements such as 4:45 AM and 6:31 PM and '2:36'? i.e, how can I remove elements of the form number:number|number and those with AM/PM on the end?To be honest, I havent tried much, as I am not sure really where to even begin, other than something like:
You can use regular expression \d+(?::\d+)?$ and filter using it.See demo.https://regex101.com/r/HoGZYh/1Output: ['abd', ' the dog', '1234 total']
Consider using the built-in filter function with a compiled regex.A lambda can also be used for the first argument if, for example, you wanted to avoid compiling a regex, though it is messier.Note that in Python 3, filter returns an iterable object instead of a list.The regular expression here works by accepting all strings except \d\d?:\d\d(\s*[AP]M)?$. This means all strings except for ones matching HH:MM, optionally ending in some whitespace followed by AM or PM.
Try this code in pure Python.Firstly it checks the last two chars, if the last two chars equals to 'am' or 'pm', element should be removed from list.Secondly it checks each element if it contains ':', if ':' is found in the element, then it checks the characters before and after ':'. If characters before and after ':' are digits, the element is removed from list. The idea supports number|number:number and number:number|number.output for this example is :['abd', ' the dog', '1234 total', 'etc...']
The regular expression \d:\d\d$ matches a single digit, then a :, followed by two digits.\d+:\d+$ would match any number n >= 1 of digits  on each side of the :. I suggest you play around with it. The documentation is here.Detail: $ specifies the end of the string, and re.match starts looking at the start of the string.
A regex is the easy answer.Here is an alternative with pure Python:Note that there is a side effect of '1234'.split(':') that serves to filter all digits as well.If there is a possibility of '1:2:3' type numbers:
You don't need regex, try using:Or use a much easier solution with regex:Or a version of non-regex that's also much easier:
Check this implementation.OUTPUT
