I am trying to create a csv file with a single column of file paths. I need a second column filled with ones.The result I want to get is as follows;The code I tried is this;However, it doesn't seem to work. Could you help?
You don't need Numpy for this. Just do something likeand you're golden.
If you don't care about how the file is created (as long as it works), go for AKX's solution.If you want to do it with Numpy, you need to get your dtype straight. np.savetxt has a default formatter which has trouble understanding the array you gave it.This is how I managed to get your desired output:
In each iteration of your loop, you only ever write to data[0][0]. You need to alter your loop to change the array position you're setting as you loop over the range.
In csv file the delimiter is ";" not ",".
I would use Dataframes from the Pandas library. A similar approach to chitown88's answer, but more compact.
I personally like to store all my data into a dataframe and then at he very end, save it to a csv file, as opposed to writing after each iteration.so I initialize a blank dataframe called resultsthen iterates through your range, creating your file_path string. Then I create that 1 row with the current file_name string and your 2nd column. That gets appended to the results dataframe, then moves on to the next item in your list/range. Continues that process until it's done, then saves the final results dataframe to file
