I have this function above. I want to use the m variable from this function in send_mail function below.I made the m variable as global but still I am getting m as undefined
The proper way to do this would be to have some module-level scope where m is defined, and then passed between the functions.This means ending the function make_bill() with a line line return m, the send_mail() function made to take the m as an input, and then the module would look like
