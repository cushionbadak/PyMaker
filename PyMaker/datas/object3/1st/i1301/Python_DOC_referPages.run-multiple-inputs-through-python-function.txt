I'm running multiple floats through a function to generate a scientific notation. However, not all floats are put in at all times (it is randomised) therefore generating an error.Input:Function:In other words, 'rst' does not always consist of four elements (thanks for pointing it out Singh).Is someone willing to point me in the right direction?
i don't think you quite understand what the error is. Can you post the error message?I suspect you trying to assign a0,hvt,at,lambd = signify(a0,hvt,at,lambd) is the real culprit, what if "rst" returning from the function does not have 4 elements? That syntax on the left hand side forces the list on the right hand side to be unpacked exactly into 4 elements, and raises a ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 4) in a mismatch.try result = signify(a0,hvt,at,lambd) and check output.Update:If you want to only modify only some of the 4 terms but allow the rest to pass as-is, you Just need an else portion. Here is how you can think of the entire process.We can improve on this.However, This essentially is the same as applying a function on all args. We can create a function that emphasizes this "working on 1 term" approach.But that makes us realise this is just an if-else statement. They do not have to be ugly necessarily. (PS. That last line is a list comprehension.)The condition can be tweaked around a little to give us a cleaner comprehension.Note that these can be written in a single line as well if you prefer.You can use any of the styles which looks the cleanest to you, Or explore and find something even better. Just apply it to your case like this.
