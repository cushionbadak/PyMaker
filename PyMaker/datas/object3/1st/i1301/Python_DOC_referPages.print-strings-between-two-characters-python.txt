This question already has an answer here:Match text between two strings with regular expression                    2 answers                What special characters must be escaped in regular expressions?                    8 answers                I am trying to get a string between two strings as below. I tried below code but it didn't work. and gave me this;print (result.group(1)) = bbdate]august[ebdatethanks in advance
You can use something like:Regex Demo & Explanation:Notes:[bbdate]august[ebdate] isn't  valid python syntax, becauseyou're trying to append a list([bbdate]) to a string(august).You can also use re.sub for this job:r = re.sub(r".*?\](.+)\[.*", r"\1", s)
Try this - The problem is that without the \ the brackets are treated as part of the regex chars and not as part of the string.
