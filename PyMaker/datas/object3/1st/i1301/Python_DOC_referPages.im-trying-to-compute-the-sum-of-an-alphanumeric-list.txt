So this is the original list:I'm trying to generate a sublist out of this which looks like the following:I have successfully generated the list, now I'm trying to compute the sum of the sorted list ** based on the values after **":" for each flight_noExpected output:My Code:My Output:
If you really want to summ up flight-numbers, you can create tuples from your raw data directly and summ them into a dict: (using a defaultdict would be better)Output:What I find a bit curious though is, that you seem to have used the flightnumber from the flightsname as passenger count - should you not count the sold tickets per flight?Counting tickets:Output:You can also use groupby from itertools on a sorted list to group your flights and evaluate them like so:
It'd be easier to use defaultdict, then if you insist on having the output as a list convert it later:If you are using Python <= 3.6 it is not guaranteed that the output will always be in the same order, and I assumed that it does not matter.
It appears as though you are adding together the flight numbers, however I would think you would want to add the passenger totals together, like so:Therefore tickets returns:
