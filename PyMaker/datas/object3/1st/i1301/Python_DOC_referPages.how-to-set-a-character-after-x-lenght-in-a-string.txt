This question already has an answer here:Split the string into different lengths chunks                    5 answers                I'm trying to create a script that automatically replaces a minecraft uuid from b75243c9b8534269b885b036875a627c (without dashes) to b75243c9-b853-4269-b885-b036875a627c (with dashes) in python. But I have no idea how. Can you help me?Thanks!
A quick and easy, albeit not as performative, way is to use uuid.UUID class and pass in your string as an argument
As strings in python are immutable, you cannot insert a character in between.  You can slice the given string and add ' - '.
