This question already has an answer here:How can I generate a file with today's date in its name?                    2 answers                I am scheduling a python script to run everyday,which outputs a dataframe. I wish to save the dataframe everyday with that day's date. For example for today it would be '12/11/18.csv'How can i write such a csv file? I'm doing df.to_csv('datetime.datetime.today().strftime.csv') but as expected it is saving it with the filename 'datetime.datetime.today().strftime.csv' not today's date as such

You can change - with /, but it's quite dirty to have those in file name.
