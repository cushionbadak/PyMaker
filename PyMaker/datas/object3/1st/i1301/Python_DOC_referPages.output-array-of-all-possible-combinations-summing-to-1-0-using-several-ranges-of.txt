Natural Text
I have the following arrays, which represent ranges of numbers I wish to explore:I would like to call one number from each array, such that the 4 numbers always sum to 1.0. I hope to output an array or dataframe that contains all of the possible combinations that sum to 1.0 given my ranges of interest (form 4 x n, where n is the number of different combinations).I'm kind of lost as to what to do next. I looked at the 'permutations()' function, but I don't think it will work here. I hope this is a clear enough description of what I'm trying to accomplish.Thanks!Zack
This should be of help:a is a list of 4-length tuple whose sum is 1. You can convert it to a numpy array. Each tuple has one element for each one of your array.
You can use itertools.product:
