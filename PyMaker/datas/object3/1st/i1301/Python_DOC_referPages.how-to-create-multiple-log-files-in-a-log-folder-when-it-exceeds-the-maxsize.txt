I just want to make new log file with different name in LogFolder when its exceeds the maxbytes size ...please help me how to do it. Thanks in advance..
Have a look at RotatingFileHandlerEDIT to expand the answer as per recommendation from commentThe RotatingFileHandler class supports rotation of disk log files. At instantiation you can supply two optional arguments -  maxBytes with default value of 0 and backupCount with default value of 0You can use the maxBytes and backupCount values to allow the file to rollover at a predetermined size. When the size is about to be exceeded, the file is closed and a new file is silently opened for output. Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in length; but if either of maxBytes or backupCount is zero, rollover never occurs, so you generally want to set backupCount to at least 1, and have a non-zero maxBytes. When backupCount is non-zero, the system will save old log files by appending the extensions ‘.1’, ‘.2’ etc., to the filename. For example, with a backupCount of 5 and a base file name of app.log, you would get app.log, app.log.1, app.log.2, up to app.log.5. The file being written to is always app.log. When this file is filled, it is closed and renamed to app.log.1, and if files app.log.1, app.log.2, etc. exist, then they are renamed to app.log.2, app.log.3 etc. respectively.There is also TimeRotatingFileHandler that allow to rotate log files based on time.
