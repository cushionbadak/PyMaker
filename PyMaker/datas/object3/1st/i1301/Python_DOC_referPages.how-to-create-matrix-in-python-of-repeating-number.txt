I want to:Create a vector list from 0 to 4, i.e. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and from thatCreate a matrix containing a "tiered list" from 0 to 4, 3 times over, once for each dimension.  The matrix has 4^3 = 64 rows, so for example  This is what I have so far:  I am just getting started with Python so any help would be greatly appreciated!
The python itertools module product() function can do this:Giving the result:So to make this into a matrix:

Note, you really want the matrix to have 5^3 = 125 rows. The basic answer is to just iterate in nested for loops:There are other, probably faster, ways of doing this, but for sheer get 'er done velocity, it's hard to beat this.
