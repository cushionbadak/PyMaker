I have defined a python-type using PyTypeObject etc… and I have defined a .tp_str to support the str(myObj) feature… because my type has also a [list] like behavior… I would like to support the list(myObj) feature too. my problem is that I miss a .tp_list entry to support this.my question… how can I do this?thanks
There's no __list__ hook at Python level either. Like implementing the same behavior at Python level, you have to make instances of your class iterable. list(yourobj) will then iterate over your object to gather elements into a list.The C-level slots corresponding to __iter__ and __next__ are tp_iter and tp_iternext, and they work pretty much like __iter__ and __next__ do. If you haven't written an iterator class manually before, I suggest doing it in Python for practice before doing it in C (and remember that the iterator should be a different object from your list-like object).Aside from iteration, you should also implement the sequence protocol if your object really is supposed to be list-like.
