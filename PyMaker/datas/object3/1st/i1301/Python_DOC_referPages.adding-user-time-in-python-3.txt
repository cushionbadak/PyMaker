This is what it looks like now thanks pal.
Simple using timedelta create an offset indicated by timedelta object and ad it to your time object (working the same with date and datetime too).
So if the current time is 17:16 and the user wants to add 1hr 30 to  that. how would i do it.You can use timedelta, i.e.:
Cool so when tring balance = datetime.timedelta(hours=int(time[0]+time[1]), minutes=int(time[2]+time[3]) + datetime.timedelta(hours=int(flex[0]+flex[1]), minutes=int(flex[2]+flex[3]))its complaining that its expecting an interger not a time delta
