The following program is designed to take a string, my_string = "Stackoverflow", and rotate it to the right based off a given integer num.Is this the most efficient way to perform this function? Space complexity wise I know its not favorable to create new variables. Can it be done without creating new variables without sacrificing readability? In place? 
Here is a comparison of suggested answers using Ipython timeit module:Now Test using ipython:OUTPUT:
One way is using collections.deque
Python strings are immutable, so no you cannot do it without creating a new variable.  If you really want to be space efficient, you could use a list of characters or if you want to be very efficient, a byte array 
Yes you can
