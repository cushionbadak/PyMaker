Natural Text
I'm using socket programming for sending a UDP text message and it's working fine. Here is the code:send:recv:Now I want to change the message I'm sending to a list. I tried to do this by using pickle. Here is the code:send:recv:But I'm not getting the correct form of the list in the receiver side. Here is the output:what's wrong?
The problem is solved. The code is working fine, there was a problem because I was printing the data itself not the output of pickle.loads(data), So this code is working fine now:recv:
Sockets are operating on bytes (binary data).Encode your string when sending data to socket connection (str.encode()) and decode byte sequence received from socket with bytes.decode('utf8').https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html#socket-howto
