So I'm trying to improve this script, which returns a bool if an adjacent item is equal.So I feel like this script can be improved using a while loop, but hasn't work for me, my goal is to make it shorter without using modules, any advice?
Just run through each element in the input array (using an index), but the last one to avoid an IndexError, and compare it with the next element:
You could use zip (which is in-built, you don't need to import) to check adjacency condition:Sample runs:
Use enumerate() to iterate through the items in the list and also keep track of the item's position in the list.For each item in the second and subsequent position, compare it to the previous item.
