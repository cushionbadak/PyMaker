Here i have MazeRunner Class which put all elements of self.boxes in queue and run thread on them until all of the queue becomes empty q.empty() .Here problem is how do i actually identify if my program is done performing threads on all elements which are in queue of self.boxes & return True.It looks challenging because our threads are in while loop which keep changes based on self.boxes length & self.threads we defined.i have tried putting all threads in list and t.join them all. But not luck. Any Help?
You need to wait until all threads are done calling Thread.join:HOWTO:Replace your self.threads = 5 expression with class constant:Put additional attribute threads (for a list of threads) into your __init__ method:Put each created thread into threads list:Define method like check_completed to ensure all threads are terminated (done):The way you need to check "all done":
