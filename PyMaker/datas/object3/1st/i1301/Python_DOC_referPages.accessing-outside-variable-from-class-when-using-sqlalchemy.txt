In the following code snippet:why db inside the class can be used as global variable without global? I checked python doc and found:In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.I wonder does this rule apply here? Because db is not only referenced but modified in add_passenger method.
You are not assigning anything to the variable db inside any functions. add_passenger is only calling a method. It alters only internal state, not the reference itself. If you did inside a function then you'd need to use global, otherwise, you'd just get another variable called db at the local scope and using it would not have any effect on the global db object.
