Is there a way to choose a position of an item in a list and then flip the bit for examplethen randomly choose a position in each set of item in the list and flip the bit to 0 to 1 or 1 to 0so for example, it will go through each item in a list and choose random position in each item, 1010101 will turn into 1000101, second item will turn into 1000101, 1011001, etc.
You could use random.choice:OutputEverything is done inside the flip function in 3 main steps. Choose the random position: pos = random.choice(range(len(s))). Change the bit of the position.And finally return a new string by joining the elements of r, return ''.join(r).FurtherChange one character in a string?Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?
