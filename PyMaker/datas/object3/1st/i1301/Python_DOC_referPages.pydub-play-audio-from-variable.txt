I have a function that can generate WAV audio frames into a list. Is there any way I can play audio from that list without using an intermediate file to generate an AudioSegment object?EDIT: For reference, this is my code.
I managed to solve this by using a BytesIO object. Since my library uses wave.open, I can just input an IO-like object to save to and read from. I'm not sure that this is the most pythonic answer, but that is what I used.
I suggest instantiating AudioSegment() objects directly like so:addendum: I see you're generating sound in your linked code snippet. You may be interested in pydub's audio generatorsand one final note: iteratively extending an AudioSegment like this can get slow. You might want to do something like this Mixer example
