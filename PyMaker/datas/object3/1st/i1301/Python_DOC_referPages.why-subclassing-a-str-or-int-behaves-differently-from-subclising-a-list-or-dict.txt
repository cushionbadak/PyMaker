When inheriting from string the value passed to argumentis printed out:Output:Same thing when inheriting from int:Output:However, when I inherit from a list or a dict I get an empty list or dict respectively:Output:Why is there a different behaviour?
Initializing self.argument = argument does not really initialize the object itself (the list), it's just setting an arbitrary attribute called argument. If you are using a half-decent IDE you should see a warning saying Call to __init__ of super class is missing.If you do that you will get your list:And you don't even need self.argument.Now, you will see the same warning when subclassing int as well. The difference between int and list is that int is primitive and works a bit different. You don't even need to pass in argument to super().__init__. You are however required to pass it to IntChild.__init__:See this question for more details about how int works.Users are encouraged to subclass collections.UserList and collections.UserString instead of list and str directly, however there is no UserInt.
