Slicing is available for lists in pythonSimilarly, slicing or anything similar to that available for dictionary ?I would like to get any 3 (can be random) elements of dictionary, just providing the number (as provided above for list [:2]), then i should be getting below dictionaryHow can this dictionary slicing or alternative be achieved in python & Robot-framework ?
Maybe this is a solution you could consider, since a dict can not be accessed as a list:
Just to provide 2 alternatives using only Robot Framework keywords. In essence they follow a similar approach. Get the keys from the dictionary, then slice those and either modify or recreate the dictionary in the desired format.Unless there is a specific reason to not want to use Python for this, I think this functionality should be provided by a Python keyword and not Robot Framework.
I would like to get any 3 (can be random) elements of dictionaryConstructing a list of all dictionary items is not necessary. You can use the dict.items and itertools.islice to slice a fixed number of items:With Python 3.6+, as an implementation detail in CPython 3.6 and officially in 3.7+, this equates to taking the first n items by inseration order.
