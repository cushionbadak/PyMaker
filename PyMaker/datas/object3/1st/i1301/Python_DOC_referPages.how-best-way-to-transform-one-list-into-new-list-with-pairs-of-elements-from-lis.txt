This question already has an answer here:Rolling or sliding window iterator?                    19 answers                My problem was to transform the list [1,2,3,4,5] to [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]].I resolved it with:What the best way to do it?
You can use zip:This gives a list of tuples. If a list of lists is a strict requirement, you can use map:For a generalised solution to your problem, see Rolling or sliding window iterator.
Don't know about the "best" way, but here is another way.
