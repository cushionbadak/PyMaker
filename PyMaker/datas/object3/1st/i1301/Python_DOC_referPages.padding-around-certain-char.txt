Natural Text
I have for example this dict: and I have string, for example : "if (x < 0) {"and I want it to be "if ( x < 0 ) {"what is the way to do it? (its not important to use the dictionary, the important is to add padding around certain chars)
If you want to avoid double-spaces in case padding already exists (as in your example), you could use a regular expression instead, using lookaheads and lookbehind to find places where a character that needs padding is preceeded (?<=...) or followed by (?=...) a non-space character \S:
Try using str.replace:
