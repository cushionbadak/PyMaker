Is there a way to create a GUI for Python scripts that works on Mac, Windows and Linux?There surely must be a universal way.Anyone having an Idea? What about GTK? Any good alternative?
The default way to make GUI applications with python is using the tkinter module https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinterIf however tkinter does not meet your needs, there are several non-standard libraries which can be found here https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html
You could use Kivy, is a cross-platform GUI for Python, could be used on Mac, Windows, Linux,
