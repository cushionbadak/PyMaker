How do I compute the inverse of what is described here: Getting indices of True values in a boolean list ?That above link always comes up when I try searching for "how to obtain the true values in a boolean list from integer indices," but it gives me the indices from the true values in a boolean list, which is the inverse of what I want...For example, from:I want to obtain:The values are all 0 indexed, as expected with Python. I'm guessing that my question is a duplicate, but it's so annoying to not be able to find what I'm looking for every time I try to remember how to do this operation, I decided to ask a new question so my Google search will hopefully bring up this post next time.
You can use a list comprehension. I recommend you turn t into a set for O(1) lookup:
Use a list comprehension with conditions:Shorter:
How about this:
You could also try using map():It might also be worth converting t to a set, since lookup is O(1) instead of O(N). You could also use __contains__():
