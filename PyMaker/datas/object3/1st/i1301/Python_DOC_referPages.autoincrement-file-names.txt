This issue comes from [here]. I tried asking about this is the link provided but I was downvoted and told to ask my own question...so here I am.I tried replicating the results for my own project and it didn't work.  when I try to save more than two files the script starts renaming each file instead of just the new ones I create:instead ofAny suggestions?Thank you in advance for you help!
The reason you get this behavior is that os.walk recurses into subdirs. Your target dir IS a subdir of your sourcedir - so you rename files from source to target and later os.walk into the target directory and rename some more into itself using the "renaming" strategy all the time because the file already exists.Lenghty solution - most of it is creating file structures so this is a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example you can use. See the documentation of topdown=False in os.walkCreate file structureOutput:Fixed methodUsage: Output afterwards:You see some files in new got the _1 infix in it's name due to a same-named file was already in it.
