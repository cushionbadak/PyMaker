I have known the use of setter and getter for several properties, how could I trigger a same function when any property changes?For example, the following codes add a setter to property a. If the class has a lot of properties like a, b, ... , z, and I want to print something like property xxx is modified when any property changes.It is stupid to add the similar getter and setter one by one.I have read some related questions and answers, but I do not find the solution for many properties.How to trigger function on value change?Using @property versus getters and setters
Metaprogramming, using __setattr__ to intercept modification:You can do similarly with __getattr__ for reading access.
You can use descriptors. Descriptors are, in layman's terms, reusable properties. The advantage over the __getattr__ and __setattr__ hooks is that you have more fine-grained control over what attributes are managed by descriptors.Demo:
