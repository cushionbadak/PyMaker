Scenario: I am trying to pass all days of a month to a list, in which I could iterate and use functions on the days, such as weekday().Issue: So far, I was able to use Calendar to pass dates or days into a list. In both cases, when I try to read the dates and output only the wanted weekday, I get the error:What I did so far (with the help from other posts here on SO):This here works fine, but I need it to be more dynamicSo I tried:and All of these work fine, but when I try to iterate, like:orI get the previously mentioned error.Question: Any Idea on how to do this properly / more efficiently?Final objective: Is to create a function that takes as input month, year, week and weekday, and returns me a datetime object.
Probably something like thisor if you want to use monthdatescalendar, in which case you will gate list of list, i.e. list ot weeks and each week is also a listNote that it will expose full weeks, e.g. in this case it will start with 31 Dec 2018.
The problem is that monthdatescalendar returns a nested list:So, if you want to keep the same structure, in order to retrieve only second days of the week, you could do the following:Another option is to use itermonthdates but the list will be flat:Also, note that you can specify the first day of the calendar when creating a Calendar object. Then to obtain the first days of the week, you just have to take the first elements of the lists:P.S.:As a side note, I think it's better to compare days explicitly like this:instead ofBecause Explicit is better than implicit.
