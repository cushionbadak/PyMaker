Is there a one-line way to find the index of a string with a specific substring in a list?I have a list like ['abc1', 'abc2', 'abc3', 'abc4'] and I wanna know what is the index where I have the substring 4. 
Does this help?
You can use enumerate for that, i.e.:Python Demo
Since, there is only one item containing '4' (like you say), go for a generator:Additionally a None to handle case when there is no string with '4'.
