I'm trying to create a frozen dataclass but I'm having issues with setting a value from __post_init__. Is there a way to set a field value based on values from an init param in a dataclass when using the frozen=True setting? and this is the trace 
Use the same thing the generated __init__ method does: object.__setattr__.
According to PyDocs, you can't create truly immutable objects."...dataclasses will add setattr() and delattr() methods to the class. These methods will raise a FrozenInstanceError when invoked." To answer your question, you cannot set values after creation using a frozen dataclass.Frozen is designed to create a read only object. Not sure why you are trying to as you didn't specify a use-case.Below is something that you can do, that I believe accomplishes what you are looking to do.Result: 10
