I am trying to get a reference number inside a string which is in most cases precedented by "Ref." or something similar.e.g.: Explorer II Ref.16570 Boxregex with further examplesThe problem is that there are many different variations1 as this is user generated content. How could I retrieve the number with python which is precented by e.g. Ref.? The number/string is not always the same pattern e.g. numbers. .They might be mixed with characters and dots and slashes but for a human eye there is almost always such a number in each line identifiable.E.g.:A small amount of false positives would not be a problem.
Not totally sure if you need to match or extract, but Ref\.?([ \d.]+) will extract any digits after Ref (case insensitive), i.e.:Regex DemoPython DemoRegex Explanation

Try the following code. It collects all the data after Ref till one of pre-defined stoppers. Stoppers are used because the question does not contain clear definition of what data is reference (not always the same pattern, might be mixed with, for a human eye there is almost always). I guess additional processing of matches is needed to extract actual references more accurately.Output starts with the lines:
