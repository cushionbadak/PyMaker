You can use zip,a good tutorial about zip in here. In case one of the lists is longer then the other, you can use zip_longest (documented here):

You can simply do following:
EDIT: izip is needed for python2 only. In Python 3 the built-in zip does the same job as itertools.izip in 2.x (returns an iterator instead of a list  Using zipNote that zip return list type:It means zip computes all the list at once, which is not memory efficient when your l1, l2 is large. For saving memory, using izip: izip computes the elements only when requested.
You can do it by using zip function.The zip() function take iterables (can be zero or more), makes iterator that aggregates elements based on the iterables passed, and returns an iterator of tuples. Code :Output :
