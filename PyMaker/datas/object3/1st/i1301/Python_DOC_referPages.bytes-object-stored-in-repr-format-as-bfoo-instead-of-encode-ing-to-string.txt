Natural Text
Some hapless coworker saved some data into a file like this:when they should have usedNow foo.txt looks likeInstead ofI already read this file as a string:Now how can I convert bad_foo from the incorrectly-saved format to the correctly-saved string?
You can try literal eval
If you trust that the input is not malicious, you can use ast.literal_eval on the broken string.Otherwise you will have to manually parse and remove or replace the offending repr'ed escapes.
This code is working correct in my computer. But if you still get error, this may help you
