I am making a bot for a game. So far I have built the basics I need for my game. Now I want to get it a little bit further and make a mechanism that will randomly move the mouse within a range on my screen and click that position. How I am thinking it, I will set the top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left cords and pointer will mouse within that range and when it gets to the position it will do a click and after some time it will move to another random position. Any suggestion how I should start?
You could use pymouse to get screen resolution and control your mouse, and randint() to choose random coordinates to click at
