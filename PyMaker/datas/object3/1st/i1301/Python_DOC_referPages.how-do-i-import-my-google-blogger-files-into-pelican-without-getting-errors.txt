I can't import my Blogger files in the feed.atom file format into Pelican without some kind of Python error. I installed BeautifulSoup4, lxml, feedparser, and pandoc but I keep getting other errors appear such as the one below:I run a RedHat derivative if that helps any. I'm also not sure if I'm supposed to be using the --feed or --blogger parameter when making the call to parse my feed.atom Blogger file.
This seems like a bug in pelican-import. feedparser's date/time parser returns the result of datetime.utctimetuple() which is time.struct_time instance while pelican-import expects an object with .strftime() method.Report the bug to the Pelican tracker.
