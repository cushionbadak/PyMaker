I'm having a hard time understanding how imports work in Python 3.x. Suppose I have a project structure like thisMy understanding is that foo and bar can be treated as packages and the .py files as modules.I want to import foo1 and bar1 in foo2(which is the main script). How can that be done in both absolute and relative ways?If I want to execute foo2 after this, is this a bad project structure (maybe foo2 should be placed elsewhere, but I do not want to place it at the root)?
Try this:If you want more information on importlib, check https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib
