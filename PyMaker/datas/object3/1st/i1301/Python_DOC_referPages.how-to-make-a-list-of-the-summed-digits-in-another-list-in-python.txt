This question already has an answer here:Count the number occurrences of a character in a string                    18 answers                Is there a way to easily convert numbers in a list into single digits for exampleI'm very new to Python so I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly
One possible way is iterate over the population list and use str.count('character') to count the '1''s in each "number" string:evaluation will contain the desired counts:
If you are only dealing with zeros and ones, then @davedwards is a good solution.  Count the instances of '1' in each string.If you need the solution to be more extensible to values other than 0 and 1, you can convert each digit to an int and sum the integers.
Using collections.Counter():A functional aproach would be to also use map() and operator.itemgetter():
