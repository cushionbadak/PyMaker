How can I sort by name and age in PYTHON?I have the following list in .txt file:I want to sort this by name and by age. I wrote this code but it doesn't work:Thank you very much guys :)
Here's one approach:Using:a context manager to handle automatic file closure (this is the with)the for line in f iterator to loop over the file's lines one at a timea list comprehension to split the lines into lists as neededint instead of evalchanging all line.name references to line[0] -- you could make the lines proper classes (or namedtuples if you wanted the .name access.Though, in general, solutions for parsing csv files exist (e.g. csv -- there were a few more issues in your code than just that.
