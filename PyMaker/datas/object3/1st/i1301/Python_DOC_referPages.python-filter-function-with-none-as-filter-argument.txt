Natural Text
As of my understanding None means "no value" in python. but in the above case how the filter function is removing the empty string.I am confused with None in python. Can any one explain what exactly None represents in the above command and how come it is matching with non-empty strings.
The documentation makes application clear:If function is None, the identity function is assumed, that is, all  elements of iterable that are false are removed.So filter(None, it) removes all Falsy values such as [], {}, 0, False, set(), '', None, etc.
