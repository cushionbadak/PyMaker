Thank you for your help and patience.I am new to python and am attempting to calculate the number of times a particular atomic symbol appears divided by the total number of atoms. So that the function accepts a list of strings as argument and returns a list containing the fraction of 'C', 'H', 'O' and 'N'. But I keep on getting one result instead of getting all for each of my atoms. My attempt is below:ThenHowever I only get one result which is 0.07692307692307693. I was supposed to get a list starting with [0.23076923076923078,..etc], but I don't know how to. I was supposed to calculate the fraction of 'C', 'H', 'O' and 'N' atomic symbols in the molecule using a for loop and a return statement. :( Please help, it will be appreciated.
Well you return the variable total at your first loop. Why don't you use a list to store your values? Like this:
@ganderson comment explains the problem. as to alternative implementation here is one using collections.Counter
It would be better to return a dictionary so you know which element the fraction corresponds to:You can, then, even lookup the fraction for a particular element like:However, if you must use a for loop and a return statement, then answer from @not_a_bot_no_really_82353 would be the right one.
A simple one liner should doOr better create a dictionary using comprehensionOutputIf you still want to use the for loop. I would suggest to go for map which would be a lot cleaner
