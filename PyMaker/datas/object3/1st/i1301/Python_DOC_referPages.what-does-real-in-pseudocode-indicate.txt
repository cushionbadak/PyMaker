I'm trying to translate this pseudocode and can't do it accurately. In particular, I can't seem to figure out what real here means. This is the pseudocode:And this is what I've come up with:
Some languages use the term "real" in place of "float" etc.  Therefore, in Python, with this bit of code you can leave it out. ..but there are a few things wrong with your code other than that. For example you just wantthen just give average "scores" and 6Like thisWhilst clearly it is not necessary to do this in this way, I presume you are just learning Python...
