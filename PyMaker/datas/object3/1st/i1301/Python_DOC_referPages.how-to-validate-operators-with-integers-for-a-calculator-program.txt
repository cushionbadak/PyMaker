I'm trying to create a program that allows the user to input one of 4 operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and then two numbers. The program then calculates the operation. I can't seem to validate the operators for the output, though. I'm trying with an if ... else statement now, but no luck. Any pointers here?
You should check if user entered valid operation, try except wont work here since input() won't throw any errors. Also here's more elegant way to get 2 valid integers from user, and calculate final equation (using eval())Output:
You should use the builtin operator module of python. Then you can use a dict like this:This way you don't need to implement simple operator functionality yourself.
The easiest and cleanest way to do so, is to use the operator module in Python, so your userOutput method would become as follows. A few changes you should do on your code, though, would be to rename hour operator variable to op, as it would conflict with python module name, and update the operator as a return from the userInput():
