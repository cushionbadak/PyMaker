I have 2 sheets with some data (18k rows each) and need to check if value from source.xlsx exists in a target.xlsx file. The rows in the source file should be unique. If the cell from source file exists in the target file (in specific column) then in next column in target file need to fill value from some column which is in the source file. It is quite tricky so example would look like:target.xlsxsource.xlstarget_values - contains the values from col 1 in target sheetThe above code works, but is very heavy and I think there is some better way do it. The files contain more than 18k rows so it would take ages to compare data. The tricky part is that I need to know in which row in the target file my cell from source file is to fill column with corresponding value. I am using openpyxl but if it is easier I could use pandas.Thx
Question: check if value from source.xlsx exists in a target.xlsx file.Implement it like the following example:Documentation: OpenPyXl - accessing-many-cellsPython - Mapping Types â€” dict, Python - object.__init__Output:Tested with Python: 3.5
From my understanding of your question it seems like the rows in target file are not arranged in the same specific order as the source file.
