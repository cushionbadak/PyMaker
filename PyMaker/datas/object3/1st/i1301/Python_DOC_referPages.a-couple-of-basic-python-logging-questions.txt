I'm working through Logging HOWTO, logging docs, and tomordonez/logging tutorial to get a handle on the logging system. When I add logging to a Class, the logging info doesn't show up for MyClass.__init__() but it does show up for MyClass.obj_name(). Why is that? How do I include the Class name with the funcName info in the logging output? The docs and other SO questions I read looked like I might need to write a custom formatter? Or something like that? Are there any non docs.python.org sites with detailed walk-throughs, something in between basics and advanced? Thank you!Complete output:
Not sure if this will help:2018-12-08 22:43:40,503 DEBUG: hello init2018-12-08 22:43:40,503 DEBUG: created instance of class 'main.MyClass'2018-12-08 22:43:40,503 DEBUG: hello my_function2018-12-08 22:43:40,503 DEBUG: here is a function my_function of MyClass
