I have the following URL:When I use the Flask method:q = request.args.get("q") it simply returns me the string "New Haven CT", essentially converting both %20 & + to a blank space   I want to read the arguments "New Haven" & "CT" from my URL separately as two items in a list. how do I do it?
If you really want to separate arguments with +. You can parse the URL by yourself.(Warning: it's not as safe as urllib.parse.parse_qs.)urllib.parse.unquote function doesn't parse + to space, urllib.parse.unquote_plus does. See the docs.An example:And there's a simple way, if you can make the url like q=New%20Haven&q=CT, Flask can parse q to multi values.Or parse it by yourself using urllib.parse.parse_qs.
