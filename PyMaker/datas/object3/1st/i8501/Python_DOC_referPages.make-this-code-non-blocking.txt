I'm using the VSphere API, here are the lines that I'm dealing with:The problem here is that this blocks the execution completely whilst the task is not finished. I would like the logging part to be ran "in parallel", so I can start other tasks.I thought about creating a function that would accept a task as parameter, and poll the info.state attribute just like now, but how do I make this non blocking ? EDIT: I'm using Python 2.7
You could use asyncio and create an event loop. You can use asyncio.async() to create an asynchronous task that won't block the event loop execution.
Here is an example of using the threading module: If you create a logger, you can configure it to print the thread name.
