I tried to write this script that just prints number after each other on the same line with a one second delay, but it does not work.Ex this works:But this does not, the program just freezes:Can anyone explain why this is?
The program does not freeze, you just need to flush the stream by passing flush=True:sys.stdout, the stream that print uses by default, is line-buffered (when in interactive mode), as stated in the documentation:When interactive, standard streams are line-bufferedThis means that when the default string used for end (\n) is encountered, a call to flush will be made. Using other strings (i.e '') don't trigger flushing so you'll have to force it by using flush=True.
