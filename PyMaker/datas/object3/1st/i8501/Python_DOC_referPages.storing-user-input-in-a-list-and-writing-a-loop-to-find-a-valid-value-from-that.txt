New to coding...i am a student and have been tasked with writing a code that asks the user to input a series of values that will i will store in a list and then to ask to input a value (continue this until user types done) and then to check to determine if it is found in the list of valid values. I'm assuming this could be done with a while true loop to accomplish the input until 'done' is typed and i'm assuming a search using 'if' and 'in' would accomplish the second part. I am struggling finding a while true using the list of input. i am using an integer input. what am i comparing the condition to if to continue the loop? Any help is appreciated! The code below is what i wrote i test if i could store input in a list but the while true is where i'm struggling with what to compare. 
Here's some code that does what you described in the comments.We use two while loops. The first one gets lines of input, one by one, and adds them to the list_of_inputs. If a line consisting of the string "done" is read we break out of the loop, and we don't add "done" to the list.The second loop gets lines of input and tests whether or not they are present in list_of_inputs, printing an appropriate message. If the user inputs a line that is present in list_of_inputs we break out of the loop and the program ends.test run
Python 3.xMake sure indentation is proper in python codes.
