I'm reading an .avi file and extracting "hex" from itI need to be able to operate on it before putting it back in the filebut I'm struggling with the conversions, is there any way I could do this ?ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '\xc0\x1d\x00\x00'edit : more detailsI heard .avi files have frame indexes that start at "idx1", the 4 bytes following ("\xc0\x1d\x00\x00") describe the length of that said index.Since I'm duplicating frames I need to fix the size of the index to make the file readable again.
assuming your using python 2.7 ?Then you could compress to a 32 int or just add 4 to the LSB ? if you want to only use built-ins ( should be easier with 3.x )
