I have a to generate all possible combinations of a tuple of tuplesThe bases = ["U", "C", "A", "G"] and the positions = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].Requirementsno repeatsthe bases can be the same but the positions must bedifferentthe order must be kept.For example:( (A,1), (B,2) ) == ( (B,2) , (A,1) ) and( (A,1), (B,1) ) should be discarded.Sample output:[ ( (U,0) , (U,1) ), ( (U,0) , (U,2) ), ( (U,0) , (U,3) ) ...]Should have a length of 448Example:For a string length 2:would be all the combinations... I thinkI have this so far
It sounds like you want the Cartesian product of (every possible 2-base word)  X (every 2-combination drawn from range(8)).You can get this in general bywhich gives us
