So, I have this listand, I want to join them in a way such as:I tried lots of methods but nothing seemed to work. Any suggestions?
You can use itertools.groupby and a list comprehension. Group into ''s and non '' and join items from the latter using str.join. The ternary operator in the rear of the comprehension uses the group key to decide what to do for each group:
Here's another version using good old while loops to edit the list in place:
Here's another groupby approach. It doesn't use a list comp, but I think that makes it a little more readable. ;) And unlike the other (current)  answers it uses a single loop rather than nested loops (apart from the loop that .join uses internally).We use bool as the key function, so the groups are either true-ish or false-ish. A false-ish group is a group of empty strings, so we extend the output list new with the group. A true-ish group contains only non-empty strings, so we join it, and append the result to new.output
Without using lambda functions with list comprehension  you could do it the old fashion way by just iterating through the lists.^^ The solution above is not correct, and would only fit this case.Here is another generic approach using a stack approach 
Use itertools.chain and itertools.groupby() with bool as the key-function:
