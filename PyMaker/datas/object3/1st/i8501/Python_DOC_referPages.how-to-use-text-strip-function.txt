I can strip numerics but not alpha characters:Why the following is not working?
The reason is simple and stated in the documentation of strip:'abcd' is neither leading nor trailing in the string '132abcd13232111' so it isn't stripped.
Just to add a few examples to Jim's answer, according to .strip() docs:Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.So it doesn't matter if it's a digit or not, the main reason your second code didn't worked as you expected, is because the term "abcd" was located in the middle of the string.Example1:Output: Example2:Output:
