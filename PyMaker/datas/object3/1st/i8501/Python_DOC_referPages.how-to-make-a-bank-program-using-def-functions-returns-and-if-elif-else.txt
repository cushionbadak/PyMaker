This is the program I wrote, but I can't make a bank program that uses def functions like def withdrawl ( current_amount,  withdrawl_amount ). and uses if,  elif, and else for the option list. Please help.
You are using elif and else already. It looks like you do understand, mathematically, how to process the withdrawal, as well.The Python 3 docs explain the syntax of how to declare and call a functionin the section 4.6. Defining Functions.
