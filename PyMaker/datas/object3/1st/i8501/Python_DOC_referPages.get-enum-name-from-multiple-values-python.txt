I'm trying to get the name of a enum given one of its multiple values:when I try to get one value giving the name it works:but when I try to get the name out of a given value only errors will come:raise ValueError("%s is not a valid %s" % (value, cls.name))ValueError: 8 is not a valid DataTypeValueError: f is not a valid DataTypeIs there a way to make this? or am I using the wrong data structure?
The easiest way is to use the aenum library1, which would look like this:and in use:As you can see, the first value listed is the canonical value, and shows up in the repr().If you want all the possible values to show up, or need to use the stdlib Enum (Python 3.4+), then the answer found here is the basis of what you want (and will also work with aenum):and in use:1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
