I am a total novice with Raspberry Pi, I'm importing and combining a couple of programs together, working with Python 3 and VIM.  One of the programs has a code line that reads:How do I import GLOB for Windows 10 so I can work on my laptop?  I'm sure I will have a few hundred more questions but this is where I think I have to start.Thanks Gaggle,Barry 
glob is part of the Python Standard Library, it thus comes pre-installed with Python, whether you run Python on Windows, macOS, Linux, or whatever..
