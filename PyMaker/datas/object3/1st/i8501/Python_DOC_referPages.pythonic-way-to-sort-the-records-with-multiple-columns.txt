Let's say we have a lot of records in a file in the following fashion.10.10.10.10(tcp/443) : Some SSL Vulnerability : Medium : Patched10.10.10.11(tcp/888) : Some RCE Vulnerability : High : Not PatchedThese records have the 3rd column with values Critical, High, Medium, Low. What's the best possible pythonic way to sort these records in this manner :1. Critical, 2.High, 3.Medium 4. Low ?
Here's a pure Python solution, using a dictionary to convert the Critical, High, Medium, Low strings to their numeric values; that numeric value is used as the sorting key function argument to list.sort. My key function also uses the first field of each record as a secondary sorting key so that in each of the sections sorted by grade the entries are also sorted by that first field.Since your question only includes 2 lines of sample data I've constructed some simple fake data.output
Example using IntEnum for a list of dictionary.
If you can transform your table into a pandas data frame (for example, using pandas.read_csv), then this will do the job:Then at the beginning df wasand in the end df isIn the code above, the line that specified the order was
