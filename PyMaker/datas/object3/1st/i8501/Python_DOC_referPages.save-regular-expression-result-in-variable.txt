Natural Text
I would like to split a string into separated, single strings and save each in a new variable. That's the use case:Direct user input with BC1 = input("BC1: ") in the following format: '17899792270101010000000000', '17899792270102010000000000', '17899792270103010000000000'Now I want each number - and just the number in a single variable:How to realise that in python 3?Sadly I'm not able to create a suitable regular expression for it and neither a way to save string parts in separate variables. I hope someone of you could help me. Thanks already in advance!
Look into reedit: If you want int not str, you can map(int, matches)
If I understand you correctly, this should do the trickAnd now your desired numbers areThe split function creates an array of your numbers, but includes the spaces and the quotes.["'17899792270101010000000000'", " '17899792270102010000000000'", " '17899792270103010000000000'"]The strip function gets rid of the spaces and the quotes['17899792270101010000000000', '17899792270102010000000000', '17899792270103010000000000']The int function parses the strings into an integer (number)[17899792270101010000000000, 17899792270102010000000000, 17899792270103010000000000]However, this requires the user to follow the format you specified. Foryah's answer is more robust to different input formats.
if it's already "format" at the input :
