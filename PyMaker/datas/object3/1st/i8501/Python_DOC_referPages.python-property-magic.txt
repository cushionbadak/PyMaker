When is the inner() function actually getting called in this simple code snippet?I have read about python properties, but I am unsure what magic is it doing here.When I remove "@property", I get an expected error:
__repr__ is supposed to give a human-readable representation of the object...Return a string containing a printable representation of an object.For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval(), otherwise the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object. A class can control what this function returns for its instances by defining a __repr__() method.You are returning a function.Try:It's also worth reading up on the @property decorator, and decorators in general... See this answer.To answer youy "When is the inner() function actually getting called?", see below. It's getting called when repr() calls Magic.__repr__() on your behalf.
