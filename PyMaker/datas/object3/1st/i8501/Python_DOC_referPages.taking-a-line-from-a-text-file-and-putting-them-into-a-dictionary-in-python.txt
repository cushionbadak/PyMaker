I have a line in the following format:I want to split this line in python such that for each line in a file, there is a name, age and university. In the above example, '32' is the age, 'Liam' is the name and 'University...' is the University name. What could be the best way to do this?
Regular Expressions! They're a little confusing to get your head around to start with, but they're awesome. Too much to explain in full here, but a brief demo on your specific example:Very brief breakdown of the regular expression:Anything within round brackets is a 'group' - i.e. the bits you're interested in.Anything in square brackets denotes a character set - which means 'match any of these characters', and the hyphen in A-Z means 'anything upper case between A and Z'.The '+' after square brackets means that it's looking for 1 or more of the characters in the set, and only stops when it finds a character not in the set.'.*' means match anything, but you'll notice that none of the .*'s I've used are in the groups - they're just used to skip irrelevant stuff between the groups.Hoppe that helps!
Use csv.reader, set empty space as delimiter and put in " for your quote character. This is fairly simple, just experiment and test a bit.
