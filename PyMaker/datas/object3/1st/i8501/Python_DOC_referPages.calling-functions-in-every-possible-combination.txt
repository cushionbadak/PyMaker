I have a list of functions. I want to call each possible combination of these functions, where each function is either called once or not at all. It doesn't matter that order they are in.Example:I would like to call function1() on its own and also function1() + function2() and also function1() + function2() + function3() and also function2() etcHow would I implement this in python? I thought to use itertools.combinations however it doesn't seem I can use that for my problem.
You can use powerset function from the the itertools recipe page:It produces the following output:
itertools works fine.  But you need to go through the number that you want to use...between 1 and the number in your set. not sure if you need 0 as your degenerate case.  The following works. It could be compressed but as-is it's pretty readable. Look up "python function pointer".
