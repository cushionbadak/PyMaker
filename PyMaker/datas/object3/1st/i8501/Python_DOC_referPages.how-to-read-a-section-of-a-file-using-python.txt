I am currently trying to create a python program that prints out specific sections of a file. I tried using file.read() and file.readline() but I can't seem to get an exact position, just either full lines or bits. Is there a better function to be using or an import I can use?The problem I am running into is my files output readsI want to take the values and put them into a variable. I would like to create an if statement that takes those three values and adds them to different variables however I don't know of a function that does that. Should I be trying to parse the file first?My code to provide the output isI would like to have an if statement along the lines of I am trying to solve for d but I can't find a way to use the output of the file in order to input for d.
I think what you are looking for is something like regular expressions. However you can in principle do something like split:hope that helps you.
