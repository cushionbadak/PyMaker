I cannot get my while loop inf the getClasses function to end when it is supposed to. Both getNum and counter are set as integers. I have also tried to do while True and an if statement to see if that would help, yet that just gives me an infinite loop. I know that this is a simple problem, yet I cannot figure out what it is that I am doing wrong. Please help.
line 4, You mean this ?
Name the exception after the except clause. In this case a ValueError. If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of  the clause is skipped. Then if its type matches the exception named  after the except keyword, the except clause is executed, and then  execution continues after the try statement.source https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
