I want to understand how Python bitshift operators >> and << are used for defining operator relationships in Airflow. I am not able to figure out the logic that can be used for translating the functionality of set_upstream() and set_downstream() methods using the bitshift operators. It will be helpful if someone can also point me to the relevant module in the Airflow code repo.
>> and << are translated to the __lshift__/__rlshift__ and __rshift__/__rrshift__ methods of the relevant object.
It will be helpful if someone can also point me to the relevant module in the Airflow code repo.The relevant module where it is defined is models.py, by the way. And the line of relevance is where the __rshift__, __lshift__, __rrshift__ and __rlshift__ operators are defined, which are the methods that >> and << translate to.
