To dodynamically, I can do the followingBut what should I do to do the following dynamicallyProblem Context:I need to import a different version (0.10) of a module('pika' in my case), installed in a separate directory instead of default version(0.9). As we can see regular imports are working fine. However when importing dynamically, importing relative to the location is causing issues. As per importlib.import_module documentaion , following should work but it doesn't.And when trying to import 'pika' from a relative path, which should fail as there is no module pika under the relative path, it is still importing it from default module. What is it that I am missing ? I mainly want to do the following dynamically.
To dodynamically, I can do the followingNo, you do the following:Similarly, to replicate import itertools as iters, you doimportlib.import_module doesn't care what you call the module. as is not and cannot be part of importlib.import_module's functionality. It just gives you the module object; what you call that object is up to you.As for your context, you've misunderstood what a relative import is. The second argument to importlib.import_module has nothing to do with from imports, and importlib.import_module('thing', 'whatever') is not supposed to be equivalent to from whatever import thing.If you want to dothat's pika = importlib.import_module('scale.lib.hypervisor.esx65.pika_3_5'). The second argument doesn't enter the picture. You seem to think this is somehow not dynamic, but it's as dynamic as any other importlib call.
