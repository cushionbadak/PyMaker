Is there a nice simple method for extending a list n times, and doing so incrementally based on the existing values?Basically I'm extrapolating a gradient, but don't want to invoke numpy/scipy if I can really avoid it.I have some lists, lets say:Where I have already got a value for the average of the pairwise differences (the 'average gradient' of the list). I would now like to extend each list (let's say 20 times, to a total length of 25 each), where each subsequent value added is the previous value plus the computed average difference (if this was negative, obviously it would decrease).So, x[5] would evaluate to x[4] + gradient.Thus, the x list would ultimately end up:Because the average difference in the original x = 1 (obviously this is just test data, in actuality I want to do this with more complicated floats in the y list.
Yes you can.
You could use list.extend() and a list comprehension:For integer values you can also pass a range directly to list.extend():
