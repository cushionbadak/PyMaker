I'm trying to write a small function for my programm (python) which writes some data into a csv file. The input data is from an other file. Both files are opened!The code for actual read- and writeprocess is:This code works fine so far, but sometimes my input data doesn't have left 4 bytes at the end for the last readprocess, so it gives me the error "struct.error: unpack requires a string argument of length 4".This is totally fine for me, i don't mind some dataloss at the end but this error stops my whole programm. Is there a way to stop the function and return to the main programm if this error occours? Or just stop the while loop und go on with the "else:" part?
This should do it:This way you'll know when there is a problem, but program execution will continue.Do read up on Python error handling for the full story.
