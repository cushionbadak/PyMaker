I made a python script in which it runs a specified terminal command.As the terminal command I am trying to use does not accepts a list in the -s argument, which is the reason that I make it into a python script.While running the script, it works but I notice that it will prompts me with the following question:Are you sure you want to continue (y/n)?This means I will need to punch in the y on my keyboard, 3 times in the above example.But in the event if my list is huge, and should I not be on my desk, is there any way that I can script to make it accept 'y' as my answer, without me to press anything on the keyboard?
You'd need to use a pipe, that way you can actually write to that pipe an answer, don't forget to close the pipe once you're done with it.popen documentation
Use the pexpect module.  It's basically expect used in shell scripts, for Python.
