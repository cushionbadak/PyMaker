I have written a small python script to automate the process of adding jobs to crontab but the job added via the script is not working and same job  when given manually working fineHERE IS THE CODE:
PermissionsMake sure the user you're running your python script as root.  I did some quick testing and other users can't access their /var/spool/cron/crontabs/$username files.  This is by design if I can remember correctly.  You're supposed to use the crontab -e command to edit your crontab.sudo python editcron.pyReally, the Python you've written isn't exactly wrong.  It opens the file, adds the string, then closes it.  Nothing ground-breaking here.  I just added some file system checks in to make sure you can get to that file.Code
NOTES from man cron:         cron searches its spool area (/var/spool/cron/crontabs) for crontab files (which are named after  accounts  in         /etc/passwd);  crontabs  found  are  loaded  into  memory.  Note that crontabs in this directory should not be         accessed directly - the crontab command should be used to access and update them.  Question: ... same job when given manually working fine  I assume you use crontab <filename> here!  Search for a python module or use module subprocess.run(...) to start crontab <filename> from within your .py.  using-the-subprocess-module Come back and Flag your Question as answered if this is working for you or comment why not.
