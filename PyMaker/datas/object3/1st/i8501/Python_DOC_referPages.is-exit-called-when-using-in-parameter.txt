In this single line code, When call a method as parameter, but not release resource, __exit__ is called when method is finished ?It can be issued about 'improper resource release' ?
The __exit__ won't be called, __exit__ is triggered at the end of with-statement.In CPython __del__ will get triggered eventually as there are no reference to this file object anymore and it will close the file.But it's recommended to use with-statement to make sure the close() call is explicit not implicit and in this way you're not relying on implementation details.
You can find a comprehensive explanations regard this in python data models documentation:Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a close() method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such objects. The try...finally statement and the with statement provide convenient ways to do this.That said your opened object will not be closed since you're not calling the close attribute of the opened object. If you don't call the close explicitly you should wrap your code within a with statement:By doing the context manager will call __exit__ method automatically at the end of the block which it will call the close method of your file object consequently.
