Write a class named Employee that holds the following data about an employee in attributes: name, ID number, department, and job title.Once you have written the class, write a program that creates three Employee objects to hold the following data:Susan Meyers - 47899 - Accounting - Vice PresidentMark Jones - 39119 - IT - ProgrammerJoy Rogers - 81774 - Manufacturing - Engineer^ This is the problem I'm stuck on. I believe I have the first part of the code correct, but I don't understand what to do for the second part of the program to create Employee objects.Here is my code so far...emp.py fileand here is my main function where the second part is going to go...So with this code, I am now getting the correct answer of this:
Take a look at thisYou have inpored you python file emp.py that has the class 'Employee' with import emp statement.Now ,Will create the object and stores its pointer to emp1. 
Import emp.pyGo ahead and create 3 Employee objects:
The emp.py file could be:A couple of notes: id is a built-in function that returns the “identity” of an object.  It is best not use that as an attribute, it might confuse other programmers.The attributes should not have double underscores, aka dunders. In Python, there is no need for setters and getters.Add a str method for well-formatted printingThen the second would be:Instance attributes can be set when constructing. This saves many lines of code.
