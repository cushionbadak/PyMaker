I have 30,000 files in a folder. start from 0 to 30000. I want to read from start to end with 10 interval when end number is higher than 5000. I have created following code, This code read my file 0 to 5000. But i need it to read at an interval of 10 when endfile is larger than 5000. So there must be 2 conditions, one for endfile less or equal to 5000 it will read 0 to 5000 and one for endfile higher than 5000 where the program will read with an interval of 10. Any idea how to write it in python?
You can find the number of files in a directory by using os.listdir;Once you do that, you can choose your stepsize and process every 10th file by giving step argument to range;For reference range (start, stop, step) arguments. Step is the index increment size, it will pick the n'th next element if you set it as n.
