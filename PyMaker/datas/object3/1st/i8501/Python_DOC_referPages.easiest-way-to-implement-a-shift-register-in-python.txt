I want to implement a data structure similar to a shift register, basically a shift register should have a fixed length (L) and should have a function to mange the input to this register (New_Input), the new input will be in the first cell of the shift register and the previous element will be shifted one cell forward. When the register is full and a new element is added it will shift all the element such that the element in the last cell will be thrown (out of our concern). My idea to implement such things is by using a dictionary that contain those element such that the keys are the order of this dictionary. Can any one help me?
Python already contains this data structure as collections.deque:
