Natural Text
I'm trying to make a function that will take an argument that's a word (or set of characters) as well as the speech, and return a boolean expression saying whether the word is there or not, as a function.I want to make it so that the word that the program searches for in the text matches exactly as the input and that are not a part of another word ("America" in "American"). I thought of using the len() function but it doesn't seem to work and I am stuck. If anyone helps me figure this out that would be very helpful. Thank you in advance
You can use mmap also, for more information about the mmapmmap in python 3 is treated differently that in python 2.7Below code is for 2.7, what it does looking for a string in the text file.Why mmap doesnt work with large files.
One option may be to use the the findall() method in the regex module, which can be used to find all occurrences of a specific string.   Optionally, you could include list.count() to check how many times the searched string occurs in the text:output:
