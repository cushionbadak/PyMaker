Natural Text
When I try and print n in the main program, it doesn't return anything. Can someone give me advice on what I'm doing wrong. I'm a bit confused on how reading txt files works..Main program
You need to reset the line variable to the next line of the file:I would instead iterate over lines of the filelike object like this:This works because Python's open() function returns an iterable object (io.TextIOBase) that allows you to navigate the contents of the file in a for loop. Each item returned by the iterable is the next line of the file. You can just check the char that you're looking to find in the line variable.
