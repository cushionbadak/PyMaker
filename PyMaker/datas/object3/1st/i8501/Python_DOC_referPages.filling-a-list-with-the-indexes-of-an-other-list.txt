You are trying to find the index of a generator expression which is supposedly in your list. Besides, using list.index repeatedly is not very performant since you'll be running the entire length of the list (worst case) every time.You can instead use a list comprehension with enumerate:Using a set for the lookup of shared items ensures 0(1) lookup time as opposed to O(n) for lists.
