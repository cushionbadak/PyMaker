This question already has an answer here:Calling a function of a module by using its name (a string)                    11 answers                How to construct and call a function from a string?For example, consider three different functions and a list of strings, I want to be able to use the items in list of strings to construct and call the appropriate function
The problematic code isIn the first loop item, will have the value 'function1'. You are calling this string as if it were a function. But strings are not callable and have no code assigned to them!Then, you go on with the for loop before doing anything.Simply refer to item, like this:
The most explicit way would be to have a dictionary of those functions:That way you can also name your functions whatever you want, decouple from item names, make them methods, move to other modules etc without breaking the general design. The other way is globals, as already answered.
First of all, usually you won't need this. Instead of putting strings in a list, you can also put functions themselves in a list like this:However, if you insist, you can do it like this:locals() gives you a dictionary of locally defined objects by name.
