Python 3. Probably need to use urllib to do this,I need to know how to send a request to a direct download link, and get the name of the file it attempts to save.(As an example, a KSP mod from CurseForge: https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/mechjeb/files/2355387/download)Of course, the file ID (2355387) will be changed. It could be from any project, but always on CurseForge. (If that makes a difference on the way it's downloaded.)That example link results in the file:How can I return that file name in Python?Edit: I should note that I want to avoid saving the file, reading the name, then deleting it if possible. That seems like the worst way to do this.
Using urllib.request, when you request a response from a url, the response contains a reference to the url you are downloading.You can use os.path.basename to get the filename:
