Natural Text
I'm trying to record how many times the letter Y appears in the 6th column of a .txt file and assign that to a variable. How would I go about doing that? Thx in advance!.txt file:I've set the whole file to a variable and have created variables for each column in the file.
You should try using the csv module:
Use csv and sum:Your data is comma separated, and Python has the csv module for working with delimited values (could be semicolon separated, etc, as well).The reader is iterable and yields a row at a time.I've used the sum function which takes an iterable but I've used a generator expression to yield True or False for each row in the file.The expression row[5] == 'Y' evaluates either True or False. When you give a boolean value to sum it converts to an integer and True becomes 1, False becomes 0. We could have written it as:This however is slightly different. It filters out only the rows which have Y in the 6th column and yields the value 1 for each of those rows. It's subtly different.
THIS should work as expected: This gives for the text provided above: and works even in case of malformed lines in the input text file.
