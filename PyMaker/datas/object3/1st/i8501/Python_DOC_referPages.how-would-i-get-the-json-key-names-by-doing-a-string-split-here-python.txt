I have a json var:       [u'{"Average_Rating":3.75,"Number_Of_Users_Who_Have_Watched_This_Movie":90,"title":"Quiz Show (1994)"}']And I want to get the '3.75', '90' and 'Quiz Show (1994)'. I've tried doing: but it's not working. I'm sure this is something simple but just don't get how to use it properly! Could anyone please help?EDIT:Normally, I would just use the json library but I'm using Apache PySpark and there are a few issues around JSON - how can I do it using just string splitting?
You are trying to get information from a JSON string, you should really use json for this.Per request of the original poster:
