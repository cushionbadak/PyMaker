I am logging into a remote node using SSH, getting the status of a service and want to print it.Running the bash command on my remote node yields.The python code that Ive written is The output that I am getting from result variable is:Why do all these extra characters appear ? And how can I get rid of them ? 
The entire process of calling subprocess.Popen and then manually reading from its stdout property can be condensed into one call which will also automatically performs the bytes to string conversion:If you also want to read stderr, then include a stderr=subprocess.STDOUT.You can find the docs for subprocess.check_output  here.
When you use .readlines(), it will return a list of lines. You can use .read() if you want it all in one string. It has the b there because it is a byte string. To get it to a normal string, you can use .decode('utf-8') in most cases. It may be a different encoding, but utf-8 will probably work. Then to get rid of the new line, you can use .strip(). Putting it all together, either of these would work:orEither one will work when you have only one line. If you have more than one line, the first will not work properly; it will have \r\n in the middle of the string.
