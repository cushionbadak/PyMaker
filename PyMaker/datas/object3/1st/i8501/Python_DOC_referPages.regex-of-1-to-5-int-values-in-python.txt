Natural Text
I want to store the numbers that are 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 only. I am trying as [1-5];But it is validating 22 also. Is anything wrong here?
Try with This way you tell that the string Starts (^) and Ends ($) with a number between 1 and 5.Hope it helps
This is happening because re.match matches the start of the string, so as long as it starts with [1-5] it can end with any other characters (in this case just '2'). You'll need to add a $ at the end of the regex to force it to match the end of the string:Alternatively you could use vote.isdigit() to test whether it's digits and then use int(vote) to extract the number and test the range:
If you just want one of those numbers from a line of text try matchObj = re.match( '\b[1-5]\b', vote, re.M|re.I).\b means word boundary so 2 matches but 22 won't.
