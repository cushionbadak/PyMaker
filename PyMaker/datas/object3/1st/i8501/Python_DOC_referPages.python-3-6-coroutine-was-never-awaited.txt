So when ever I run my program and connect to it with the echo client it gives me this error. As far as I know I have everything that should be awaited awaited. Here is the code:
Regarding your error message, the actual error is:And the line below is just a warning (RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'handle_request' was never awaited).You might be mixing asyncio.start_server with loop.create_server().loop.create_server()'s first parameter is protocol_factory which is a callable that returns an instance of a Protocol (and not a coroutine as in your code above):See full echo server example here.
