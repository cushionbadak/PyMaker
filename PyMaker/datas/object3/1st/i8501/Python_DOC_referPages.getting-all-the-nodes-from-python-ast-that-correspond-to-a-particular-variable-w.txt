Consider the code below:The value of x after execution of the code above is 10. Now, how can I get all the nodes with class Name whose ids are x and refer to the x that's being used in lines 1, 10, 12 and 13?In other words, the x inside of f is different from the rest of the xs. Is it possible to get their AST nodes, having only the script and script's AST while not executing it?
When walking the AST tree, track the context; start with a global context, then as you encounter FunctionDef or ClassDef or Lambda nodes, record that context as a stack (pop the stack again when exiting the relevant node).You can then simply only look at Name nodes in the global context. You can track global identifiers too (I'd use a set per stack level).Using a NodeVisitor subclass:Demo (given the AST tree for your sample code in t):And using global x in a function:
