I'm using Sphinx to generate my HTML docs from my docstrings like a good lil' Pythonista.I have a docstring that looked like this:However, I want it to link to https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip rather than just be all monospace and code-blocky.I've tried a couple of approaches:None of these work - or more accurately, the first four approaches give me a monospaced & bolded font face, but none of them actually link anywhere. And the any directive gives me WARNING: 'any' reference target not found: str.strip()Obviously I could make a link myself, but that seems gross and also probably not exactly what I want, because what about when I upgrade to Python 4? Then I have to update all of my links in my documentation and that's just gross.What's the proper way to link to the Python documentation for a str method?
Intersphinx ftw!In conf.py, add a couple of lines. Pyramid documentation has good examples for adding the Intersphinx extension and configuring intersphinx mappings.andThen in your .rst files, there are several ways to point to the Python docs. We prefer to use the following format which indicates to the documentation author that the link will resolve to a specified external documentation source.For Python, you can also use any of the directives within the Python Domain, including:As far as versioning, you can use multiple names in your intersphinx mapping or update the target mapping.or in the future...
