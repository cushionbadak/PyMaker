I am trying to write a Linear congruential generator in python and I find a little piece of code on Wikipedia but have some difficulty on understanding it. The code is as follows:My problem is that what is "lcg.previous"? I notice that the function is done, the value of lcg.previous gets updated and stored. Is it declared as a member variable of function lcg() here or actually some kind of default set up for all function in python? Thanks a lot!
It is a "member variable" of the function, so that each time it is called (except when called with something for seed) the sequence will pick of where it left off.
Python is recognizing the lcg.previous as a new variable declaration, and will add it as a member to lcg.
The previous variable is a property on the lcg function. In this example it's being used as a static variable for the lcg function. Since Python doesn't require variables (or object members) to be declared before use you can create them at need. In this case, you've create a member previous of the lcg function object.
