I am using Python 3.6 and Pillow 4.0.0I am trying to make a PIL Image from an array of values, see the simplified code below and I am getting the following error: AttributeError: 'array.array' object has no attribute '__array_interface__' when calling the Image.fromarray() function.Why does this happen?When PIL documentation says:Creates an image memory from an object exporting the array interface (using the buffer protocol).and array.array documentations says:Array objects also implement the buffer interface, and may be used wherever bytes-like objects are supported...
The array interface is a NumPy concept: ref. Said differently, Image.fromarray can only operate on numpy arrays and not on Standard Python Library array.array.
You must use  array interface (using the buffer protocol), try this:You can read An Introduction to the Python Buffer Protocol
