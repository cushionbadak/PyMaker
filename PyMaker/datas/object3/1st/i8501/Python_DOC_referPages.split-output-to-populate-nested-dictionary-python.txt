Natural Text
I am trying to populate a nested dictionary, but are having trouble since I am fairly new to python (also to Stack Overflow).I have a txt file with paths to photos and I would like to populate the splits from it to a nested dictionary. An example of the text file looks like this:Where Bob is the user, January is the month, W1 the week and 001 the nr of the photo. Etc.I would like to populate a nested dictionary in the following structure (based on what I have read):So far I have only managed to sort the numbers to a user, like this:But now I want the nested structure I described. I started by initializing my nested dict, like this nesteddict[user][month][week].append(image), but I recieve KeyError: 'Bob'. I also understand that I am going to need a lot more if statements and conditions. But I don't know where to begin.        
You can use nested sets of collections.defaultdict to build your data:
I have done something like this before:So, your keys would need to be in a list (the keys list) and the value that you want at the end of that key chain is in value
