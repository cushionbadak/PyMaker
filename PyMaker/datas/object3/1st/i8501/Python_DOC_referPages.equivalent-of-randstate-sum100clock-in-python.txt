I am not very familiar with python. I have searched a lot and I want to exactly transfer below line to python:I know that I should use  np.random.seed() and np.random.RandomState()but I was not able how to choose and using them to have exactly that equivalent. Thanks
You don't need such a thing in Python.  Unlike MATLAB which uses the same fixed random seed by default, Python automatically sets a new random seed each time, either by system-provided randomness or by the system clock depending on the platform.  You only need to manually set the seed if you want to use the same seed each time.  This is covered in the documentation:random.seed(a=None, version=2)  If a is omitted or None, the current system time is used. If randomness sources are provided by the operating system, they are used instead of the system time (see the os.urandom() function for details on availability).If you want to manually reset the seed to a new random value (which you only need to do if you previously set it to a fixed value), you can just do:Or for numpy:
