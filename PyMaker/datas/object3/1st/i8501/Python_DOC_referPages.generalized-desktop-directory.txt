Simple enough, off of my last question, I am trying to make a directory change to a players desktop or file that is similar for all, as in C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Desktop\\Tester File but the how would I make it so that USERNAME is the username of the person's computer? I tried using %USERNAME% but I don't really know how to do that, and it didn't work, and anyway the % gave an error message (I cannot remember the message, I think it was syntax error)I also tried using ~, but it proved to be ineffective, but it may be due to my lack of experience.EDITI solved this issue, thanks to some very great help from @pstatix so thank you.By using user = getpass.getuser() I was able to do something like 'C:\Users' + user + '\Documents' it made this all user friendly! Thanks!
Have you tried the getpass module? getpass documentation here.Edit: For user specified exampleYou may also be interested in using the os module? os documentation here.Using os.environ for environment variables may also prove useful. os.environ documentation here For example:
