Natural Text
I am trying to get a to be the first line of the file and b to be the second. This prints nothing. I want to assign specific lines to variables, not just read all of them.
Check the tutorial first please, it says:If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use  list(f) or f.readlines().
