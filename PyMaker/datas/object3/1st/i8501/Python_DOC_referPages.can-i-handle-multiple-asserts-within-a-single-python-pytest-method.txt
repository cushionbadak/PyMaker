I am writing tests with pytest, and I ran into the next problem: I have a test which testing some variable, and then I perform some heavy calculation, and after that I want to perform another test.The problem is- if the first assert failed, the whole test failed, and the pystest does not perform the second test.The code:I'm aware that this test method can be separated into 2 methods, but the performance issue here is crucial.There is a way I can run 2 asserts in one method?
Usually, I just let the test fail on the first assertion. However, if you really want to do more than one comparison, compare tuples. Here's a simple example:When I run that with pytest, it shows me both values:I also tried using and to combine comparisons, but that doesn't work because of short circuiting. For example, I tried this assertion:Pytest reported this failure:It doesn't report the value of b unless you use the --showlocals option.
