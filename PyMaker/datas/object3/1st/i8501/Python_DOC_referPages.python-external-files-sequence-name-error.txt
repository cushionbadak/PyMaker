I try to make my code more modular for general readability. When moving functions and dictionaries storing function names to external py.files in the same folder, it raises a name error. It does however work fine when in one file and the dict-file importing the function file (please see below):Does not work:Main fileDoes work but seems messy:Main fileIs there a reason why the former does not work? It seems that order is of importance for the addMode in the dict to not cause a NameError, is there a way to force it?
It doesn't have much to do with the order things are in â€” this is how namespaces work. data.py and func.py have different namespaces, and if you want to use something in one namespace from another, you need to import it. And importing something into the main file's namespace doesn't cause it to appear in data.py's namespace.
