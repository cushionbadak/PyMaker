This question already has an answer here:How to create a tuple with only one element                    3 answers                I'm learning about dictionaries and I wrote a small bit of code and built it.I get the following error:I don't understand why it isn't iterable? And what has 'int' got to do with the problem?Thanks
As documented here you need to provide key-value pairs to OrderedDict.At its core, OrderedDict is a dictionary and thus needs a value to store at a key.Passing it (1) is wrong because:So, (1) is not a tuple but an integer object.
OrderedDicts (or any sub-class of dict for that matter) are a set of key-value pairs.The following statement does not provide any such pairs.Also note that(1) is an int.(1,) is a tuple.
The list elements should be a tuple of 2 items (one key and another value).(1) becomes 1 an int. So what python is doing is it is trying to split it into key-value pair. So you get that error.
