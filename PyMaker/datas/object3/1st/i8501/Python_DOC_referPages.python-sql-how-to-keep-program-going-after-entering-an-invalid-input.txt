Ok, so I have some code when creating a database.Here's the code:So basically, the PhoneNumber is set to unique. If I enter a phone number that has already been entered the program stops and gives an error message (Because it is unique). How do I get it to keep running or display a message saying "Phone number already taken please input another on" instead of endingThanks
