My bytes is getting converted to an int but I don't know exactly where?Take this exampleI guess this is some kind of coercion but what triggers it? is doesn't appear to be using the zip iterator? as calling z.__next__() does not cause the conversion.  Thanks
The documentation (here) says a bytes is a sequence of integers. Further down the documentation of zip (here) says, that zip iterates over sequences. That is why b becomes of type int.You can see that by doing the following:Notice please, that by using a and b as loop variables you overwrite the original a and b.
