Natural Text
I have a list of job titles (12,000 in total) formatted in this way:Career_List = ['1) ABLE SEAMAN', '2) ABRASIVE GRADER', '3) ABRASIVE GRINDER']How do I remove the numbers, parentheses, and spaces from the list elements so that I end up with this output:Career_List_Updated = ['ABLE SEAMAN', 'ABRASIVE GRADER', 'ABRASIVE GRINDER']I know that I am unable to simply remove the first three characters because I have more than ten items in my list. 
Take advantage of the fact that str.lstrip() and the rest of the strip functions accept multiple characters as an argument.
Split each career at the first space; keep the rest of the line.Output:One-line version:
We want to find the first index that STOPS being a bad character and return the rest of the string, as follows.
