I'm new to python and I'm trying to figure out how to ask the user for input and then use that input to select a specific card from a deck of cards. This is what I have so far   
I assume your problem is that you don't know how to access the chosen card, once the player picks a number.If that's the case, you're already close to the solution!When the player inputs a number, you've stored it as a string in the pick variable. The next steps are to:convert that string to an integer, and find the card at that position in the deck.Python has a built-in int function, to convert the pick from a string to an integer.Your deck variable is a list, and to get items out of a list in Python, you can request the item by index. The index is a number representing the position of that item:Adding this to your code should do the trick:
You're almost there!  All you need to do is to get the card out of deck.(Psst!  remember, lists start at index 0, that's why you have to -1 from it)
It looks to me as if all you need to do is access the chosen card.Do you need to do more with this?  I would normally think that you'd want the deck to be a list of (suit, rank) pairs, rather than string descriptions.  You can select a card description with your current code, but deck doesn't have an easy way to turn those descriptions back into characteristics you can manipulate.
