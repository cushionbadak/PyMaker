Let's say I have this:How should I define mystery_method so that it would return the class_instance instance?The real-world case I have is that I'm sending a QWidget which I'm using as a base instance for .ui file loading into a function. Inside this function I need to figure out which class instance it belongs to.
One way would we to define foo as a custom property that returns both its value and the related instance when its value is fetched:Now in your program you can explicitly use its value and the related instance using foo's value and instance attributes respectively.Demo:

In general you cannot (at least not without a lot of searching through all the objects in the system) but if all you want is to find which instances of a class match a particular value then it's fairly easy.You can create a set of all instances and iterate over them to find what you need.Note that deleting the object won't remove it immediately, it may not go until garbage collected:However in general you would be better to keep the reference to the original object hanging around and just use that.Also, note that you cannot reliably tell which instance holds 'bar' if it is stored in more than one object: they could be the same 'bar' or they could be different ones, and whether they are the same or different is an implementation detail.
