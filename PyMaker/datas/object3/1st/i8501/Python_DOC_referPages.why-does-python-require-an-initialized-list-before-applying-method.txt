This question already has an answer here:python append list return none                    1 answer                The following works just fine:But the following doesn't:This holds true for a few of the list methods that' I've tried. Why does Python require explicit variable declaration before applying a method?
You're not reading that right. .append() returns None in both cases. In the first case, it is b that results in [1, 2, 3]. In the second, that list is created also, but you don't have access to it becaues you didn't assign a variable name to it.
append returns None as its value, but alters the list.  TryYou'll get None for output, too.
