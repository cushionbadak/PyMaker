Relatively new to python so apologies for any terrible coding.I'm using blender to create random stimuli sets using the sapling add on to create something likeI also want to define a random camera position and angle in a hemisphere above the plane which I do by producing two random numbers (u and v in my example below).However, calling the py.ops.curve.tree_add function (which generates the tree) sets some kind of seed which means that the random numbers I produce are always the same.E.g. in the example code it creates a range of different trees depending on the randint() generated for basesize/ basesplit.However, for each unique tree these generate, the random numbers u and v are always the same. This means for every random tree I generate, the camera angle is specific for that tree (and not completely random)I assume this occurs via some seed, so I was wondering if there is a way to tell python to generate a random number and ignore any seeds?Best,Example code: (import bpy is the python api module for blender)in case it helps, my function to generate a sphere to place the camera and then point it towards the object is (I haven't included the libraries/ rest of the script etc. here for brevity- it creates a point around a defined centre which is a radius r away and works apart from the above issue):
You can make a instance of random using the class random.Random.An example would be:This reason is: The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the random.Random class. You can instantiate your own instances of Random to get generators that donâ€™t share state(from https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)
Python's random module provides the seed() method for you to set the seed.Another option to get variations in your trees is to provide a different seed for the sapling addon to work with. You can find it in the operator adjustment panel above the tree scale, the python API also accepts a seed paramater.
