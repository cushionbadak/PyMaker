Natural Text
Assume that, file.txt is closed or deleted during the delay between open and write. (or it can ?)Then, this situation can occur TOCTOU ?with statement sure that atomic until with block or not?
Can this occur?Use case 1: Python itself deletes the file* yes it can happen. I just tested like this:Use Case 2: Other than python deletes the file. Then also, found the behavior to be same. How to avoid it? You can use exclusive lock from fcntl.lockf() Edit: There is one more caveat here. Locking the file may not be straight forward and may be OS dependent like What is the best way to open a file for exclusive access in Python?
