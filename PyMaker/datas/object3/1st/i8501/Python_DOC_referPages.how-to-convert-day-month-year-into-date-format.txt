Ifhad an index error, it means month was either smaller than 1 or bigger than 12. You could check it's in the correct range before this line.A few noteseval is dangerous, and not needed in this case. You could use split, map and int to extract the integers.you could use format with %02d to show the dates, if you want to write it yourselfstrftime and strptime do exactly what you want. They parse a string to datetime and display a datetime in any given format.calendar already has month_name. The list has 13 elements though, and the first one is empty.Modified code :As an example :but :
eval() is unnecessary here, assuming your user knows to separate with commas you can just use:may only work in 2.x see comments below, sorry for confusionthen regarding inputs you should validate your data:
