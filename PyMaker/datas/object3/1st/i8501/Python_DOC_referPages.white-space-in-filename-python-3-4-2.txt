I have created this small prog to search all PDF's in a directory, determine if they are searchable or not and then move them to the appropriate directory. I am new to Python and it is probably not the best way but it does work until the file name has White Space in it and I get the following returned.Any help would be appreciated.
os.system() uses the shell to execute your command. You'd have to quote your filename for the shell to recognise spaces as part of the file, you could do so with the shlex.quote() function:However, there is no reason at all to use os.system() and the shell. You should use the subprocess.run() function and configure that to pass back the output without using redirection or a shell:Because pdfFile is passed to pdffonts.exe directly there is no need to worry about a shell parsing and whitespace no longer matters.Note that I changed seekWord to be a bytes literal instead as result.stdout is a bytes value (no need to try to decode the result to Unicode here).
It seems the problem doesn't come from python, but the Windows shell. You need to enclose in quotation mark. As I don't have your program pdffonts.exe, I cannot debug. I also made your code more pythonic
