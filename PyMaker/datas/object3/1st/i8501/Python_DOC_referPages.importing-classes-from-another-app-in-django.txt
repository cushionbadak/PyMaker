I am using Django 1.10 for my project. Below is the project structure.I have define UserForm class in user_forms.py file and in __init__.py file I imported user_forms as from .user_forms import *I am trying to use UserForm in otherapp.I was just curious why works butordoes not work?  Why?Isn't 3rd method better than first two as it follows zen of python Explicit is better than implicit.What is the best way to import classes from one app to other?
You can't do import accounts.forms.UserForm because UserForm is a class, not a module. You can however do:Personally, I prefer your first approach. As long as UserForm doesn't clash with another UserForm from account.views it won't cause any problems. The import shows you where it has been imported from, so I don't think 'Explicit is better than implicit' is an issue here.
When we import anything python search for the named module not for class or function. UserForm is a class according to you, thats why import accounts.forms.UserForm is not working. You can also do it by:For more on import statement you can go https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html and https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import
