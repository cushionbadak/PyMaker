How do you run a specific line from a csv file depending on user input.My code asks the user to input the problem with their phone, if the user inputs water has spilled the keyword water or spilled will be identified and a   solution stored in the csv will be printed. However i stored many solutions there for different keywords.
First re-write your dataset as:Then search for the problem and print the next line.
If your problems/solutions are written in the file this way:which gives:you can try this code:The list_of_problems_and_solutions will be someting like ['Problems1', 'Solution1', 'Problems2', 'Solution2' ]The for i in range (0, len(list_of_problems_and_solutions )-1, 2): function will go through the list from index 0 to the end, with a step of 2.As you see, when I type Problems1 as my problem, Python returns Solution1. You only have to replace with your keywords/solutions
