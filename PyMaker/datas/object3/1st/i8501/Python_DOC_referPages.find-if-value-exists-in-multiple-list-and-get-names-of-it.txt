I found similar question, but I'm not able to convert answer to match my needs.(Find if value exists in multiple lists)So, basicly, I have multiple lists, and I want to list all of them, which contain current user username. If current user is user1, I want it to print rep_WOHTEL, rep_REPDAY and rep_ZARKGL. Code above print only ony of them.How should I change this part of script, to print all I want?
Checking if value is in all global lists, and if true, print which list(s) contains the required value.Code:Output:More info about the used functions:globals()dict.items()filter()isinstance()startswith()
Like I commented in the linked question, iterating through all of globals() or locals() is a bad idea. Store your lists together in a single dictionary or list, and iterate through that instead.Result:
