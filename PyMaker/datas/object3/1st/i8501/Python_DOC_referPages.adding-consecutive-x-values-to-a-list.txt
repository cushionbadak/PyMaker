Suppose I have a list with items [123, 124, 125, ... 9820] and from that list I want to append to a second list with a string of every 8 items separated by a space up until the end. For example the list would have: ["123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130", "131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138",..] etc. What is the best way to do this in python? I have tried a naive solution of looping from 123 to 9820 but this takes way too much runtime and times out some of my simple tests I have set up. Are there any functions that would be useful to me? 
Collect the elements into chunks of length 8 and use join(). Here's an example using an adapted recipe from itertools:
We have to jump by 8 index to get next item from items list.DemoConsider items list from 1 to 999 numbers, Length of items list is 999.Then use for loop with range function to jump by 8 index in a items list.Use append method of string to get final result.code:
I think this does the work you want:The code:The output:
