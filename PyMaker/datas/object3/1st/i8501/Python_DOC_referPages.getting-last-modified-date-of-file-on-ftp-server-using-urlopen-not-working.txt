Following How can I get the last-modified time with python3 urllib? I want to get last modification date of a file on a FTP server. However, with the code above, last-modified is None. Any suggestions? I want solution to work on both python 2 and python 3
The documentation of urlopen does not claim that it returns last-modified for FTP URLs.Note that there are no headers in FTP protocol. The urlopen just fakes few HTTP-like headers for some kind of compatibility of the interface across protocols.To retrieve timestamp using FTP, use the ftplib. See How to get FTP file's modify time using Python ftplib.
