I have an assignment to create a 10 by 10 table in Python and I'm using the end "\t" within my print function to prevent it from creating a new line. But, I need it to start a new line after of course 10 characters. How can I make it do that? Here's my code:I need it to look something like this:
This is using alignement options from the format method.Reference: Format specification mini-language
I think all you would need to add to get what you want is to print a new line in your inner loop like so:On the third line it'll start a new line after 10.The output will look like this:1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   102   4   6   8   10  12  14  16  18  203   6   9   12  15  18  21  24  27  304   8   12  16  20  24  28  32  36  405   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  506   12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  607   14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  708   16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  809   18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  9010  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100
For fun, this can be done as a one liner with a bit of list comprehension and the join method
