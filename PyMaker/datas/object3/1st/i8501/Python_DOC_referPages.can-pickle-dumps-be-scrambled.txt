For an automation project, I have to persist user id/password to allow my scripts to connect to a remote service.My idea is to use the keyring module to achieve some better level of security; but as not all platforms support keyring; I am looking into storing credentials into a flat file, too. I created a "Credentials" class; and figured that using pickle I could just dump/load objects of that class, like:Unfortunately, this file gives away the password in plain text:I understand that file, stored by a local script isn't offering real security. But I was hoping to at least get to a point where one would need more than a simple "less whatever.dat" to acquire that password text.I had hoped that pickle has some kind of "scramble" mode; but couldn't find anything. Am I overlooking something?Alternatively: is there another way to persist my objects that easily, but not that "easy human readable"?
A simple solution; based on the comment by Keef Baker --- using AES encryption to scramble on password/username; like this:
You should not.The problem in applications that try to keep a safely encrypted copy of a key is just that they need another key to decrypt it. It could be encrypted too by would need still another key. It could... (sorry joking :-) ). It only makes sense when you have to store multiple secrets, because you unlock the secure vault with one single password - what keyring and password managers do...For one single password, the correct and portable way is to rely on the OS to provide a secure folder. Both Linux (and Unix-like) and provide either access control rules (only accessible to user), or encrypted folders if you need better security. Just document it and respect the single responsibility principle.
