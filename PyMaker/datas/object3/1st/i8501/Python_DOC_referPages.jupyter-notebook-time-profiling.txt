So I installed jupyter notebook through anaconda and I am working on python 3 kernel.I am trying to do Time profiling using %time magic command as show hereThe problem is that it only prints the Wall Time not the CPU Timeusing %time or %%time does not help%time prints the wall time for the first line only%%time prints the wall time for the whole cell I am not sure if there any specif config to print the CPU timeEDIT To clarify using %%time should print two metrics for the whole cellMetric 1: CPU TimesMetric 2: wall timemy problem is that I only get wall time not CPU time.You may check this link on what is the expected output for %%time
So it seems that my issue was in the environment itself. Switching from Windows to Ubuntu actually helped me print the CPU times.
