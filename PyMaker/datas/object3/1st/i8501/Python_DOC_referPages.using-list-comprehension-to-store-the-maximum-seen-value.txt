Is it possible to do the below with list comprehension? Trying to store the maximum value that has been seen at any given point through the loop.
What you present here is a typical form of what is known in functional programming as scan.A way to do this with list comprehension that is inefficient is:But this will run in O(n2).You can do this with list comprehension given you use a function with side effects: like the following:You can then use:Or you can use a dictonaries setdefault() like:and call it with:like @AChampion says.But functions with side-effects are rather unpythonic and not declarative.But you better use a scanl or accumulate approach like the one offered by itertools:
You can use itertools.accumulate with the max builtin in Python 3:
If using NumPy is permitted, then you can use NumPy:
