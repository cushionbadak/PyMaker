I've been asked to contribute to some in-production Python/Django code. I'm setting it up in PyCharm. When I run the app, I get this error message:What could be causing this?
That may be caused by the name shadowing trap. A cause may be that you are shadowing the Charset class, which is defined in the email.charset module, when you import from email import (charset as Charset, encoders as Encoders).Another probable cause, supported by this issue: If you check your file tree, you may find a file named charset.py or Charset.py which shadows the above mentionedSearch your files and you will find what casts the shadow.
