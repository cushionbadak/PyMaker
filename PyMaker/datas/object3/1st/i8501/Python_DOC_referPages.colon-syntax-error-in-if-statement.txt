Ok, so i'm pretty new to the whole coding scene, and i've been working on python through code academy. On the site there is an activity where you make a pig latin translator. I was able to make this just fine, but when I attempted to recreate it in the python shell I was getting some weird errors in the if statement.I get a syntax error on the colon ending the statement, so I assumed it was some kind of indentation error. However when I put a line space between the line previous and the if statement, it works just fine! Can anyone explain why this is??
Ending each line with \ is what's tripping you up. (See the documentation for "Explicit line joining")\ is the chatacter used to continue a line if you want to have a "single line" span multiple lines of textThe python interpreter sees it and ignores the next newline character and thus sees:when you add the extra space it works because the if statement is again on it's own line
