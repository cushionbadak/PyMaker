I have a python3 code that uses subprocess exception TimeoutExpired, but I need this to run on python2. My code is a simple try and except subprocess.TimeoutExpired but it is only available on python3. I apologise for the simplicity of the question. What can I do about this?
The timeout feature is available on Python 2.x via the subprocess32 backport of the 3.2+ subprocess module. You can get the module here
