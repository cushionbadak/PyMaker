I have three lists (L1, L2, L3), something like :I want to compute the product of L1*L2*L3, id est,but I want to take or not in account some lists; hence,[1,], [ 1, 'a' ] would be a part of the result, like ['a',], ['a', 'B'] and so on.Any idea to help me ? Thanks !
Use the powerset function given in the itertools examples. powerset([L1,L2,L3]) will give you all subsets of the set of 3 lists. For each subset you can take the cartesian product, and then chain them all together.
