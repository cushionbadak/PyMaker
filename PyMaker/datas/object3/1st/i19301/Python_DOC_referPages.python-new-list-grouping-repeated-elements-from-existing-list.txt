I have one list of the form:and I want to create a new list, grouping the repeated elements into lists inside my new list, so at the end I will have:
Use itertools.groupby:The key argument is needed here to extract just the part of the value you wanted to group on; the first 3 characters.Result:groupby will combine successive keys that are equal into 1 group. If you have disjoint groups (so same value, but with other values in between) it'll create separate groups for those:If that is not what you want you will have to sort my_list first.
Make sure it's sorted and use
As an alternative to groupby, you could use collections.Counter:This will work without the need to sort the list if the elements are all jumbled up, unlike groupby.
