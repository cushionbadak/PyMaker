So my desired outcome is opening a list, searching for a character within that listand returning the character details. for eg. searching for a in [(a,b,c,d),(e,f,g,h)] would return a,b,c,d. So far it isn't returning anything.
Your biggest issue is that the for row in lists won't actually iterate through anything (you've already done a complete read of the file when you called set). I think if you get rid of that line (and look for name in row you should be doing much better.
