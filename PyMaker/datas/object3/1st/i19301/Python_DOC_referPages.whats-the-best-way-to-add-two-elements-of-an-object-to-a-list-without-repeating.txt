Performance, elegancy and readability are the requirements for "the best way"I have the array of dictionaries:The result should be: ids = [1,2,3,4] (list of id1 and id2)Edit:Something like this:
Update for updated question
This could be done pretty easily by using itertools.chain.from_iterable() to flatten a nested generator expression producing the values of the ids - we presume that all keys are going to be strings, and that starting with "id" specifies an id. We then make a set of those values to remove duplicates:If you really want a list, then you could create one from the set, but in most cases, the set should be fine as-is. Note that the set has no order, so if you want an order you will need to use sorted(), for example.itertools.chain.from_iterable() is the most efficient and readable way to flatten an iterable.Your specification isn't clear when it comes to what an id is. If you have a set of keys which define an id, then something like this might be more appropriate as the if clause of the inner generator expression:
