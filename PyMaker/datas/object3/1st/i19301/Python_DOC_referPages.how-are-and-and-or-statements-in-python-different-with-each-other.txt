If you look at this:-and this:-Both are almost similar. So how are they different?
The or and and operators short-circuit. They return early when the outcome is a given.For or that means that if the first expression is True, then there is no point in looking at the second expression as it doesn't matter:The same goes for and, but only when the first value evaluates to False; in that case the expression is always going to evaluate to False whatever the second expression is going to come to:See Boolean expressions:The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.
