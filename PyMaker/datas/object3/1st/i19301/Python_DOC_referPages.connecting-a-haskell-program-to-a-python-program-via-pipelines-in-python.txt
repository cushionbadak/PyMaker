Bear with me as I'm fairly new to programming. My basic question is this. I have a program written in Haskell whose stdout I want to connect to the stdin of a Python program (which will manage the GUI related stuff). Similarly, I want to connect the stdout of the Python program to the stdin of the Haskell program so that it can send information about what the user clicked/typed in to the Haskell program. The first question is this, if I set up a pipeline between the two, assuming the stdout of the Python program is hooked up to the Haskell program, if I use Tkinter to create widgets and stuff, will they be displayed on the screen nonetheless?The second question is how exactly would I establish this pipeline? Consider the following example code..The Python code would look something like this.I'm sorry if this has already been asked before, but thanks for helping me out!
I did it using Twisted since it provides great abstraction over polling. Basically you need to first define the ways (called protocol in Twisted) how Python and Haskell programs communicate with each other, E.g., how long a data packet is, how to handle errors etc. Then you just code them up.Here is the haskell code:And here is the Python code:
You can also establish the pipeline from a command shell:mypython.py | myhaskell.hsThe Haskell program will respond the same as it would toany other type of standard input, as in:myhaskell.hs
