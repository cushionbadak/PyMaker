For example let's say I have a file called myscript.pyThis file contains the following code.How would I call the function foo with argument var on command line.I know that I can go to the directory myscript.py is placed in and type.Which will run myscript.py. The only problem is myscript.py doesn't automatically call foo when it is run.I have tried using Which does not work for me. For some reason when I do that nothing happens. I get no error message and nothing is called.
