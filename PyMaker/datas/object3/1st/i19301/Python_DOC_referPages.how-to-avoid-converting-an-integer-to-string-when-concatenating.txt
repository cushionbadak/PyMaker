This question already has an answer here:How can I concatenate a string and a number in Python? [duplicate]                    7 answers                I know that in python, you can't simply do this:you have to do this: otherwise you'll get an error.My question is then, being python such a compact language and this feature of automatic casting/converting from integer to string available in so many other languages, isn't there away to avoid having to use the str() function everytime? Some obscure import, or simply another way to do it?Edit: When I say another way, I mean simpler more compact way to write it. So, I wouldn't really consider format and alternative for instance.Thanks.
I tend to use the more compact formatOr, in python 3,Notice however that both options will always introduce a space between each argument, which makes it unsuitable for more complex output formatting, where you should use some of the other solutions presented.
You can avoid str():Anyway,is equivalent toand the __add__ method of strings accepts only strings.Just likeis equivalent toand the __add__ method of integers accept only numbers (int/float).
You can use string formatting, old:or new:
As this answer explains, this will not happen in Python because it is strongly typed. This means that Python will not convert types that you do not explicitly say to convert.
