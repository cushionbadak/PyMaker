Frequently the constructor of a class will take it's arguments and save them on the instance. For example:This is repetitious so I made a helper function to do this automatically:My questions are as follows:Will this fail with certain classes or agrumentsIs it portable, will it work on Jython, etc.. It worked for me on python 2.7 and 3.2Is there a simpler alternative?Is there a python package out there that already does this? 
It'll fail when your class uses __slots__. You could use setattr() instead:provided the arguments keyword arguments to __init__ are all declared slots of course.Otherwise this should work on any Python implementation.You may be interested in a previous discussion of the topic, which sparked a Python-ideas list thread.
This requires you to write more code, silently ignores all erroneous arguments to the Example constructor, and doesn't support positional arguments to the Example constructor, but avoids use of inspect:
