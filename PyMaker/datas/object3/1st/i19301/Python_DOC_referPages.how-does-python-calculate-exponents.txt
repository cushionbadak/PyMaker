To calculate exponents in Python, we use the ** command. For example, we type x**3 for the cube of x. How does Python evaluate such polynomials? Is that 3 flops used in this calculation? What about non-integer exponents? Say x**2.3? 
The ** operator translates to the BINARY_POWER opcode in the bytecode, which the interpreter then translates to the C-API PyNumber_Power call with the 3rd argument set to None.PyNumber_Power calls the nb_power slot on the operands (see ternary_op).If both are integers, the int_pow C function succeeds and its result used.If however x is an integer and you use 2.3 as the power, the integer power function raises an error and float_pow is tried next. In that case, provided x is greater than 0, the C library pow() function is used on two float values, which on most architectures is then handled by the floating point support in the CPU.
