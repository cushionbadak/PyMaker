This code is a preview from an upcoming competition at picoctf.com.  I modified the original code provided so it allows for user input, but I can't get Test #2 to work.  When a string of 10 characters is entered with at least one letter, I want it to print that only numbers may be used.  Currently it tries to convert the user input to an integer value to compare it to the actual serial, but if there is a letter present the test fails since a letter can't be converted to a integer value:123456789a yields "invalid literal for int() with base 10..."How can I fix this piece of code so that it tests correctly?****
Use str.isdigit() to test if all characters are digits:You may want to turn your serial string into a sequence of integers to make all your tests easier:then etc.You could easily build a sequence of tests with indices, an operator and the expected outcome:
or following Martijn's suggestion
Use str.isdigit()Return true if all characters in the string are digits and there is at  least one character, false otherwise.You could use a regular expression as well:
