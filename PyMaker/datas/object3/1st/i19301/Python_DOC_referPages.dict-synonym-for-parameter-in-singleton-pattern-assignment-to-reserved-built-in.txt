In Python a way to implement the Singleton pattern is with metaclasses.But in Eclipse with PyDev dict parameter raises a warning: Assignment to reserved built-in symbol: dict.Also PEP 8 says:If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is  generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than  use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus class_ is better than  clss. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)I found on the web different names assigned to the parameter instead of dict, such as dictionary, classdict and attrs.And a approach with *args and **kwargs:I think this last snippet is the best because is safe if type init method changes his signature.The questions:What name do you assign to the parameter instead of dict?What do you think about this last snippet?What do you think is the best option? Change parameter name or use *args and **kwargs?
dict is a built-in type, you can use namespace or attributes or whatever instead. It doesn't really matter here, it is just a local variable name.There is no requirement for it to be named anything specific as it is a positional parameter. The datamodel documentation uses namespace.Using *args and **kwargs is more than fine there. In fact, the __init__() of a metaclass can be passed additional keyword arguments, so it is good practice to pass those on to the super __init__ method.I'd use *args and **kwargs when I don't care about the parameters. That way you future-proof the method.Note that in Python 3, you no longer need to give super() any arguments:
