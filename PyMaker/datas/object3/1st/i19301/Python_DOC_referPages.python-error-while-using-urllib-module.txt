I was making python http banner grabber using urllib but it gives me an error.I was not able it import urllib2 (module not found error) so tried with with urllib instead.Here's the code , what's wrong with it?Error:
You are using Python 3; use urllib.request instead.This is documented at the top of the urllib2 page:Note: The urllib2 module has been split across several modules in Python 3 named urllib.request and urllib.error. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3.
