I have started to write console with Python language. It is amazing. But, I have tried to create input box with curses as shown below. I have stucked in how I can put input line and get the input written on the input place on the console. Can you help me for this part ? I forget to ask _is it possible to create input box as shown below with curses ? If not, what should I use ?I just want to see the methods/algorithms not the whole and complete code.I am developing on the Linux platform ( Ubuntu 12.04 lts ) 
Somehow my previous answer got deleted...To get user input in Python, assign a variable to the results of the built-in input() function:In Python 2, the raw_input() function is also available, and is preferred over input().To get the password without it echoing back to the screen, use the getpass module:I'm not that familiar with curses, but it would seem that you could position your cursor, then call input() or getpass.getpass(). Just briefly reading over the documentation, there are apparently options to turn screen echoing on and off at will, so those may be better options. Read The Fine Manual :)
