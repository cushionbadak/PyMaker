This question already has an answer here:Convert two lists into a dictionary in Python                    15 answers                Say I have two lists.How would I use a loop to make list1 the keys and list2 the values so that each index would store themselves into the dictionary, so as an example...
Since you explicitly ask "How would I use a loop to X" rather than "How do I X", this may be a homework assignment where they don't want you to solve it the trivial way with zip. So, just in case, I'll give you a hint.First, here's a way to iterate two lists in lockstep (assuming you know they're the same length). It's not the right way to do it—again, that's zip—but if your professor wants you to do things the wrong way, you can.Now you just have to figure out what to do inside that loop instead of print, do get d[x] to equal y for each matching x and y from the two lists.
