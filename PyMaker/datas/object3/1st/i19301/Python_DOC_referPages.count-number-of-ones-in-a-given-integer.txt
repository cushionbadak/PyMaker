How do you count the number of ones in a given integer's binary representation.Say you are given a number 20, which is 10100 in binary, so number of ones is 2.
Use the awesome collections module.Or you can use the built-in function count():Or even:But that last solution is slower than using count()
What you're looking for is called the Hamming weight, and there are a lot of algorithms to do it. Here's another straightforward one:

The usual way to make this blinding fast is to use lookup tables:In Python, any solution using bin and list.count will be faster, but this is nice if you want to write it in assembler.
The str.count method and bin function make short work of this little challenge:
If the input number is 'number'Another solution is 
I am a new coder and I found this one logic simple. Might be easier for newbies to understand.
