According to the doc and this tutorial,cmp() returns -1 if x < y and cmp() returns 0 if  x == y and cmp() returns 1 if  x > y The tutorial also said thatcmp() returns the sign of the difference of two numbersI don't really get what does it mean sign of the difference of two numbers. Doesn't that mean that it returns a value when the sign of number aren't equal ( positive and negative sign ) ? Since...**Note: code from the tutorial.*Despite my confusion in sign differences, I can't really think of why do we need a built-in function to return a value of -1 when x < y. Isn't the function cmp( ) easily implemented ? Is there any reason why Python creators keep cmp( ) function, or is there any hidden usage of this Python's cmp( ) function ?
Why cmp( ) is useful?It isn't very useful, which is why it was deprecated (the builtin cmp is gone and builtin sorts no longer accept one in Python 3). Rich comparison methods supplanted it:This allows the < symbol (and other symbols) to be overloaded comparison operators, enabling, for example, subset and superset comparisons of set objects.while it could enable the above, cmp wouldn't allow the following:Toy usage for cmpHere's an interesting usage which uses its result as an index (it returns -1 if the first is less than the second, 0 if equal, and 1 if greater than):According to the docs, you should treat cmp as if it wasn't there:https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#ordering-comparisonscmp removed, equivalent operationBut you can use this as the equivalent:in our little toy function, that's this:
I don't really get what does it mean sign of the difference of two numbers.This means: take the difference, and then the sign of that difference. For example, if x and y are two numbers:x < y => x - y < 0 and the function returns -1.x == y => x - y == 0 and the function returns 0.x > y => x - y > 0 and the function returns 1.For more information on three-way comparisons, see Wikipedia.
For sorting sequences of items. When you are sorting a list of items you only need to know one item is greater or less than another item.More info here: http://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting/#The_Old_Way_Using_the_cmp_Parameter
Trivalued comparators are very useful when sorting.  You don't just want to know whether two elements are equal; you also want to know their relative order so that you know how to rearrange them to move closer to a sorted list.  This is why C (strcmp) and Perl (cmp) both have similar operations (in those cases for strings, but it's the same idea).
Another use case: Finding the sign (- / +) of a numberIf you want to find out, what the sign (+/-) of a number is, you can easily use 0 as the second argument to the cmp function
