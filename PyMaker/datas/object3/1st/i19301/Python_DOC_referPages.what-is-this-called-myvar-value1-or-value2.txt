I've seen this kind of ternary assignment called and I was wondering if it had a specific name:
The docs call that a boolean operation.  The value of value1 or value2 is just a feature of the language.In C and C-inspired languages there is a ternary operator.  The effect of this operator is better called a "conditional expression".  Python has a conditional expression, too:I prefer using the conditional expression to the boolean operators in this kind of situation.  The effect of myVar = value1 or value2 is not obvious to someone who isn't fluent in Python.
