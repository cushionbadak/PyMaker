Hi i would like to know what is wrong with this code
Python's for loop doesn't yield indices but the item in the sequence itself, so here, inside the loop, answer is already an element of yourResult. IOW, you want:As a side note:1/ a file object is an iterable, so you don't need to use readlines(), you can (and should) directly iterate over the file (it will avoid loading the whole content in memory):2/ open() is context manager which takes care of properly closing the file.The clean version of your code would then be:
yourResult[answer] can't work, the [] are expecting integer. when you do:for answer in yourResult:, answer is a list(thanks bruno desthuilliers).You should do: here, answer will be yourResult[0], then yourResult[1] etc.. 
When you use a for this way, answer is one of the elements of yourResult, not the index of such an element.To do what you want with indexes, do :In this case, you'll look inside yourResult by using indexes.If not, you can do :In this case, you loop directly at the elements inside the array, thus not needing to access them through indexes.
You don't need to use usingwill do what I expect you want. Since you have created yourResult as a list, yourResult[x] expects x to be a number from 0 to len(yourResult)-1. By doingYou are iteratively setting answer to each item in yourResult.
