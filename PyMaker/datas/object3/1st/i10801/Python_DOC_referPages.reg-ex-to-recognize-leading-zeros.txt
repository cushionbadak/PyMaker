I'm working on a program that searches all the files in my database and groups them based on what number is in the file name (from 001 to 100). The only problem is that python interprets '001' as '1', but '001' is  the exact number in the file name, and since I'm using regular expressions to search it doesn't recognize the numbers the way I want it to.Would really appreciate some help! Here's my code so far:The regex "_z.*%s_." % location would match to _z023_ if the specified location is 23, but if the specified location is 1, the program will return _z001_, _z011_, _z021_, _z031_, _z041_ ... _z091_.

Suggest that you build an index based on a flexible length number portion and use this to lookup the appropriate file. E.g.:
