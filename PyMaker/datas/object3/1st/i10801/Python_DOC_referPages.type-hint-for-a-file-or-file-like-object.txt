Is there any correct type hint to use for a file or file-like object in Python? For example, how would I type-hint the return value of this function?
Use either the typing.TextIO or typing.BinaryIO types, for files opened in text mode or binary mode respectively.From the docs:class typing.ioWrapper namespace for I/O stream types.This defines the generic type IO[AnyStr] and aliases TextIO and BinaryIO for respectively IO[str] and IO[bytes]. These representing the types of I/O streams such as returned by open().
