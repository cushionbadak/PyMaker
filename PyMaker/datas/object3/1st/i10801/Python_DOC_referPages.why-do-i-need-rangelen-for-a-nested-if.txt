This works as is but when I didn't have range(len..)) in and do  for i in arr and for j in arr, I get IndexError: list index out of range on the if statement. Why is this?
If you analyze what is going on with your code in the failing form, you have:Using the for i in arr form is returning an iterator that is handling the index information for you you, so your "i" is set to the values in your array.When you get to this line:    if (arr[j] == arr[i]):you end up with the variable substitution of arr[45]Your index of the array only goes to 10, so, you have the error thrown.
When you're iterating over a list, you get its elements. Since you're then accessing list elements at the index of that element, it won't work when it's out of bounds (and wouldn't do what you expected anyways).Instead, just use the items you're provided by the loop:
