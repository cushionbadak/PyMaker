I have a script which is really buggy and every couple of hours it stops due to an error. I don't code in Python but I know the basics so I would like to know how can I make a script that check another script for errors and if it's true just re-run it?Sorry for not giving any examples but I think you get the idea and because I'm not good at Python doing this is easier than trying to understand the script and edit it. Any help is greatly appreciated.
By far the simplest way is to just wait for it to exit and always restart it when it crashes; the following bash loop will do nothing while the program is running, and will restart it as soon as it exits:And that's it. It'll run forever, until you kill the bash script that's running it.PS. Of course this assumes you are on OS X or Linux; if you're on Windows, use an equivalent batch or PowerShell script.
You can create a daemon for the script.Basically keep the main functionality in a loop that will run forever.import loggingimport timeif __name__ == '__main__':    while True:        //log errors        logging.basicConfig(filename='log_file.log', level=logging.DEBUG)        // use try except to handle exceptions        try:            // your code statements and function calls        except Exception as e:            // log the error for debugging            logging.error(str(e))        // sleep the program if you want it to for desired amount of time.        time.sleep(delay)The level of logging I set is debug. You can set it to any other of your own choice.
