I have just started out with Python, and am using Idle.I put in:And got this in the console:Notice the spaces around the name "Chase". I can't figure out how to get rid of these spaces. I looked up this question, and went to this page. I could not understand what the answer meant, so I need some help with it.(Please note that I have already set the variable.)
By default, the Python print function uses a separation set to a single space when printing arguments; you can easily override this by defining sep='' (i.e empty space):Which will now print:For Python 2.x you could either use from __future__ import print_function and if that doesn't suit you for some undisclosed reason, use join to explicitly join on the empty string:or, use .format as the other answer suggests:
Another option using string concatenation:You could also do the following using string formatting
What you're trying to do is concatenate strings which isn't exactly what commas in the print statement do. Instead, concatenation can be achieved several ways, the most common of which is to use the + operator.or you can concatenate into a variable and print that. This is especially useful if you're concatenating lots of different strings or you want to reuse the string several times.or you can use string formatting. This has the benefit of usually looking cleaner and allowing special variable types such as decimals or currency to be formatted correctly.Note that in Python 2, the print statement does not require brackets around the string. In Python 3 they are required.
