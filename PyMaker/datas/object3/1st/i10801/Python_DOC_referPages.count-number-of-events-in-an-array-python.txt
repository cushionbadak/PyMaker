I have the following array:Each time I have a '1' or a series of them(consecutive), this is one event. I need to get, in Python, how many events my array has. So in this case we will have 5 events (that is 5 times 1 or sequences of it appears). I need to count such events in order to to get:Thanks
You could use itertools.groupby (it does exactly what you want - groups consecutive elements) and count all groups which starts with 1:what if I wanted to add a condition that an event is given as long as  there are is 2 or more '0's in between.This could be done using groupby and custom key function:The idea is pretty simple - when a 0 goes after a group of 1's, it could be a part of the group and therefore should be included in that group. The next event either continues the group (if the event is 1) or splits it (if the event is 0)Note, that presented approach will work only when you need to count a number of events, since it splits [1, 1, 0, 0] as [[1, 1, 0], [0]].
Math way (be careful with an empty array):I like to think this is efficient :)
Try this
One more:
This function iterates over the list from the left side and every time it encounters a 1 immediately after a 0, it increments the counter. In other words, it adds 1 to the total count at the start of each event.
Me being a simpleton ;-)
To replace multiple occurrence with single occurrence, append each item in a list if only the last appended item is not equal to the current one, and do the count.
