I am creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The game has a main menu which I need to be able to return to from each sub menu. I've tried a few different method I could think of as well as looked here and elsewhere online to determine a method of solving my problem.I want the user to be able to select an option from the main menu, go to the selected sub menu, then be prompted with an option to return to the main menu. For example, Select the rules sub menu, then return to the main menu. Or, select to play a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors, then select to play again or return back to the main menu.Currently my only test is within the onePlayer() module. The idea behing my code is to ask the user if they want to continue playing. If they don't then I want the program to bring them back to the main menu.
You are using player variable for two works, instead of that you can use another variable to just check the condition and another to take user input.Also you can check the condition like : if again in ["yes","y"]
Do a try and except command. If they say no your code should be quit(). If they say yes put a continue command and it will restart the whole thing.
put your main method in a while (True): loop, and if option 4 is called, use break like this: add an indent to and rather than calling main() just set player = True also, your Weapon array has not been defined. easy fix, just add WEAPON = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"] to the beginning of your onePlayer(): method. I can see another problem, changeto one last thing, don't forget your imports! (put it at the top of your code.)BTW, the break statement just tells python to leave whatever for loop or while loop it's in.
