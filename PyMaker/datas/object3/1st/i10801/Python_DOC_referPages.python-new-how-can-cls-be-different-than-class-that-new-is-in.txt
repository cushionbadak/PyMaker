Documentation for object.__new__(cls[, ...]) says:Called to create a new instance of class cls. __ new __ is a static  method (special-cased so you need not declare it as such) that takes  the class of which an instance was requested as its first argument.So if you have var = MyClass() andWon't cls ALWAYS be equal to MyClass ?
Try this:We get:By the way, this is fine in Python 3, but will not work in Python 2.  In Python 2 __new__ is only supported in "new-style" classes:In Python 3 all classes are "new-style".
