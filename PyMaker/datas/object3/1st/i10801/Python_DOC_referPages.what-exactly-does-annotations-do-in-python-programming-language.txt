This question already has an answer here:What are Type hints in Python 3.5                    3 answers                I am completely confused about the use of annotation in python...In python documentation it says that Function annotations are completely optional metadata information....you can refer to https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.htmland if it is completely optional then why are we having this in python?
In the PEP 3107 related to these annotations, you can read:The only way that annotations take on meaning is when they are interpreted by third-party libraries. These annotation consumers can do anything they want with a function's annotations.You can use it for documentation purposes, linting, validation... But nothing in the standard library use it.
Functions annotations can be truly great when using a library, it helps you knowing the type of the parameters you need to send without having to crawl into tons of documentation sheets.
