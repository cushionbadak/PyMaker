Natural Text
I have a document of patents that is a concatenated string of xml files in one text document.  I'm looking to split it up into separate documents each a single xml file.  My code works but I need to speed it up.  My code is like this: The one optimization I can think of to speed it up is the if statement.  It checks if the line contains the xml header: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>.  It probably would be significantly faster if I could check that the line was <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> instead of just containing it.  But when I write  if line == '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>': it doesn't pick up the line.  Do I need to include a \n at the end or something?  Are there any other optimizations you can think of to speed this process up?  thanks,Cameron
instead of checking each line, you might want to load the whole file content and perform the python regex pattern matcher. This way you will reduce the steps to check and get all the matches just by calling method findall().Here is the doc link - https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
