I have the below regex (from this link: get python dictionary from string containing key value pairs)Here is the explanation:My question is that when my string has the word with the "-" in between, for example: movie-night, the above regex is not working and I think it is due to the b(\w+). How can I change this regex to work with word including the "-"? I have tried b(\w+-) but it does not work. Thanks for your help in advance. 
You could try something such as this:Note the [\w\-]+, which allows matching both a word character and a dash.For readability in the future, you may also want to investigate re.X/re.VERBOSE, which can make regex more readable.
