or better, if you do not want to create the dictionary every time you call the function,
if that is all the values-result that you are going to handle, then a dictionary is what you needif you want to make a function of it is a simple asor some other variation likeor anyway if that is all you need, I would use the dictionary directly rather that making a function that do the same in a more limiting way.You can also do a simple linear search in the list, but this lose in the speed that a dictionary offer
