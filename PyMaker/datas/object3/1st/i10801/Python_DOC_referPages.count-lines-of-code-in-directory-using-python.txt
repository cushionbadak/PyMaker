Natural Text
I have a project whose lines of code I want to count. Is it possible to count all the lines of code in the file directory containing the project by using Python?
Here's a function I wrote to count all lines of code in a python package and print an informative output. It will count all lines in all .py To use it, just pass the directory you'd like to start in. For example, to count the lines of code in some package foo:Which would output something like:
To count all the lines of code in the files in a directory, call the "countIn" function, passing the directory as a parameter.
This is derived from Daniel's answer (though refactored enough that this won't be obvious). That one doesn't recurse through subdirectories, which is the behavior I wanted.
