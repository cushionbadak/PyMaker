I'm trying to store an exception error to json. Even though I'm pretty sure I'm storing a string, it's still giving me a typeerror. Relevant section of code: Traceback:This is quite baffling to me. I'd appreciate any help with this matter.
You are looking for json.dumps(), not json.loads(). Try this:json.dumps(obj): Serialize obj to a JSON formatted strjson.loads(s): Deserialize s (a str instance containing a JSON document) to a Python object
