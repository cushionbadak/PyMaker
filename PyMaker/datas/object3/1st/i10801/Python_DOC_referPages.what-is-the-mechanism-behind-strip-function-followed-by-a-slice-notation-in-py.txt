For exampleOutput:Here strip( ) is a function object. So it should either take parameters or be followed by another object using dot notation. But how is it possible that the function is simply followed by slice notation ? How does strip( ) and slicing work together here ? what is the syntax rule supporting this format ? 
Python executes _result = sentence.strip()[:4] as several separate steps:so [:4] is just more syntax, just like a () call, that can be applied to the outcome of another expression.There is nothing special about the str.strip() call here, it just returns another string, the stripped version of the value of sentence. The method works fine without passing in any arguments; from the documentation for that method:If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace.so there is no requirement here to pass in arguments.In this specific example, sentence.strip() returns the exact same string, as there is no leading or trailing whitespace in "hello world":so the output of sentence.strip()[:4] is exactly the same as for sentence[:4]:You appear to have missed the call there, as you appear to be confused by the output of just the attribute lookup; sentence.strip (no call), produces a built-in method object:
