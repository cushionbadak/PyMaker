I am trying to convert my current projects from python 2.7 to 3.5. One of the first tasks is configuration of logging. I use a configuration file for flexibility and the date is part of the file name.Below is the code for setting up the file handler that works fine in 2.7In 3.5 the following error occurs:configparser.InterpolationSyntaxError: '%' must be followed by '%' or '(', found: '%Y%m%d%H%M%S")+\'.log\', \'a\')'Has anyone experience with this? Is there a better way to format the date within the configuration file?
similar subject as this post:Configparser and string with %I think you may need the substitution for %
