This question already has an answer here:Unit Test Problem with assertRaises                    2 answers                This code does not work as expected. I'm getting pass when expecting fail; and fail when expecting pass for assertRaises(). test_db.py:In this example the code passes the unit test even though the exception was not raised. If #raise is uncommented, the exception is just passed to command line and the test fails when it should pass.Executing test using: python -m test_db or python test_db.py
You're calling the method self.close_database, when you should just be passing a reference to it. Remove the parentheses e.g.Check out the docs for more details.
Remove the parentheses after self.close_database:You are calling self.close_database which means its result (None) gets passed to assertRaises. See the documentation for assertRaises.
