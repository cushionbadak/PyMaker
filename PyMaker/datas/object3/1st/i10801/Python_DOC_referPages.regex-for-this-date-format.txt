I'm trying to find a regex that will match dates in the following format: 3-Jul-16 or 30-Jun-16I have tried this regex at first:But it matches also dates like 947-UfO-104, and this is not something I want.First, I got the month:Now, the year is fine, because it could be anything numerical.For the day part, I have tried:Now, my problem is that when given something like that: 73-Jul-2015It matches: 3-Jul-2015I tried making sure that the date is followed by a non-digit char like that:But then, when the date is at the beggining of the string, it didn't catch it (because it's not followed by any char).So my question is, is there a regex part that says "An non-numerical char or empty string"?
Split the task into 3 parts. First, a number in the range of 1-31 (tutorial), then a list of possible values for the month, and then two numbers.Regex101 Demo
