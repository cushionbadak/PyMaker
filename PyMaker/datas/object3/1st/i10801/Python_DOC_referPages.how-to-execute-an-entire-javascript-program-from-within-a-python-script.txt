So I am currently working on a project that involves the google maps API. In order to display data on this, the file needs to be in a geojson format. So far in order to accomplish this, I have been using two programs, 1 in javascript that converts a .json to a CSV, and another that converts a CSV to a geojson file, which can then be dropped on the map. However, I need to make both processes seamless, therefore I am trying to write a python script that checks the format of the file, and then converts it using the above programs and outputs the file. I tried to use many javascript to python converters to convert the javascript file to a python file, and even though the files were converted, I kept getting multiple errors for the past week that show the converted program not working at all and have not been able to find a way around it. I have only seen articles that discuss how to call a javascript function from within a python script, which I understand, but this program has a lot of functions and therefore I was wondering how to call the entire javascript program from within python and pass it the filename in order to achieve the end result. Any help is greatly appreciated.
While this is not exactly what you are asking for, propably using json and geojson is easier. (If you dont want to use nodejs or the like)
I was able to write a conversion script, and it's working now, thanks!
