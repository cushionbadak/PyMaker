(I already upvoted @donkopotamus' answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38558696/42346)Using this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19527596/42346 we can see how you can convert your local time to GMT. This requires pytz.Result:
What is happening here:time.strptime produces a time.struct_time which closely mirrors C's tm struct;The documentation of time.mktime is then fairly clear that it produces a local time from a struct_time, not a GMT time.So instead you need a function that converts your struct_time into a GMT time.  Such a function is hidden away a bit in python, in the calendar module.Try instead:In this case we end up with:Plugging that into the website you've given produces that this is GMT: Tue, 09 Mar 1999 13:44:17 GMT
