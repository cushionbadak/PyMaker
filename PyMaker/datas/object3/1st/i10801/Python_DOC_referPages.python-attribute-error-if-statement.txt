I have been working on this code for about a day now. A few hours on just this one part it keeps saying I have an attribute error on line 26. Unfortunately that is all the information I have. I have tried countless different ways to fix it and have searched many websites/forums. I appreciate any help. Here is the code:
The problem is that monthdays does not have a get() method, and that is because monthdays is a set, not a dict as you probably expect.Looking at your code it seems that a list or tuple would be appropriate for monthdays. A set is not useful because it is not ordered and can not include duplicates:and then:Your code suggests that you eventually will want to handle years. In that case you should look at the calendar module. It provides function monthrange() that gives the number of days for a given year and month, and it handles leap years.
set objects ('monthdays' in your case) don't have attribute 'get'you should iterate over it or convert it to list, e.g.:list(monthdays)[0] will return the first item of the resulting list
