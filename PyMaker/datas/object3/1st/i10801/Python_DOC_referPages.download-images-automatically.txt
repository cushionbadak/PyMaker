I have written this piece of python code which downloads a number of images from a repository of images and saves them in specified folder. The code looks like this: For some reason the images are replaced and I do NOT see all images. I keep seeing one image 1.jpg and all the images seem to replaced, though I expect the name of the images to go 1.jpg, 2.jpg , ... .I also see this warning/error but I am not sure if it is relevant to this problem or not. Where do you think the problem lies? Note that I am incrementing the image number: 
You have everything in one try/except block. Assuming cv2.imwrite fails but all the other lines are executed without any problems, your code will never reach picnum = picnum + 1.Try rearranging your code where you first increase picnum and check which lines actually gives you the error.
