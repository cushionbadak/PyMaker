My code is like this:Seems like the regex [.\n] does not work, but (.|\n) does. Why? And how to write a RegExp when using brackets in this situation?
Instead of the [.\n] that matches a newline or a literal dot character, use . with re.DOTALL or re.S enabling the . to match newline symbols, too:See the Python demoAlso, see Python re reference:[]         Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set:  ... Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters (, +, *, or ).If you do not use fullmatch but search, you can just use reg = re.compile("<contentID>1") or if "<contentID>1" in s.
