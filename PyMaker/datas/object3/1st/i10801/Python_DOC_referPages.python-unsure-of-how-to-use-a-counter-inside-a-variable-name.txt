This question already has an answer here:How do I create a variable number of variables?                    16 answers                I'm totally new to coding. And this is killing me, I feel i'm missing something super fundamental but I just can't work it out...Very simply, I am using a for loop to look at each line of a text file.If a empty line is found, I wish to update a counter.I then wish to use the counters information to be able to change variable names which will then have the particular line from the text file saved into it.SO at the end of the script, a variable name ParagraphXLineX will correspond with the appropriate paragraphs as found in the text file.But I cannot seem to understand how to use a counters information to make a variable.
It's bad practice to create variables dynamically. You should use a dict or a list instead, for example:If you insist on using variables, you can use globals():
in you code, you can use list to store the empty lines:--try--first line find all the indexes of empty linelen of empty line index list is number of empty lines you have in data
