thank you in advance for the help.I need to retrieve some data (clients and products) from a WebService. This code gets the data and transforms it into lists with dictionaries within them.Whats I need to do is to create two lists, one for costumers and one for products. Choose some specific elements for each costumer and product and create a new list that have to look like thisThen apply a function that will relate costumers with products and append the result to the list that produced that output:This returns an error: IndexError: list index out of range and using thisOnly takes the elements only from the first one of the list of lists. Any help will be appreciated.
Your loops all appear to do nothing, e.g.replaces c every time, and you only get the last value from the last time through the loop. You do the same for p and the same for param_relcp.Either:orand the same for the others.
