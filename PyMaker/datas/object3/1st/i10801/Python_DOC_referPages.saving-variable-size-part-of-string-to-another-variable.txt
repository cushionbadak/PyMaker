I am messing around with string on an imageboard, and I want to be able to grab the board name from the end of the URL. I was wondering if I could possibly use %s to save it to another variable, but I only know how to use that to assign. Here is an example of the end of the URL.I can't just say it's at position url[1], because the board could be more than 1 letter, like:I can't find an example in documentation anywhere, is there any placeholder I could put in the board that would automatically extract the board part of the url?
You can just split your string at the / characters and grab the second element of the resulting list (the first one is empty because of the leading /)You could also use regular expressions if you wanted.
