Natural Text
How do I take a string such as: K = "Hello User" and use it in the code that says it using festival tts: os.system('echo "Hello user." | festival --tts')?

If anyone can help it would nice.Thank you.The complete code is:I want to enter the text from string K to the Marked 'X' in the last line.Also I use linux-Terminal to run the code.
