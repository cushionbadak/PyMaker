I have a process (class) that I split into several steps (methods). each step can only be invoked if the previous one was successful. I created a method run() that runs the process by checking each step before invoking the next one:Is there a more elegant way (a design pattern?) to avoid these nested IF statements?Thanks a lot,
You would place your steps in a list:And then execute them in a loop:
This is an alternative if you don't have too many steps or you don't want to put your step functions in a sequence.
Think of it as failing returning False instead of passing returning True.
