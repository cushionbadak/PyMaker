I am not getting any output from logging.debug in the simplest possible situation. (I do get output from logger.warn.)The last line prints the logger's logging level, which shows as logging.DEBUG, and whether the logger is enabled for that level, which is true. yet output appears for log.warn but not for log.debug. What am I missing?[Python 3.5, OS X 10.11]
The reason is that you haven't specified a handler. On Python 3.5, an internal "handler of last resort" is used when no handler is specified by you, but that internal handler has a level of WARNING and so won't show messages of lower severity. You need to specify a handler and add it like this example:either just before or just after the setLevel statement in your snippet.
