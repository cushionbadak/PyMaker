Natural Text
I have two json files. One of them is a dictionary which is a subset of the other. json_file_1.json contains {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2, 'baz': 3}json_file_2.json contains {'foo': 100, 'bar': 200}. I want to create a final json file that has the following: {'foo': 100, 'bar': 200, 'baz': 3}Here is what I tried so far:However, when I open the final json file, it only contains "Null". When I tried debugging it, I printed out original_info and updated_info, and they were each fine. I could call original_info.update(updated_info) and that would produce a dictionary that was properly updated. However, it just isn't working for some reason when it's all put together?Any thoughts?Thanks so much!
dict.update updates a dictionary in-place and returns None. You need to dump original_infoFor reference,
