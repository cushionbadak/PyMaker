I have used scrapy for several months.Several weeks ago,I started to use file to record log information.I wrote log-to-file function as this:    Then,in each scrapy spider class,I use logger = logging_file.logging_to_file('./logs/xxx-%s' % time.strftime('%y%m%d')) in __init__ function to customize log file name.Something went wrong today,I found if I wrote two scrapy classes in one .py file,and after I started spider of the second class,the log file was also  named by the file name which is given in the first class!I think this is caused by python log rule,but I don't know how to resolve.
I'm not sure if I understand what your question is but in general you don't have to create any functions or anything to configure your logger.What you should do create a logger and assign it a FileHandler and then just use your created logger to log your info.You can put this anywhere that gets executed on program startup, like __init__.py or something.Now when you want to log something just:Official Python logging tutorial can be found here
