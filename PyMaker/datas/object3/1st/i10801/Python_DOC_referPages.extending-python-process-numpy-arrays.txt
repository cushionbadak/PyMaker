I wrote an extension for Python 3 in C++My module is capable of handling arrays like [1.0, 0.0, 0.0].I want to add support for numpy arrays as well.I process arrays with the following code:I want a function that can iterate through this: np.array([2,3,1,0])TL;DR:Numpy equivalent for:PyList_TypePyList_SizePyList_GET_ITEM or PyList_GetItem
First of all there is no numpy equivalent for:PyList_TypePyList_SizePyList_GET_ITEM or PyList_GetItemThe numpy.array implements the buffer interface, so one can write:The numpy.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0]) uses double precision:The full example:C++Python
