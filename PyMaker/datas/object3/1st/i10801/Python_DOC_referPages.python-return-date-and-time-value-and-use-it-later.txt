I have the following code, but I'm not quite sure how it's going to work.I'll execute the following:and it will return exact date and time of the moment I call this. I want to use the exact output of this date and time in another function which is going to be execute 2-3 seconds later.How can I pass the date variable here and not use the new current time and date?
Does anything stop you from passing date as a parameter to your other function ? http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htmIf you can't pass it as a parameter, and both functions are within the same object / class, you can use self.date = strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") and on your other function use self.date when you need to read it.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objectsFinally you can simply set a global variable, but depending on your project, this may cause bugs, if for example the code is multi-threaded (like a web application).Using global variables in a function other than the one that created them
