This question already has an answer here:Specifics of List Membership                    3 answers                I found a similar question here but the answers don't seem to apply to my issue.Here is my code:It keeps printing y is not in range.My goal is to check if y does not equal to 0 or if y does not equal to any item in the list.I understand that the above or should be an and, I'm specifically interested in how to check in the condition of y being contained in the list. 
You want to check that y is different from 0 AND not in the list:Using or means that one of the conditions is sufficient, so since y != 0 it returns True without going to y != list1 which would always return False because an int is not a list, you have to use in in that case.If you really want to use an or then you what you want:Rememer the De Morgan laws:
Regarding the question asked in the title, you can write something liketo check condition for every element y in the list list1.HERE a useful link.Otherwise @Bakuriu response is correct.
