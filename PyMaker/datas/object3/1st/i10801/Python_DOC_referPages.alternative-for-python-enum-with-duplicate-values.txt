I like Enum a lot and I would like to do the following:As you can see, there are duplicate values in Color class. What class alternative can I use in this case that supports iterable, name, value?
Are you asking how you can have Color.red and Color.blue without blue being an alias for red?If yes, you'll want to use the aenum1 library and it would look something like:And in use:The downside of using NoAlias is by-value lookups are disabled (you can't do Color(1)).1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
