I would like to use ginput function in python to get two points from the figure and get the closest int value and save the array. The code is shown below:When I run the code and print the x with brackets, the output is:However, if I run the code and print x without the brackets, the output shows error:I am really confused about this. What is the reason of this?
In Python 3, print() is a function, therefore it requires parentheses around its input argument like any other function.
