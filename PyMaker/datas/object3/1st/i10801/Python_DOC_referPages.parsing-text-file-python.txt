Natural Text
I have a text file with a bunch of lines which contains:I have around 50 of these little guys, and I want the script to get rid of the stuff I don't need, all I would need isand so on and so on.How would I achieve this?
I cant tell how what information you really need, but using a spreadsheet editor is probably best. All you would need to do is remove the Quote marks, then your file is in csv format and can be opened in excel or most spreadsheet editors (rename to .csv).To remove the quotes there are many options, like Find & Replace with any text editor (just enter nothing in replace).You really dont need to program anything if you only have one of these files.
