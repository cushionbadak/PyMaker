Given a real number between 0 and 1 (for example 0.2836) I want to return only the number without the dot (for example in this case from 0.2836 -> 2836 or 02836). I was trying to use python to do this but I just started and I need some help.
As long as you have a number, the following should do:If a . is not found in the string, str.replace just returns the original string.With more numbers:
The simplest way to remove an unwanted character from a strip is to call its .replace method with an empty string as the second argument:Note, this would leave any leading zeros (i.e. 0.123 using this method would result in 0123)If you know there are always, say, 4 numbers after the decimal (and in the case that there are less, you want trailing zeros), you could multiply the number by an appropriate factor first:There are other options, but this may point you in the right direction.
