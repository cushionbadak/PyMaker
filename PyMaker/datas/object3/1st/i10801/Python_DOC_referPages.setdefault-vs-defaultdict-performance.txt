I am writing code for an application where performance is important. I am wondering why defaultdict seems to be faster then setdefault.I would like to be able to use setdefault, mostly because i do not like the print output of the nested defaultdict (see implementation below).In my code, i need to test if element_id is already a key of the dict.Here are the two functions that i am testing:IPython input and output:    Why is setdefaultfunc slower. I thought the underlying code would be the same. Is there a way to improve its speed?Thanks
According to user aneroid:It would make sense that defaultdict is faster that dict.setdefault() since the former sets its default for the entire dict at creation time, whereas setdefault() does it per element when it is read. One reason to use setdefault is when the default you assign is based on the key (or something) rather than a generic default for the entire dict.
