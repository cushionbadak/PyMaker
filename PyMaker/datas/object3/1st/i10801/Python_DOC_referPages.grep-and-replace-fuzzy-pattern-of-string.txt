Natural Text
I have a few files with python code and decorators like this:The only difference between these decorators is the string 'api.module.function_name' - func name and module are different. And depending on the this param name sometimes this decorator is one-lined, some times it is two- or three-lined.I want to replace these decorators with the other one - more simple, like "@my_new_decorator".I thought about some regex but I have no idea if it's possible for such "fuzzy" search. I tried ^@trace([A-Za-z0-9]\, custom_args=False)$But it doesn't work.Is there a way to do it?
Something like this should work:See the demo
Use ^@trace\('api\.(.+)\.(.+)', info=None, custom_args=False\)$ with a multiline flag.You may want to use re.sub :See this for the demo of the regexAs you can see \1 expand to the first group in the regex (.+)
