Natural Text
I created the following program to try to work through what I believe to be a unicode issue:The print statements provide the following output when the program is run:When it comes time to write to the file, I get the following error:I have read the unicode documentation from beginning to end at https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.htmlbut have not successfully cracked the code.I can copy the string assigned to the variable s and paste it into a file, save the file, then 'more' the file. I am on a Mac, and the string shows on my screen correctly.  The Python print statement shows the string correctly.My goal of all this is to create a csv text file where the delimiter is ";".  The issue appears to be the accented second character in the location field.  The string for s contains the following fields:  Date, Location, MessageAny assistance in how to resolve the issue would be greatly appreciated.
Your error can be reproduced, even on systems that have different defaults, with something like:The issue is that your default text encoding is ascii.  Or at least that's what Python is understanding it to be.  See "encoding" under open(), and locale.getpreferredencoding().The easiest way to fix this is to tell Python to open your file with a compatible encoding.  For example UTF-8 (because your character is unicode encoded):And you should be done.
