I have noticed a strange behaviour of lpsolve library (using it in python 3.4).When I change the order of constraints which I add to the lpsolve model the results are also slightly different.Will be glad for any hints why this is happening.Adding both models to reproduce the case:If you run both models you will get slightly different results (while the objective function is almost the same):Python code to reproduce:
This could be because your model is not completely numerically stable. You probably have inputs variable who are not in the same range (eg: x1 can be -1..+1 and x2 can be -1000000..+1000000)
