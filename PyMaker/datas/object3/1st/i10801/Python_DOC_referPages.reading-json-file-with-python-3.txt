I'm using Python 3.5.2 on Windows 10 x64. The JSON file I'm reading is this which is a JSON array containing 2 more arrays.I'm trying to parse this JSON file using the json module. As described in the docs the JSON file must be compliant to RFC 7159. I checked my file here and it tells me it's perfectly fine with the RFC 7159 format, but when trying to read it using this simple python code:I'm getting this exception:I can read this exact file perfectly fine on Javascript but I can't get Python to parse it. Is there anything wrong with my file or is any problem with the Python parser?
Based on reading over the documentation again, it appears you need to either change the third line to or remove the linesince read() causes the file's index to reach the end of the file. (I suppose, alternatively, you can reset the index of the file).
