I'm trying to write a program that would ask for a students name, a couple other numerical values, and assign them to groups, via their numerical value, to have all groups as close to equal as possible (by taking the the highest next value in the list, and assigning it to the next group and so on).However, I'd need to save their number to some variable, as well as their name, to then print out the group's list.For this I'd need a variable that changes everytime the loop goes through to add another student. I'd also need to sort these number, and then somehow call back the name they corrispond to after they've been sorted into groups, and I'm not sure how to do any of these. Is there any way for this to be done, would I have to use another language?This is the code I have so far:
I believe it would be nice to create a Student class that holds all variables associated with a student. Then you could add each student to a list which you could sort by the values you want and divide to how many groups you want.
