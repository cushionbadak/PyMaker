I'm trying to parse / scrape some data from an FTP site. Specifically: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA_000513335.1_PCAMFM013_20131106 Eventually I would like to be able to have a Python script that will download all the files from this site. But first, i'm trying to learn how to get all the download links using BeautifulSoup4 and urllib2. (Since requests doesn't work with HTML sites?)  I inspected the elements and see they are stored in a table, however I get an attribute error for findAll when i call it.  This is what my code looks like right now (still starting. I want to mess around with the table data):  Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? Am i approaching this incorrectly? Any help would be appreciated.  
The HTML table is not sent by the FTP server. Only the browser will  generate the HTML based on the directory listing returned by the FTP server. This means you can not use BeautifulSoup to parse it. Instead look into ftplib for interacting with FTP servers.
