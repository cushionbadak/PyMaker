Currently I am using pySerial and its list_ports.comports() function to poll for changes of the currently available serial ports of devices with a certain vid/pid. I'd like to know if there is a way to avoid polling and get notified of a port change instead?
Probably you have to deal with some of C/C++ code, integrated with Python: https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html. I'm afraid, such low-level functions are almost impossible in hi-level programming language like Python.Also look here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19152327/1828296
