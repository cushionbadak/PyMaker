let's say i have something similar to:Is there way to specify how many threads can run in parallel? in the above case, all 1000 will run in parallel
This can be done using multiprocessing.dummy which provides a threaded version of the multiprocessing api.In python 3, concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor usually provides a nicer interface.
