I have a while loop that fills a list of objects ,and another loop that fills a dictionary associating Var1:Account2. But, I need to get that dictionary's value into each object, if the key matches the object's Account1.So basically, I have:I've tried this:But, it's not working, and I suspect it's my first "if" statement, because listOfSpreadsheetRowObjects is just a list of those objects. How would I access account1 of each object, so I can match them as needed? Eventually, I should have three objects with the following information:SpreadsheetRowself.Account1=Account1self.Account2=(v from my dictionary, if account1 matches the key in my dictionary)
You can use a generator expression within any() to check if any account1 attribute of those objects is equal with k:
You can try to use the next function like this:
If you have a dictionary d and want to get the value associated to the key x then you look up that value like this:So if your dictionary is called dict_of_account1_to_account2 and the key is self.Account1 and you want to set that value to self.Account2 then you would do:The whole point of using a dictionary is that you don't have to iterate through the entire thing to look things up.Otherwise if you are doing this initialization of .Account2 after creating all the SpreadsheetRow objects then using self doesn't make sense, you would need to iterate through each SpreadsheetRow item and do the assignment for each one, something like this:But again, you don't have to iterate over the dictionary to make the assignment, just look up row.Account1 from the dict:
