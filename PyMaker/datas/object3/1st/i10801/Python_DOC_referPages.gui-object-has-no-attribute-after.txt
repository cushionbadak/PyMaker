I took my working tkinter code (which only drew window/buttons and so on) and tried to add some code from the approved answer here: python code for serial data to print on window.The approved answer works by itself with very small modifications, but added to my code I get the error "'Gui' object has no attribute 'after'"What I don't understand is why the attribute "after" is looked for in class Gui instead of in method process_serial.
The culprit is in this line in the process_serial function:The self variable that is in here refers to the Gui object, not to a tkinter object that has the 'after' function.There is a mismatch between your code and the code from the linked question. Your class does not extend a tkinter object. The class in the answer extended the tkinter Tk object like so:Thereby inheriting functions from the Tk class.To solve this for your code, replace self in the process_serial function with a tkinter object, like self.textArea.Alternatively, you could subclass tk.Tk just like in the linked answer. But I do not see the added benefit here.
The the method after was a inherited from Tkinter.Tk. Check mentioned questionYou probably should subclass Tkinter.Tk
