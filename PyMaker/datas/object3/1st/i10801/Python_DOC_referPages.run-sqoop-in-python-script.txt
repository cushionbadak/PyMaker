I'm trying to run sqoop command inside Python script. I had no problem to do that trough shell command, but when I'm trying to execute python stript: I got an error, Invalid syntax, how to solve it ? 
The build in exec statement that you're using is for interpreting python code inside a python program.What you want is to execute an external (shell) command. For that you could use call from the subprocess modulehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
You need to skip " on --query param
You can use:Invalid syntax error noted that you haven't backslashed \"queryname\"
