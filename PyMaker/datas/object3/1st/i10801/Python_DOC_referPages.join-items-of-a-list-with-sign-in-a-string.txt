I would like my output to be :Yet my actual output is :I'm using join as it's the only type I know. Why are the plus signs printed around the items and why are they surrounding blank spaces?How should I print the list's values into a string for the user to read ?Thank you. Here's my code :
Change each individual int element in the list to a str inside the .join call instead by using a generator expression:In the first case, you're calling str on the whole list and not on individual elements in that list. As a result, it joins each character in the representation of the list, which looks like this:with the + sign yielding the result you're seeing.
You don't need to call str on your list. That returns the str representation of your list and the output of that is joined with '+'. You can instead use map to convert each item in your list to str, then join:You can also use the new style formatting to have a more readable output:
What you need to do is concatenate a string element with ' + ' for each element in your list. All you need from there is to have some string formatting.  Sample output:How does it work?We use what's called a list comprehension (5.1.3) (generator in this specific usage) to iterate over our list of int elements creating a list of string elements. Now we can use the string method join() to create our desired format.
