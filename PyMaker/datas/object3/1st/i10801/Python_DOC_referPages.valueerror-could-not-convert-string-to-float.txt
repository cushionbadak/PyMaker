So... I have this primitive calculator that runs fine on my cellphone, but when I try to run it on Windows 10 I get...ValueError: could not convert string to floatI don't know what the problem is, I've tried using raw_input but it doesn't work ether. Please keep in mind I'm green and am not aware of most methods for getting around a problem like this
your code only convert string that are integers like in below statementif you provide 13 as a input it will give the output as 13.0but if you provide SOMEONEE as input it will give ValueErrorAnd it is same with the case of raw_input() but the difference is that by default raw_input() takes input as a string and input() takes input as what is provided to the function
I think this is happening because in some cases 'input' contains non-numerical characters. Python is smart and when a string only contains numbers, it can be converted from string to float. When the string contains non-numerical characters, it is not possible for Python to convert it to a float.You could fix this a few ways:Find out why and when there are non-numerical characters in your input and then fix it.Check if input contains numbers only with: isdecimal()Use a try/exceptisdecimal() example:UPDATE:Two-Bit-Alchemist had some great advice in the comments, so I put it in my answer.
