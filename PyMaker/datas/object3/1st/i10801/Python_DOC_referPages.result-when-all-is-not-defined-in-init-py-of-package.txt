I am just learning and practicing python,on the way,i am reading about python packages and how to import into other modules or package at Modules ,I assume the following scenario ,I have package as ,and in no I have not definedwhat happens if i have an import statement as,Since I have already imported mkv module in first statement,what exactly happens after execution of second import statement,I didnt get the concept after reading on the mentioned link.
When you dofirst, if the package's __init__.py hasn't been run yet, it will be run. (If you've already done import whatever_package.something_specific, the package's __init__.py will have already been run.)Then, if whatever_package.__init__ does not define an __all__ list, the import will pick up all current contents of the whatever_package object*. That'll be anything defined in __init__.py and any submodules that have already been explicitly imported by any code that has executed in your program. For example, if whatever_package's __init__.py is empty, you doand no other import statements relating to whatever_package exist in your program, then the import * will pick up something_specific, but not any other submodules of whatever_package, such as other_thing.*excluding anything that begins with an underscore, as is standard for any import * with no __all__ list, whether you're importing from a package or a normal module.
