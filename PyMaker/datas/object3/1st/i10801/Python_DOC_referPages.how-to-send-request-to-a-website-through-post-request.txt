My purpose is to write a python script which returns the facebook ID when a url is given as input. I found this website which does the same thing.I want to ask:1) Is it possible that I send a POST request myself which will include the url entered by user using "urllib" library "urlopen" command? And then extract the answer from urllib.read() function?2) If not possible, how can I do this task?I have little idea about POST and HTTP. But can't figure this out.From reading the page source, the POST request is being sent this way:
Well the easiest answer would be for you to use requestsyou can install it using     the normal usage would be ( assuming you're using python 3) :    If you want to use urllib you can use this sample code found here
