The below code gives 50 as the maximum number. Please help!
There are couple of mistakes in your code : You need to remove the enclosing parentheses from the string first. You need to split on ', ' and then convert to int also.Modified code : Also, since input is already a tuple(string of a tuple), you can also do return (max(eval(input)))
split will create a list of strings - therefore you compare in alphabetical order. In alphabetical order '50' > '175'.You should convert the list to list of integers. you can use map for this task :
