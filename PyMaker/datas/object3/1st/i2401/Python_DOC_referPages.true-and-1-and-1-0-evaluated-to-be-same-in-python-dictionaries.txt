This question already has an answer here:How come I can add the boolean value False but not True in a set in Python? [duplicate]                    3 answers                Using True/False as keys - how/why does this work?                    3 answers                Why is bool a subclass of int?                    3 answers                Can anyone explain this behaviour of python dictionaries?Why does it not print all the other (key, value) pairs?Why does True, 1 and 1.0 is evaluated to be the same?
the hash of the 3 items 1, 1.0, True is the same (it equals 1). that's what python uses as the key for  dictionaries if there are no collisions. and as 1 == 1.0 == True is also True there are no collisions.here are more details about the old implementation of python dictionaries. the new implementation does things along those lines (but preserves the order).
