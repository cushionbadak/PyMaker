Natural Text
I have a Python script that is used to parse emails from large documents. This script is using all my RAM on my machine and makes it lock up to where I have to restart it. I was wondering if there is a way I can limit this or maybe even have a pause after it gets done reading one file and providing some output. Any help would be great thank you. 
I think you should try this resource module:
It seems like you are reading files with up to 8 GB into memory, using f.read(). Instead, you could try applying the regex to each line of the file, without ever having the entire file in memory.This can still take a very long time, though. Also, I did not check your regex for possible problems.
