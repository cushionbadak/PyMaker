If I input "1995y 05m 05d", then I want to make a program that prints "950505". More example: "1949y 05m 23d" --> "490523".here is my code. How do I fix it? any solutions?
Since you're basically working with date strings, you can use datetime.strptime() to parse them:
Your existing code prints the full year, where you want only two digits. Just skip the first two digits on print.That will print p starting from position 2 (the third character, since lists are counted from 0), with no end to the range, so it prints the entire string except the first two characters (19 in your sample).
Using Regex expression :
Requested regex solution:Uses findall to find all two digits before y, m and d and join to join all to required format.
this does it with out any libraries
