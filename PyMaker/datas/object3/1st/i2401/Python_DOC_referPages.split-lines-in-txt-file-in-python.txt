Natural Text
I have a .txt file:And I want to get something like ['My', 'name is', 'Richard']I triedBut it gives me ['My', 'name', 'is', 'Richard'] So how can I get it line by line?
split() splits by any whitespace. Use this:
There's an integrated function for this called readlines(). There is a tutorialspoint article about it, and it's in the python docs as wellYou would use it like so. And straight from the docs themselves, from at least Python 3.5 to 3.7, If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().
Just use instead ofsplitlines method splits a string by newline characters
