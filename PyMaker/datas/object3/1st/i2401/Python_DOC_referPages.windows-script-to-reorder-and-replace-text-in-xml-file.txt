i have found several similar questions but none quite reach my goal, im tying to edit multiple lines in an xml file. My knowledge of scripts is at best very basic so please include some details my basic brain will understandim trying to convert thisinto thisim not even sure what would work best? Can this be done with python ? batch?TIA
Python 3 is used since you mentioned Python in the summary of your question.This is using Regular Expressions to modify the XML.If the XML has a reasonable constant structure as with the example posted,then this may meet your goal.test1.xml is read and the modifications are done usinga Regular Expression pattern with re.sub().test2.xml is the XML file with the changes applied.Both files are treated as utf-8.Read the Python help file about the re module.Brief overview of Regular Expressions used.^ match start of line.\s match whitespace characters.* match 0 or more of previous pattern|character.+ match 1 or more of previous pattern|character.(.*?) capture any character as a group being not greedy.\1 is 1st group as replacement. \2 is 2nd group...re.I is insensitive flag.re.M is multiline flag so line anchors ^ and $ can be used.Suggest you read the Python help file as it is morecomprehensive for learning.
