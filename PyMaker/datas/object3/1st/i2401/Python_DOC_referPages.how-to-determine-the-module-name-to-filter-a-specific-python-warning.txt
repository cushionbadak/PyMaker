With Python one can filter specific warnings using the following command line syntax:But how can one determine the correct value for module for a particular warning?Consider the following example:Using (pipenv --python 3.6.5 install lxml==4.2.4)If one wanted to ignore only that specific import warning, how does one find the module name to use? None of the following commands appear to be correct. They all still emit the warning.
the ImportWarning warnings, in fact, is from import.c, but you need to filter with _frozen_importlib, the stacks in the warning message are incomplete and internal stacks are skipped. you could obtain this info by overridden warnings.showwarning:you could verify this by:btw ImportWarning is ignored by default.
