As you may know, implementing a __getitem__ method makes a class iterable:However, this doesn't hold true for regex match objects:It's worth noting that this exception isn't thrown in the __iter__ method, because that method isn't even implemented:So, how is it possible to implement __getitem__ without making the class iterable?
There are lies, damned lies and then there is Python documentation.Having __getitem__ for a class implemented in C is not enough for it to be iterable. That is because there are actually 2 places in the PyTypeObject where the __getitem__ can be mapped to: tp_as_sequence and tp_as_mapping. Both have a slot for __getitem__ ([1], [2]).Looking at the source of the SRE_Match, tp_as_sequence is initialized to NULL whereas tp_as_mapping is defined.The iter() built-in function, if called with one argument, will call the PyObject_GetIter, which has the following code:It first checks the tp_iter slot (obviously NULL for _SRE_Match objects); and failing that, then if PySequence_Check returns true, a new sequence iterator, else a TypeError is raised.PySequenceCheck first checks if the object is a dict or a dict subclass - and returns false in that case. Otherwise it returns the value of and since s->ob_type->tp_as_sequence was NULL for a _SRE_Match instance, 0 will be returned, and PyObject_GetIter raises TypeError: '_sre.SRE_Match' object is not iterable.
