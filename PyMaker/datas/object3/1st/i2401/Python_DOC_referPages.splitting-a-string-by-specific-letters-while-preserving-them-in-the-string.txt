Natural Text
I'm trying to split a string by specific letters(in this case:'r','g' and'b') so that I can then later append them to a list. The catch here is that I want the letters to be copied to over to the list as well.What I want:
You can use findall:OutputThe regex match:[^rgb]+? everything that is not rgb one or more timesfollowed by one of [rgb].If you need the result to be singleton lists you can do it like this:OutputAlso if the string is only composed of digits and rgb you can do it like this:The only change in the above regex is \d+?, that means match one or more digits.Output
