Natural Text
I am in a situation where I am accepting a user input, that can either be True or False or a string.I know i can just take input as string then parse it to boolean if its either true or false, but is there a better way to parse input as either string or boolean?thank you.
Technically, you can do this pretty easily.Assuming you want to accept true/false in arbitrary case, it's only marginally more complicated:This potentially runs lower() twice, so if that's a concern, you could cache that value first. Though in an argument parser I doubt it would be.Really, though, I think it's more likely you should be accepting two different arguments. Mixing types like this is a bad sign and makes it harder to end up with easily readable, debuggable code.
