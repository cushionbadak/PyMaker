Natural Text
I have a file which has the following text. I want to open the file in python, read each line and then edit the file in such a way that each line as only 40 characters. At the end of the line, I want to have a '+' sign. Save the file.Need help to write this script.file = "Starting today (September 17), a range of iPhones and iPads are set to change, courtesy iOS 12. Apple has started the rollout of the next version of its mobile operating system called iOS 12. Available as a free upgrade, iOS 12 will make your iPhones and iPads faster, more secure and add a slew of new features including Memphis, Siri shortcuts and grouped notifications. Wonder if your iPhone and iPad is compatible with the all-new iOS 12? Here's the complete list of devices compatible with the new Apple OS."
This is one way:It uses Python's textwrap module to "wrap" the text into maximum of 40 character lines, if you actually want to split words or whatever else it has those abilities too.This will enforce a strict 40 character limit:
file[:40] will give you first 40 charsalso check out https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/string.html for more info
