I have a script in which I'm having difficulty testing for a new line character coming from stdout of a remote command.The result of OUT is ['\n'] if a directory is deleted.  No matter what I try I can't get it to recognize ['\n'] in the if statement.
Right now you are checking if the list ['\n'] (i.e. the list containing only one element, '\n') is contained in OUTreadlines() returns a list of strings. It will never return a list which contains lists, so ['\n'] in OUT shouldn't ever evaluate to true. You likely want to either doif OUT == ['\n']:ORif '\n' in OUT:
