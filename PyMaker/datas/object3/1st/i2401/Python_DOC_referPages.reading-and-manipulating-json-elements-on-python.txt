I'm a python newbie and I need to read and manipulate elements from a json file, but I keep getting errors and I have no idea how to move forward. This is my code: An example of the dataset:When I try to get only id or name, I get this error:TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) in ()----> 1 city = d['city']TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strThen I tried this:TypeError Traceback (most recent call last) in ()  ----> 1 city = d[:]['city']TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strAny ideas? Thanks!
You more likely don't want to know the array index of the element you are looking for.With some pythonic flavor, you can create tuples with a list comprehension like this:The output would beThen, you have the possibility to get only specific items in your tuples if needed.Ex:which would return id and name for every entry that contain 's' in the city property.
As this is a dictionary within a list you must provide a list index before calling value by the key. This should work:Or you can simply use:
You can write a loop to go through each objectOr you can try using thisOr if you only need the first value then  Output'Paris'Since your data is a list of dictionaries, you'll have to use the index value to get the data in the dictionary
