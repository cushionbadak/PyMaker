I am new to python and trying below code. All I need is if one of the argarse value is true, get another value. All I am looking is if user-count is true then code should be prompt for --user_count.  Thanks much. 
I've updated the conditional statement. I guess this is what you wanted to do.
Well.. found a workaround as below. But still would be great to know if there is a option as asked in original question
