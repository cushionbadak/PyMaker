I want to dynamically add arguments to a function run_func that calls another function.If I do not copy the __closure__ object from run_func to modified_func, Python crashes as soon as I try to call modified_func.If I try to copy the old closure object to the modified function, it does not fit: "#ValueError: run_func requires closure of length 0, not 1"How can I do the modification properly so the modified function does not crash?
The easiest way to add parameters to a function is to replace it with another function that accepts *args and/or **kwargs. You can then also assign a fake Signature to the new function's __signature__ attribute in order to get a nice output from the help function.Code:Function and class reference:inspect.signature is used to obtain the wrapped function's signatureinspect.Parameter instances are created to alter the obtained signatureSignature.bind is used to match the received *args and **kwargs to the function's parameters
