Hey, I contacted the company multiple times and after some weird conversations I got some code that let me read and decode the data. Thank you everyone for your help!I connected a PCB to my Raspberry PI that should output temperature, humidity, pressure and air quality. I receive the data via serial. I wrote a Python script that read on the serial and outputs the data.And the data looks like this (multiple sample data):So that should be multiple byte-arrays. Sadly there is no documentation so I can't find anything how to decode this. If I try to decode the data:I get the following error:So maybe the data is not utf-8? Ignoring the errors does not help. Does someone know how to proper decode the data? That would help me a lot!Thanks!
This looks like raw binary data (not human readable in any of the common encodings I tried). You'll need to look up the structure of bytes and likely use the struct library to convert to regular python objects. If there is no documentation you'll have to reverse engineer it. Each bytearray is 20 bytes long, and the first four bytes are all the same, so my gut assumption is that the first four bytes (32 bits) are a header, followed by your four values as 32 bit floats or ints. If that is the case you could decode each array with something like:The examples you provided suggested the simple case of all 4 byte numbers probably isn't the case (none of those numbers make sense for weather readings), but it may be a mixture of various length numbers to account for the various sensors having differing levels of precision.
