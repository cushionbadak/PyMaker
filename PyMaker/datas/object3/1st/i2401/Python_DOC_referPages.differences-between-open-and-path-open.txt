Regarding the pathlib module in the standard library, is the path.open() method is just a "wrapper" for built-in open() function?
If you read the source code of pathlib.Path.open you'll find that it simply does:and according to io's documentation:io.open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)This is an alias for the builtin open() function.So you are correct that pathlib.Path.open is just a wrapper for the built-in open function.
