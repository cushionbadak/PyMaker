Hi guys I just want to know if there's a way to iterate over a tuple that behaves like zip.For example:What I knew now is that it can't be zip-ed:I am trying to pass zipper into a function, I also hope to pass the tuple or a single set of zip.
With a loop of for x, y in tupl: you are expecting tupl to be a sequence of tuples, rather than a tuple.If you want your loop to process only one tuple you should assign tupl with [(3, 2)] instead of (3, 2).
Parenthesis are missing.When passing a tuple to function, it needs to be wrapped by parenthesis.In your case,Otherwise, zip will sees 3 and 2 as two positional arguments.
