I have the following code in two modules.Module "main":Module "B":If I run this code I get:Why is variable "a" not set to "1" ?If I activate the commented line of code in Module "main" ( api_a() ) the variable "a" will be set to "1". Why is the variable not set when the function api_a() is called via the thread?In the example code I skipped the use of locks to make the code thread-safe.Any ideas?Thanks a lot in advance,Thomas
Such behavior occurs, because you passed main.py as the argument to python (python main.py).When you execute a script in such way, python interprets main module as __main__, but b module still updates main.a variable instead of __main__.a, because b has re-imported your main.py module as main.So to make it work, we can either update __main__.a in api_a function from perspective of b module OR print main.a variable instead of __main__.a from perspective of __main__ module. or __main__ docs
