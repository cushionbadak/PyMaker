When I input a command such as "dir" through my python program it prints out what it should except that instead of being neat and organised, its all a continuous line and spammed with either \r or \n . Does anyone know the solution for that?Client:Btw, I get the input from another program remotely.Thanks in advance.Here is the Server.At the end, its printing the result from the previous one.
Ok so I found out a simple solution though not the most effective way.I replaced toThen, I encoded it like so:And on the recieving program, I decoded the result with no problem.
I assume that your output also starts with b. According to the Python documentation, the return value of subprocess.check_output is also a byte sequence that you will need to decode.As an example, check out this fiddle.The codewill outputwith the sequence ending in \n rather than \r\n because repl.it is probably running on a *nix machine. If the fiddle is changed tothen it will outputIn your case, you should change the return value of execute_sys_command.I did not notice this until reading your code a few more times, but I think thatwas meant to decode the result rather than the command.Note that because you are running on a Windows machine, the encoding may not be utf-8 but rather cp1252 or iso-8859-1.I am almost certain this is the case. Looking at the ISO-8859-1 code page (of which Windows-1252 is a superset), 0xa3 corresponds to the pound sterling sign.The line above will result in your error, UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa3 in position 0: invalid start byte.The line above will result in Â£.
