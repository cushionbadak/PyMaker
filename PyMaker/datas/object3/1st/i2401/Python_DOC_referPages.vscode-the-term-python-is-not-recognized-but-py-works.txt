I just installed python on VS Code and I can't run any python code using python command.python command:It seems to use the python command by default and it does not recognize it.When I right click and choose Run Code it complains:'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch fileSame goes for manually running python main.py.When I open an elevated PowerShell and run python, it complains:py command:It doesn't try to use py command but it recognizes it. And when I manually call py main.py, it works.When I manually do >py main.py it writes my Goodbye, World!Question:How can I make it compile/run in VS Code simply by using the CodeRunner's right-click feature (Run Code)?I already have both Python folder and its Scripts folder in PATH.I'm using VS Code 1.27.2 and I have installed python 3.7.0 on my machine and have checked its installer checkbox for adding the environment variables automatically. (PATH is ok)I also installed : ms-python.python and tht13.python and formulahendry.code-runner extensions on the VS Code.This is my main.py code:
The Windows installer for Python does not put python on your path by default (there's a checkbox during installation to add it). Make sure that you selected an interpreter that's installed by running Select Interpreter and choosing the interpreter you want (the extension will find them through the registry).
It turned out that I just had to restart my computer after I installed ms-python.python and tht13.python and formulahendry.code-runner extensions on the VS Code and added python's Scripts folder in PATH.Now both py and python commands work from anywhere like cmd or Run Code in the right click menu.
