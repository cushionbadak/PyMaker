I know this C# code:can be converted to this Python code:but what if var1 were instead a byte array as follows:Normally, I would do:but no such variable like myList exists in this case to fill that position, leaving me with [bytes(i) for i in ] which is obviously syntactically invalid.Related to Mimic C# classes in Python
bytes() is not the equivalent of a C# byte. There is no direct equivalent of a C# byte in Python; the closest would be an ordinary int. I would consider the most direct translation of that C# class to bebytes objects are immutable sequences of bytes. If you want a mutable sequence of bytes, either a bytearray or an ordinary list would be appropriate, or an array.array array. I'd probably go with the list unless I had specific reason to do otherwise, really:Note that bytearray and bytes represent sequences of unsigned bytes; their elements go from 0 to 255, not from -128 to 127. An array.array('b') would be a sequence of signed bytes.
