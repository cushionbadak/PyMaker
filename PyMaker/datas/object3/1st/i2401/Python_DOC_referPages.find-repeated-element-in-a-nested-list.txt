I have a nested list of elements:I want to create two lists of elements: one which has repeated elements and another with unique elements. But I also wanted the repetition to be maintained Uniqueness or repetition is determined by the first element of every sub list. For example: 'Name', 'Weight'. If there are two sub lists where the first element is 'Name' I consider it as repetition. Can anyone suggest an easy way to do this?
You can use a collections.Counter and comprehend the two lists based on the counts of the significant first elements:Update: split rept by "key"
You can not using list of list to do the Counter , it will return the unhashable type: 'list'So We need convert to list of tuple 
There are a variety of solutions you could use including list comprehensions and filters. You can also use sets and list to produce the unique set of elements and convert back into list as shown in the link provided by benvcThen after you get the list of unique elements, you can filter those elements from the original list to get the resulting list of duplicates (if any) See python tips on filter 
If you created a test_list that contains all of the items in employee_list you can use the built in count method and count the appearances of each employee_list[i][0] in that list if the count == 1 then we append that entire item to our unique_list
I go with the pure numpy solution (I added one more row to make it more general):Lets say that this is our data:The next step is to grab the unique rows:Now, we want to see which rows are not repeated more than once:(The answer for only once rows:)In order to get the repeated indices:The matrix of the only repeated values:
