Natural Text
I am looking for an elegant way to find the first match from a list of  prepositions in a text so that I can parse a text like "Add shoes behind the window", the result should be ["shoes","behind the window"]It works as long as there are not multiple prepositions in the text my keys behind the window before:  my keys  after:  behind the  windowmy keys under the table in the kitchen before:  my keys under  the table  after:  in the kitchen my keys in the box under the table in the kitchen before:  my  keys  after:  in the box under the table in the kitchenIn the 2nd example, the result should be ["my keys","under the table in the kitchen"]Whats an elegant way to find the first match of any of the words in the list?
You can do that using re.split:First, we create a regex that will look like (in|on|under). Note the parentheses: they will allow us to capture the strings on which we split the string in order to keep them in the output.Then, we split, allowing 1 split at most, and concatenate the last two parts: the preposition and the rest of the string.
