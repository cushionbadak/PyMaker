Python documentation suggests two ways to union sets:I've recently come across yet another one:How does it work?
In your example, set.union(set1, set2) actually calls the union method with set1 for the self argument. Therefore, it is equivalent to set1.union(set2).As an aside, Python allows union-ing of arbitrary numbers of sets according to this. Actually you can see this in the Python documentation, here. Because the union method accepts *others as an argument, you can pass in any number of sets and it will perform the union of all of them.
