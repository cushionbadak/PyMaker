How can I dynamically define the cell location. For example, suppose I have a worksheet consisting of six rows. I am able to get the rows count using Count_Row = df.shape[0] but not sure how do I reference Count_Row parameter in the below statement.Thanks

Same as DeepSpace's answer, but using f-string instead:
