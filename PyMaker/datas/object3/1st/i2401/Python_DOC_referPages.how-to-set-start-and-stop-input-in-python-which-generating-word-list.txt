I try Hard to figure out how to Input start and stop word for my Python wordlist generator.Here is my code:My generator is giving me output like this as usual: aaaaa, aaaab, aaaac,...But how set the inputs in order to take a starting point and an ending point?.My length is 5. I want to generate for example from aaac1 to aaad3.How can I achieve this? I'm completely stuck.
Very common and beginner of doing is To have output line by line replace last print statement with below codeIf you want to pass start string & ending string in random index order and if you want let code itself decide the index then you can use below codeTo get count, you can use len() functionAnd if you are trying to find out good head start with Python basics I suggest you to read https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/index.html. Its very small and can read in a single day.
