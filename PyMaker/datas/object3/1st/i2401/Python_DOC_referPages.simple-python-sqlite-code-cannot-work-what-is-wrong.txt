Natural Text
I have this simple python sqlite code to execute a simple SQL statement. I do not see a new record being added to the sqlite database after running the code. However, if I run the SQL statement manually using a sqlite tool called DB Browser, a new record is added.I am using python 3.6 and sqlite3.
You need to commit the changes.
