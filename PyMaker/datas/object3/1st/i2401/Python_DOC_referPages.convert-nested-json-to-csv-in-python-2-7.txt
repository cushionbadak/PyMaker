Have seen a lot of thread but unable to found the solution for mine. I want to convert one nested JSON to CSV in Python 2.7. The sample JSON file is as below:From the above JSON file my requirement to redirect keys {uid, name, rule-number, comments, destination, source, hits.last-date}, etc. with their values  to CSV basically.By following the below code, I was able to generate the CSV but seems that is only parsing header, nothing else. Please guide me as I am very much new to Python scripting.
You're pretty much there. You're just calling csv_output.writerow() on the list you created with [v for k, v in leaf_entries]. You should instead call csv_output.writerows().Information on these calls is available here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects
Just figured it out. The below code properly working and generating valid csv data from my complex JSON file.Thanks for your help mates.
