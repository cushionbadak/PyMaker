I am working on a bot that streams post from the Steem Blockchain (using the synchronous beem library) and sends posts that fulfil certain criteria to a Discord channel (using the asynchronous Discord.py library). This is is my (simplified) code:Before I implemented discord.py I would just call the synchronous function scan_post(post) and it worked just fine, but now with the asynchronous implementation the posts are not processed fast enough and the stream has a rapidly increasing delay. If I make scan_post(post) a synchronous function, the processing time is fine, but the Discord websocket closes (or does not even open) and the bot goes offline. How can I solve this in a simple way (without rewriting the beem library)?
I solved the problem: I run the beem stream in its own thread and the asynchronous functions in a second thread. With the janus library I can then add objects from the beam thread to a queue that is processed by the asynchronous thread.
