My question is i have inp=[1,52,234,65,87,57,96,0,3] and output should be output=[0,1,52,3,234,65,96,87,57]. if the last digit is the same you leave them in same order as they are on input.increasing.how you sort integers on last digit?
You can sort using a key function that calculates n%10:or 
The last digit of a number is the remainder of division by 10:
You can use the sorted() built in with the keyword argument key:This takes the value, converts it to a string to get the -1 index from it, then that value is able to be compared and sorted. You don't need to cast it back into an integer.
