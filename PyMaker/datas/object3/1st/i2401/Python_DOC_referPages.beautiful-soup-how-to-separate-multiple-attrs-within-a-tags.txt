I am trying to scrape a webpage to collect Image Names & their respective asset URLs and write them to a CSV in two seperate columns. I have not been able to separate attrs out of the  tags.In BS4, I am able to run:It successfully returns the below html (multiplied by the photo count on the page)I have tried running the following (and many other variations)and they returnAnyone know how to extract this data from the  tag and write to a CSV?Cheers!
Welcome to StackOverflow! You are having your requirements in two different elements i.e. aria-label in a and src in img. But luckily you have got img nested inside the a tag. So iterating will be simple. Store the names and links in a list of dictionaries and with DictWriter() you can easily write them into a csv file. Hope this helps! Cheers! 
Try the code below, it extracts the value of src attribute of <img> tag which is inside the <a> tag that has an attribute aria-label and write those links to a csv file Or you can use the csv module to write the data
Thank you everyone for the input! I still wasn't able to pull aria-label and I read on some other forums this is a BS4 issue when parsing HTML.I was, however, able to solve this quite easily using @SmashGuy solution, and pulling the alt text description versus aria-label. And to write to CSV...Thanks again for everyone's help! Cheers!
for images you need to find the <img> tag, <a> is markup for links.you found that image because as you can see, the link tag wraps  the image tag.and that's not how dictionary syntax works, use : in attrs={} (see https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#the-keyword-arguments) so it's soup.find_all('a', attrs={'css': 'value'}) instead of soup.find_all('a', attrs{"aria-label" "SomeImageName"})
