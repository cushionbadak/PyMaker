I am a beginner in Python3 and I am trying to figure out how I can solve this exercise:Define a function called myfunc that takes in an arbitrary number of arguments ans returns a list containing only those arguments that are even.I tried this:When trying to call out myfunc(1,2,3,4,5,6) it takes only the first even number:2.Why does this happen?How can I create a list that returns only the even numbers?
args is just an regular iterable. SoAt your current code, you don't get the whole list because you call return when you find the first value.
The problem is you are returning after finding the first value, so it will only return the first value. You could try something like this:OutputThe above method uses a list comprehension. An equivalent solution, albeit less pythonic, is the following:
The issue is once your function executes return thats it, so what you want to do is append all those values to a list and return that entire list    Looking forward, just to show you you can cut some bulk out of here, note that 2 % 2 = 0 right so we can say if not 2% since not 0 will evaluate to True and meet our conditions that wayAnd once you really fall in love <3
