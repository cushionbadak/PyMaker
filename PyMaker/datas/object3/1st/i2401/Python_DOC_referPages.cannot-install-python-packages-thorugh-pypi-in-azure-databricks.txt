I want to call a webservice from a Databricks Notebook through Python. The needed library for this seems to be http.client.I have already found a code snippet to test this but when i try to execute it i get the following error:ImportError: No module named http.clientThis is correct cause i have no module installed yet.In the next step i go to a folder within my Databricks, select Import -> Import Notebooks dialog click on (To import a library, such as a jar or egg, click here) -> Select in the Language DropDown Upload Python Egg or PyPI -> in pyPI name typehttp.client` and click on Install Library.Then i select Attach automatically to all clusters.I receive the following error:Error: java.lang.RuntimeException: Installation failed with message:  Collecting http.client Collecting http.client Could not find a version  that satisfies the requirement http.client (from versions: ) No  matching distribution found for http.client You are using pip version  9.0.1, however version 18.0 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
