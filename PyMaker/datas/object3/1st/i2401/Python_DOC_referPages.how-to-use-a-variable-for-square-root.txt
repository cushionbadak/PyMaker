So, I joined just to make this. How can I do the square root with a variable?Here is the code.
First of all, input() returns a string, not a number, but math.sqrt() requires its argument to be a number. So you need to do:and similar for all the other inputs (use int() instead of float() if the input should be a number without any fractional part, such as the numerator and denominator of a fraction).Then to calculate the square root, you need to call math.sqrt(), not just sqrt():Then your if statements are wrong.The is_integer() method returns True or False, but b is the number the user entered, not a truth value. If you want to tell if b is equal to the integer part of X, it should be:The elif test should just be else:, since it's just testing the opposite condition.
