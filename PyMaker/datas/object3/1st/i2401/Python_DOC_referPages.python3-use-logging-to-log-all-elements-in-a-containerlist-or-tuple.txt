In Python3, if we want to print all elements in a list, we can simply do In this way, we can print out all elements in a list. Suppose now I use logging to log everything, instead of print it out to the screen, for a debug purpose, how to log all elements in a container ( i.e list, or tuple) ?I can think of something like :but this is too ugly. Any suggestion?I also refer Howto , but did not get much input.
I have figured out. Yes, just like@Patrick Haugh said, we can just use loog.info(lst) to log all elements in the list, just works similarly to print.Thank you all!
