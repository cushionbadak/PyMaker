This question already has an answer here:Where should virtualenvs be created?                    4 answers                I'm relatively new to the world of python, so I apologize if this is a stupid question.I'm having some trouble discerning at what level I should be creating my virtual environment. Using a trivial example:
Think about it like this - Your whole project is a single environment, well because you would want it to be separated from other things in your system. Now within your environment, things(modules) must be interacting with each other and therefore each of the modules can't really be in different environments.In conclusion, the venv goes at the top
In python, modules don't work quite this way, normally is one virtualenv per project, (but is not a fixed rule).From the python documentation about modules:A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable name.
