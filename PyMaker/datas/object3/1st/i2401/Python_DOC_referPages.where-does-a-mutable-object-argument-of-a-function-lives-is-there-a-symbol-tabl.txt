Going through the python tutorial, in section 4.7.1, a mutable default argument is stored somewhere but I can't seem to find it using dir(), globals(), locals() or f.__dict__. I'm referring to this code:behaves as:I would expect to see this in the namespace of the function, say when I do dir(f) but it is not there.I had a look at this but this is way more than I'm probably looking for.
As per the Python Data Model:__defaults__  A tuple containing default argument values for those arguments that have defaults, or None if no arguments have a default valueThere is also __kwdefaults__ for keyword-only arguments.Note that things in Python are not necessarily stored anywhere accessible. For example, the reference count of an object is not available as an attribute. It only exists in the C layer of the CPython implementation and requires builtin magic to access.In fact, __defaults__ is not a "real" attribute either. It is a builtin property fetching the defaults from wherever the implementation stores them.
It's in f.__defaults__:You didn't find __defaults__ in __dict__ because it's not stored in the __dict__; it's stored in a dedicated C-level struct member, which is mapped to the __defaults__ attribute by a descriptor on the function type.
If you're using Spyder, when you type f., autocomplete options should pop up. One of them is __defaults__, which holds the defaults.
