I am using Python and reading values from properties file as shown below,My JSON isNow, I want to set device-id with the value i was getting from config file. What I tried was,But value of d1 is not substituting inside the string. Any idea what I am missing?
That isn't a concatenation: you're not appending this to anything else.  It's only a value substitution.  Thus, you should (1) use the variable name, rather than a string; (2) leave out the concatenation attempt.This should substitute the desired value of varibale d1.
