If I have two or more sets, and a string that describe de operation that must be done between them, like 'and', 'or', 'xor', it can be obviously get done like this:and so on. What if I want to do it with a dictionary?I have something like this:And also triedBut none worked. How can I achieve the same result that I get through ifs but with a dictionary?
You can use set.itersection(), set.union(), etc. as static methods, passing multiple sets to them:Alternatively, you could map operations to method names and use getattr():
You can try attrgetterCall it like: set_methods[method_string](set1)(set2).
