I am trying to create a music guessing game whereby the FULL NAME of the artist is given and the first letter of EACH WORD of the title is given. My current code (that works) is capable of handling one word for the artist and one word for the song; for example EDEN Nocturne.However, if the artist were to have two parts in their name (Ed Sheeran) my code wouldn't be able to handle this (similarly to the song name).Therefore, I wanted to use a determiner to split the artist and song so that I could print the whole Artist name and then use the try: and except: functions to be able to print the first letter of each word of the song if it is available.When I just use a space the .split() function works correctly, however when I use a word or a symbol ('DOT', '|') It no longer works.This is the code that works:The code above works for this style of Artist and Song:However, it will not work in this instance:Hence, I use a determiner as such:Look wise, it appears to work. However, it no longer thinks the answer is correct and therefore asks me to guess again:I am just confused by why this is happening because if I were to print the two variables of which need to be equal for it to be correct, they would be exactly the same. Though the program doesn't think that.In the else statement further on I put: print(guess) print(song):Thank you for reading all of this and any help is appreciated!
Your textreading looks suspicious:Doku - hidden in IOBaseIt works similar to readline() in that it:f.readline() reads a single line from the file; a newline character (\n) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesnâ€™t end in a newline.(from Dok)You are never trimming '\n' from your title, so its essentially not euqal to your input as this one has no '\n' at its end.You can use song = song.rstrip() (link) to remove whitespaces including newlines from it.For multi-word songtitles you might want to inspect the str.split([sep[, maxsplit]]) dokumentation here and use it like so:
