Please can someone share some python script that will loop through this geojson and retrieve the values under "attachment". I am struggling with these ones.Thank you
Please try this below code
The sample json you provided does not look like valid geojson to me.  You can find parsers that are not as strict, but the comma (",") at the end of the "Tag_Number" line for example should not be there, and I'd expect to find a "type" attribute defining any geometry or features.That aside, geojson adds semantic meaning for json so you can for the purposes of your task can treat it as any json parsing task in Python.If your data is in a file sample.geojson you can read from a file with the load() method:This results in geo being a regular Python Dictionary that you can inspect.  By calling geo.keys() you can find all of the keys in the data.You access any of the values as you would any Python dictionary by specifying a key: geo['extensions']. Since, the extensions is itself a dictionary you can reference it as well and loop over any of the values which happens to be a list of dictionaries.You may find ipython a useful interactive tool as you learn to work with data and data structures in Python.
