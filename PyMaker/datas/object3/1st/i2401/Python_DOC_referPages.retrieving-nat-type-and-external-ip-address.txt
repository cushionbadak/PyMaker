So far I tried using pystun, but following the manual:yields:It looks like the repository is not maintained anymore. I found ipgetter superfast for obtaining IP address, unfortunately it does not provide NAT type information. What is the alternative way to retrieve both efficiently?
It probably is a problem with python versions, the original code of pystun using 2.x and you using 3.x.Looking at the source code line where error originates, we can see that it calls the dictionaries .items() method and tries to access its members by position.Here is the problem:In python 2.x, dict.items() returns a list of tuples.In python 3.x, dict.items() returns a view, which cannot be accessed by position, only iterated over.Short answer: you cannot use the pystun repo with python 3.x; maybe some patching can be done, or you can just copy and modify the source code yourself instead of relying on the external repo.
