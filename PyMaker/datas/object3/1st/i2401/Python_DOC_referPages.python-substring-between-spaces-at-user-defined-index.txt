Natural Text
I am new to Python, have been watching videos on Youtube and trying to learn.I am trying to substring a text between two spaces from a line. Let me explain, what exactly I am trying.1) I have a text like mentioned below:CREATE TABLE DATABASENAME.TABLENAME AS SELECT ....2) Now from the above text I want to retrieve only DATABASENAME.TABLENAME3) So I want to extract text between second space and third space, ie. I want to extract text between index numbered 13 and 35, but on basis on spaces.Can anyone help? Please.
You can split the string into list of words based on spaces then get the elements by index in this case it's 2.

You can split a python string by space with string.split(). This  will break up your text into 'words', then you can simply access the 3rd word like this:For more complex patterns, you can use regex, which is a powerful string pattern finding tool.Hope this helped :)
