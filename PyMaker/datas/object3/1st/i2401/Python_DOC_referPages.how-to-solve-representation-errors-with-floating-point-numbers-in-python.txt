I need to truncate a decimal at the hundredths place without rounding.I'm using the the method:which comes back as 78.45. As it should.However, if I doit come back as 5.09, when it should be 5.10I know that this is a representation error, due to the floating-point inaccuracies in Python, but I don't know how to fix it.If anyone can either help me figure out how to fix representation errors or maybe find a better way to truncate at the hundredths place, I would really appreciate it.Thanks
