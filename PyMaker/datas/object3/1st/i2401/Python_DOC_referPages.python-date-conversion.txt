I'm using Python and I want to convert a date from the following formats:'30th Sep 2018' or 'Mon 30th Sep 2018'to the format:'2018-09-30 00:00:00'I already tried to use the strptime() and strftime() functions but I can't make this works with them. Anyone know how to accomplish this in Python?
You can use datetime.strptime and datetime.strftime for that like so:This is the output:I used the patterns as described in the documentation for datetime. I used sclicing to extract the th part of the date-string. In doing so I ensure that the functions also work for nd and st.
The simplest way to convert from 30th Sep 2018 or Mon 30th Sep 2018 to 2018-09-30 00:00:00 is using dateutil.parser, i.e.:For the opposite conversion, there's datetime.strptime, but I'm afraid it doesn't output ordinals (1st, 2nd) as you want, still, you can achieve the desired result using a small function, i.e.:
You can use strftime for change the style of date and timeGoto to http://strftime.org/For more inforamtion
