Natural Text
this sequence of symbols is required as a password in an app:9h/#13/'!O!Nr},w_T0 6!ws%N\c^i,4"How can store this to a variable/string? 
One easy way to store those characters in a string is to use Python's triple-quotes.If your sequence did not end with a double-quote, triple double-quotes could also have been used rather than the triple single-quotes above. The triple-quote way of showing a string is designed for tough cases like yours, with almost any combination of text characters allowed in the string. Executing the command print(s) gives the output that you want:
Just declare a string as usual, and escape the special characters ' and " with \. The escape makes it act like a string literal, rather than a special character.str = '9h/#13/\'!O!Nr},w_T0 6!ws%N\c^i,4\"'Output is'9h/#13/\'!O!Nr},w_T0 6!ws%N\\c^i,4"'
