My over all goal is to have an array/list of urls that don't get scraped during a website url scrape the logic as seem in the code sample below is logic for ('scrapy.py'):open url in ('source') ~> find 'a' tags from url in ('source') ~> find 'href' in 'a' tags ~> if value of 'href' is not equal to(!=) ('done') in file ('doneurls.py') ~> then write urls that aren't equal to ('done') into file ('url.py')   The code i'm using is 'scrapy.py':index.php:doneurls.py:This code seems to work and it ignores only one url that I add to doneurls.py and works well, but what i'm looking to do is to add an array of urls to done like this When I try to run 'done' as an array no urls are skipped over at all. I'm using this code to try to not have to scrape urls that I've scraped in the past. 
If I understand the problem well, you are trying to see if each URL found has been done already or not, using:Except the problem is that the above allows the check for only one done url instead of the potentially multiple urls already done. So, if done becomes a list, you can use the operator in (here you will need not in because we want to check if it's not there):As a side note, lists in Python are created using square brackets, so, done will be should similar to something like this:Braces are for sets and dictionaries, although making done a set doesn't matter too much here.
