I have this functional code:And this test code:I expect that when the test is made to fail by replacing [] with [items] in self.assertRaises(), it should throw a NameError - You have not entered any password. However, it throws a different error meaning my code has a problem. Please help
The behavior you are seeing seems correct:You call check with empty list not passwords is True and NameError is raised. That is expected behavior as far as the test is concerned and all is well.Now if you've changed the line to for instance:You would see:Because the method ran, and returned None, but the test states it expected NameError exception to be raised.As is, your test could look like this:For no args, we expect NameError to be raised. With passed argument, we expect None to be returned.Side note: NameError has a usual meanings of trying to use unknown variable. Perhaps ValueError would be more appropriate. Or you may want to define your own exception.
