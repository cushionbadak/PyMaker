I'm a beginner with python so you can think that am i asking a stupid question, but i really can't understand why mine function is removing previous data in csvfile instead of adding new in to this file. That's how it looks like:Have you guys any idea how to make program adding new data instead of replacing it?
When you open a file in write-mode (i.e. open('file.txt', 'w')), the contents are cleared before things are added. The fix to your problem would be to open the csv file in append-mode:
Use the below codewith open('employee data.csv', 'a')parameter 'a' instructs to append.
