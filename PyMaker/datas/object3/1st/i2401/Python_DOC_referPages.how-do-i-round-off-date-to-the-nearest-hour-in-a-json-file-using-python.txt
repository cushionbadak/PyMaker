I want to round off time to the nearest hour in a JSON file which has a collection of tweets with different timestamps. Example:Here I want to round off the time to 01:00:00. Could anyone help with a script which can do that in python? I tried to use this but since the timestamp changes for every tweet I'm unable to do it.Any help  is appreciated! Thanks!

You can a python library like datetime to parse dates in general.
