I'm not sure if this is possible but I have a very large array containing datesI'm trying to find if there is a way to count the frequency of the days and months in the array. In this case I'm trying to count strings for abbreviations of months or days (such as Fri,Mon, Apr, Jul) 
You can use Counter() from the collections module.The if prints only those keys from the counter that are pure "letters" - not digits:Day-names and Month-names are the only pure isalpha() parts of your dates.Full c output:Improvement by @AzatIbrakov comment:would weed out non-alpha words in the generation step already.
Python has a built in .count method which is very useful here:  Output:What happens is we take all the items of the lista and join them into one string. Then we split that string to get all the individual words.Now we can use the count method and create a dictionary to hold the counts.  We can create a list of items we want to retrieve from the dicionary and only retrieve those keys
