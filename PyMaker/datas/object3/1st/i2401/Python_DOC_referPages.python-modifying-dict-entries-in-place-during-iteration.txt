I know that in the general case, itâ€™s unsafe to mutate a dict while iterating over it:This yields a RuntimeError as expected. However, while reading the documentation for dict, I found the following (emphasis mine):Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may raise a RuntimeError or fail to iterate over all entries.So I tried the following code:Note: I did not add or remove any entries during the iteration; I only updated existing entries. I've tried it with a few examples and so far have not received a RuntimeError, and the loop works as expected.Is this guaranteed to work by the language? Or have I just been lucky so far?Note: I am using Python 3, so d.keys() returns a dynamic view rather than a list).
The internal structure of the dictionary is determined by the keys, and not the values. At least currently. This means that you can modify the value associated with a key, but adding or removing keys (which the first example's d[k + 1] = d[k] + 1 does) will cause problems.
