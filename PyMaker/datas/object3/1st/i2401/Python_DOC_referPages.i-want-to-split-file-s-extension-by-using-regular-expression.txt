Natural Text
item is a string like "./test/test1.csv" .I want to change item into "test1".I wrote code,But,"1.csv" is item.I really cannot understand why such a thing happens.What should I do to do my ideal thing?
As a regex, './*.csv' does not mean what you think it does. A . means "any char" and a * means "zero or more of what came before", Thus, it's not "dot, slash, any string, dot, csv", but "any char, some slashes, any char csv".If you really want to use a regex, you could try, e.g., this (among many other variants):Or just use str.split and rsplit:Or, since you are handling file paths, how about os.path?
Usually you want the os.path module from the standard library for this kind of filename.In your regular expression version of this, remember that . matches any character (not just periods), x* matches any number of x's (even zero), and that re.search will return true if the pattern matches anywhere in the string: your regular expression matches whenever a filename contains the letters "csv" anywhere later than the first or second character.  A correct regular expression implementation might be(matching a slash, at least one character that is neither a period nor a slash, a period, at least one character that is not a slash, and end of string).  (IMHO os.path is more readable and maintainable.)
This will work
