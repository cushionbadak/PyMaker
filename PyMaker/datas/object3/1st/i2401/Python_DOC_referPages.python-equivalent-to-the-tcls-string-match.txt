I am looking for Python equivalent to the Tcl's string match operation. Specifically, I would like to handle correctly the special sequences (*, ?, and [chars]).For example, given three Python strings:the match operation match(expected,actual1) should return true, but match(expected,actual2) should return false.Thanks a lot!
You want the fnmatch module. While re provides full powered regular expressions, fnmatch performs the limited, shell-style globbing wildcard matching you're looking for.For a case sensitive match, it's as simple as:If you want to follow the operating system's case sensitivity rules (that is, insensitive on Windows, sensitive on most other operating systems), you'd use plain fnmatch.fnmatch to invoke automatic case normalization.
