Natural Text
I have a text file that represents a transcript. I need to find a way to split this so that I have a list of strings representing what each person said. So this;Becomes this;I am new to regular expressions but recognize that this could be the way to go. The problem is I want to iterate this over many transcripts in circumstances where the names will differ (e.g. John, Paul, George, Ringo and so on). What will be consistent is the presence of a word (representing the speaker), followed by a colon, followed by a white-space.

If by any chance the colon is not there then this regex should be preferred over the previous one.
