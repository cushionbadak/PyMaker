Hi: I would like load some 2400 images from a folder into python 3.6 for Neural Networks, the following code works, however, it loads images in its original size, which is (2443, 320, 400, 3), after converting into an array. How do I resize it to 64x96? so it is (2443, 64, 96, 3) and less of a load on memory. Separately, how do I do it using parallel processing, so it is efficient.Thank you!Inspired by this link, I tried to do the following:however, it resulted in an error, written below. Any suggestions, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
First you may want to resize your images then you can use your same method to initialize the arrays given the output image folder.Resizing the imageThis uses PIL package for resizing images but any library should do the same as long as it provides a resize method.You can read further down discussions from here  How do I resize an image using PIL and maintain its aspect ratio?Parallelism ExampleRegarding parallelism you can use this example as a base and move on from there.This is from the python docs https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html
