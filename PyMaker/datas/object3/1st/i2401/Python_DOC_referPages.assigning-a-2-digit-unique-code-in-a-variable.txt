can you please show me how to add a 2-digit unique code in every user's input.The problem scenario is, if the program takes 4 inputs from the user (input1, input2, input3, input4), the program should also assign a unique 2-digit code in every input.this is just a small part of my assignment, but if you could guide me through how to get it, it will be a great help for me. You may give me a hint if you feel don't want to give the real answer, but this one's quite important for me as once I've got this I can get through all the rest of the codes :)here's what I have done so far:I want to utilise the numbers generated by this for loop. But, they should be used once only.Asking a user input.here is the example output:Thanks very much
You can get the codes from using random.sample of 4 within range(10, 100), and save the inputs to a dict indexed by the codes:Sample input and output:
