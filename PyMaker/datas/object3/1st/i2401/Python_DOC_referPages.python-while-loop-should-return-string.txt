Again I'm somewhat stuck with a task. This time my while loop should return a string of comma separated numbers. I do get the comma separated numbers out when I print them but the whole thing should be inside a string, and that's where I fail.The code I use:This produce: 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, and not "7, 10, 13, 16, 19,"I don't think I should hard code it in... Any pointers on this?Regards

This is actually a String. You can test this by printing the value of type:
