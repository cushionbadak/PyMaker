This question already has an answer here:'order' of unordered Python sets                    5 answers                Code: a={1,2,3} c={14,62} b=a|c print(b)Output: {1,2,3,14,62}Code: a={1,2,3} c={15,62} b=a|c print(b)Output: {1,2,3,62,15}Code: a={1,2,3} c={16,62} b=a|c print(b)Output: {16,1,2,3,62}Code: a={1,2,3} c={17,62} b=a|c print(b)Output: {1,2,3,17,62}Code: a={12} c={4} b=a|c print(b)Output: {12,43}Code: a={12} c={44} b=a|c print(b)Output: {44,12}Why is that the resultant set is ordered most of the time but not in some cases.Numbers like 15,31,63 (00001111,0001111,0011111111) are always at end and numbers like 16,32,64 (00010000,00100000,01000000) are at first position. Explain please.
That's not bitwise OR even if it looks alike. That's set.union().Also, the order of elements in a set has no guarantee. You may not expect any order unless you convert it to a list and sort it.See Python 3 documentation on set.union().
