I try to find out the Characteristic Polynomial and Eigen values using sympy. But when I print the results in Jupyter notebook all the fractions in the coefficients of the polynomials have been evaluated as float(e.g-0.5x**2+1) but I want $(1/2)x^2+1$). Is there anything to solve this problem. Thank you.My CodeOutput.
these are the relevant chageswhich yieldthe point is that 1/3 is immediately converted to the float 0.3333... the way to avoid that is to use fractions.Fraction or (probably better) the sympy version thereof: sympy.Rational.
