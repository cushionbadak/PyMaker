Natural Text
Could you provide me an example in python how to extract text entries using starting reference and the end reference point?  For example the file "test.txt" has content as follows:* start1231234567abcdefgxyz1234* end123I want python to search for "* start123" once found, look for end point "* end123" then any entries in between are extracted and saved into a new file "test2.txt" as is. I know it can be done in grep or awk but if you could provide me a sample in python, I could reuse that to accomplish my next step.
In this case, I'd use regex. Try using import re for text matching in general.
The easiest way is to use str.find(). This method returns the index where the substring was found or -1 if it wasn't found. I'll leave the I/O and error checking for you to implement. Thus you will have the substrings occurrences in the line and you can slice your string to get just the content between them.Just make sure to deal with the case in which the substrings aren't found.
