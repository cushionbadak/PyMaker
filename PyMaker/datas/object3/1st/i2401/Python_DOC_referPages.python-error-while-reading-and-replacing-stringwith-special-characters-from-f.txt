a.json file:following code I tried:output:"color" = 'black' AND "api" = 'demo-application-v1'"color" = 'black' AND "api" = 'demo-application-v1'graph: abcd nodesgraph: abcd nodesThis is working fine and replacing string as expected but it is not when I tried the following approachesApproach 1:Open file in a read mode,get line by line and replace string output:{"a": "b","key": "graph: \"color\" = 'black' AND \"api\" =  'demo-application-v1' node","c": "d"}Approach 2:Open file in read mode,Since the file a.json has JSON data, get json file loaded, convert json object to JSON-string and then replace it.Code:output:z: {u'a': u'b', u'c': u'd', u'key': u'graph: "color" = \'black\' AND  "api" = \'demo-application-v1\' node'}Approach 3: I assume Unicode character in JSON string might be creating a problem so converted Unicode string to normal string and then tried to replace stringcode:output:a: {'a': 'b', 'c': 'd', 'key': 'graph: "color" = \'black\' AND "api" =  \'demo-application-v1\' node'}python version:2.7.15 using byteify code from one of the SO answer.JSON file is big and cannot do the manual search and replace. There is no difference in ' and " in python still tried in above example.
While I certainly do not recommend any sort of context-unaware search & replace in a hierarchical structure like JSON, your main issue is that the string you're searching for in your JSON file has escaped quotations (literal \ characters) so you have to account for those as well if you want to do plain text search. You can use either raw strings or add the backslashes yourself, something like:Which, for your JSON, will yield:(Extra new lines added by print).
