I have a program in python 3.6 that I made to run in linux. I needed to know how much cpu, memory, etc., it consumed when it was executed (in command line), could you help me?Thank youNote: Sorry for the tags used, I was not sure which ones to put
For basic experiments you can use %timeit with the ipython interpreter. For high precision low level ones - perf. For everything in between there is an article specifically on the topic in the documentation.
For timing single lines, you can python's magic function %timeit. (You can also time multiple lines, however it would give result for complete execution and not per statement basis) However for a detailed description, you can use cProfile. You can read the description here.Sample code that might help you:[sample.py]cProfile can help you profile your program written in sample.py. Run your python file like below from your linux terminal.Output:Hope this helps you.Cheers!
