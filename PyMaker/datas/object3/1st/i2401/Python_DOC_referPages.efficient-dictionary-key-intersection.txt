This question already has an answer here:Intersecting two dictionaries in Python                    8 answers                Say, for example, we have the following dictionaries:What is the most efficient way of intersecting the keys of both dictionaries?Of course, one can use set(dict1.keys()).intersection(set(dict2.keys())), but I assume converting the dictionary to a set first is not efficient at all. 
keys is a view and has the intersection operatorOr simply
The dict.keys() view object supports set operations:However, for smaller dictionaries using a set will probably be faster:Note that set.intersection() accepts any iterable as an argument, so you can just pass dict2 to it. Also, no need to call dict1.keys()as a dict object by default iterates over its keys.
