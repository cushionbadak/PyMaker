I have a file called tester.py, located on /project./project has a subdirectory called lib, with a file called BoxTime.py:I want to import BoxTime from tester. I have tried this:Which resulted:Any ideas how to import BoxTime from the subdirectory?EDITThe __init__.py was the problem, but don't forget to refer to BoxTime as lib.BoxTime, or use:
Take a look at the Packages documentation (Section 6.4) here: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.htmlIn short, you need to put a blank file named in the "lib" directory.
Create a subdirectory named lib.Create an empty file named lib\__init__.py.In lib\BoxTime.py, write a function foo() like this:In your client code in the directory above lib, write:Run your client code. You will get:Much later -- in linux, it would look like this:
You can try inserting it in sys.path:
Does your lib directory contain a __init__.py file?Python uses __init__.py to determine if a directory is a module.
Try import .lib.BoxTime. For more information read about relative import in PEP 328.
I am writing this down because everyone seems to suggest that you have to create a lib directory. You don't need to name your sub-directory lib. You can name it anything provided you put an __init__.py into it. You can do that by entering the following command in a linux shell:So now you have this structure:Then you can import mylib into main.py like this:You can also import functions and classes like this:Any variable function or class you place inside __init__.py can also be accessed:Or like this:
I do this which basically covers all cases (make sure you have __init__.py in relative/path/to/your/lib/folder):Example: You have in your project folder: You have in another project folder: You want to use /root/anotherproject/utils.py and call foo function which is in it.So you write in app.py:
Create an empty file  __init__.py in subdirectory /lib.And add at the begin of main codethenor better
try this:from lib import BoxTime
/project/tester.py/project/lib/BoxTime.pycreate blank file __init__.py down the line till you reach the file/project/lib/somefolder/BoxTime.py#lib -- needs has two items one __init__.py and a directory named somefolder#somefolder has two items boxtime.py and __init__.py
