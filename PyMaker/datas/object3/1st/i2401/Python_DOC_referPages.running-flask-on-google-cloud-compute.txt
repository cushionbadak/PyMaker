Usually, there are many python interpreters installed in a system and when you run pip install some_lib it's installed not system-wide, but for a single python interpreter, which is quite often is different from the one used by an Apache. Python's best practice is to use virtual environments so I'd advise you to learn what it is and how to create it and how to use it with Apache+mod_wsgi.
