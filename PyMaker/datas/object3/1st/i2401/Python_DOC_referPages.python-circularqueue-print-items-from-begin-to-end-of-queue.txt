I am trying to implement Circular Queue in python and trying implement str(self) that print all the elements from the queue from the beginning to the end.When I print out the list, it does not give the whole list of items in the queue.I am splicing the items from the self.items from the front and going till the end of the list.
It looks like your problem is that you only add in the elements from the front of the circular array to the end of the underlying list implementation. What you really want to do is copy from front to end, and then from beginning to back.This gives me the correct outputHope that helps! Also, you might want to consider using cycle from itertools.
