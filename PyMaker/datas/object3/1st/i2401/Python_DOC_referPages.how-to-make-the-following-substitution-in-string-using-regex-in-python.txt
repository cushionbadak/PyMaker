I'm trying to make a substitution in the following string:The requirement are as below in the given string:If the pattern has characters 'ai' or 'hi', replace the next three characters with *\*.If a word has 'ch' or 'co', replace it with 'Ch' or 'Co'.I tried the following methods:Output:Output:You can see the output is not as per the requirements. Please help me find the correct regex expression.
The first you can achieve by referencing a captured group from the pattern in the replacement:For the second, you can pass a function as replacement (see the re.sub docs):
This outputs:
You can replace those step wise:Output:The only interesting thing is a non-capturing group around ai|hi that does not work as I expected - ai and hi are still replaced. You might want to change them to:Output:The flag re.DOTALL lets . also match newline characters.Without it, vain; would not be matched.
