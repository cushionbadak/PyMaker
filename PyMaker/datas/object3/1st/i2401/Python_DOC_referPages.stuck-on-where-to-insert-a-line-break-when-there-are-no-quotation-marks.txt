I'v done a code challenge and one of the extras was write a line of code that prints the previous result (which I have done)but it also says to put a line break between each returned value.So for example the var 'year' returns an int and that int gets printed a certainamount of times depending on what the users input is.I just can't figure out where the '\n' will go in this line of code.
You could use a simple loop:This will insert the \n by default - as each print is a seperate command and the default end=\n parameter to print applies.Patrick Haugh beat me by 50sec to use the print-commands parameter sep that lets you specify what to put between printed values: This prints a newline between each of the numbers - by default it prints a single space.You could put the collected numbers in a list, decomposit the list in its element and print them with a \n seperator:More can be found in the  print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False) documentation.
You can print a separator character between separate arguments to print that will appear between them instead of a spaceWe can use argument unpacking to provide number many arguments to print, and separate them with '\n'prints
