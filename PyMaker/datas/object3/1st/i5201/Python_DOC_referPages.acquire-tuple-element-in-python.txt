Suppose I have a nested tuple as follows:I know we could use a[0][0][1] to acquire the second element 2. However, this method might be inefficient with a long tuple. Is there any more efficient way to acquire the tuple element in this case?
If you want to be able to do this dynamically and know that your indices are valid you can use functools.reduce to write this compactly:
You may write function for access tuple valueOutput1(1, 2)
