I have a simple XML object <person> created with xml.etree.ElementTree.I want to modify the XML element to remove the age attribute.I can access the attribute using .get("age"), but using .remove("age") results in a TypeError.According to the documentation, .remove() can only be used to remove subelements. There doesn't seem to be any alternative option for removing attributes.How can I remove an XML attribute from an xml.etree.ElementTree object?
You can try del xml.attrib["age"]Will produce:
Use xml.attrib.pop("age").Output:Explanation:The attrib member of ElementTree is implemented as a dict object, meaning you can use any standard dictionary methods on it.
