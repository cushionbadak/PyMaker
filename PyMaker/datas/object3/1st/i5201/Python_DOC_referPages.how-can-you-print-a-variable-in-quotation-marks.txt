How can I make it so that in line 4 it comes out as "___" does not even sound like a word anymore." If I put it as this below it doesn't work.Also if I put line 2 into a loop how would I print it so that it prints on a single line?
In Python 2.6 or above, you can use string.format:In lower versions, Ketzak's method will work.To print multiple times on a single line, you want to prevent print from appending a newline.In Python 3, use the end argument:or in lower versions:
Use the Python interpolation operator if you can guarantee favoriteword will always be a string:print('"%s" does not even sound like a word anymore.' % favoriteword)
In python >= 3.6, you can use "f-string":print(f'"{favoriteword}" does not even sound like a word anymore.')See this link for more information about it.
