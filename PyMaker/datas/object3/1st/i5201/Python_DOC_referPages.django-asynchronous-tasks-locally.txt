I have a web application that runs locally only (does not run on a remote server). The web application is basically just a ui to adjust settings and see some information about the main application. Web UI was used as opposed to a native application due to portability and ease of development. Now, in order to start and stop the main application, I want to achieve this through a button in the web application. However, I couldn't find a suitable way to start a asynchronous and managed task locally. I saw there is a library called celery, however that seems to be suitable to a distributed environment, which mine is not.My main need to be able to start/stop the task, as well as the check if the task is running (so I can display that in the ui). Is there any way to achieve this?
celery can work just fine locally. Distributed is just someone else's computer after all :)You will have to install all the same requirements and the like. You can kick off workers by hand, or as a service, just like in the celery docs.
