As you can see here, it convert to 38000us instead of 38002us (us = microsecond)How can I keep '2' of the right most digit?
You can try a simple workaround of storing microseconds separately then replace it into datetime objectThen finally replace the dt with desired microseconds
You would need nanosecond precision to encode that value - note that you don't have .038002, you have 0.0380002 (extra digit).This is 38000us (rounded), or 38000200ns.
