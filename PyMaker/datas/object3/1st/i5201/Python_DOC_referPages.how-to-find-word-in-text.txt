I have to find if word is present in text.I have to do FPS present in PS 18 26888 12345. In this it should detect PS though 'F' is not present in 'PS 18 26888 12345'. I have tried Thank you.
This looks for the substring "FPS" in full (so 'ab' in 'abba' is True but 'abc' in 'abba' is False), but I think you want to find if any of "F" or "P" or "S" are in the string. In which case you should use:

If you want to find all that are contained in your text:Output:Thiscreates all combinations from sear of length [1, 2, 3, ..., len(sear)]. For FPS this iswhich are joined back to a string with ''.join(..) and each checked against your big string.Doku:itertools.chain.from_iterableitertools.combinationsThe "mechanism" is documented in power-recipies on the itertools-page as powerset:which I modified to not contain the empty tuplecomb itself is an iterables so you can "use" it only once, persist it into a list if you need it more then once:
You can try this approach if you want:output:
