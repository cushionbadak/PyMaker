I am currently using a colorchooser from tkinter in a project to allow the user to choose a custom colour. Minimally, this can be created (in Python 3.x) throughWhen this window appears (in Windows at least), there is a section called "Custom colors"Is there any way that I can pre-populate this section with colours of my choosing?
What you see is the common Color dialog box, which is native Windows dialog. It's not possible to specify custom colors within tkinter, because they're handled at a lower level.The naive implementation (using ctypes) could be something like this:Remember, that there's a room for expansion, for example, preserving the custom color array between calls and supporting of hex colors/arbitrary array length.
No, there is no way to pre-fill the custom colors from tkinter.
