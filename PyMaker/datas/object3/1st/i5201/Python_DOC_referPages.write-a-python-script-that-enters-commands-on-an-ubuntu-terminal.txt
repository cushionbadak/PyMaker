I am using spyder on ubuntu 16.04.  I want to write a script that will execute several commands in the same linux terminal.First I want to open a terminal, then ssh into another computer, then enter my password, then continuing entering commands.I have tried os.system(command) but this does not open a new terminal for me nor run the command I want.os.system("gnome-terminal -e 'bash -c \"ssh blah blah blah; exec bash\"'") works but I am stuck when trying to enter my password.How can I enter commands with a Python script in this context?
If you're looking to automatically connect & login to an ssh server with a password, you can use sshpass to enter the password, but it'd be better to use an SSH key. Github has a good tutorial on how to generate a key here.If you're looking to execute commands after SSHing into your server, you can do so with: os.system("ssh user@host 'command1 && command2'")
For executing commands on a terminal you can use python's subprocess module. There's already a question here on how to execute multiple commands using a single terminal with subprocess.
You can use the subprocess module along with the gnome-terminal command if you're using Gnome.The idea is to spawn a GUI terminal, and to execute a script into it through the -e option.Here is a very simple example, on how to execute a shell script in a new terminal.myscript.shspawn_and_run.pyRunning python spawn_and_run.py will spawn a new terminal, print the working directory (pwd), print the content of that directory (ls), and then echo the input from stdin (cat without arguments).
