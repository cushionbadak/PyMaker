The problem is very simple: I want to call a script from a rule and I would like that rule to both:Perform stdout and stderr redirectionAccess the snakemake variables from the script(variable can be both lists and literals)If I use the shell: then, I can perform the I/O redirection but I cannot use the snakemake variable inside the script. Note: Of course it is possible to pass the variables to the script as arguments from the shell. However by doing so, the script cannot distinguish a literal and a list variable.If I instead use script: then, I can access my snakemake variables but I cannot perform I/O redirection and many other shell facilities.An example to illustrate the question: 1) Using the shell:Problem with 1): Naturally, the python script thinks that each element in the frequencies list is a new argument. Yet, the script cannot access the snakemake variable.2) Using the script:Problem with 2): I can access the snakemake variable inside the script. But now I cannot use the bash facilities such as I/O redirection.I wonder if there is a way of achieving both (perhaps I am missing something from the snakemake documentation)?Thanks in advance!
If possible, I suggest you use the argparse module to parse the input of your script, so that it can parse a list of arguments as such, using the nargs="*" option:And you would call this as follows:
