I have been writing a small Python app for several weeks. The application reads data from a Firebird database and it copies it to another DB. I'm using FDB with Firebird embedded.This is my connection code.This code works for folders inside my computer, but inexplicably it doesn't work for folders shared in our local network. I used os.path.exists() to check whetever Python was able to find the selected shared folders and it always returned True.I keep getting this error and I don't have any clue how to solve it, even if I suspect that it is somewhat related to a slash conversion issue.I tried all the following way to type the path:\\CENTRALE\Danea Easyfatt\ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft//CENTRALE/Danea Easyfatt/ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft\\\CENTRALE\\Danea Easyfatt\\ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eftNone of them worked.
You cannot access databases on a network share. Firebird explicitly disallows this*. However, as far as I can tell, the error you display simply means you're trying to use an invalid path to access file.If you want to connect to a Firebird database over a network, you should connect to a Firebird server on the system hosting the database. That means running Firebird server, not using Firebird Embedded.* : You can configure Firebird to allow opening database on a network drive, but it is a great way to corrupt a database if multiple processes try to modify the database from different hosts, it is something you really should not do.
