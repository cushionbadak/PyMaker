I have a script for controlling some instruments during an experiment that looks like this:If an Exception occurs inside the loop (e.g. some hardware problem for the camera or the stage), then I want to go save the results and close the instruments. If an Exception occurs before the loop, then I just want to close the instruments. How to do this? I can put many try/except statements, but are there other better methods?
You have several options. You could register atexit handlers as needed (first, one that would close the instruments), then before the loop, one that would save results. Though, meh.Using two try/except:Maybe:
You can use a try-finally statement.
