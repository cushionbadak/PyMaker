I have a lot of arguments to pass to my main.py. It's easier to store them in a txt file. So, i would like to know best way of using "config" files to pass CL args.Shell script is not what i need, unfortunatly.
If you plan to use argparse, then fromfile_prefix_chars is designed to solve exactly this problem.In your launching program, put all of the arguments, one per line, into a file. Pass @file.txt to your child program. In your child program, pass a fromfile_prefix_chars parameter to the ArgumentParser() constructor:argparse takes care of the rest for you.Here is an example:The contents of foo.txt:The command line and the output:
Use configparser.  It uses .ini files and it's really easy to use.Config file:Example Code:
Here is a simple function that converts any @foo argument into the contents of foo, one argument per line. After the conversion, you may use sys.argv in any of the normal ways.Notes: The generator delegation syntax requires Python3.3 or higher.You may have @ args inside the argument file. The expansion is recursive.
