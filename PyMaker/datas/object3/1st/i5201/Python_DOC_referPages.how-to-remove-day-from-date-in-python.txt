If I had a date in the format '2016-07-31'How would I turn it to '2016-07'? I have datetime imported 
If you want to use datetime, you can parse the string with strptime and then use string formatting to print just the parts you want:Although, as zeet points out, if you know your input will be of the form 'YYYY-MM-DD' it's simpler to just slice it:Still, using strptime will make it easier if you want to support more formats in a generic way.
There are several ways to go about this, two ways are:Assuming your dates are all constant width1 (meaning each date has the same number of digits in it) you can simply do If your dates are not constant width then you can use datetime and you can simply doYou can piece together YOUR_FORMAT for your timestamps by looking at the datetime reference here. Since your example shows a zero padded month it's pretty likely that you can go with option 1.1You can actually get away with a non-constant width date provided that the year and month always come first and they are constant width.
the format of "2016-07-31" is called ISO 8601 -format, this is what i recommend to do.
