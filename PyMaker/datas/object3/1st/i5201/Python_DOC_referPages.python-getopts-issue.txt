I tried run the code above and it seems my option "a" was not captured. What should I do to get it working?I run the following command lineIt returnsI not sure why the "a" value was empty. How do I change my code to make it work properly?
You need to add a colon after the second parameter 'a'. So try See the documentation for getopt, there it is said clearly:Parses command line options and parameter list. args is the argument list to be parsed, without the leading reference to the running program. Typically, this means sys.argv[1:]. options is the string of option letters that the script wants to recognize, with options that require an argument followed by a colon (':'; i.e., the same format that Unix getopt() uses).
