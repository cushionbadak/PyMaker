I wanted to return a output which is the number of rows with all zero in its elements. Here is my python code, and I couldn't identify where is the bug. 
Your code counts every zero that it's seen so far, but it should be just counting the zeros in the current row. To fix that you need to reset count to zero before you enter the for j in range(n): loop.However, counting all-zero rows this way is inefficient. A much better way is to use the sum function in conjunction with any or all. For example:outputFWIW, I wouldn't bother putting that code into a function, since Python function calls are relatively slow, and the code required to call the function isn't much shorter than just writing the code itself:
You can use sum:Output:
In your example the count just gets incremented for every 0 forever and never gets resetYou just need to reset your count at the start of the for loop
Here is a vectorised numpy solution. See @PM 2Ring's explanation for why your logic does not work.
