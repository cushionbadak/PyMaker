I want to reverse sort a dictionary of lists based on the number of items in each list, and keep the keys for further processing. I.e. I do not want a list returned.Example:After sorting the dict the desired output should be something like:What I have come up with so far is:It correctly sorted as desired, but this breaks my dictionary and results in:As you can see the keys are gone, and the data is useless for further processing.What am I missing?Big thanks to anyone who can help me sort this out.
It looks like you have 2 levels of processing: first by key, then by length of value.As per my comment above, the output is a list of tuples, as currently ordered dictionaries are considered an implementation detail.If you wish to use an ordered dictionary, use collections.OrderedDict as below.
