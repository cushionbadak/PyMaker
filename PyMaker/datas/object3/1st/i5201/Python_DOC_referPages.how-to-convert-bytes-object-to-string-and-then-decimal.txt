I am trying to convert the bytes object to Decimal. In order to achieve it, I am firstly converting it to string. Below is my function to convert it to string.Then I am calling this function as:But with this code I am getting the error as:Error has occurred: Cannot convert b'6016.0000' to Decimal
In order to get a str from bytes object, you need to firstly decode your bytes object using bytes.decode() function as:Or you may get the same result by passing encoding parameter while type-casting your bytes object to string as:As the Python's str document says:if object is a bytes (or bytearray) object, then str(bytes, encoding, errors) is equivalent to bytes.decode(encoding, errors)Then in order to type-cast your number string my_str to decimal.Decimal, you may simply do:In your code, when you type-casted a bytes object using str() without the encoding parameter, it returned you a new string having b'...' at the start as:This behavior is also mentioned in Python's str document:Passing a bytes object to str() without the encoding or errors arguments falls under the first case of returning the informal string representation (see also the -b command-line option to Python). 
Instead of strip(), try Decimal(s.decode()). This makes the bytes object b'6016.0000' a string and should work great.
