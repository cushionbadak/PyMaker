I'm rather new to using python and haven't done really anything to configure python. my professor gave us an autograder.py file that checks our python code for correctness. the autograder.py file imports a file called grader.py which then imports something known as cgi (import cgi). inside this cgi file located at '/usr/lib/python2.7/cgi.py' there is a line of code that says this is where the problem occurs. i recieve the following errorit is my understanding that the operator module should be built in (according to other stack overflow posts). this error only occurs when i use python2.7.12 (as opposed to python3.5). i have had a simular issue importing Tkinter in 2.7 aswell.also i want to say that i have tried uninstalling python using: but it wont even uninstall for me to even attempt to reinstall. im not using any pipenv or desktopenv.i dont know what else to say, im very new to python coding.
It is almost a necessity to use a virtualenv for each python project.A virtualenv creates a dedicated python environment and it saves you from a lot of 'operating system' related issues.Here, you can find some virtualenv solutions compatible with all Python versions, along with the official python 3.6.4 documentation.
