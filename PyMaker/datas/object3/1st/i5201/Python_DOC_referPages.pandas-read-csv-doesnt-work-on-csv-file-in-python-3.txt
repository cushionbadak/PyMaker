I used Python2.7.10 before. Recently I change to python 3.6. However, when I want to import csv files it fails. My simple code is like this and I think it should work well in Python2.And the error returns like:What does this mean and how can I solve this problem? Thanks.UpdateI've already solved it adding something like this:Although I still don't know why it works, thanks for your help anyway.
