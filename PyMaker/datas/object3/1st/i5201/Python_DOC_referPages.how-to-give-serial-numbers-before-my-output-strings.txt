I have written a python script to get the name of Wikimedia contributors in a CSV output file as follows;-veluramuஆதிHow can i give serial numbers to those names? Like below;-1.velu2.ramu3.ஆதிMy code: It reads a file and removes duplicates. Finally, i want to give serial numbers.
yes, you can.
Use enumerate to get the index along with each line. i is the index of the line. Note that you'll need Python 3.6 or newer as this code uses formatted strings.
I learned from both your approaches and rearranged with another article as follows;-My output result is,1 velu2 ramu3 ஆதிThanks indeed both of you.
