Natural Text
Sorry noob here.I would like to have a function which, for a given natural number, will printout all possible pairs of 2 natural numbers whose product makes the input.I think it could be like this, but still can't figured out how to write it properly: (the last output line is missing in my code output)And output should be like this:Thanks for the help and possible explanation
The range() function does not include the end (stop) value so i is never actually n. This is easy to correct with a +1. You should also use integer division (//) as it is neater than passing a float into int().Making your function:and it now works:We can see from the documentation that range() does not include the stop parameter:For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.The proper terminology is to say that i does not attain the upper bound (stop).
Just use n+1 in the range function:
