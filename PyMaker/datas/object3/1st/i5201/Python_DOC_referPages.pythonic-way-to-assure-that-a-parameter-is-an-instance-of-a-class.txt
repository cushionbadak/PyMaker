Let's say that I have the following class:And also this function:My question is: what is the pythonic way to assure that my_class parameter is an instance of MyClass()?
Use the isinstance builtin:Hope it helps.
Use assert along with isinstance:If my_class is not instance of MyClass an exception would be thrown.
May be simple one is, more help
Another approach would be:But the Pythonic way, of course:
The pythonic way of assuring is not checking at all. Let duck typing do the job. Or you can use Python 3's type hints like said in the comments section. Otherwise, specifically check the type if you really really need to.
