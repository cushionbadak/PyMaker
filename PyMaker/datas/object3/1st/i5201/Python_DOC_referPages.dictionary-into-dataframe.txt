Here's a SO answer that gives a bit more detail, but by and large this is to conserve memory and speed up computation time.Here is a reference to the 2to3 docs that specifically calls out that dict.items() in Python2 is logically equivalent to list(dict.items()) in Python3.So all you need to do is to make a call to the list constructor when running in Python3:You can check what version of python you are running dynamically with sys:Note: See @jp_data_analysis answer for how to handle this in a version agnostic way.
