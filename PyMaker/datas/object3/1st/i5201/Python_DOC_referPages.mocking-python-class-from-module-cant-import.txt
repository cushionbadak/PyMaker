I have a Python script that is to be placed on a remote vendor server, which then will be run, importing a module (that isn't available to me locally).How am I able to mock a class I don't have access to? Is it possible to stub the known class name, add_channel func (and its params)I was also thinking is this even the write approach, maybe I just write different running cases, and skip this section entirely if executing remotely. 
Try to patch your module. Have you seen https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch?
YES! unittest has mocking built in.  Using unit tests to develop your code is the way to go.If you make your code do case statements or try/catch blocks to see if you're in the test environment vs deployment, you're going to get slammed by your customer.  Or, hopefully you will.  So, use their API to create a mocked class, and unittest will allow you utilize that mocked class without having to put those awful try/catch blocks in your import statements.
