I am trying running a cookie server using http.cookies module on localhost:When I run this file using python3 command, it raises this error:My environment is Ubuntu 16.04, with Anaconda 3 installed.I referred to http.cookies documentation, but I did not figure out what Morsel object is all about.
In your CookieServer module, you are trying to escape the value of a cookie attribute, but you are escaping a Morsel rather than the value itself.So in your code, the linemessage = "Hey there, " + html_escape(name)should be message = "Hey there, " + html_escape(name.value)
