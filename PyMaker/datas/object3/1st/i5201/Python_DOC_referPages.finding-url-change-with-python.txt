I have this URL - 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Aylmer_Fisher' and when I open it with a web browser it changes to 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher' and I need to find the second URL from the first: input Ronaly_Aylmer_Fisher and get Ronald_Fisher. I tried using requests and urllib.request to find redirect history but it didn't work.Is there a way to detect this using Python? 
You can get the reason why you can't see the redirects in the requests history  from this answer on SO:Requests doesn't show the redirect because you're not actually being  redirected in the HTTP sense. Wikipedia does some JavaScript trickery  (probably HTML5 history modification and pushState) to change the  address that's shown in the address bar, but that doesn't apply to  Requests, of course.If you check the page source(view-source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Aylmer_Fisher), the redirected url is available here:You can scrape it using regex or BeautifulSoup like this:Output:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_FisherOr, to get the output you want, you can do this:Output:Ronald_Fisher
