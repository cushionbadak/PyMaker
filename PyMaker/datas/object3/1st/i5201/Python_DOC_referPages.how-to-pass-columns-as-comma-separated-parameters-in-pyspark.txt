I have a dataframe with thousands of columns that I would like to pass to greatest function without specifying column names individually. How can I do that?As an example, I have df with 3 columns, that I am passing to greatest, each by specifying df.x, df.y.. and so on.In the above example I had only 3 columns, but if it were in thousands, it is impossible to mention each one of them. Couple of things I tried didn't work.  I am missing some crucial python...
greatest supports positional arguments*pyspark.sql.functions.greatest(*cols)(this is why you can greatest(df.x,df.y,df.z)) so just* Quoting Python glossary, positional argument is... an argument that is not a keyword argument. Positional arguments can appear at the beginning of an argument list and/or be passed as elements of an iterable preceded by *. For example, 3 and 5 are both positional arguments in the following calls:Furthermore:*args and **kwargs?What does ** (double star/asterisk) and * (star/asterisk) do for parameters?
