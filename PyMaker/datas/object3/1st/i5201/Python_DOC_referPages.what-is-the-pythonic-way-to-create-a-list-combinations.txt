This question already has an answer here:Combining lists in python                    2 answers                Let's assume I have two lists:How can I get a list containing pairs of words from both these arrays? To visualize:I know I can do it using two for loops but is there a 'pythonic' way?
You can simply use product from itertools.I do not think it gets any more pythonic than this.Under the hood, product(list_one, list_two) generates tuples of the form ('1A', '2A') which we simply '-'.join() to produce the desired result.
