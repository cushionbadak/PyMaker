Why does this work:But this doesn't:I want to add the number of i to the start of the filename each time it loops through. But adding it at the end adds the number to the extension example - filname.xml0 
The % operator has a higher operator precedence than the + operator, and it is applied first.Python executes:in the first case, andin the second.You could add parentheses to override this:Or you could interpolate both filename and i into a template:This has the added advantage that any % characters in the filename are not seen as special (which would cause problems).If you are using Python 3.6 or newer, you should really use a formatted string literal to do the same work; these expressions are way faster:Note the f prefix to the string, the {} slots are filled with the results of the expressions contained within them. This is also clearer and more readable, I think.
Operator priority means the % has higher precedence than the +.Sois equivalent to:You could parenthesise:but that will go horribly wrong if the filename contains a literal % character.So use string formatting for both:oror just concatenate strings:
The operations priority is the problem Simply add brackets like so:Otherwise you are first trying to format filename using i and only after that add the result to %s.
