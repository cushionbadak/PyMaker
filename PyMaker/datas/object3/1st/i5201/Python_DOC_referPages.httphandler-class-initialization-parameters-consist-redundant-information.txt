From the official docs on the HTTPHandler class:class logging.handlers.HTTPHandler(host, url, method='GET', secure=False, credentials=None, context=None)Returns a new instance of the HTTPHandler class. The host can be of the form host:port, should you need to use a specific port number.There is no documentation of the url parameter, and I'm not quite sure what to put there.For example, if I have a server listening on http://localhost:8080, then I think I should set:host='localhost:8080'url='http://localhost:8080'But wouldn't that always be redundant information?Or else, what should I set the url parameter to?Thank you.
You only need to add the path, like:
