I'm trying to convert datetime.datetime.second to an integer in Python 3. I would like to round this value and then use the integer value in the function datetime.time(hour=h,minute=m,second=s) where h, m and s represent integers. I'm currently getting an error message which reads as such:Below is a snippet of my code which shows what I'm trying to do.Please could someone explain why this type conversion does not work, what is datetime.datetime.second actually returning and what solutions there are to my problem.I expected the code to return the number of seconds in the current time. E.g if it is 10:29:34 when the code is run I expected s to be set to 34. I was trying to round the number of seconds to 0 or 5. So in this case I expected to round the number of seconds to 35, then get the value for 10 and 29 and store them in h and m respectively. Then put those values in datetime.time() and display that time later in my code.
datetime.datetime.second does not give you the current time. It is not an object you generally want to use; it is an implementation detail of the datetime.datetime class.To get the current time as a datetime.time() object, use the datetime.datetime.now() function, then use the .time() method on the returned datetime instance:Demo:If you need to manipulate these values, you can use the time.replace() method to create a new datetime.time() instance with the updated value.So to round your seconds value, you could use:To be precise, datetime.datetime.second, datetime.datetime.minute and datetime.datetime.hour are descriptor objects, letting you access the internal information of a datetime.datetime instance; it is these objects that make the attributes .second, .minute and .hour on instances of the datetime.datetime class:
