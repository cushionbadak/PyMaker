I am trying to read image file with filenames having cyrillic characters. Now I am trying to read 'ОД Д.bmp' in python 3But I get this error.But os.listdir('/home/atin/test') gives following output['\udcd0\udc9e\udcd0\udc94 \udcd0\udc94.bmp']How can I decode the above output to original file name which is ОД Д.bmp.I am using python 3.6 in ubuntu here.  
Your system has an incorrect locale configured. On Linux, Python takes the filesystem codec from the locale. From the sys.getfilesystemencoding() documentation:Return the name of the encoding used to convert between Unicode filenames and bytes filenames.[...]On Unix, the encoding is the locale encoding.You have a filesystem that uses UTF-8 but Python is not reading the data correctly.As a result, the UTF-8 data can't correctly be decoded, there is an decoding error, and the surrogateescape error handler kicks in, and it has 'preserved' the bytes as low surrogate codepoints.You can reverse the issue by encoding to UTF-8 with the same error handler:The result happens to be the correct UTF-8 encoding for your filename:You'll want to use LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 at the very least, to avoid this issue. In your case you appear to have LC_CTYPE=UTF-8, which is invalid (you could use LC_CTYPE=en_SG.UTF-8 instead).Another work-around is to use bytes paths:
