When I am passing the single period, I am able to execute but trying to pass multiple values using IN clause, not able to do?Problem is taking string and in list format. But my period accept only integer like 201801,201802 etc.  How to pass the parameter value? Any trick to handle list and convert into integer and pass into query? Since when passing through unix shell file it convert the params into python list? 
You can use join() to get the list as a string like:Test Code:Result:As A Query
