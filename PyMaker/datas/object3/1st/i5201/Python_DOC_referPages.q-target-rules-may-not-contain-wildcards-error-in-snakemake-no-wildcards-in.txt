I'm trying to create a snakemake pipeline whose outputs are determined by the set of sequencing files present in a particular folder. The structure of my filepath here is something like:Here's the code for my actual SnakefileMy understanding is that all should be my target rule, and that the input variable of fastq in that rule evaluates toAnd this seems to be confirmed by the print output in the pipeline when I run my script. However, I get the error WorkflowError: Target rules may not contain wildcards. Please specify concrete files or a rule without wildcards. whenever I run this script. Strangely, I can copy one of the paths from the list generated by expand to call snakemake directly, e.g. snakemake data/2.fastq_files/A.fastq and the pipeline completes successfully. What am I missing?
It could be that snakemake thinks your target rule is convert_ab1_to_fastq and not all. By default, snakemake takes the first rule as target rule. Declare all first, and see whether this solves your problem.
