I want to add unique values to every tuple in a list of lists. The list looks like below:I trying to get the below output:The number increment should be happened for every list (number should remain same for tuples belonging to a list) and should finally output as the above list of tuples. By doing this, I would be able to achieve the following:I'm trying to do with list-zip functions:which is giving me the following result:But unable to proceed further with this approach. 
Using a for loop and the enumerate method you can iterate over the list of tuples and get the desired output.Ex:Output:
First of all, you can't change tuples, you can only create new.You should iterate over existing list, creating new tuple with index prepended to old data, and append resulting tuple to new list.enumerate gives you ability to iterate over sequence, and have indexes at the same time. Optional "start" arg will help simplify logic.((index, *inner_tuple)) creates new tuple with index and everything from inner_tuple expanded. This works in python 3 only, tho.
You can do this with a double for loop in a list comprehension, using enumerate to produce the indices.output
