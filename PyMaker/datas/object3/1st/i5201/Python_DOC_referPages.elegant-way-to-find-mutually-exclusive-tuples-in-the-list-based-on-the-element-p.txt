Note that the subtraction is based on only the a of the (a, b).I tried map(operation.sub, first, second), didn't work. Tried b = map(sub, first, second), didn't work. Says unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'tuple' and 'tuple.Thanks for your help and time in advance.Edit: A solution that would help me most would include creating an intersection of the two tuples and subtracting that from each of the tuples.Edit: I want to subtract based on common items. Hope that clarifies it.
Maybe follow is what you wantï¼š
Here is what you are looking for - Intersection (Edit)Union (Extra)Output
You can use set with below list comprehension to get the desired result as:Explanation:Here, I am using set to get the non-common words in the two list by performing XOR (also know as Exclusive OR) on two sets. For example:Then I am iterating on both the list within list comprehension and checking whether they are present in above set of non-common words tuples. If they are present, then we are keeping it as the part of new list as:
