How can I use a for loop to get values that I've already got into variables?I currently have this code, that works the way I want it to:But I also need to be able to get these values from the variables this makes into another for loop to be able to do calculations with them, but I'm not sure how to do that.I want it to loop through each value in the list and do either of two things, alternating, so I'm using this:So when I print answer1 and answer2, they come out as 13 and 9 respectively.That's what I want it to output, but I want it to do it for each value in my_list, even if my_list has more than 4 items in it, I need it to loop through every item in it and store the answers separately.
the values saved within the dictionary named "values" are accessed like this:where the key is the string you associate with the valueto initialize the dictionary you can do something like what was done in the above for loop (the first one)or something like this
In Python, rather than trying to assign lots of different variables, it is always better to think of your problem in terms of processing a list of values and producing a list of answers.For your problem, you appear to want to process 4 values in my_list, two at a time. There is a trick to do this based on the grouper() recipe in the Python documentation:This would create an output list containing two answers:So for example, the first time around the loop, v1 is 7 and v2 is 8.An alternative way to get two values at a time would be as follows:
