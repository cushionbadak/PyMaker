I need to pass arguments to my python program, something like:Basically, I need to be able to assign argument value to a variable, however, the user may pass in the arguments in any order, so I need to make sure that the proper argument value is being used in the right place in the code. Is this possible? If so, how?
If you want to stick with your current format, you could do this by use of a dictionary.Assumptions: Every variable passed in will be by the format varname=value.You know what variable names the user is supposed to put, meaning you're expecting certain variables to be declared to be used in your program and you know what names the user will give them.The code basically looks like this:Testing (filename is test.py):Doing this, you could also iterate over all the user's inputs, albeit dictionaries don't preserve order:Output:
Personally, I would use argparse.ArgumentParser. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html for details.
You could always use os.environ if you want to do this.Then you would do var1=value1 var2=value2 python test.py to pass the values, instead of passing them as arguments. This sets them as environment variables, and executes your program which picks up the variables from the shell environment. This code also uses the .get() method to provide a default value (False in this case), so you can easily check if a variable is present or not.
You might want to look at sys.argv. In your example...argv[0] = program.pyargv[1] = var1=valueetcThen you could parse it out with split()...variable1 = argv[1].split('=')[1]
