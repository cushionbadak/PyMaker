The error message is as follows:What am I missing, here? I'm guessing it is the coindesk.pass_for_request(), but I can't sort out exactly why the values don't get passed. Also, what is a good way to debug something like this? I'm having a rough time looking inside of the classes to see what is going on.
There is no url or api_id variable in the scope of pass_for_request. You probably meant to access self.url and self.api_id, in python you have to use self. to access members unlike in other languages where using this. is optional.Also another thing I spotted is when you're trying to create a Price in Coindesk you are passing in api_id and the other arguments as if they are arguments with defaults, which they are not. You'd need to call it as: Price("coindesk", "https://mylinktocoindesk", "['time']['updated']")Here's some reading on OOP in python that you might find helpful:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.htmlhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm
