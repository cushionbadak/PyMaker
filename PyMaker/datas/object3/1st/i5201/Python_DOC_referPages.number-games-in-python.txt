Natural Text
I would like to know why it isn't it working. Are all of the lines correct? It is looping, any solutions?
Some changes to make the gameoutput
I'm not sure about your indentation as it is unclear how it looks in your actual program, But this:should be placed in a try catch to see if the input is actually convertible to an int (I.e it will only accept number inputs)
I see no problem with this code. It should work fine if you use the official ide. If you do use it and it does not work, you should try reinstalling it. I have had problems with the ide before and that always fixes them.
