First time stack overflow-er here. I'm trying to create some new features for this data science project that I'm working on (categorizing bank transaction data). For instance, I have transaction categories like "Auto Payments", "Gas", "Parking", etc. and I want to create a new feature called "Car" where any category with any of those words will be given a value of 1 (and all other categories will be given a 0).I tried to write a function for "car", but I can't figure out how to create a new feature based on the results of this function. I feel like there must be a simple way to do this, but I'm a bit new at python and having trouble figuring it out!Here's my function for car:Here's the code for how I tried to create a new column of "car":Here's what the df looks like:Thanks! I appreciate any input that you might have.
In Pandas try to use vectorized methods as much as possible... In this case you can use the suite of vectorized string manipulation methods. Here is a good tutorial on them from the docs.In particular we can use .str.contains which checks to see if a regular expression is inside each element of a Series. Here is the Python tutorial on regular expressions.Because str.contains return a bool you can use .astype to convert it to an int (either 0 or 1).outputs
