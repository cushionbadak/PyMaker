List of dictionaries:I need to join all nested dictionaries to reach at the expected output:I try nested list comprehension, but cannot join dict together:I am looking for the fastest solution.
You can do the following, using itertools.chain:The usage of chain, map, * make this expression a shorthand for the following doubly nested comprehension which actually performs better on my system (Python 3.5.2) and isn't that much longer:Note:RoadRunner's loop-and-update approach outperforms both these one-liners at timeit: ~1.37
You can do this with 2 nested loops, and dict.update() to add inner dictionaries to a temporary dictionary and add it at the end:Which Outputs:
You can use functools.reduce along with a simple list comprehension to flatten out the list the of dictsTime benchmark is as follows:Time benchmark of other answers on my machine
If you have nested dictionaries with only 'a' and 'b' keys, then I suggest the following solution I find fast and very easy to understand (for readability purpose):
