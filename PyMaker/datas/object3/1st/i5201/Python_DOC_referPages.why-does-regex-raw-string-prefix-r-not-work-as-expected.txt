Natural Text
I learned that "r"\n" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while "\n" is a one-character string containing a newline. Regular expressions will often be written in Python code using this raw string notation." And the r"\n" is equivalent to "\\n" to denotes two-character string '\' and 'n'.I test it by printing and it worksHowever, when I tested in regexWhen I tried this, it works thoughWhy? Does this mean I have to add one more backslash when using regex to make sure it is a raw string?Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html
The reason that "\d+" works is that "\d" is not a proper escape sequence in Python strings and Python simply treats it as a backslash followed by a "d" instead of producing a syntax error.So "\d", "\\d" and r"\d" are all equivalent and represent a string containing one backslash and one d. The regex engine than sees this backslash + "d" and interprets it as "match any digit"."\\\d", "\\\\d" and r"\\d", on the other hand, all contain two backslashes followed by a "d". This tells the regex engine to match a backslash followed by a "d".
