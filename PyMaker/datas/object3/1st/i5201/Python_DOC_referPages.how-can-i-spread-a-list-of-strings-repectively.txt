Given an input list as:What I wanted to make with this list is:At first, I tried to generate a list of len, and multiple with standard function reduce and functools's mul.Next, I don't have efficient or "pythonic" idea to solve this.By the way, this seems to be similar problem with tree traversal, but I thought this is multiple-parent tree or problem related to graph implementation.For efficiency in memory issue to deal with a huge list of lists, how can I solve this with python generator by using directed graph or any other algorithm?
Use itertools.product:From the documentation:Cartesian product of input iterables.  Roughly equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).
