I've created a dictionary instance without any key: value pairs, standard I'm then returning back some information from an API to be added to this dictionary dependent on some variables name.However, I seem to be getting an error similar to this *Assuming that str(some_variable1) is equal to 'foo':Any pro tips?
Other answers already adressed why this fails, here is a convenient solution that sets a default for if the key is not already present, such that your appending does not fail. The way I read it, you want a dictionary with lists of other dictionaries as values. Imagining a situation such asYou can do This will evaluate to {'0': [{'oh', 1}]}In other words, change lines of this sortInto:I hope this answers your question.
you have to first check is "foo" present in dictionary as a key.You can try:Small suggestion: do not use dict as dictionary variable as it is keyword in Python
@Harsha is right.This:Will do:Right-Hand-Side needs to be evaluated first so, it will try to lookup:Which will fail.
The pythonic solution is to set default values for your dictionary. In my opinion, collections.defaultdict is the best option for this.Also, please do not use variables names which are also classes. I have called the dictionary d below.
to create a new dictionary use:When you try to add something you use:There is nothing to add. you have to first create the valueAs also suggested do not use dict.. a simple d that means dict is the way forward.
