I am trying to write a function that returns the most frequent value in a dictionary in Python. I do not want to import anything, just simple code.Any ideas? For example, if my dictionary is:The expected result is 1964(because it is present as the value in the dict 3 times (maximum count)).This was my last attempt:
Even i suggest you don't need to import anything , its simple task :output:
Using collections.Counter:Simplest way to achieve this is via using Python's builtin collections.Counter which is created for the same purpose. Here's the sample code for your example:Using intermediate dict (with no imports)Here's another one without importing any module. Here I am creating my own counter using dict as:From the above dict, extract the key with maximum value using max function as:Without using intermediate dict (with no imports)Here's another alternative without creating the intermediate dictionary, but it is relatively less efficient because of one complete iteration of the list due to the list.count for each element in list:
If you really insist on not importing anything. Consider this:
You can utilize the max function with key parameter:Output:
