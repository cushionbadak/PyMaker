I am working on some data extraction in a text file. I have been using MATLAB for a while now, but it seems kinda more stressful. I started using python for the extraction.  Now I have a pretty complex question and I don't even have any idea about how to do it. Here's what I've done so far.I have a log file that looks likes this:Now I need to extract out any line that contains RStrtD followed by another line having RStpD and then find the difference in the time between them, for every case of this in the text file, and then add the times together.I extracted using the code below:After running this, I received the following output:This is good, but I now need to subtract the times from each other on each line and then take the sum of all of these differences. I really don't know how iI can go about this. I'm not yet familier with time vectors in python.
for doing math with time, I would recommend arrow. Its documentation is comprehensive and you can easily subtract time by just time2-time1 which will give you a time delta.
