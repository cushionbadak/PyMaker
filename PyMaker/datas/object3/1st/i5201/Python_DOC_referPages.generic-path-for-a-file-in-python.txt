Natural Text
I am opening a file in my python code. For a particular user, the path is /home/user_name/IB/MAINwhere user_name is the personal user name. For testing and stuff I have used my own user name but if I give this code to someone else, it won't run as the path is different for that user, so how do I get a  generic path for this file?
Use to denote relative path to user home.or via environment variable
