Natural Text
I currently am going to have output in a txt file that looks like this:I'd like somehow convert this to a CSV so I can have it all listed neatly in a table with their own columns Example:Right now I'm using Python to generate that text file but knowledge is pretty shallow on python. Not sure how I would do that.Any help is appreciated. Thank you.
Try next:to represent it as csv you should use in csv module.
