See Intra-package References in https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.htmlYou can also write relative imports, with the from module import name form of import statement. These imports use leading dots to indicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative import. From the surround module for example, you might use:from . import echofrom .. import formatsfrom ..filters import equalizeri.e. I think  you need to e.g. from .example import foo.
