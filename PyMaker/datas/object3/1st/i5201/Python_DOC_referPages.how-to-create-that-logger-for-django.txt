Log entry in the format: "message. User: name the name of the operator."I need to create a request to receive logs of operator activity. Which returns a formatted log of all user actions.I have an activity application in which there is an OperatorLog model.You need a public api (activity / api.py) to register events in other applications,There is also a file with a list of activity types (constants.py), it should be available in other applications via the import of api.py, you need to output the logs using the serializer (DRF).constants.py (Sample version)
Try the logging library, where you can access various type of log messages like-Error, Debug, Warning or just Information.You can read more about here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html
