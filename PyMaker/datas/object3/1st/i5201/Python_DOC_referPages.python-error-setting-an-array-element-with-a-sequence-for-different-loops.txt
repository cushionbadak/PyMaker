I'm new to python but I know that python indexing starts from 0, but I cant understand why this code stops here.
Your example code is not complete. But I think the bug is clear.By definingYou dC_frac is a multidimensional array of shape (1,  3). Use dC_frac.shape you will find it's (1, 3), not, (3,). Thus in Your dC_frac[m] is an array of 3 elements, not a scalar.If your dC[j, n] and dt are scalars, This will assign an array of 3 elements to an entry. Thus the error.To fix, just use
