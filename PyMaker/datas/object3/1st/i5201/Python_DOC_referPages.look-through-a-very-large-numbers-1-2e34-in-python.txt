Already looked at Google and past questions in here and couldn't find a simple and well-explained answer.How to loop through a large number in python?e.g. I would like to check how long it will take to loop between 1 and 1.2e+34 and print the final result.Not sure how to write for look/while loop for this and I have no idea how to write 1.2e+34 in python language (For i = 1 to i = ?).
Python understands 1.2e34, as a float, but you can cast it to an int. int(1.2e34).If you want to loop between 1 and n inclusive, you would normally use range(1, n+1).Thus, in Python 3:--As FHTMitchell pointed out, in Python 2, the value is too large for range or xrange. You could use a while loop instead.
Ok so you have an answer as to how you'd do it, but you really need to think about if you should do it. On my, not slow machine, this code in iPython (py 3.6):producesSo if you want to loop between 1 and 1.2e34 that will take 1.2e34 / 0.0204 = 5.77e35 seconds or roughly 10^18 times the age of the universe. I don't think you want to be doing that...
Maybe you can try something like this:
