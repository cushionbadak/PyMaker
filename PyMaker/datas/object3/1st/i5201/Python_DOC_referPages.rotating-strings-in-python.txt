I was trying to make the string HELLO to OHELL in Python. But couldn't get any way to rotate it without working with loops. How to code for it in just 1-2 lines so that I could get the desired pattern?
You can slice and add strings:This gives you the last character:and this everything but the last:Finally, add them with +.
Here is one way:Alternatively, collections.deque ("double-ended queue") is optimised for queue-related operations. It has a dedicated rotate() method:
I would agree with Mike MÃ¼ller's answer:I would like to share another way of looking at s[:-1]This means that it is starting from the start and including everything except for s[-1].I hope this helped.
