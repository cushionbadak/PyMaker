I am trying to use python's regex to recognize 3 tokens from the user which can all be composed of either letters or numbers.Here is the code I was using:where inputStr comes from raw_input(). I ran my code, and here's what I get for each inputI thought \w matched any letter, digit, or underscore, and by including the + I would get 1 or more instances of it in my group.
\w does not match the spaces between the numbers â€” as you correctly pointed out, \w matches a letter, digit, or underscore, but not a space.  Try:\s+ matches one or more whitespace characters between the groups of digits.Example as tested in Python 3:
thought \w matched any letter, digit, or underscoreYes but \w does not match spaces eg.1 2 3r'(\w+)(\w+)(\w+)'Your pattern is looking for any letter digit or underscore, 3 times or more
