For my project i want to use external libraries, connected to git repository as submodules. They are located in shared-lib folder, that is added to sys.path.All libraries contains setup.py file and subfolder with python module. How can i import that module without installing whole package and without changing it structure?import module_name.module_name does not work, i get No module named module_name.module_name because there is no __init__.py file inside module_name directory.My project does not require installation, because it is plugin for another system. So i can use only python import.
