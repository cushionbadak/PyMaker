I am trying to group the list of days according to month, for example day 1 to 31 is January, and so on. Here is some input data:I am tring to sum up its total grouped by month. This is the code where I printed out the above:I am thinking to manually do an if else statement to sum them up but I do not think that's a good idea. Is there any better way of doing this?Thanks!Edit
Convert day to month based on a given year, and then group by month using dictionary:
Let's say your input is in a dictionary, with the integer day as the keys.We can use those keys to build date strings, then use the datetime.strptime method to interpret them.  We can then extract the month from the datetime objectI would not be surprised if there is some better way of doing this, so you might want to double check in the datetime and calendar modules to see if you can find something I missed
