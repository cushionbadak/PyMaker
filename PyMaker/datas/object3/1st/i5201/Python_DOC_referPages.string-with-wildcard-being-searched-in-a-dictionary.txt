This question already has an answer here:Python wildcard search in string                    6 answers                Search for a file using a wildcard                    4 answers                I am learning as I go and came across a little snag. I'm trying to search an inputted string in a dictionary. example: I want to pull up all episodes of a single season of a show with this search "S*1*Show title". I want it to show S.01 E.01 Show Title S.01 E.02 Show Title ...S.01 E.10 Show Title.I can get it to show all titles by just putting in "Show title" but this also brings up Season 2, Season 3 and extras. I believe the issue is here in the codeI've also tried but I get the same results. "show title" brings up all episodes and extras and "S*1*show title" brings up nothing
Ok, to be honest, I've not really read your code, too much stuff here, but let's focus on what I think to be your actual question: How to use wildcard search with Python.The only way I know is fnmatch:Output:Please, not that wildcard is really not the same thing than Regex. Don't except to use wildcard via any Regex method.
