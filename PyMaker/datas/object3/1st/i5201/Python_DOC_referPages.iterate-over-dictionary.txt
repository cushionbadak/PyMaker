The two setups using print(i, j) and print(i) return the same result. Are there cases when oneshould be used over the other or is it correct to use them interchangeably?
Both are different if remove parenthesis in print because you are using python 2Xoutput
In Python 3, print(i, j) and print(i) does not return the same result. print(i, j) prints the key i followed by it's value jprint(i) prints a tuple containing the dictionary key followed by its value
items() returns a view object which allows you to iterate over the (key, value) tuples. So basically you can just manipulate them as what you do with tuples. The document may help:iter(dictview)  Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples > of (key, value)) in the dictionary.Also I think print(i, j)[1] would result in error in Python 3 since print(i, j) returns None.
