I want to create a function my_sum_div(a, b, div=10) which will compute the sum of numbers from a to b, prints out this sum, but also all intermediate sums of type a+(a+1)+(a+2)+(a+3) that are divisible by div.I want the program to work as follows:The output should look like:Now I have already done this:Ive been trying for hours. I know my code only checks what numbers between (a, b+1) are divisible by div, but how do I make it so that the function computes and prints all the intermediate sums that are divisible by div? My first function only computes the sum of all integers in the given interval. I now want the subsequent function to compute all intermediate sums that are divisible by div in a given interval and print all of these. Thank you in advance.
Output:
You may create your custom generator to yield the results as:Using above generator, you may yield one result at a time with next() as:OR you may get the list of all the results in one go as:Result with commented version of code to yield total my_sum at last:In Python 3, you can simply store the sum of intermediate values and the total sum at the end in two variables as:For older versions of Python, you need to do:
Hereâ€™s my implementation
