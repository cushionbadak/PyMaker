I want to check the type of input, check if data is float or int.This will check if the inData is an integer, but this won't check for float type.Any suggestions?
As I understand it, you want to check whether inData can be converted to float.You can do that like this:For understanding exceptions have a look at this
You can use the type() builtin to see the type of an object.For example, type(inData) is float will return True if inData is a float.
