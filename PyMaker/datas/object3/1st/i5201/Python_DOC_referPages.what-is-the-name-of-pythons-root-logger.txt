As described there, the default level of the root logger is WARNING:I'd like to explicitly set the level of the root logger to INFO. I tried doing it using name='root', but this has no apparent effect:I am able to set the level of the root logger if I call logging.getLogger() without arguments:I'm curious, though, why this didn't work the first time? It would seem that this should work since its name attribute is 'root':In short, if I didn't want to rely on the default, what name would I pass to logging.getLogger() in order to get the root logger?
The root logger's name is root, but you can't access the root logger by name.Inspecting logging.py reveals this:root is stored separately from loggerDict, which is where all named loggers go.You can follow the manager.getLogger internal function and find it cannot find root:
