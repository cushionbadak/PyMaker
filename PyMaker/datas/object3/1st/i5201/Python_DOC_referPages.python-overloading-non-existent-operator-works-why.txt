While messing around with overloading operators and namedtuples, I've stumbled on some weird behavior which works, for some reason or another:https://repl.it/repls/RemorsefulFlawlessAfricanwildcatDoes anyone have any insight into this? Why does it work?If I remove the Point.__floor__ line, it doesn't work.Did the math package define a __floor__ operator somewhere?ORDoes Python parse Point.__XXX__ to extract XXX and compare with the name of the thing (function/operator) that acts on the argument?I'm confused, probably because I don't know how exactly these things work deep down.
From the docs (emphasis mine):math.floor(x)Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x. If x is not a float, delegates to x.__floor__(), which should return an Integral value.
