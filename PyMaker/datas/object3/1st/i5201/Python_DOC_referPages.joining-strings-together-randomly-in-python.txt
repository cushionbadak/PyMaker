I'm looking for the words in the list to be joined together in different combinations, but it's only returning single word results. I'm looking for strings like 'whywho' 'whatwhywhen' 'howwhywhatwho' etc.
use sample function from random package.EDITIf you don't care which element to be repeated,if you don't want this operation to be repeated if repetitions are already there,you might also want to use insert method defined for lists, which simply inserts an element to desired index in list. Check this for last one. 
You are very close to the answer!random.choice returns one random element from the input sequence. What you are doing is that you are generating a slice of random size from the words list, from which you are choosing a single element.The following does what you want:random.choices returns a k sized list of random elements from the input sequence. These elements are chosen with replacement, meaning that you may have more than one occurrence of an element from words.
Try this out. Just find a random index and join it with a random list. To count the number of times a word was produced use the Counter object from the collections namespace.
