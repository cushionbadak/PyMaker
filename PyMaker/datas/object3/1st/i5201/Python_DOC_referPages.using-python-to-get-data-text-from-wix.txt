I'm making a python project in which I created a test wix website.I want to get the data (text) from the wix website using urllibso I didurl.urlopen(ADDRESS).readlines()the problem is it did not give me anything from the text in the page and only information about the structure of the page in HTML.how would I extricate the requested text information from the website?
