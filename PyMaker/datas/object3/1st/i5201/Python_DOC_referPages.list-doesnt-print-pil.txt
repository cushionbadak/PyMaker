I wrote a very simple program, and something that has no reason for it not to work.  It isn't working. This is my code:The data never prints. No errors occur; nothing happens.I have tried putting a print statement in between the getdata() command and print(data) command. The string prints, but the list still doesn't.Thanks for your help!
On this line: data = list(image.getdata())) you have one ) too many.For some reason this doesn't work when running through the IDLE, however if you run this through a terminal it will start printing the values. I am guessing that PIL requires some function that is provided by the terminal and since the IDLE is not actually a terminal it cannot execute. You may also want to add a input() to the end of your script to prevent the window from closing.
