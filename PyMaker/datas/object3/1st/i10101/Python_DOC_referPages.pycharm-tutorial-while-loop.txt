It's my answer for this question :" Print all squares from 0 to 99(1,4,..,81)Use number variable in while loop."Pycharm says it doesn't match with its answer.I think i should print those numbers in a single line but i couldn't deal with it.How can i do that ?
Your code will print each number in a newline, because, in Python, the call to print() comes with an implicit newline (see the end argument per the documentation). Next, you're making an assumption about output formatting.  As I see it, there are two primary issues with this assumption:1) Calls to functions (e.g. print()) in a while loop "execute" when they're called -- there's no delay to see if a future pass through the loop will provide extra data to the function.2) You're assuming that the Python interpreter will guess that printed numbers (in a while loop) are desired to be returned in a comma separated list.  Computers are machines that do what you tell them to do -- if you don't write logic to explain what you need, the machine cannot give you this.You can express your desired output in the following ways:1) Collect the numbers (as strings) in a list, then output them after you're done looping:2) Specify that you want to use a comma in the call to print.  Make special note of the trailing comma -- you now know why this happens:
