I'm currently trying to find the complementary strand of DNA, meaning I have to replace all Ts with As, As with Ts, Cs with Gs, and Gs with Cs. I have been trying to find a way to do this that doesn't result in the program returning entirely one letter and I think I found the way but now every time I run it I receive an error telling me to convert a line to str and I can't place where it should be or why, here's the code I have currently:
You are passing in integers as the first argument to DNA.replace() where it only takes strings; ord('A') produces an integer, and that's what you pass in as k:You could replace ord('A') with just 'A' but then you have new issues, namely that the C->G replacement is going to be undone by the G->C replacement or vice versa.You should instead use the str.translate() method, and remove the loop:Also see Simultaneous .replace functionality (which was linked to as a duplicate from your previous question, and it appears you only partly implemented my approach there).
