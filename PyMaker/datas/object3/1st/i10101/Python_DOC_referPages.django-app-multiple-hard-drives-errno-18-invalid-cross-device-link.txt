os.rename() may fail across different file systems.The operation may fail on some Unix flavors if src and dst are on different filesystems.shutil.move() should workIf the destination is on the current filesystem, then os.rename() is used. Otherwise, src is copied (using shutil.copy2()) to dst and then removed.but you've got a os.rename(initial_path,new) just before your shutil.move(initial_path, new). Remove the first os.rename() and it should work.
