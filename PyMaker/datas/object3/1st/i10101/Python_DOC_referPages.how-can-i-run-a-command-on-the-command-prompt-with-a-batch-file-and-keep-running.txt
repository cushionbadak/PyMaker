Create any python(.py) file and run it likec:\python27\python.exe <path_of_the_file>/filename.pyTo keep running it over say, 1000 times:for /l %x in (1, 1, 1000) do c:\python27\python.exe <path_of_the_file>/filename.pyNote: Assuming your python is installed at c:\python27\
Use the subprocess module. You may be interested in subprocess.run and its timeout argument if you are using a newer version of Python (i.e. 3.5.x). If not, take a look at subprocess.Popen.The timeout argument is passed to Popen.communicate(). If the timeout expires, the child process will be killed and waited for. The TimeoutExpired exception will be re-raised after the child process has terminated.Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run
