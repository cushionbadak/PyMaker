I've run into a couple of issues using arguments within a python script. Can i please get some help or direction to get this code functional? Thank you in advance.First issue: I am unable to specify multiple arguments at once. For example I am able to pass a single argument fine:However, I am looking for a way to pass multiple arguments in any position. Is there a way I can accomplish this?For example, I would like the below to occur:Second Issue: I am trying to pass both whole numbers and floats in the -b argument. But when I pass a float/decimal I get the below error. Is there a way I can pass both a float and whole number?This works:But this does NOT:Below is my testable code:
You didn't actually provide the code you're using (aside from incidentally in the traceback),(Update: Code added later) but the answer is: Stop messing around with parsing sys.argv manually and use the argparse module (or docopt or something that doesn't involve rolling your own switch parsing).If you want to accept int or float, the easiest solution is to just make type=float and use a consistent type (but the range check must be done outside the parsing step). If you must allow both, ast.literal_eval or a homegrown argparse type conversion function are options. Since you want a range check too (which range won't handle properly for float values that aren't equal to int values), roll a type checker:Then use it by replacing the definition for -b with:
