This question already has an answer here:TypeError: list indices must be integers, not list. How to fix?                    2 answers                This lines of my code are throwing me this error:TypeError: list indices must be integers, not listWhy? I am new to Python (coming mainly from C++) but I have checked the documentation for the syntax and it seems to be right.
Python for loops are what is described in some other languages as "for-each" loops. That is, i in each iteration is not an index, but the actual element in v_recorrido. So:
This is what is in some languages called a for-each loop, meaning the iteration variable takes on the value of each of the elements, not the index of the element. The error is because you are trying to subscript v_recorrido using its elements.Change it to:
In your example, i is actually a list item. In the first iteration it is equal to [4, 45], then [4, 15] and finally [4, 45].What you might be looking for is to iterate over a range equal to the length of v_recorrido. Like:
