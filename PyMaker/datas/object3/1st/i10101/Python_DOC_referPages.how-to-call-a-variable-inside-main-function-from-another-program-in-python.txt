You should use function calls and return values instead of this. Return the computation_result from the function in the first file, and then store the result in the b variable in the second file.first.pysecond.pyOther option is to use a global variable in the first file where you will store the value and later reference it.

It isn't accessible to anything outside of that scope.You need to get  first_variable into first's global scope - then in second you can use it with first.first_variable.One way would be to return something from first.main() and assign it to first_variable.Then in second you can use it:
