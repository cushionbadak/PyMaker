I'm modifying our pacific time zone filter to include a time option. I don't want the time component to be shown if midnight. The only import thus far we are using is dateutil.parser. Any pointers on best solution would be appreciated! Thanks.
I believe the best thing to do would be to just take the time() from the datetime before passing it, then compare that to datetime.time(0, 0).Note that I've changed format to date_fmt, because format() is already a builtin. Also, from a design standpoint, it's probably not a great idea to have time override the specified format string, so maybe change the "add time" portion to be date_fmt = date_fmt + ' %H:%M'.Demonstration:
Alternatively you can use the .hour, .minute and .second attributes of the datetime object. Like this:midnight is a boolean indicating if it is midnight in the US/Pacific timezone.
To check if the time is midnight:
I am not sure if this is the solution you are/were looking for but personally I use simple comparison:where time is TimeObject (datetime.time)
