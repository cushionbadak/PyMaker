I have a data set that is pulled from a pixhawk. I am trying to parse this data and plot some of them vs time. The issue is when I use this code to open one of the bin files:I get data that looks like this:I was told it is supposed to be in binary, but it's not. Unless python is doing something to the data set when it is opening it?You can download this sample data set if you would from:
Python is showing you the binary data represented in hexadecimal when the characters do not correspond with a regular ascii character. For example \xa3 is a byte of hexidecimal value A3 which is 10100011 in binary. T on the other hand could be printed as \x54 which is a byte of binary value 01010100. Since you used the print function, python assumes you are trying to convert the binary data to a human readable string, so instead of \x54 it showed the corresponding character T.You can use the following code to get an array of binary strings that represent your data:Here is the output:
