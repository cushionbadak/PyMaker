I have the following function:EDIT (full function)If the date is right, the function creates a list where the month is put, otherwise a '*' is put. But if I write:I get this error:So Python is telling me I have to put a control in the list number 8. How do I manage to tell the function to act like this?
Use Python time.strptime and time.strftime:If the date is invalid, ValueError will be raised, in which case you return '*'.Call get_month for each date string in your function.
