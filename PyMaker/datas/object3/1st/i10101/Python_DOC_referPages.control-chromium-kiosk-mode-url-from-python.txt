Using Python to start a browser (Chromium) and change the urlThe linked question is asking exactly what I want but I don't know how to implement the answer that is just to uses Selenium. I just need to load chromium in kiosk mode and load a local html page I have does this with os.system('chromium-browser --kiosk file://.....') but this loads a new window/tab every time so it's not efficient or fast
You can add options to selenium's chromedriver, similar to how you would using os.systemTo refresh or reload the page repeatedly, you could do driver.get(url) or driver.refresh() in a while True loop.
this code work for me..
