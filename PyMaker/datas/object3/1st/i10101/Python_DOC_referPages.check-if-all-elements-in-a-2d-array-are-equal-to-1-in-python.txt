This question already has an answer here:How to check if all elements of a list matches a condition?                    5 answers                What's the most Python way to do this, other than iterating through nested loops and checking if each value is equal to 1?
If you're using numpy you can use its per-element equality check and then call the resulting arrays all method to check if all elements did satisfy the condition:
Use itertoools.chain to iterate over "flattened" list
Using sets:
You can use np.searchsorted along with np.apply_along_axis to find the elements in any dimensional array. 
Generator function + all is probably the way to go.Another option would be to first flatten the array, but python has no standard way to do this. But the code would handle any kind of dimensions (If you flatten it deep)!
