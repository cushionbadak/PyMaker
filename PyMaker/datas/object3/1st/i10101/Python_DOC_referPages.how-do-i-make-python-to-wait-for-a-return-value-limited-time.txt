I'm calling a method which run time is undefiniable.I want to wait for it some second (for example 2 sec) and after then I want to step my program next.
I think this is a more suitable answer to the question: break the function after certain timeP.S: Could not post it as a comment due to insufficient reputation. 
I believe you are looking for the sleep function in the time module.https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.sleep
