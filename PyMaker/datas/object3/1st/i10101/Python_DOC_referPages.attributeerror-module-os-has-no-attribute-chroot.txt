Below is my very basic code running in spyder & python is choking, what am I doing wrong?I get following error message:
One possibility is that your operating system is Microsoft Windows, for which os.chroot() is not available.
I have checked your code, and there is no any ERRORbut i see this message:PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/home/beenj/Documents' means we must run python3 with sudo ==> sudo python3then enter above code...or run compiled Python application (after completing ) in SuperUserDO (sudo)
Did you name your file os.py? If you did, it is shadowing the stdlib os module. Change the name of your file and delete os.pyc or __pycache__.Do print os or similar inside the script to see the file path Python is using to get the os module.
