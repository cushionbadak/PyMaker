When trying to run the following code:it yields an UnboundLocalError, butdoesn't.Is that a wanted behaviour ?Is there a way to modify the value of a variable without creating a new one ? I could use a dict of one element. It works but it seems ugly:Isn't it a better solution ?
just addat the beginning of the method truc() to declare that i is global variableTake a look at this topic in Python's FAQ to get more informations
To refer the outer scope variable of the function, i should be declared as global.
You'll have to add global i to the function.Other ways to handle this problem is:Making i capitalized you'll be able to access it without the global        however i is then unchangeable which seems like something that isn't appropriate in your case.Taking i as an argument. This makes the code less messy and easier to debug later.
