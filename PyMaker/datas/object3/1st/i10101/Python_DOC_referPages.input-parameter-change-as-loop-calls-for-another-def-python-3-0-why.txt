I can just not figure out why my input parameter(board) is changing in the loop..The def iterate takes in the list "board" from def initiate. And it should do this once, and I checked, it is only calling def initiate once. The problem occurs in the loop "for i in range(0,size()):" in def iterate. Here, the list "old_board" somehow changes. If I have 5 rounds and 5 lists in the list "old_board", the second round changes the values of old_board[1] and so on.. Why is this happening? And how can I solve it?(Parameter list and list in the loop should be equal)This is the output:"This is the parameter list  : [[1, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]This is the list in the loop: [[1, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]This is the list in the loop: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]This is the list in the loop: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]This is the list in the loop: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]This is the list in the loop: [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]"This is the code:
By doing thisYou don't create new objects but merely new references to the existing ones. You can use the copy module or the syntax suggested by Alex to create new objects.Here you can find a detailed explanation:http://www.python-course.eu/deep_copy.php
Here, you don't copy your list, you just make a new link to existing listIf you need a copy of it, you should do it like this:see FAQ
