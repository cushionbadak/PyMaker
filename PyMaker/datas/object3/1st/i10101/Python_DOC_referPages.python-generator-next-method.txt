For the next method of generator, I use the below example. I tried to find the Python documentation for next method, but failed, could anyone help to point out?The purpose I want to find the official document is I want to look for all forms of next methods and meaning of the 2nd parameter None in my below example.
next() is a function, so it is listed in the functions documentation:next(iterator[, default])  Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its __next__() method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.The second argument then is the default, returned if iterator.__next__() raised StopIteration. If no default is set, the StopIteration exception is not caught but propagated:The default is rather redundant for the specific example you gave, as the (x**2 for x in range(0,100)) generator expression is guaranteed to have at least one result.PyCharm can show you documentation for Python standard-library functions; just use the Quick Documentation feature (CTRL-Q).
