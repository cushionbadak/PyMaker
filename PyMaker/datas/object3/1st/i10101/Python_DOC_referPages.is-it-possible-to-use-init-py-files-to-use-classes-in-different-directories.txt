For my project, I use object-oriented Python class. I'm quite new at Python. I'm using Python 3.5.I use those classes in different subdirectories. My files are organized that way : I was using sys.path.append("absolute_path_to_/MyClasses")to use my classes in the subdirectories program (for example in MyPrograms1/program_using_class1.py) , which was ok as long as I was working on my computer.But now, I want to be able to run it from other computers too. So I tried to use __init__.py file.I read the Python documentation about Modules : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html .I did not find my answer. The blank __init__.py did not work. Can you help me ? 
You are going to need to be importing those classes as a single module by adding __init__.py inside the classes' directory. But instead of leaving it blank you need to import the classes:from . import class1_file, class2_fileAnd then you'll need that directory with the classes in order to import them in another computer. 
I solved my problem using sys.path.append,os.chdir,os.path.dirname and os.path.abspath. I added the path to my module to PYTHONPATH using sys.path.append so the program could find it. I used this code : I would like to thank Stam Kaly for making me discover the chdir function.You have to adapt the os.chdir part to your file organization. Thank you for all the help.
