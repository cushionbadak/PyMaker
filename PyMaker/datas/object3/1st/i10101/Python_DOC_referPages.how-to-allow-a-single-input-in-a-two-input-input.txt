Natural Text
So, I have this code that allows two inputs:And the "color 2"/"color 3" thing works. However, typing "hello", as it'sa single word, gives me this error:So, how can I get around/fix this?I hope this was formatted correctly and everything, thanks for taking the time to look at the question. I'm pretty new to python, so sorry if it's a simple fix.
If you don't know in advance how many arguments there are to the command, then you can not use this construct:You could try like this instead:Or, may I suggest to use more verbose variable names:It will work for any number of arguments after the first 'command' word, because str.partition is guaranteed to return a 3-tuple.
