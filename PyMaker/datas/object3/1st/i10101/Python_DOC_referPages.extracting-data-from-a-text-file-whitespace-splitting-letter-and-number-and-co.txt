Natural Text
I'm trying to create a program that reads a txt file that has over 1000 lines of the format below and stores the data in two separate two dimensional arrays:The file stores the results of a game where there are two players and they both choose four tokens out of a bag. An example token as can be seen above is 'b15' which means it is the colour blue and it has the number 15 on it. The colon signifies that the tokens thereafter are for the 2nd player.Each line is a game. I need to store the colour and number of each token into two dimensional arrays with 4 rows and 2 columns, I have one for each player e.g.This stores the first two tokens for player 1, after I've stored the rest of the tokens for this player and the 2nd player in a separate two dimensional array for a single game (single line in text file), I'll be processing the data then overwriting the arrays again for the next line (game) in the text file.My main question is how do I do the following:Split the letter and number so I can store them in the separate array positionsRecognise a white space meaning a new tokenRecognise that the colon means that player's tokens have all been chosen and it's player 2 next.Thanks for reading and I'm happy to answer any questions to clarify further.
One you have read your moves in from the text file, you can use the split function and list slicing (Explain Python's slice notation) to process them.>>> mystring = 'b14 b15 b12 y4:y11 r7 y1 b2'Split at the colon to get player 1 / payer 2 moves:>>> player1, player2 = mystring.split(':')For each player, split at the spaces to get the moves:If you know that the first part of the move will always be exactly one letter, you can 'slice' off the first part of the string:
You can use regular expression to split the letter and number, str.split() to split 2 players' result 
Use the following approach(crucial functions are re.match and str.split):The output:
