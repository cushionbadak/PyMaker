I am using python. I have a function (getAll) that call other function in a loop (getPart) and in each step the return value is updated. In some case when I call the function that is inside the loop, this fail. I need return the result in this moment.I need print the result partial value,  if occur a except in some step when I call tempResult in getAll
Sounds like you need to use try, except blocksBasically when you catch an error or an error is raised it will run what ever is in the except block, since we are putting return tempResult it will return the value. Like the comment says, catching all exceptions is a bad idea since you might hit an error that has nothing to do with your code and it will catch it, for specific exceptions you should do: You can also see more error details like:So find out what errors will cause your program to stop and put it there. 
You can handle the exception by wrapping the code that raises the error with a try/except and printing the result in the except block:On another note, since you already know calling getPart might raise an error, you may move the try/except block into the function. This depends of course on what exactly you're trying to achieve.
This is not necessarily the best solution, since depending on the error, it may be better to prevent it than to handle it in this way. However, you can try (no pun originally intended...) the following (where WhateverError is the error that is raised in your case):
Wrap your method in a try, except block. You might want to raise an exception so you can respond to it too.
