An example of my input is:I need to produce output in an array list How can I achieve this?
If you want the numbers located before the "arrows" (->), here is a solution using re :I'm using map to convert the strings to int.More informations on the regex used :I'm using a lookahead expression ((?=->)) to match only something located before this string : '->'.And what I am looking for is a number between 0 and 9, thanks to the set of characters [0-9].Please note that this won't match 10 for example. In this case, I need to change the regex to the following : [0-9]+(?=->), to match 1 or more numbers.
