Hello I'm having some problems with some code I am writing for a school and its not working. It wont run through the whole loop but all the code looks right to me. Does anyone have any ideas?
You're not testing what you think you are. Your expressions look like:In Python, {} encloses a set or dict (or comprehension of either). This is thus a set containing one bool value. Per truth value testing, any set that contains members is regarded as True, so your first test will be the only branch taken. Secondly, the inner (unchecked) condition tests User_Input_Length for simultaneously being 7 or greater and some other value; only the one with 7 could ever be true. 
Those braces are for defining sets, and a non-empty set always evaluates to true, so your code will always evaluate the first if.Python doesn't requires parenthesis (or braces) around if statements.
you must use parentheses for the parameters of the if condition, and be careful about the placement of your code blocks: unlike C which uses ; as a delimiter, python knows your block is over only because it jumps to the next line.
