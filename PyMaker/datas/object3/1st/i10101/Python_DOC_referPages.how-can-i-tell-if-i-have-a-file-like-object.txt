I want to have a function that writes data to a file:But sometimes, I have a file object instead of a file name. In this case, I sometimes have a tempfile.TemporaryFile (which creates a file-like object that's writable).I'd like to be able to write something like:What's a good way to do this?Also, does makes sense to do in Python?
While your approach is LBYL, it's pythonic to assume it's EAFP. So you could just try to write() to the file_thing you received oropen() itand except a potential exception, depending on which you feel better represents the default case.Edit: Cf ShadowRanger's comment for why mixing the exception handling with a context manager is rather unelegant here.
A function should do one thing, and do that one thing well. In the case of data_writer, its one thing is to write data to a file-like object. Let the caller worry about providing such an object. That said, you can also provide that caller in the form of a wrapper that takes a file name and opens it for data_writer.
