Natural Text
Is there a way to group words with a given length of letters in Python?I started working on this function:in the return list I want the words which have length:a <= lenght <= bso I was thinking:split the lines of the text in order to have the function operating on differents lines of the textremove the punctuation from the linesif in a line there are words which have the right lenght, the function must put them in the returnlist with a space between each word (e.g. 'cat dog'), otherwise the function put ''I know there is the splitlines() method, but I don't know how to use it (even after reading about it).I want to give an example of how the function has to work:This function should separate the lines:All in the golden afternoonFull leisurely we glide;For  both our oars,with little skill,By little arms are plied.--> delete the punctuation and return:I know I have to append the words to the return list, but I don't know how to proceed.
You could write a list comprehension like this:It would return all words in variable s (str) with character lengths between a (int) and b (int). An example on how to use it iswhere result would be:['golden', 'little', 'little', 'plied.']To get rid of the punctuation, just addabove the last line. The results are then:['golden', 'little', 'little']Hope this works for you!EDIT:If you want to search the different lines separately, I would suggest a solution like this:With your example string and preferred word lengths this would return ['golden', '', 'little', 'little'].
Your were on the right track when you where thinking about ranges. Here is how I would write your function.Create a function with three parameters: start and stop for the range, and sentence for the target sentence.Inside the function, create a list called word_list.Iterate over each line in the sentence by splitting the sentence via .splitlines().Filter out all punctuation characters from each line you iterate over.You then iterate over each word in the current line via list comprehension, and test if each word you iterate over is in a given range: tmp = [word for word in line.split() if start <= len(word) <= stop]. Assign the result of the list comprehnsion to a list called tmp.If the length of tmp is greater than onejoin each word in tmp by a space and add the joined string to the word_list.otherwise, if the tmp list is only one element longSimply add it to the word_listOtherwise if it is emptyAdd an empty string to word_listreturn word_listUsing the steps above, here i how I would write your function:Output:
