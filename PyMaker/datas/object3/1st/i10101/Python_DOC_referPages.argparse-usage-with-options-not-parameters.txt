If I am passing an boolean option to my script, which is basically true if the option is supplied and false if not, how do I process it differently with argparse than a parameter that holds value.For example, my script takes a parameter propFile, which holds a value and an option clean, which is just a true/false flag. The usage ismyScript.py --propFile=path/to/my/prop.file -cleanNote that I try to differentiate between parameters and options on the user level by assigning two dashes to the former and a single dash to the latter, which shouldn't matter to the interpreter.I want to assign scrptVarClean=True if -clean is provided and False if not.What I tried is:but I gotpgCloner.py: error: argument -clean: expected one argumentHow can I use an optional boolean argument with argparse?
Value of clean will be True if "--clean" or "-c" is supplied, else False
