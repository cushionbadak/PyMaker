So I'm having a problem with PyCharm and can't find a solution for it.It fails to recognize unresolved references: The image also shows that it fails to auto-complete request.session. It only happens with .session, it works with every other attribute.Also, this image shows that it does detect unresolved references for other stuff:I'm running it on a virtualenv, the interpreter is configured correctly and I have Django Support enabled.Oh, and I'm using Python3 and Django 1.10.2EDIT: Just tried it with other projects. It doesn't work with Django 1.10.x but works with Django 1.9.x
