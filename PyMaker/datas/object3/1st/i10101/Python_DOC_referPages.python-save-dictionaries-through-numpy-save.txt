This question already has an answer here:How to save dictionaries and arrays in the same archive (with numpy.savez)                    3 answers                I have a large data set (millions of rows) in memory, in the form of numpy arrays and dictionaries. Once this data is constructed I want to store them into files; so, later I can load these files into memory quickly, without reconstructing this data from the scratch once again.np.save and np.load functions does the job smoothly for numpy arrays.But I am facing problems with dict objects. See below sample. d2 is the dictionary which was loaded from the file. See #out[28] it has been loaded into d2 as a numpy array, not as a dict. So further dict operations such as get are not working.Is there a way to load the data from the file as dict (instead of numpy array) ?
It's a structured array. Use d2.item() to retrieve the actual dict object first:result: 
pickle module can be used. Example code:You may also save multiple python objects in a single pickled file. Each pickle.load call will load a single object in that case.
