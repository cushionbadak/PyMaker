I started with programming in python just a few months ago and I really love it.It's so intuitive and fun to start with.Data for starting point:I have a linux mashine on which runs python 3.2.3 I have three buttons on GUI to start a function with and one to stop that proccess or the proccesses (Idea).The source is as follows:I have tried while, and try with except, but the main problem is that the GUI (thinter) is not responding at that time during the process is running. It stores the input and runs it after the first function (printName1) is finished.I also looked here at stackoverflow, but the solutions didn't worked properly for me and they had the same issues with interrupting.I apologize for that (maybe) basic question, but I am very new in python and spend a few day of searching an trying. Is there a way to do that? The solution can maybe made with threading? But how?Any advise/help is really appreciated.Thanks a lot!
Use threading.Event
Also, you might want to look at using Tk.after. I found it much easier and more intuitive than threads. The after command takes the time in milliseconds to wait and then the command to run after the time.maybe this answer will help too: How do you create a Tkinter GUI stop button to break an infinite loop?
