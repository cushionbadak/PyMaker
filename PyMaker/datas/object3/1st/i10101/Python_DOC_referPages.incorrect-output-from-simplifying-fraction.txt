I have a simple code, written to simplify fractions in python. Putting in certain numbers (Such as shown in the code) give huge, and possibly incorrect values. Below is the code.And it outputs:Why does it do this, and how can I fix this?
I believe that you intended to use Fraction(36, 40).Notice the comma instead of the slash.What happens is that you input a division result instead of the numerator and denominator.There are quite a few ways to init the Fraction. Take a look at the docs.
