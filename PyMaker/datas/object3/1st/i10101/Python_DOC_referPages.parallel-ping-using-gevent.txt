I am new to python and I am trying to run this code to want parallel ping of multiple machines.but I can not ping all IP concurrently. seems it run one after another .can some one please guide me on how can i ping multiple server concurrently.
os.system is not patched, but subprocess.call is patched; Replace os.system with subprocess.call (You can also use subprocess.run if you are using Python 3.5+)
The problem is that os.system("ping -c 5 " + switch) is running synchronously, because the function is blocking. You should try to do it in different processes.Here is a concurrent code that does the same.
