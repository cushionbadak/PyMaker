As far as I know, while statement requires condition to work, but here it works without any; how's that possible? How does while q: work?The code is below:...
A while loop evaluates any expression it is given as a boolean. Pretty much everything in Python has a boolean value. Empty containers, such as set() generally evaluate to False, while non-empty containers, such as a set with at least one element, evaluate to True.while q: can therefore be read as "loop while q is not empty", i.e., "loop as long as q does not evaluate to boolean False".As an aside, instances of any class you write will usually evaluate to True. You can modify this by implementing a __bool__ method in your class that returns something else.Also, q = set() works fine. No need for q = set([]).
There is a condition. The loop will iterate as long as there is an element in set q.You would get a similar effect if you wrote:or evenHowever, these expressions could be viewed as perhaps a little redundant.
