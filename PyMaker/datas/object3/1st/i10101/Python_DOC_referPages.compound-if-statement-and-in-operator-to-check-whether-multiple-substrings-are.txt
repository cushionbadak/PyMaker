This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I am checking whether two substrings are contained in another string:This does not work, the if statement is already being entered when only one substring is part of the string. Can someone explain why?I found the following workaround, I'd simply like to know why Python behaves that way.
It doesn't work because (substr1 and substr2) return substr2 or operand which can convert to False and after this you verify if substr2 in str
So and works to check if two booleans (True/False values) are True, however (substr1 and substr2) is not a boolean. However, substr1 in str and substr2 in str and both booleans, so you can create a statement:Now inThe statement (substr in str for substr in substr_list) creates a generator that will return two boolean values. What all does is takes any iterable such a list of generator of booleans and returns a single boolean checking if they are all True.
