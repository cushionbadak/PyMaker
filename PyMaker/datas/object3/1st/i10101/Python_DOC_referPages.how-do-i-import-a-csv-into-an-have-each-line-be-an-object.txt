I have a csv file with 8-12 values per line, this is spending data with categories, payment method, date, amount etc.  Each line is a single purchase with these details.  I want to import the file into python into a list that I can then iterate through easily to find for example, how much was spent on a given category in a given month.  Is there a good method to create an object for a single purchase that has all of the attributes that I want and then do an import from a csv into a list of these objects?  
Python brings its own CSV reader in the csv module.You can use it to read your CSV file and convert the lines to objects like this:Please refer to the Python 2.7 or 3.x documentation for further details on the CSV module.
One tricky/hacky thing you can do with objects is programatically create them with dict.  Here is an example:So, yes, you could create an empty object, create a dict, then insert it into the empty object so you can use it like an object with set attributes.
