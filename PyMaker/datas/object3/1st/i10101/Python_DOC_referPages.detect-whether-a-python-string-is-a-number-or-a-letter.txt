This question already has an answer here:How to check if character in string is a letter? Python                    4 answers                How do I check if a string is a number (float)?                    32 answers                How can I detect either numbers or letters in a string? I am aware you use the ASCII codes, but what functions take advantage of them?
Check if string is positive digit (integer) and alphabetYou may use str.isdigit() and str.isalpha() to check whether given string is positive integer and alphabet respectively. Sample Results:Check for strings as positive/negative - integer/floatstr.isdigit() returns False if the string is a negative number or a float number. For example:If you want to also check for the negative integers and float, then you may write a custom function to check for it as:Sample Run:Discard "NaN" (not a number) strings while checking for numberThe above functions will return True for the "NAN" (Not a number) string because for Python it is valid float representing it is not a number. For example:In order to check whether the number is "NaN", you may use math.isnan() as:Or if you don't want to import additional library to check this, then you may simply check it via comparing it with itself using ==. Python returns False when nan float is compared with itself. For example:Hence, above function is_number can be updated to return False for "NaN" as:Sample Run:Allow Complex Number like "1+2j" to be treated as valid numberThe above function will still return you False for the complex numbers. If you want your is_number function to treat complex numbers as valid number, then you need to type cast your passed string to complex() instead of float(). Then your is_number function will look like:Sample Run:PS: Each operation for each check depending on the type of number comes with additional overhead. Choose the version of is_number function which fits your requirement.
For a string of length 1 you can simply perform isdigit() or isalpha()If your string length is greater than 1, you can make a function something like..
