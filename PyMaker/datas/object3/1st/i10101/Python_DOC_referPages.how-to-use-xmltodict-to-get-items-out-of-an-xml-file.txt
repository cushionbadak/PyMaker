I am trying to easily access values from an xml file.If i want to acces the value ABC123, how do I get it?
Using your example:If you examine doc, you'll see it's an OrderedDict, ordered by tag:The root node is called artikelen, and there a subnode artikel which is a list of OrderedDict objects, so if you want the code for every article, you would do:If you specifically want the code only when nummer is 121, you could do this:That said, if you're parsing XML documents and want to search for a specific value like that, I would consider using XPath expressions, which are supported by ElementTree.
This is using xml.etreeYou can try this:if you want to extract a specific code based on the attribute 'nummer' of artikel, then you can try this:this will print only the code you want.
To read .xml files :
You can use lxml package using XPath Expression. The thing to notice here is the expression. /artikelen is the root element. /artikel[1] chooses the first artikel element under root(Notice first element is not at index 0). /code is the child element under artikel[1]. You can read more about at lxml and xpath syntax.
