Good day!There is a question about iterating inside the generator dictionaries in python:It is necessary that the variable j increases until it vyrozhenie data are recorded:I'm new to python, so I apologize for the stupid question. I for a long time I fight over this trivial issue, but it should perform - because this problem needs to be put now.There is a class that deals piercing file csv:`import csvclass CSV():It parses the CSV type of file:street,city,zip,state,beds,baths,sq__ft,type,sale_date,price,latitude,longitude3526 HIGH ST,SACRAMENTO,95838,CA,2,1,836,Residential,Wed May 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008,59222,38.631913,-121.434879At the same time he has to do Dictionary type:csv_dict[key_select][key_select_val][num-element][element_csv_string]For example: csv_dict['zip']['95838'][1][3526 HIGH ST,SACRAMENTO,95838,CA,2,1,836,Residential,Wed May 21 00:00:00 EDT 2008,59222,38.631913,-121.434879Thanks in advance, and I apologize for the stupid questions.
Please , explain your question. I am not able to collect any reference of j in your code. And also the code seems wrongly constructed. Hope that helps!
