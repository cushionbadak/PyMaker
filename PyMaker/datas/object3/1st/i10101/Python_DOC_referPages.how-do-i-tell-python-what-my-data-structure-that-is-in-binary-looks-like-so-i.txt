I have a data set that looks like this.I have been reading around to try and find how do I implement a code into python that will allow me to parse this data so that I can plot some of the column against each other (Mostly time).Some things I found that may help in doing this:There is a code that will allow me to convert this data into a CSV file. I know how to use the code and convert it to a CSV file and plot from there, but for a learning experience I want to be able to do this without converting it to a CSV file. Now I tried reading that code but I am clueless since I am very new to python. Here is the link to the code:Also, Someone posted this saying this might be the log format, but again I couldn't understand or run any code on that page.
A good starting point for parsing binary data is the struct module https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html and it's unpack function. That's what the CSV dump routine you linked to is doing as well. If you walk through the process method, it's doing the following:Read a chunk of binary dataFigure out if it has a valid headerCheck the message type - if it's a FORMAT message parse that. If it'sa description message, parse that. Dump out a CSV rowYou could modify this code to essentially replace the __printCSVRow method with something that captures the data into a pandas dataframe (or other handy data structure) so that when the main routine is all done you can grab all the data from the dataframe and plot it.
