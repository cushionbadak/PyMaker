I'm just starting out with Python and wondering how I would go about sorting thislist from the earliest time to the latest.Any help is appreciated.
In python3 with standard library only:
I recommend that you install the PyPi DateTime package and use those facilities for whatever manipulation you desire.  The problem at hand would look something like:Implementation details are left as an exercise for the student.  :-)
If the times are always going to be in that format, you could split the times into subsections.To wrap it all up, use something like:If you're not guaranteed to have the two letters at the end, or the colon in the middle, you're best off using a library like what is suggested by Prune.
What you're showing isn't a list of times, it's a tuple of strings. Tuples are immutable and can't be sorted, only mutable collections like lists can be. So first you need to convert your tuple to a list:You could try sorting this list now, but the strings won't sort the way you expect. Instead, you need to create a custom sort function that will temporarily convert the values in the list to struct_time objects and sort using those.Now you can call sorted() and pass in your list and your custom comparison function and you'll get a list of strings back, sorted by the time in those strings:Note for Python 3: The previous example assumes Python 2. If you're using Python 3, you'll need to convert the comparison function to a key function. This can be done using functools.cmp_to_key() as follows:
