suppose we can and can only get the iterator of some iterable(L).and we can not know the length of L.Is that possible to print the iterable as:My try at it is as follows.
Here's one way to do it with itertools.groupby and itertools.count. groupby on the key function lambda _: next(c)//3 groups the items in the iterables in threes  in successions. The logic uses the integer division of the next object in the count item on 3:Output:
You can split the iterator into chunks of three, using chain and slice from itertools and a for loop, and then join them. The for loop will do most of what your try/while True/except construct is doing.However, if your iterator is just a list, you can just use range with a step parameter:
