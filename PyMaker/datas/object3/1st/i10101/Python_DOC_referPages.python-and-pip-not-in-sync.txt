I am working on a remote linux server with python 2.7.6 pre-installed. I want to upgrade to python 2.7.12 (because I am not able to install some libraries on the 2.7.6 due to some ssl error shown below).I downloaded and compiled from source and installed 2.7.12 and python2.7 opens 2.7.12. However, I still get an update python version warning while using pip. It seems the pip has not synced with 2.7.12 and continues to serve 2.7.6 and I am not able to find other installations of pip in system.I just want a working version of python2.7.x with pip/pip2/pip2.7 working properly.
Upgrade (and automatically reinstall) pip this way: The -m flag loads the corresponding module, and in the case of pip will execute pip (thanks to the power of the __main__ module inside the package).After installation, your current pip should also be up-to-date.Alternatively, you could run NB: be wary about which pip and python2 you're running: there'll probably be a /usr/bin/python and /usr/bin/pipnext to the ones you installed in/usr/local/. The ones in/usr/bin` should just be updated following the standard system updates, if at all.
Thanks @Evert , just before looking into your solution I tried,This fixed my issue and I was able to install libraries to 2.7.12 using pip/pip2.7I was earlier trying python2.7 -m pip install package-name and I was getting pip not found.
