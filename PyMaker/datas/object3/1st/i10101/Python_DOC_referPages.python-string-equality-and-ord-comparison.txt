I want this piece of code to print "second". I tried these inputss1 = ".0" and s2 = "0.00"Could anyone please explain in brief what "if all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2)):" means exactly?I understand that it relates to string equality as well as comparing the ord() on strings and wanted to know how these are different.Thanks in advance for any help.PS : Please excuse the indentation. Python beginner here!
There's no 100% sure way of making that piece of code print second, since interning is an implementation detail.CPython interns integers in the [-5, 256] range,So you'll need a character that when it's passed to ord returns something > 256.all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2)) checks if every ord(c1) has the same id as ord(c2).From the id documentation:Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory.
In plain english, if all(ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2)) means that ALL the values of ord(s1[i]) and ord(s2[i]) for i ranging from 0 to len(s1 or s2) (where c1 and c2 if the reference for ord(s1[i]) and ord(s2[i])) is same for both the listsCheck zip() document. As per the document:zip() returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th  element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. The returned  list is truncated in length to the length of the shortest argument  sequenceFor example:Now [ord(c1) is ord(c2) for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2)] will return the tuple list of True/False value based on the condition ord(c1) is ord(c2) where c1 and c2 are tuple pair from the previous list of tuple returned by zip().Now the last part. if all() will return True if the list [ ... ] of True/False value mentioned above will be having all the values as True. In case any single item is as False, all() will return the value as False
