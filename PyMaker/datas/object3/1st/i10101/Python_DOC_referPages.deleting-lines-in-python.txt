Alternatively, I tried this, but it doesnt seem to get rid of the rows that have blank spaces (blank rows included in the number of rows I'd like to delete). Meanwhile, the code above appears to get rid of those blank spaces, but there is line termination.
Use fileinput.input() with the inplace update file option:This will skip the first skip_rows rows of the input file and overwrite it without you having to manage writing and moving a temporary file.(You can omit importing print_function if you are using Python 3)
There are quite a few ways to grab input from a command line tool (which is what I am inferring you wrote).  Here are a couple:Option 1:  created in a file called out.pyuse sys.argvThen run it by passing in an argument (note index 1, script is index 0)Option 2:A potentially better way is to use a commandline tool framework like click:  http://click.pocoo.org/5/.  This has almost everything you could ever want to do, and they handle much of the hard logic for you.
You can prompt the user with a simple while loop and listen into standard input or using the input() function. As to your question on how to delete lines in a file, you can read in the file as a list of lines.You can then write back into the file everything past the lines you want to skip by using list slicing.Also I am pretty sure similar questions have been asked before, try to Google or search Stack Overflow for your question or a subset of your question next time.P.S. I also want to add that if you are reading a very large file, it would be better if you read a line at a time, and outputted to a separate file. For a large enough file, you might run out of RAM to hold the file in memory.
Firstly I have opened up the csv file [...]Did you consider to use pandas to process your data?If so, pandas.read_csv, allows to skip lines using the skiprows parameter.
You will typically use an iterator to read files. You could do something like this:
