So I'm trying to define a function so that the elements of a listelements = ['H', 'N', 'C', 'O'] equal to the elements in another list in the same positionsmolarMass = [1.00794, 14.0067, 12.0107, 15.9994]So that H = 1.00794, N = 14.0067, etc..Edit:trying to define a function example:elementMolarMass(elementSymbol)that when used will look like this elementMolarMass('H')and it returns the corresponding element from the first list and match with the element in the other list that is in the same position1.00794.Not sure how to even begin with that.
You could bind them with dictionary comprehensionOr if you want to abstract it with operations and use / interact with the data further, probably should use a class?Which will generate a new list of elements that you may use. And output:H = 1.00794N = 14.0067C = 12.0107O = 15.9994
You can create a dictionary if it works for you:It'll give you the result:Or if you want it as a list of strings:Or in one string:After your update it's easier to use dictionary like this:Result:
You can either build a dict out of it like other answers suggest, or you can use the less efficient list lookup and use the resulting index against the second list:
