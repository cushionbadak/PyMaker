Natural Text
I've met words such as  top-level modules and top-level packages in Python documentation several times. This is the documentation about such concepts.What does these words mean?
Modules can be nested inside each other. For example os.path is a path module nested inside os module. Top level module is the topmost one. I this case, it's an os module.
