Say you have a list value like this: spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats'] Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 'and' inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats', but your function should be able to work with any list value passed to itMy cod is below. When running, it shows TypeError and print(value, sep = ', ') won't work; They are not separated with comma and space.
You have to specify the range value with range(stop)or range(start, stop[, step]). Maybe range(len(value)) if value is a list.You get the exception TypeError: 'type' object is not iterable because you are referencing the class range instead of calling it.
You need a start and an end point for the FOR loop.eg. this will return "This is printed" 10 times.
Here is the code which does that
