I'm currently writing a simulation in python 3.4 (miniconda).The entire simulation is quite fast but the measurement of some simulation data is bloody slow and takes about 35% of the entire simulation time. I hope I can increase the performance of the entire simulation if I could get rid of that bottleneck. I spend quite some time to figure out how to do that but unfortunately with little success. The function MeasureValues is called in every period of the simulation run.If anybody has an idea how to improve the code, I would be really grateful.Thank you guys.
The code looks basic enough that there aren't any obvious gaps for optimisation without substantial restructuring (which I don't know enough about your overall architecture to suggest).Try installing cython - I believe nowadays you can install it with pip install cython - then use it to see if you can speed up your code any.
As stated in the comments the function is quite simple, and with the provided code I don't see a way to optimize it directly.You can try different approaches:PyPy, this may works depending on your current codebase and external dependecies.Cython as suggested by holdenweb, but you need to redefine a lot of stuff to be static-typed (using cdef) or nothing will change.rewrite the function in C as a Python extension, this may take some time, especially if you have no experience in C programming.The PyPy way seems the most reasonable, if it works you will gain a boost for all the simulations code.
