This question already has an answer here:Split a list into chunks determined by a separator                    3 answers                I have to write a function that takes a list(or string) and and object and returns the copy of the list up to but not including the first occurrence of that object, or all the elements if that object is not in the list. I know I have to use a loop here but what I'm confused at is lists and strings use different methods for finding the index of that object. How can I use that with the loops to get my function up to the first occurrence of that object. 
Try the following function:    This will return the sequence seq if obj is not in that sequence, and will return the sequence up to, but not including obj otherwise. However, this function as it is will break if you are not careful about types. For example, it will work if you are looking for 5 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (and return [1, 2, 3, 4]), but will raise an error if you look for 5 in a string.
Consider itertools already has a feature for this:I'm unclear if you want to match on the identity of an object or its equality (as in the __eq__ operator), but in the above lambda I'm using identity.
