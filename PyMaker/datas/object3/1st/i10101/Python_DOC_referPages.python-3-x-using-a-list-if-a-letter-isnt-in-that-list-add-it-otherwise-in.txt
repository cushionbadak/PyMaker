so this is what I'm doing: I'm pulling up a file and having the program read it. Every time it encounters a letter, it'll add the letter to list1 and add '1' to list2. Every time it encounters a letter in list1, it'll increment list2 by 1. the problem I'm running into is that when running this, I get the following error:line 14, lettercount[letters] = 1TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not strI assumed I could get away with stating that at list[letter] set that value to a number, but it isn't liking it. any possible hints on what to do?
That line of your function essentially tries to do something like this:which doesn't really make any sense. Lists are ordered collections and are only accessible via numerical index, which is why you get an error telling you that an integer is required (not a string). As the other answers mentioned, you really want to store the count for each letter in a dict. The Python standard library provides a Counter dict subclass which is actually perfect for your needs - it'll count the characters for you and make it easy to remove duplicates:
Lists work with integer indexes, you can use a dictionary instead:Dictionaries have the capacity to store key, values objects, so you can use not numeric keys to acees values. Their use is similar to the lists so you can still use:to add or update a key in the dictionary, however they are not iterable as lists, you have to iterate them using keys or iteritems methods.To print the results you can iterate over the keys and display the count:
lettercount should be type dict, not list. Type dict maps a unique key to a value, while list just contains values.The value within brackets for a list should be an integer referring to a position in the list, while a dictionary will reference the key in brackets.
