What does this line mean?code is from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/2_fullyconnected.ipynb
In numpy, the == operator means something different when comparing two numpy arrays (as is being done in that line of note), so yes, it is overloaded in that sense. It compares the two numpy arrays elementwise and returns a boolean numpy array of the same size as the two inputs. The same is true for other comparisons like >=, <, etc.E.g. 
For Numpy arrays the == operator is a element-wise operation which returns a boolean array. The astype function transforms the boolean values True to 1.0 and False to 0.0 as stated in the comment.
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#value-comparisons describes value comparisons like ==.  While the default comparison is an identity x is y, it first checks if either argument implements an __eq__ method.  Numbers, lists, and dictionaries implement their own version.  And so does numpy.What's unique about the numpy __eq__ is that it does, if possible an element by element comparison, and returns a boolean array of the same size.A common SO question is 'why do I get this ValueError?'That's because the comparison produces this array which has more than one True/False value.Comparison of floats is also a common problem. Check out isclose and allclose it that issue comes up.
