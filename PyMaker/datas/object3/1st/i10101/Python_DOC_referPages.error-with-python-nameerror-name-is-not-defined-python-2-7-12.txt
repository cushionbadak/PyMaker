This seems to happen on every program which requires an input.
You need to use raw_input() as opposed to input() as you are using Python 2.x.In Python 2.x input() will will try and evaluate your input whereas raw_input() will return a string which you can use. Hope this helps! 
Change input to raw_input which returns a string.On Python 2.x input tries to evaluate its input, while raw_input returns a string. On Python 3 input replaces raw_input
If you want to pass a string into name from what the user types, you should use raw_input() instead of input().
Difference between raw_input() and input():  In Python2.x:input() is looking for an expression. if you give 1+1 to input(), it will evaluate it and return 2.jeff being not an expression, it will throw an error.if input is "jeff" or 'jeff', input() will return the same string.raw_input() is looking for a string. if you give 1+1 to raw_input(), it will return "1+1"(string).if you give jeff to raw_input(), it will return "jeff".In Python3.x:raw_input() is renamed as input() and raw_input() is removed.
