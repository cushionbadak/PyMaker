Good evening, StackOverflow. Lately, I've been wrestling with a Python program which I'll try to outline as briefly as possible. In essence, my program plots (and then fits a function to) graphs. Consider this graph.The graph plots just fine, but I'd like it to do a little more than that: since the data is periodic over an interval OrbitalPeriod (1.76358757), I'd like it to start with our first x value and then iteratively plot all of the points  OrbitalPeriod away from it, and then do the same exact thing over the next region of length OrbitalPeriod. I know that there is a way to slice lists in Python of the formwhere a and b are the indices of the first and last elements you'd like to include in the new list, respectively. However, I have no idea what the indices are going to be for each of the values, or how many values fall between each OrbitalPeriod-sized interval. What I want to do in pseudo-code looks something like this.croppedList = fullList on the domain [a + (N * OrbitalPeriod), a + (N+1 * OrbitalPeriod)] where a is the x-value of the first meaningful data point.If you have a workaround for this or a cropping method that would accept values instead of indices as arguments, please let me know. Thanks!
If you are working with numpy, you can use it inside the brackets
