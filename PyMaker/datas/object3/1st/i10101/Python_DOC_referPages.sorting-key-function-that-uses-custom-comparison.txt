This question already has an answer here:How to use a custom comparison function in Python 3?                    5 answers                Python 3 removes the cmp parameter to sorting functions:builtin.sorted() and list.sort() no longer accept the cmp argument providing a comparison function. Use the key argument instead.That's fine for orderings that can be determined just by inspecting a single item in the sequence (e.g. key=str.lower). But what about custom orderings that must have two items for inspection to determine their ordering?That two-parameter cmp function can't be replaced with a one-parameter key function, can it?
Use the functools.cmp_to_key helper.The Python 3 sorting functions take a ‘key’ parameter:key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a  comparison key from each list element: key=str.lower. The default  value is None (compare the elements directly).The functools.cmp_to_key helper is designed to help you transition tothat style:functools.cmp_to_key(func)Transform an old-style comparison function to a key function. […]  This function is primarily used as a transition tool for programs  being converted from Python 2 which supported the use of comparison  functions.This works in the latest Python 2 and Python 3.The trick is done by creating a key function that takes an item forcomparison, and returns a custom object, which knows how to compareitself as specified by your comparison function.See the Sorting HOWTO for this and other tricks.
