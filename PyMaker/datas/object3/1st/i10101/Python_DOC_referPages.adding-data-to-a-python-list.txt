I've just started playing around with python lists, I've written the simple code below expecting the printed file to display the numbers [12,14,16,18,20,22] but only 22 is displayed. Any help would be great.
You need to set up datapoints outside your loop, and then inside your loop, append each additional datum to datapoints
Joel already answered but if you want a more compact code you can use rangeor if you only want to print the numbers you can do
you can achieve the expected list as output by using the range() method. It takes three parameters, start, stop and step. Note that, in python 3 the range() is a sequence-type. So, you will have to cast it to list in python 3
