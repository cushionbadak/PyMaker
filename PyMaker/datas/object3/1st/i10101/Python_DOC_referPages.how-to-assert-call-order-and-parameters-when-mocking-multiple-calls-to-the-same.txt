I have multiple calls to the same mock and I want to check each calls parameters and order in which it was called.E.g. if I needed to check just the last call, I would use this:However I want to do this for each call.I've managed to do that, like this:mycode.pytest_mycode.pyThis works, but I'm a little concerned about my assertEqual methods on call parameters. I feel like there's a better way of doing this. I'm still fairly new to mocking so any suggestions would be appreciated.
You probably want to use the Mock.assert_has_calls method.By default, assert_has_calls will check that the calls happen in the proper order.  If you don't care about the order, you can use the any_order keyword argument (set to True).
