In this simple Python code if the value of a is changed from 0 then there will be a NameError showing that b is undefined. However, if the else clause is never executed, the error remains hidden. How can I detect these kind of errors?
pylint is able to find a lot of common (and not so common) errors in python code without executing it, example output from your example:The line you're interested in here is: E:  5,10: Undefined variable 'b' (undefined-variable)
There are two ways to achieve this:Either include such statements within the try/except block. For example:Use may also use traceback to get all the information related to raised Exception.If you want this behavior at the scope of function, create a decorator and use that decorator with the functions you need this behavior.
