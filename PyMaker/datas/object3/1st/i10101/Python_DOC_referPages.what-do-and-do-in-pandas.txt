I frequently see code like this at work:My question is what do operators such as &=, |=, and ~ do in pandas?
From the documentationThe operators are: | for or, & for and, and ~ for not. These must be  grouped by using parentheses.Augmented assignment statementsAn augmented assignment evaluates the target (which, unlike normal  assignment statements, cannot be an unpacking) and the expression  list, performs the binary operation specific to the type of assignment  on the two operands, and assigns the result to the original target.  The target is only evaluated once.just like a += 1 increments a, a &= b compares a and b and assigns the result to a.And a pandas exampleLet's generate a dataframe of zeros and ones.Our initial dataframeThe 4th row of a and bNow evaluate and assign row 4Row 4 of a has changed. Only where both rows have 1 at the same position a 1 is written back to a.
