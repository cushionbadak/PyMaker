Pardon me if this is a really simple question. I've been at this for hours. I'm trying to read a csv file per row. However on the last row I don't want it to append any "," that's why I had separated the problem in an if-elif statement.I'm not sure if this is just me sleepy but I can't seem to fix this simple matter. It doesn't enter in any condition yet when I print out the print (iter, row_count , iter < row_count) I'm 100% sure that the last row is False.
anddon't do what you think they do. Python syntax allows chaining of comparisons, so something like is equivalent toThis is a very handy feature, but it means that your iter < row_count == True is equivalent toSo you should change that if statement toand change the elif to a plain else:
Donâ€™t use the if and let join do the work for you:Update:  after seeing your entire snippet, I would recommend letting python do your JSON formatting?  Use json.dump
You should use like this:And read about order of execution in logical expressionAnd yes, you don't need to use comparaison with False and True
Order of operations.In Python,because that resolves as (1 < 2) and (2 == True) or True and FalseYou don't need to compare the result of < to True. Just use it directly, if iter < row_count, and you should be fine.Also, this is not the best way to do this - most trivially, everything but the prints is the same in both cases, so you could do everything but the prints once and put only the prints in the conditionals. If you're willing to do more refactoring, others have suggested other ways.
I think this will fix your issue.  Just remove the ',' after you are done iterating through the data Additionally, look at enumerate().  You use it like this
First of all you should consider some value for row_count which is not mentioned in the provided code, so in this way you don't need to compare it to True or False. then, it's better to change the iter value after performing if or elifEDIT:Therefore ietr is eqaul to row_count. I think it'is not a right way to compare a Boolean value like row_count with an integer unless you define TRUE or FALSE as macros.
