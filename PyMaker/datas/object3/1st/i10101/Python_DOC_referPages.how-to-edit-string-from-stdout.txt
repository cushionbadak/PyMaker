I have this code:and output is this: How to get output like this "Success The hosted network stopped."?
Reading from a sub-process gives you a bytestring. You could either decode this bytestring (you'll have to find a suitable encoding), or use the universal_newlines option and have Python automatically decode it for you:From the Frequently Used Arguments documentation section:If universal_newlines is True, these file objects will be opened as text streams in universal newlines mode using the encoding returned by locale.getpreferredencoding(False). For stdin, line ending characters '\n' in the input will be converted to the default line separator os.linesep. For stdout and stderr, all line endings in the output will be converted to '\n'. For more information see the documentation of the io.TextIOWrapper class when the newline argument to its constructor is None.For a process run via the shell, locale.getpreferredencoding(False) should be exactly the right codec to use, as that gets the information on what encoding to use from the exact same location that other processes like netsh are supposed to consult, the locale environment variables.With universal_newlines=True, output will be set to the string 'The hosted network stopped. \n\n'; note the newlines at the end. You may want to usestr.strip()` to remove the extra whitespace there:
That is a bytestring. Change your code to make that a str:
