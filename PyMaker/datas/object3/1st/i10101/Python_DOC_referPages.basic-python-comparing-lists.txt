This is all I have so far: I don't think this is close to right. I want it to compare the actual result to what the function previously gives out as a result, then output whether the result was the same, being 'correct' or not 'incorrect' then output how many tests worked correctly against the function. I can't get my head around the if statement.Thanks for the help!   
Fixed your code based on what I thought you wanted to do with some comments on what was changed and why:This prints out:I think you were mistaking on how to print things out with variable assignment to the string, I vaguely remember a language that had that had a similar syntax with what you were doing. You error is basically trying to call a str object like a function. Since you took other programming language, I think you should know what's wrong with that statementEdited:
You're treating str1 and str2 like functions, when you're really just passing str objects, which, according to your error, are not callable (i.e. don't work as functions).Are you trying to accept input? If so, use str1 = input("String 1 : ") and so on.Otherwise, if you're trying to format output, use this:
