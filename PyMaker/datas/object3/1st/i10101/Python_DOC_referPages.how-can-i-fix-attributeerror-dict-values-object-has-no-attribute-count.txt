Natural Text
here is my code and the text file is hereI want to plot degree distribution web graph how can i change dict to solve?
In Python3 dict.values() returns "views" instead of lists:dict methods dict.keys(), dict.items() and dict.values() return "views" instead of lists.  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.htmlTo convert the "view" into a list, simply wrap in_degrees.values() in a list():
The error is obvious dict_values object has no attribute count. If you want to count the number of unique values, the best way to go is using a collections.Counter
If you want to count dictionary values you can do it like this:same method works for keysAlso keep in mind if you want to get all keys or values in list just use list(dict.values())
