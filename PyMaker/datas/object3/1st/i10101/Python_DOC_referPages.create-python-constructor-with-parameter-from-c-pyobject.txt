I have got this far.But I am getting error Exception TypeError: 'argument list must be tuple' in module 'threading' from '/usr/lib64/python2.7/threading.pyc'How can I achieve from import statement to a.print_name("John") from C++? Any help is appreciated.

The error you're getting is because the argument to PyInstance_New should be a tuple. There are multiple ways to call functions or methods. Here is a complete example using one of them:For more information see Python pure-embedding.
