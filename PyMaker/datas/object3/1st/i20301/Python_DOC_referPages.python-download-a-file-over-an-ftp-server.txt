If you want to keep using the requests library, there is a requests-ftp package that adds FTP capability to requests. I've used this library a little and it does work. The docs are full of warnings about code quality though. As of 0.2.0 the docs say "This library was cowboyed together in about 4 hours of total work, has no tests, and relies on a few ugly hacks".
Try using the wget library for python. You can find the documentation for it here.
urllib2.urlopen handles ftp links.
urlretrieve is not work for me, and the official document said that They might become deprecated at some point in the future.
