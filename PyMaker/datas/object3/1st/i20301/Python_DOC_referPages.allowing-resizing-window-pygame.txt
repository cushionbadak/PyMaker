I am trying to allow resizing for this app, I put the RESIZABLE flag, but when I try to resize, it messes up! Try my code.It is a grid program, when the window resizes I want the grid to also resize/shrink. Please tell me whats wrong, thanks.
You are not updating your width, height, or size when the window changes.From the docs: http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.htmlIf the display is set with the pygame.RESIZABLE flag,  pygame.VIDEORESIZE events will be sent when the user adjusts the  window dimensions.You can get the new size, w, h from the event VIDEORESIZE http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html
The answer for this problem (allow the Pygame window and the surface inside it to resize) is simply to recreate the resizable window with an updated size, when the user changes its dimensions (done on pygame.VIDEORESIZE events).This removes all previous content on the window surface, so belowthere's a process to continue with the current window content.Some example code:How to continue with the current window content:Here's some steps to add back the previous window content:make a second variable, set to the value of the old window surface variable.create the new window, storing it as the old variable.draw the second surface onto the first one (old variable) - use the blit function.use this variable and delete the new variable (optional, use del) to not use extra memory.Some example code for the above steps (replaces pygame.VIDEORESIZE event if statement):
