I'm rather new to programming, but what I want to do is basically this:If I have 2 lists:I want to count how many of a specific item in ls1 is equal to an item on the same position on ls2.But the counting need to be separated for each item. I don't want the "total" of any matches, but specific for each string. So let's say I want to know how many "red" match. It would give me the answer 2, because the position [0] and [1] of both lists are "red". If I want "black" it would give me 1, since only in the position [3] both match as "black".I tried to figure out by myself and did a lot of search in this forums but couldn't find an answer for this specific problem. I don't even know where to start. =/
To iterate a sequence in Python, you use a for-loop.To iterate two sequences in parallel,  you use zip.To store the results, use a dictionary, which maps unique keys to values.When you don't know if a key in a dict is present or not, you can supply a default value by using dict.get.Putting all these pieces together:
As a follow up to wim's answer, you can also create a Counter from a list that only has elements that are equal at the same index:
The general approach is to iterate through the lists, and increase the count of matches whenever you find one. Following is a solution in python with comments
In case you would like to count all occurrences without specifically items being at the corresponding index, Then this might help 
If you can use a 3rd party library, here's a fun way with Pandas:
