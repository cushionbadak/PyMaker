How do I convert a Python memoryview to bytes?For example:
Python's memoryview has a tobytes() method that allows you to do just that. You're also able to call bytes() on the object.Keep in mind that converting a memoryview object to bytes copies the data, and you're able to use memoryview in most places either way. I wouldn't suggest you to convert.
