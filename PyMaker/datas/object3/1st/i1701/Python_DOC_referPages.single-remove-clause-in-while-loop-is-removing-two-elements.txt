I am writing a simple secret santa script that selects a "GiftReceiver" and a "GiftGiver" from a list. Two lists and an empty dataframe to be populated are produced:I then have a while loop that selects random elements from each list to pick a gift giver and receiver, then remove from the respective list:The final dataframe only contains three elements instead of six:returnsI have inserted two print lines within the while loop to investigate. These print the length of the list santaslist_receivers before and after the removal of an element. The expected return is to see original list length on the first print, then minus 1 on the second print, then the same length again on the first print of the next iteration of the while loop, then so on. Specifically I expect:What is returned isWhich is consistent with the DataFrame having only 3 rows, but I do not see the cause of this.What is the error in my code or my approach?
You can solve it by simply changing this lineto Python variables are pointers essentially so they refer to the same list , ie santaslist_givers and santaslist_receivers were accessing the same location in memory in your implementation . To make them different use a list function And for some extra information , you can refer copy.deepcopy
You should make an explicit copy of your list herethere are multiple options for doing this as explained in this question.In this case I would recommend (if you have Python >= 3.3):If you are on an older version of Python, the typical way to do it is:
