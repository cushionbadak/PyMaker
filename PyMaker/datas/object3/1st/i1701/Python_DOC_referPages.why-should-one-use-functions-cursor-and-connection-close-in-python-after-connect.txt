Im trying to understand the need for a cursor() and connection close() functions within a python script when you are trying to connect to a SQL database.I currently have the following code and it works fine:However, some are using the following which I am not sure why:In addition to this question, is there a more efficient way of writing the code ive inserted up there ? thank you
When you create a connection or a cursor, there are resources that are created and represented by that cursor. If you don't close them, then those resources could stay around longer than necessary and potentially leak. It's good hygiene.As for efficiency, python has with blocks that work with context managers to make this easier. At the end of a with block the __exit__ method is called which usually defers to close (though for the pyodbc connection object it doesn't).
