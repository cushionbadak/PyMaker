I'm having problems creating indexes for a 2d array from the position of a mouse click. The program is supposed to work by checking the mouse click position against every square in the array (squares) which is only 1d. Squares is an array of objects from a class called square, which is drawn on the screen. The 2d array is an array of ones and zeros that is randomly generated to a user inputted size.It should only create the new index if the mouse click position is inside a square, and only generate the index for that square.However the program is generating the 2d array indexes for every square in the 1d array instead of just the square where the mouse click is.So how would I get this code to work as intended?
It looks like you just need to remove the nested loop and use the index n to access the current square:The idiomatic way to iterate over the indices and the items at the same time is to enumerate the list:If you're dealing with a grid, you can also just floor divide the mouse coordinates by the tilesize to get the indices. Then just convert the 2D indices to a 1D index in this way: i = x + width*y. That means you don't have to iterate over the squares anymore to check for collisions.Here's an example with a list of pygame.Rects and colors that you can change by clicking on a cell:
