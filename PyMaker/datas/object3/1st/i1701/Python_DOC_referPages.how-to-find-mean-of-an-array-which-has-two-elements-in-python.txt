I need to find mean of an array which is like: [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('a', 4), ('b', 6)]Result should be like; [('a', 4.5), ('b', 4)]
Raw solution without additional libraries could look like this:
You can put all your tuples in a defaultdict, using the first value to group them into a list and then calculate the mean:
We can use pandas for this:this will give us:or we can convert this to a list of 2-tuples with:which gives:The above is thus more a "declarative" approach: we specify what we want, not much how we want to do this.
You can collect the numbers with a collections.defaultdict(), then apply statistics.mean() on each group of numbers:You can also use itertools.groupby() to group the tuples:
If you wish, you can also try the below reusable code (without using any external libraries).
