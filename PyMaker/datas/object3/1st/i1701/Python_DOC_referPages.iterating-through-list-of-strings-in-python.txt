I am trying to wrap my head around why the top code works and the bottom code does not. They are both for loops, just written differently, that appear to do the same thing but the second one fails with 'int object is not iterable'.  Maybe I am missing something obvious herethis worksthis does not work
Problem with the second approachThis makes sense, since here if you call this with, for example longestWord(['these', 'are', 'some', 'strings']), then in the first iteration s will be 'these'.Now if we call max(len(s)) that thus means that Python will first evaluate len(s) which is len('these') and thus 5, and then we call max(..), on 5. But 5 is not an iterable (a list, generator, or any "collection" of values). Calculating the "maximum of 5" is strange, so hence the error.Even if Python would allow to, for one non-iterable, just return that element, it would still not work, since that means that it would return the length of the first element.Why the first approach worksIn the first implementation:you construct an iterable: (len(s) for s in words) is not a for loop, it is a generator that, when you iterate over it, will yield the lengths of the words. The thus max(..) takes as first (and only) argument an iterable of integers. This means that the max(..) function will iterate over this iterable, and keep track of the maximum. When the generator is "exhausted", it returns the maximum object it has seen.
Firstly, you are returning as soon as you get the first word in your list of words. Secondly, len() gives you an integer of how long the thing you call it on is. So, doing max(len(whatever)) you'd be getting the max of a single number, which is why you get the error you do. The reason this works in your first example:max(len(s) for s in words)is because len(s) for s in words is giving you an iterable, from which you can get the max element. 
Because max() works on an iterable or two numbers, if you check the definition of the max() method. And when you do like max(len(s)) its not a iterable object nor arguments are two integers, its just an integer value.
