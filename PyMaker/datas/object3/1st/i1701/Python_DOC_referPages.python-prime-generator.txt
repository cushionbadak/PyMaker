Yes, I know there are a ton of these out there, and my question has probably already been answered somewhere I have not seen. However, I am still having difficulty and am unsure as to what to do.The problem is the nested iteration does not work, it reaches 'here 1', and that's it. I have also printed y and i- which print the correct values, yet it seems to not do anything.Many thanks to those helping- please be patient, I much prefer Javascript.
You have missunderstand python's operators:As pointed out here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operationsThe operator & yields the bitwise AND of its arguments, which must be integers.What you should use is the "and" logical operator.Another thing that you should care is about operator precedence: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedenceAbout the logic of your code, as long as you discover new prime numbers you can use them to divide (perform modulus operation) too much faster (fewer steps), because every number can decompose in a prime factors product. I dont give you an example, because i don't know excatly what do you want to achieve, if you give an example of what do you need I can make it.
