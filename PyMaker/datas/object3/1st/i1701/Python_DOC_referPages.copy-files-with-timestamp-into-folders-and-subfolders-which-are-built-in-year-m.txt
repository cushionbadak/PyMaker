I have a question. I have files in different folders and subfolders. I have created a new file system in a new environment by year, month and day. I want to save the files there, I would like to read the files according to their timestamps and store them automatically in the designated folders. How do you do that best?
Here is my solution:It will walk recursively your directory structure and move all files to another directory named by YEAR/MONTH/DAY of file modification.Docs:  os.walk() os.makedirs()
You can simply use datetime to format timestamp to string and then define you folder name
