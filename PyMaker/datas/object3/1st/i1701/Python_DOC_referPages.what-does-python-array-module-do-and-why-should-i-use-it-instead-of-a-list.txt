I have recently stumbled across the "array" module in python. i saw it used something like this: what does line 2 do? why should i use "array" instead of a simple list?
The difference between an array and a list is that the type of object stored in the array container is constrained. In line 2:You are initializing an array of signed ints. A list allows you to have a combination of varying datatypes (both custom and basic) if desired. For example: You would choose to use an array over a list for efficiency purposes if you can assure the datatype found in the array to all be the same and of a certain, basic type.
