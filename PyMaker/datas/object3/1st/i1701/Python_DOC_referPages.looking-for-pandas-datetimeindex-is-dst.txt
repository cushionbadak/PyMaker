Or Do I need to covert to a different 'datetime' class?I need something general - i.e. work for any timezone including say 'Australia/Brisbane' which doesn't have daylight savings. I'd prefer not to have to parse out the timezone offset and try and determine if it's summer / winter.
It have in pandas After a small change can yield the Boolean 
I'm guessing that Wen's method may be a bit faster, but heres a way of working with the underlying Python datetime objects with the isdst attribute from datetime.timetuple:Example for a single value:.timetuple() returns a time.struct_time; The tm_isdst flag of the result is set according to the dst() method: tzinfo is None or dst() returns None, tm_isdst is set to -1; else if dst() returns a non-zero value, tm_isdst is set to 1; else tm_isdst is set to 0.The constructor will simply check if the date's .dst() attribute is None, nonzero, or some nonzero value:
