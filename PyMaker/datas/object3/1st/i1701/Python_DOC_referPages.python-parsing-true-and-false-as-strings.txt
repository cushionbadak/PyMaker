This question already has an answer here:Converting from a string to boolean in Python?                    27 answers                Is there a way in python to parse the string 'True' as True (boolean) and 'False' as False (boolean)?I know I could do bool('True') or bool('False') but each would be True
Use ast.literal_eval:If you do type(ast.literal_eval('False')), you see <class 'bool'>:You could also write your own function that returns 'True' as boolean True, 'False' as boolean False and if you supply any other input, it returns the same back:Now, you call as:
In this case I would not recommend ast.literal_eval or eval. The best thing to do is probably this:"True" will return True and "False" will return False.
