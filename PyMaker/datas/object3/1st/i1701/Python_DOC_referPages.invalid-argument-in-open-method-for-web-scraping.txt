Natural Text
I am trying to scrape some data from the ancestry, I have a .net background but thought i'd try a bit of python for a project.I'm falling at the first step, Firstly i am trying to open this page and then just print out the rows.I am getting an illegal argument on open. 
According to documentation, open is used to:Open [a] file and return a corresponding file object.As such, you cannot use it for downloading the HTML contents of a webpage. You probably meant to use requests.get as follows:Here are a few recommendation to improve your code as well:requests.get provides many useful parameters, one of them being params, which allows you to provide the URL parameters in the form of a Python dictionary. If you need to verify whether the request was successful before accessing its text, then just check if the returned response.status_code == requests.codes.ok. This only covers status code 200, but if you need more codes, then response.raise_for_status should be helpful.
