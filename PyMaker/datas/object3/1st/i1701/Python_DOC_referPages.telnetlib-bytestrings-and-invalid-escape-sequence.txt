I'm using telnetlib.expect() to interface with a device that responds in bytestrings, apparently. Unless I use bytestrings in the regex passed to expect() (either precompiled, or literals), an exception is generated: TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object. However, pycodestyle complains this is W605 invalid escape sequence '\d', and further reading makes me think this will become a Python syntax error in the future.In summary:Is there a way through this, or is pycodestyle simply wrong?(BTW, can't seem to suppress the W065 in pycodestyle, other than suppressing all warnings.)
Bytestring literals use \ as an escape character the same way string literals do. So similar to them you have to either use a raw bytestring literal rb'\d' or use double backslash b'\\d'.From https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literalsIn plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching  single quotes (') or double quotes ("). They can also be enclosed in  matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally  referred to as triple-quoted strings). The backslash (\) character is  used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such  as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.
