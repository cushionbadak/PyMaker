I just installed sklearn using pip. When I try to import anything I get an AttributeError.Full output:     Traceback (most recent call last):       test.py",  line 1, in       from sklearn import cluster       File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\sklearn\cluster__init__.py",  line 6, in       from .spectral import spectral_clustering, SpectralClustering   File  "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\sklearn\cluster\spectral.py",  line 15, in       from ..metrics.pairwise import pairwise_kernels   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\sklearn\metrics__init__.py",  line 7, in       from .ranking import auc   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\sklearn\metrics\ranking.py",  line 27, in       from scipy.stats import rankdata   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\scipy\stats__init__.py",  line 345, in       from .stats import *   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\scipy\stats\stats.py",  line 171, in       from . import distributions   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\scipy\stats\distributions.py",  line 13, in       from . import _continuous_distns   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\scipy\stats_continuous_distns.py",  line 113, in       class norm_gen(rv_continuous):   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\scipy\stats_continuous_distns.py",  line 175, in norm_gen      optimizer argument is ignored.\n\n""")   File "AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\scipy\misc\doccer.py",  line 159, in _doc      start_of_notes = cls_docstring.find(notes_header) AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find'I'm using Python 3.7.1Does anyone have an idea how this problem can be fixed?I'm not sure what more information to include, so if you need more information please tell me to do so.EDIT1:I tried doing the exact same thing on my pc, and it works just fine. This problem only occurs when using my laptop.
This seems to be a broken installation probelm.Try these please:Open your terminal (cmd) and try these before you try to import the sklearn.Also make sure your have numpy and scipy:Edit 1:Try also this:
My current user has a whitespace in the c-drive user name. I tried making another user on my laptop without that whitespace, downloaded python 3.7.1 and pip installed scikit-learn and it worked just fine!
