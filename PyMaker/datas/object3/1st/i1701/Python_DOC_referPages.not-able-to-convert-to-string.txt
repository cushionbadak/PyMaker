I might be using wrong python terminology.I have an array of 3 integer elements: month, date and year.However, I am not able to print each individual element when concatenating strings.If I uncomment line 14, I get an error:TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'I am trying to get the date in this format (all strings):  Month/Date/Year.What am I doing wrong?
Simply use:See also https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.htmlIn general  python modules usually contain all kinds of reformatting functions you don't have to reinvent them.Example:
You can use Python's format() method to handle it (much cleaner also):...or further simplified (thanks Anton)â†³ Python String Formatting
First you have to convert int values to string than only you are able to concave them.   You can use str() inbuilt method
