I have this function to show me the 1st ip of a domain:But this only shows me the first ip. I'd like to show only the ip's. The marker is for not having "has address" as shown below (imagine I input "reddit.com": I want to show only the ips, not reddit.com has addressnor once the ip's end, mail is handledetc. I tried with But it is not working! Not even returning anything useful!What I am expecting is an array with (in this case):
See it shows multiple hosts as you required .Your output can be generated using a map function
You should try the dig command instead of host and apply a proper regexp aswell:Notes:The run's parameter may vary depends on why python version you are, this is an example for python 3.5: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.htmlYou should adapt this code to some border cases.EDITAs mentioned in commentaries, you can rid off the regex part using +short option in dig.
Try splitting the string IPs at their spaces using .split() and then taking the last item of it [-1] and then splitting the last item (which should be an IP address) at the periods .split('.'). Join the strings returned from that using ''.join(iterable) where iterable are the value from .split('.'). Check if the joined string is a numeric value using .isnumeric() and if that is True, print and return the last item.The bad news is that I can't seem to get results=str(process.read()) to be set to anything. It currently just returns an empty string, but hopefully, you'll have more luck :D(Edit: As said in your comments, socket.getaddrinfo() works with flying colours. Not sure of it on Python 2.7, but it works here in 3.7.1)(Edit2: Here's your code in 3.7.1. Should be similar in 2.7)
