Python Code (Working fine):Robot Framework Code:I would like to duplicate same API testing in robot framework but i am stuck how to pass credentials to the RESTinstance POST methodERROR RESPONSE STATUS - 401 
The auth argument in requests post() method is just a shortcut to http basic authentication.And it on the other hand is a very simple (hence - basic) one - a header with name "Authorization", with value "Basic b64creds", where b64creds is base64 encoded form of the "user:password" string.So the flow is quite simple - encode the credentials, and add them as a header. There is only one caveat - python's base64 module works with bytes, where the strings in Robotframework/python3 are unicode, so they have to be converted.
