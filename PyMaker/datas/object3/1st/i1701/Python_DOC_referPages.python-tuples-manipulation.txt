I have a tuple in Python like this - Now, I want to group the tuples with the same third element. I have to convert this tuple,a intoHow do I write Python code for this? To convert a into b? Since tuples are immutable I'm not able to write the code successfully. 
This can be done with itertools.groupby.It's assumed that groups of equal last elements cannot be interrupted (like in your sample data). If they can, you need to sort a with key=itemgetter(-1) first....can you explain "interrupted"?Sure. What I mean is that groupby lumps together groups of consecutive elements where key returns the same value. So if we had something like then the groupby from above would create three groups, not two.If you don't want that to happen, sort b first.
Use itertools.groupby:
Given the elements are already ordered by the last element (well the tuples with x as last element, etc. are positioned in a sequence), we can use itertools.groupby:
