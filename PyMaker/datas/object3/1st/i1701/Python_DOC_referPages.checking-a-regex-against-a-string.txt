I have a below regex expression,I am checking against below strings. The first and third should return a match I guess and second a no match. But I am not getting a match on all 3. Is my regex wrong?
Python re does not support \z, it supports \Z as equivalent pattern matching the very end of the string. Your pattern requires the literal z char to be there at the end of the pattern.See Rexegg.com reference:âœ½ In Python, the token \Z does what \z does in other engines: it only matches at the very end of the string. Thus you may useSee the regex demoNote that starting with Python 3.6 you would even get an exception:See Python re docs:Changed in version 3.6: Unknown escapes consisting of '\' and an ASCII letter now are errors.
