Sorry I'm a beginner and looking for some help dealing with some data..So I have two lists:One describes all participants scores in a gameThe other contains the number of times each participant played the gamewhich means there were 3 participants, the first played two times and obtained 'win' and 'draw' etc.How can I split the scores list so it becomes a nested list with each participants scores as a list? As I want to find a person's average score..e.g. splitscores=[['win','draw']['lose','lose','win']['win]]I've managed to get the first trial by doing:but no clue to get the others by making a loopCan anyone help? Or is there a better way for me to find a person's average score?
The other answers are good. You can also do it with a simple for loop if you find that clearer:Output:
You can use itertools.accumulate to sum your trials list cumulatively. Then use a list comprehension with slicing:For a truly lazy solution, you can use the itertools pairwise recipe:
You can call next() by converting scores to a list iterator with iter():
