I have the following class:But I get this error:NameError("name 'DATE' is not defined")Visual Studio points to line 4 where I'm trying to define BEG_DATE.1) Why?2) How can I create the attribute BEG_DATE that takes the DATE attribute and just changes the day to 1?I've tried field(default_factory=self.DATE.replace(day=1)), but I got the same error. 
For fields that depend on the values of other fields, you need to take advantage of Post-init processing. The way you're doing it now, Python is trying to evaluate self.DATE.replace(day=1) when the class is created, rather than when the instance is created.
