I am trying to convert a string to a list.I came across many answers but all of them the strings will have quotes like thisSo my idea is I want a list like thisBasically, the country and state are variables which will get resolved in the program.After looking around I came across an answer which removes the quotes(') around the string using thisThis resulted in output that looks like list (without the quotes)But the type is __main__.MyStr.- not list what I am lookingAny thoughts on how to approach this?
Start by extracting the fields:Get a reference to the dictionary of the local variables:Lookup the fields in the dictionary. If they are there, fetch their values. If not, treat them as numbers:
try this one.
