I am working with list of dictionaries and I have an object like that:The table_name is entered through command line. I want to assign that element of the table_settings which is matching with the table_name entered.For example, if someone entered table_name as  't3', then the value in the table_conf should be {'table_name': 't3' ,'reindex': False, 'partition_deletion': True }If someone enters a value which is not in list , say 't5', then the value of table_conf should be 'None'.I am trying this code:But this is giving me syntax error.Any help would be highly appreciated.
You don't have to use a list comprehension:
If you want to use a list comprehension, which looks like what you're trying to write, you want something like this:So, add brackets to make this a list comprehension, return only the 0th element of the list, and add an exception to deal with the case that the table is not found (i.e. the list you generated is empty and has no element 0).
