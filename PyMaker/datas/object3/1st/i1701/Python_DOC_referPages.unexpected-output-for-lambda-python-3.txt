I am trying to use lambda for a usecase, but it seems not working. The following is what I triedThe below is what I used, in stackflow I came across many people getting output for this, but for me its None then I tried something elseI even tried something which is not using lambda, unfourtunately that too not working, and got NoneI got this from the last answer in this question assigning print function to variable Can anyone help me what I am missing and why I am not able to print the string?
What's not expected? that f('Hello') is None evaluate to True? Well that's expected because it is None.lambda x: print(x) has no 'return', only a side effect, and the side effect is to print stuff to the output. This is similar to a functionwhich has no return statement, hence, if you evaluate the function, it's output will be None.
it's probably because the write is not flushed, you can force this by manually callingAs for why it's returns hello5 is because the Python shell prints out the return value of the previous statement, sys.stdout.write() returns the count of the written characters which in case of 'hello' is 5. thus they become concatenated into hello5. If you ran this in a normal Python file i.e python filename.py it would never print the 5 and only hello.
