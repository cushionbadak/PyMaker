Running a simple program that accepts two inputs, an input file, and a word to search for. It then should print out all lines that contain the word. For example, my input file contains 5 sentences as follows:The word I want to check for is catThis is the code I wrote:Now obviously, this will return lines 1, 3, and 4, because they all contain "cat" at some point. My question is, how would I work it so that only line 1 (the only line with just the word "cat") would be printed?Second question is, what would be the best way to get all lines that had the word "cat" in them, disregarding case. So in this situation, you would return lines 1 and 2, because they contain "cat" and "Cat" respectively. Thanks in advance. 
You can use regular expressions for that:
Here's a short way of doing it, use in on a list of words instead of string directly.Outputs:My cat is named garfield
For your first question, you can use break statement to stop the loop after getting the first matchFor your second question, you could user lower() function to convert everything into lower case, so that Cat and cat would be detected.
