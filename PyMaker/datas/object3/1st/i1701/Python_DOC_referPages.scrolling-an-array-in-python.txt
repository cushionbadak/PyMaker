I'm currently writing a python script with pyserial and pyqtgraph that plots data coming in from an accelerometer via the serial port. I append this data to an int array and use it to update the plot. At the moment, my graph width is 500 (I'm only displaying the most recent 500 elements) and I "roll" or "scroll" by appending an element to the end and popping from the start.This update method is called by the QtTimer object to update the plot windowThis way I avoid an array that keeps growing and also avoid copying values by shifting the elements left. My plot however is inconsistent and occasionally lags (When I move the sensor, the plot reacts seconds later). Is this due to me rolling my data inefficiently?
To have a O(1) update procedure, you can do it yourself with a double array buffer :Since buffer[i:i+size] is just a view, it will take no time to update curve1.Run : 
Here's a good reference for this kind of FIFO functionality: Queues in PythonTo summarise from that link:Consider using collections.deque for this behaviour, as lists are slow.
