Natural Text
I'm trying to make a word guessing game in Python, but the final part is a bit confusing to me.Here is my code uptil now:Basically, the loop checks if you insert a 5 character word, and if you do, it compares the word with the characters of the tuple. If 1 or more characters are correct, it will print the correct characters, and the ones which haven't been guessed are masked with a symbol, for example '*'.The confusing part is where I have to check if the entered word has characters that match the tuple and then print out the correct characters.So for example:Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Your problem is you do not print your word correctly, and your print is outside of the while, here is an answer you can tryAn exercise can be to refactor this code in different methods
