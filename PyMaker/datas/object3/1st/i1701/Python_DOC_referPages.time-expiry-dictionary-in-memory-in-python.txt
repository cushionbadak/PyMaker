I was just wondering how one might efficiently implement a time expiry dictionary in memory in Python such that key-value pairs expire after a specified time interval.
The design pattern to typically do this is not via a dictionary, but via a function or method decorator. The dictionary is managed behind the scenes by the cache.This answer uses the ttl_cache decorator in cachetools==3.1.0 with Python 3.7. It works a lot like functools.lru_cache, but with a time to live. As for its implementation logic, consider its source code.If however you insist on using a dictionary, cachetools also has TTLCache.
