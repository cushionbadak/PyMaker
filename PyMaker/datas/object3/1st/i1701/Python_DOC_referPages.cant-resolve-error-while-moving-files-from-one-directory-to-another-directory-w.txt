I have a question that"Create a program that read the names of files in directory 'Task2' the names are in format UmSn where m=1 to 40 and n=1 to 40 separate the files into different directories based on m like U1,U2,U3......U40."Hints: use 'os' module for reading directories and filenames.I tried to solve it but can't.Here is my code.  I tried a lot but can't resolve this error.  Files start withU1 T0 U9 moves successfully but generate error while moving U10S1.TXT.Hence the file also U10S1.TXTexist in directory.Please help me to find where I am doing wrong in my code.
Perhaps you can try making sure you provide the absolute path instead with os.path.abspath():
