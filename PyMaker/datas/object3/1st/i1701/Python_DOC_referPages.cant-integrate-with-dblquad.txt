So I want to integrate a double integral with constants in it, like a, b, etc where the user can asign the value of this constants:The limits of the integral are x[0,1] and y[-1,2]But I get this error and I don't understant why:I don't understand it. Because when I do the same but with quad() Python does it correctly:With the result:
The problem here is that the value you provide in the optional argument args is a tuple. In the case of quad, it is what the function expects, but for dblquad, a sequence is required. Even though tuples are sequences (immutable ones), it seems that scipy makes a difference here and therefore it is why an error is raised. However it is misleading as a tuple is definitely an iterable. Anyway, this should work:
