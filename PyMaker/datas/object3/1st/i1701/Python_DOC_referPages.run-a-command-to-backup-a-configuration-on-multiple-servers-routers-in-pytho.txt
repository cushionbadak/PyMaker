Use for h in HOST to iterate your HOST array;Use SSHClient.exec_command to execute the command;Use string.format to format your messages and commands.Obligatory warning: Do not use AutoAddPolicy - You are losing a protection against MITM attacks by doing so. For a correct solution, see Paramiko "Unknown Server".
