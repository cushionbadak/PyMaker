Natural Text
I have a dataframe df1 with column name Acc Number as the first column and the data looks like: I need to make a new dataframe df2 that will have two columns first having the text part and the second having the numbers so the desired output is: How would I go about doing this?Thanks! 
You could do something like this:OutputThe pattern ([a-zA-Z]+)([^a-zA-Z]+)  means match a group of letters: ([a-zA-Z]+) followed by a group of non letters: ([^a-zA-Z]+). A safer alternative will be to use the following regex: ([a-zA-Z]+)(\d+\.?\d+) assuming the numbers can only have at most one point.FurtherThe documentation on regex in Python.The documentation on extract.
