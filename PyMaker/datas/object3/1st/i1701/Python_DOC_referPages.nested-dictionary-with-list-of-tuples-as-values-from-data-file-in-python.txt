Natural Text
Please, help. I have a data file with 4 columns (userid, movieid, score, timestamp) that looks like this:I am trying to create a nested dictionary that should look like this:users = {'196': [('242', '3'), ('51', '2')], '186': ['302','3'] ...}My code only picks up one tuple (movieid, score) for each userid:users = {'196': ('51', '2'), '186': ('302', '3')...}
Use setdefault:OutputA possible alternative is to check if the key (uid) is in the dictionary, in case is missing initialize the value with the empty list and then simply append.As a side note you should not use id as a name because it shadows the built-in function id.
