I have a flask route that uses the subprocess module to call a Python script on the server. My problem is that this script downloads files, and the time it takes to do it is not possible to determine. I want to somehow update the client by getting the output of the subprocess. Here's the whole route:I saw the getoutput method, but it's not exactly what I want, I need to get the shell output in real-time in some file. Is it possible?
According to documentation, subprocess.run has a stdout argument. So I guess if you pass a file handler to it, the output would be written live and you should be able to read it. Something like that (not tested) :
