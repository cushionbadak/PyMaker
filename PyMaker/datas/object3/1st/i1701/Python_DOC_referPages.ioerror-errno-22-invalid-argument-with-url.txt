I  am newbie in python and i am trying to open an localhost with write mode but i got following errorsIOError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'http:\\localhost:3000\\assets\\i18n\\locale-ru.json'Here is a piece of code:
According to the doc, the io.open function only reads a local file given a file path. Considering you're trying to read from a http url, I guess a better tools might be requests
