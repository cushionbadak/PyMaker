I am trying to convert the below type of string into Dictionary in Python.I would like to make the dictionary like:
If you will continue to use the identical string format, you may use a complex regular expression to cover various patterns.The following is a regular expression for a few patterns I have anticipated. Let me know if this solves your issue. If not, please provide details on where my solution fails:Edit for explainingGroup one (?=F\d+=\[).*?(\]){2,}(?=|,)(?=F\d+=\[) match string begin with F, have one or more numbers, and have =[ after them .*?(\]){2,} match string as less as it can, and it have 2 or more ] at the end(?=|,) the string end , or nothing Group two  F\d.[^,]+after matching group one, it is easy to find the string like F6=Value6. because the first group takes precedence over the second group, so the second group can only match the remaining strings.CodeOutputEdit: because the former regex does not work when string is F1=Value1,F2=Value2,F8=[iD=10,ig=12S],F3=[[F4=Value4,F5=Value5]],F6=Value6,F9=[iD=10,ig=12S],F7=[[[BC],[AC]]]I changed regex to ((?=F\d+=\[).*?(\])+(?= |,F))|(F\d.[^,]+). And we need one trick. add one blankspace after string.
