I would like to inquire about something rather simple which is about lambda parameters.I understand how the function of lambda works but when it comes to this I got confused with which is which parameters.Example:Here is a shorter version to compare it:Now, my question is x is the variable for the list or y is the variable for the list in the first example for lambda? And what is the default value for either x or y (judging either one of it belongs to product? since I did not initiate the initial value for it for the "lambda example" and only the second example I initialized.)
The map() in python takes in a list, and returns a list where each element has been modified according to some function.  You seem to want to take a list as input and get a number as a result, in which case neither map() nor lambda functions are particularly helpful, and a simple for loop is probably the best way to do this.
With:each time the lambda function is called, the x argument is the running total (or accumulated value) and y will be successive elements of the iterable [1, 2, 3, 4]. Since you didn't specify the optional initializer parameter, the value of x will be set to the first element of the iterable (1 in this case) and the first call to the lambda with start with the second element of the iterableâ€”otherwise x would have been the value passed as the initializer and the first call would have passed the first argument of the iterable as the y parameter the first time.
