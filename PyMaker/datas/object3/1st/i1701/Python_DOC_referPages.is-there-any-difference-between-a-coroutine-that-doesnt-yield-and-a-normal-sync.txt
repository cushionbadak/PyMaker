Suppose I have normal sync function that gets called a lot in my async application. Does it make any difference if I simply define it as an async function so I can await it, but I don't change its code at all?
It doesn't make a (semantic) difference, a coroutine that doesn't await is still a perfectly valid coroutine that can itself be awaited, passed to asyncio.run, asyncio.create_task, asyncio.gather, and so on.You might want to add a comment to make it clear to the reader that the function doesn't actually contain any blocking code.For example, the following code:This code blocks the event loop for as long as the while loop lasts, regardless of the presence of an await.
