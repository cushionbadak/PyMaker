I have a list of list of dictionaries and I want to find the common dictionaries between the two list.Eg:The result should be [{'1' : 1,'2' : 2, '3' :3}] I tried using set intersections but dictionaries are unhashable in python. How to solve this?
A list comprehension could work here:But this is not a very general solution, since it assumes only two nested lists are exististent. A more general solution would be to count the occurences with collections.Counter(), and storing the dictionary items() with hashable/immutable types such as frozenset() or tuple(). Then all you need to do is filter the occurences that count more than 1.Example:Which is very similar to the approach @Chris_Rands posted in the comments.
