Actually my sort algorithm works, but there is a problem.I have a class namely SortedItem which includesand I have also priority queue which sorts the this SortedItem by its cost:The problem occurs here:- I have defined some order to add queue. Let's say I am adding this objects to the queue:Now I have to get objects from queue in this order (obj1, obj2, obj3).However python built-in sort function sort these objects like this: (obj1, obj3, obj2) (because obj2 and obj3 has the same cost)How can i solve this issue. I mean If 2 objects cost is the same, I should get the first added one. Note that: I have just created a simple example of my problem. If you try this code you may get the objects in this order: obj1, obj2, obj3 
Instead of sorting the items in reverse order and removing them from the right,you could remove them from the left. That would avoid reversing the order of insertion of the items with the same cost. Removing items from the beginning of a list is not efficient, however, so you could better use a deque (replacing pop(0) by popleft()) to fix that. A deque on the other hand, has no in-place sort() method, so would need to replace self.items.sort() by self.items = deque(sorted(self.items)) as well.
