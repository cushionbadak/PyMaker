Natural Text
I have a situation to remove the previous text in a line by finding the specific string.I have a huge file and wish to delete some unwanted text.Ex: I have a line as follows:Here, I need to find a string $G and remove the unwanted characters behind it. I need a file to be like this.Can someone help me with a python script?
You can use the re - module for this task:Outputfile:The regex searches for all matches in a line starting with $G till the end of the line. If a match is found, writes it into new file.The regexstring ^.*?(\$G.*)$ means:You might need to add a crlf after your last line or integrate \Z. Probably better to use youre real data and f.e.  http://regex101.com
