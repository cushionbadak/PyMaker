This question already has an answer here:How to make a flat list out of list of lists?                    38 answers                I have a big array with many subarrays inside and am trying to join all of the ones inside. I know how to concatenate arrays, but since the number of inner arrays varies, I don't know to make one function to concatenate these ones. I understand that i'll need one or possibly more loops, but am not sure how to do it. So far I have been doing it manually like this and keep going till i get to the last index:where ldata is the bigger list, and all of the indexes are the inner lists. How do I do this?Edit: Here is an example
You could use chain.from_iterable:Output
You can grab each sublist and add to a new list.
You can use numpy concatenate for this
If your lists are not too long, keep it simple:I made some timing measurements:The more lists and the longer those lists, the solution with chain will perform much better:yieldsThat shows that adding up the arrays with a short function is pretty good too.
