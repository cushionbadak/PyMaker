Natural Text
How to make a character between a tag uppercase?For example I have this string: Should result in:
Constantly as longest as there's < big> in txt remove tags and uppercase the text between them
Try this:Note:Do not use str as a name of a variable. str is predefined in python.
Those don't look like real xml tags. But assuming the number of <big> tags are used correctly, you can split it by tag and apply upper() to strings between.
