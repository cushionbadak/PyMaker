I'm trying to check if one or two files exist like this:My question is how do I pass an exception if of one or both files does not exist?
If you don't want to use os.path.exists() or os.path.isfile() from the built-in os.path module, you'll have to use two try-except blocks:
You can directly check if a file exist by using the pathlib.Path module. It comes with python.
use os.path.isfile(path) to check whether file exists, without any exception.or
I don't know the scenario of the author. If you want to just stop the function, you can use return False. But if you still want to execute some function even the file1 and file2 doesn't exists, you can use pass to ignore the exception.
