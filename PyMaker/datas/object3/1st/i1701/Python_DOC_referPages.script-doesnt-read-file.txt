I have a problem with the read() function in Python, it just doesn't read the file:It doesn't show anything in the output (not even an error), just finishes the program.screenshot of code in Sublime IDE showing nothing printed
You are writing to the file, but you didn't go back in the file. The "cursor" is located after what you wrote.Try f.seek(0) to go at the beginning of your file after writing to it.
Your code is trying to write it as you have ”w+” as a second param of open() call. Please use the open without the second parameter.
