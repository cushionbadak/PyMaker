Natural Text
I have a few files in the folder and I want to find out the content and match its file name. But when I use re.search to achieve my goal I can only get ‘None’. Anyone could help?
(Though there is an accepted answer, I don't feel the answer is clear for other people, and there is still room to improve, so I added a new answer here)The problem is simply OP is using a wrong regex: cc*?.xml* means any occurrence of the preceding token (which means c in your case)*? is a reluctant match any occurrence.. means any characterWhich means what you are trying to do is match a string which is:a cfollowed by any occurrence of cfollowed by any characterfollowed by xmlExample of matching strings are c.xml ccccccAxml etc.What you were trying to do, I believe is which means matchingcc.*? : followed by any occurrence of any character, matching as few as possible\.  : followed by a dot  (note the difference of \. vs .)followed by xml
How about something like this with a small tweak?output:
