This question already has an answer here:How to remove items from a list while iterating?                    23 answers                I am trying to make a program where it takes in user input and spits out the input without the letters. I'm really confused on why this isn't working.I know this is really dumb so im sorry for asking. 
You should not iterate and remove at the same time, instead use a list comprehension.
