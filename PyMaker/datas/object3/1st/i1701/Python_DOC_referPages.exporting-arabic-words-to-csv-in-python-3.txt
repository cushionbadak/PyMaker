Natural Text
I'm trying to export some arabic in a csv file after getting it from the translater. I Always run into a problem when trying to write it in the CSV. The problem is this one : My code goes as follow (a bit of it, trying to be concise here) : When I build it in SublimeText with a print instead of the csvwriter, I get the result without problem.It's only when I want to write in the csv that I get the issue. Any ideas on how to fix this? I've seen Something about encoding or decoding it in UTF-8, but I don't know where to add this possibilityThanks! 
you can use UTF-8 by declaring it at the top of your code : then you can use utf-8 encoding/decoding.UPDATE: Based on these answers you should change the other environments Unicode like your console.[answer-1][1][answer-2][2]try opening your file with UTF-8 encoding :
