I am brand new to python and have searched the site on this, but still can't figure it out. It's for a homework assignment, so not looking for the answer, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and getting a syntax error (I'm stuck on the first rule...) The assignment:W​e will assume that the credit card number is a string consisting of 14 characters and is in the format ####-####-####, including the dashes, where ‘#’ represents a digit between 0-9, so that there are 12 digits overall.1. The first digit must be a 4. 2. The fourth digit must be one greater than the fifth digit; keep in mind that these are separated by a dash since the format is ####-####-####. 3. The sum of all digits must be evenly divisible by 4. 4. If you treat the first two digits as a two-digit number, and the seventh and eighth digits as a two-digit number, their sum must be 100. Here is my code so far. I've read that you can't compare characters to numbers, but nothing I've tried has worked. Any help/guidance would be appreciated!
your code is fine, but there are a couple of issuesfirst of all, indentation matters in python, everything that belongs in your function definition should be indented.second, if statements should be followed by :. that is all
Your code is incorrect:Fixed code:Also I recommend to return False from this function instead of error string. If you want to return string with error, consider using tuple like (is_successful, error) or custom object.
Have a look at string indexing:Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having  index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a  string of size one:Then read about if-statements - your code is missing the :, and the second if can be replaced by an else clause.You may also want to check the argument of the function, not the global variable input (this is a bad name, since it shadows the input() built-in)Suggested fix:
