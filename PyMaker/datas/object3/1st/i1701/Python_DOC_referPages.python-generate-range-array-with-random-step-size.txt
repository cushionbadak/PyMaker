Goals: to Initialize an array with pre-defined size with a random number. I have try this way and working:My question: Is there any better way to do it? maybe without the for loop?
Given that you are using numpy the code in your question is equivalent to:OutputBut if what you want if something that returns a range (like the one from the range function), but with a random step you could do something like this:OutputNote that in both cases only the first 5 numbers are printed. Also in both cases the step is positive.FurtherDocumentation on cumsum, randint and random.
You also can use itertools.accumulate function:I am not quite sure that this is what you need, but it computes every element with prev + random.random() like you wrote in your question.
Simple one-liner
you can use this better than your code
Use list comprehension:Again as mentioned, np.empty(100) would already give you a fully random array of the size.  What is the issue with np.empty()?
