Having issues with encoding (\udbff, \udc13, \udc02, \udc00,  \udc06). I've tried looking at this online and tried the followingThis results in the following error:UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\udc13' in position 0: surrogates not allowedAny suggestions on how I can avoid this range. I keep finding new ones so escaping each one with regex doesn't seem like a sustainable solution.
I had to escape the full range u"([\udc00-\udc69])|" to get ride of it in the end. I guess I should probably expand it to udcff or something to make it more complete!
