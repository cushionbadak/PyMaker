I wrote this class:But when I try to use it ...I'm getting an error:What am I doing wrong?
<__main__.Dinosaurus object at 0x026B5210> is not an error â€“ it's the representation of your object.A little experimentation shows that Dinosaur has all the attributes you assigned it:If you want to change the representation that gets shown when you print instances of your class, you need to write a special __repr__ method to tell Python how they should be represented, for example:There's also a __str__ method you can define, which Python will use in preference to __repr__ when printing objects if both are defined. You should think of __str__ as returning an informal, human-friendly representation of an object, and __repr__ as the formal representation (which, if possible, should be a valid Python expression that could be used to make an exact copy of it, as in my example above).
