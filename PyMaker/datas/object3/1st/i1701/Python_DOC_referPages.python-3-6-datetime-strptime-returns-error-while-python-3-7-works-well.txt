I just created a data type for my date data, which returns a datetime.datetime objectHere is the code:So everytime I give this class an ISO-8601 it should return the datetime object from the string...Python 3.7 Example:This works damn well, but when I use it on Python 3.6 or Python 3.5:It's so weird, What causes the problem? How can I fix it?
Ok, after 2 days, I checked the Python 3.7 changelog, and I found out support for Z as a UTC offset was added in Python 3.7. See this issue on the Python issue tracker, which is primarily about adding support for colons, but also mentions Z support further down the page. Also see the datetime docs, which sayChanged in version 3.7: When the %z directive is provided to the strptime() method, the UTC offsets can have a colon as a separator between hours, minutes and seconds. For example, '+01:00:00' will be parsed as an offset of one hour. In addition, providing 'Z' is identical to '+00:00'.On my class, I had to change the time format to this:I changed the %z at the end to Z, hardcoding the offset.
