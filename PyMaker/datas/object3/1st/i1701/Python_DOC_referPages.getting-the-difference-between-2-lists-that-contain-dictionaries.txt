This question already has an answer here:Finding difference between two list of dictionary in Python                    3 answers                Get difference between two lists                    26 answers                Is there a way to get the difference between those two lists?Basically, I need a scaleable way to get the differences between 2 lists that contain dictionaries. So I'm trying to compare those lists, and just get a return of {'key3': 'item3'}
You could use a list comprehension:Which will give [{'key3': 'item3'}]
You can use set() with a comprehension like this example:Output:

Since dictionaries are not hashable there isn't an easy way to hash, but since we have one key and one val per dictionary, we can build our own key! So you can do something like this:output:Not this solution is much more scalable then simply iterating through the first list because of the constant lookup ability.
You can also try using set.symmetric_difference() to get the difference between the sets both ways:Another way would be to use itertools.filterfalse():
You can inform the dictionary how to hash itself and then you could use setsthen you can dodifference gives you the elements in lists2 that are not in list1.If you wanted all the difference, so all the items that are not in both lists, do:Note this will not work for all dictionaries (e.g., dictionaries containing objects the json.dumps cannot work with) unless you handle those explicitly too with a custom JSONEncoder
