I am trying to loop through sites on Rightmove.co.uk and print out price of listings into an excel spreadsheet. For this final step (printing to excel), i figured I might need a double 'for' loop, however i am getting a TypeError with the zip function.Please see my code below:Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.Thanks,
zip takes iterables as arguments and produces a tuple by zipping each together. For examples zip('abc', 'def') produces ['ad', 'be', 'cf'] (I converted to a list).It looks like you want want the index of each element in containers. In that case you can use enumerate:
zip requires an iterator to loop, 25 is not an iterator.You probably want to use:if 25 is the length of the container, then use enumerate:
