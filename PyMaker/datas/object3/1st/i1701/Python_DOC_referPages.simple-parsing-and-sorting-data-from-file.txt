Sorry if this has already been answered before; the searches I have done have not been helpful.I have a file that stores data as such:name,number(Although perhaps not relevant to the question, I will have to add entries to this file. I know how to do this.)My question is for the pythonic(?) way of analyzing the data and sorting it in ascending order. So if the file was:alex,30bob,20and I have to add the entrycarol, 25The file should be rewritten asbob,20carol,25alex,30My first attempt was to store the entire file as a string (by read()) and then split by lines to get a list of strings, procedurally split those strings by a comma, and then create a new list of scores then sort that, but this doesn't seem right and fails because I don't have a way to go "back" once I have the order of scores.I am unable to use libraries for this program.Edit:My first attempt I did not test because all it manages to do is sort a list of the scores; I don't know of a way to get the "entries" back.As you can see, this gives me an ascending list of scores, but I do not know where to go from here in order to sort the list of name, score entries.
You will just have to write the sorted entries back to some file, using some basic string formatting:
I'm going to assume you're capable of putting your data into a .csv file in the following format:Then you can use csv.DictReader to read this into a dictionary with something like as shown in the listed example:and write to it usingYou can then sort it using python's built-in operator as shown here
this a function that will take a filename and sort it for you
