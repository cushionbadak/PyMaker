maybe seems dum but I know that if I want to declare a list I can do it this way:But why I need 2 sets of parenthesis to declare it for numbers:
The docs state:The function list only takes a single iterable argument; list(1,2,3,4) would be a TypeError. Since a string is an iterable in python, it is a correct function call. In order to use your integers you need to convert them to some form of iterable. By writing list2 = list((2,3,4,5)) you convert the integers to a tuple, which is iterable.
list() constructs a list from an Iterable. In your examples, a string is an iterable (a sequence of chars as people have pointed out), and a tuple is also an iterable (using the round brackets).In your example you're passing a tuple to the list() function.You can skip using the in-built list() function and create a list directly using square brackets:
In the first case, you are calling list() on a str which implicitly can covert to a sequence of chars. If you look closely, for the ints, you are calling list() on a tuple of ints. Not sure if you are exploring, but the most direct way to do this is list2 = [2,3,4,5]
