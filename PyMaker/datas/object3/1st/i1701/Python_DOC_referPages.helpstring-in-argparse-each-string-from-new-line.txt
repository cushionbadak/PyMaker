Natural Text
I am doing a CLI utility. When adding a docstring to call help for the module with the function -- help in console, I was faced with the fact that all the added text is displayed as a continuous, unbreakable message. How to separate strings from each other? I tried to add \n at the end of the line, but this does not work.
Use formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter to retain all spaces in your help string. This is the argparse application help string, not a docstring. Could look a bit ugly though:From terminal:py bla.py -h usage: samplefind [-h]Do note that this include spaces from the beginning of line, new lines, everything.
