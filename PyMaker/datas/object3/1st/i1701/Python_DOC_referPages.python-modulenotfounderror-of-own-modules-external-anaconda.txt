So I have the infamous ModuleNotFoundError, and for a couple of hours I can't find the solution. I know that my project works in Pycharm but I wanted to set it up in Visual Studio Code.the errorMy project structurein main.pyin Agent.pymy environment: Python 3.6.5 ('base':conda)python pathFirst I had __Init__.py in every dir, but then I read here http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python_concepts/import_traps.html that this also could be an issue.I will be alert for any suggestions and will try them as I read them.Thanks in advance :-)
You first have to add __init__.py to your MarkovDecisionProcess to make it a module. Then, you have to add \path\to\project to PYTHONPATH for you to import.For example, in Windows:In Unix/macOS:Then, you can import like this: from be.kdg.MarkovDecisionProcess import AgentAlternatively, you can use importlib.util
if you want to import Agent in Main.py just use because which is in the same directory
