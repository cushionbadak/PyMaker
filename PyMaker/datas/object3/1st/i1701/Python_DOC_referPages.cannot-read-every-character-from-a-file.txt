This is from project euler question 18.I used this method to read from the file "18.txt"This is my code-but it doesn't print every number from the file and skips alternative numbers.txt contents-7595 6417 47 8218 35 87 1020 04 82 47 6519 01 23 75 03 3488 02 77 73 07 63 6799 65 04 28 06 16 70 9241 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 3341 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 2953 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 1470 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 5791 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 4863 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 3104 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23
You are calling f.read(1) twice each iteration, once in while f.read(1) and again for print(f.read(1)). You only print the second character, so you will only see half of the data being read.If you want to see each character printed, call f.read(1) just once each iteration. Store the result in a variable and test against the variable, then print the variable:You can avoid having to assign to char before the loop if you used while True: and break out when f.read(1) doesn't return data:or you can use the iter() function with a sentinel:If you wanted to read the numbers from the file, don't use f.read(1). Just loop over the file and split each line on whitespace:You probably want to convert the text to integers too, and build up your grid list of lists:
