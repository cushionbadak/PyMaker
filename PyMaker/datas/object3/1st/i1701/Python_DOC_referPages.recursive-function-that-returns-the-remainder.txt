I am instructed to define a recursive function in Python that finds the remainder of n divided by b with the condition to not use the "/" ,"%" or "//" operator. I have defined the following function, which works fine for positive numbers. Is there a better way to do this using recursion and simple conditions.
I believe your teacher was probably only trying to go for remainders without quotients.However, since you brought it up, you can do it with the quotient, without having to start with a 1 for the default.Main takeaways, you do not need to check n for range (0,5).
What aboutmuch shorter ...
