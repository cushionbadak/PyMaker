So I have a function that takes a class as a parameter (not a class instance!).How can I specify this in the function annotationWhat I mean is:But I can't do this:Since class is a reserved word for class definition. How can I solve this?
You can use cls: type.Just like every integer is an instance of int, every class is an instance of type.Demo:You can also use Type from the typing module, which, as per the docs, isA special construct usable to annotate class objects.Using typing.Type is more flexible than cls:type.For example, if you wanted to hint that the argument can be any class object, you simply use cls:Type. If the argument should be any class object that is a subclass of the class Foo (or Foo itself), you can write cls: Type[Foo].Read the docs for more info.Responding to the comments:it's like in your example. Class object is an instance of type, but class instance isn't. So that's why it complains: going func(Person) is alright but func(Person('Steve', 22)) is not.In the second case, you are doing what you explicitly said you don't want to do: pass an instance of Person, not the class Person. So your IDE rightfully complains if you annotated type or Type.
