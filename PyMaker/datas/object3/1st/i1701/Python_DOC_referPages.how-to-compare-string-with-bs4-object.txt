Natural Text
I am trying to create a program which  fetches data from Github where some some string should be  there in  profile description of Github.But i'm unable to use not in statement.While the output doesn't work it still shows string with grab only as well while i want to only fetch string with @grab only.Output Here
If you want to print lines which contain '@Grab' or '@ Grab', you could use:Or, if you have many strings you wish to test for, it might be easier to put them in a list like this:The reason why the condition var or var2 in test is always True is because Python parses this expression as (var) or (var2 in test) (due to operator precedence, since in binds more "tightly" than or). Since var is a non-empty string it evaluates as True in a boolean context. So is equivalent towhich always evaluates as True.
