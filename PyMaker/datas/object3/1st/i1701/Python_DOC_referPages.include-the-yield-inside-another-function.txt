This question already has an answer here:Python generator to yield everything from another generator call                    4 answers                I have two functions , generatorA() calls the generatorB() inside it. I want to get all the yield when calling the generatorB(), but I only get 0,1,2 how to get 0,1,2,3,4,5 generatorA() is a call back function. so I can't say, when It will be called.
Use yield from, and you can further shorten this with iterable unpacking.You could do the same thing to generatorA:(...But I assume that generatorA is a stand-in for something more complex.)
Use yield from:Output
