So this is what I came up with. I define one function to compute the maximum element in a list which works while the second function myreduce doesn't.I don't understand why my logic is flawed. I'm new to programming. Help?
You didn't implement the reduce function. Your myreduce() function instead implements the map higher-order function, producing a sequence of myfunc() results for the inputs in mylist. When mapping, the function used should take a single input, and each input is processed independently, and the resulting sequence of outputs are given in the same order as the inputs that produced them.The higher-order reduce operation would produce a single output. Reducing means you iteratively take the output from the preceding reduce operation, and together with the next input value, the function is called to produce the next output. So the function takes two inputs for the reduce operation to work correctly. For the first step, where there is no preceding output, you would either start with a fixed starting value, or just take two inputs from the input list. With each step producing new output, the previous output is discarded. You end up with a single output at the end.Using reduce to produce the maximum for [1, 2, 3] can start with two inputs, and a simple function that determines the maximum of those two inputs. The procedure then takes the following steps:Take the first input, 1, as the starting 'output' value. If there are no further inputs, this would be the final result.Use the initial output, 1 from the previous step, and the next input value, 2, and call the function with both. The maximum of 1 and 2 is 2, so that's what the function produces as the first output result.Use 2 from the previous operation, and the next input, 3 to call the function again. The maximum of 2 and 3 is 3, so that's what the function produces as the new output.There are no more inputs, the output is 3.Your reduce implementation would have to do the same:start with a given starting value for the 'output', or take the first value from the input list.for each value in the (remainder of the) input list, call the function with the last output and the value, and the return value replaces the output.When all values have been processed, return the output.Python 3 has implemented this as functools.reduce(), the documentation actually comes with a pure-python implementation you could copy directly.
