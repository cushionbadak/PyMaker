when I used the first "with open" method, I got an error. But there is no problem when I use the "read_csv".So could anyone tell me why?Thank you!
With open(), you have to use the os.path.expanduser() function to expand the tilde ~ into the actual home directory of the user:Pandas' read_csv() does that for you.(A word of warning: since ~ is a valid character in Linux filenames, just replacing ~ with os.getenv("HOME") is a very bad idea...)
