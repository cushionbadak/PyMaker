I am new to Python and am playing with Pickle and don't understand how this worksI define a defaultdict, write it to pickle. Then in a different script I read it and it still behaves like a defaultdict even without importing collectionsscript1:script2:running:So, the 2nd script doesn't import defaultdict but the pickled x still acts like one. I'm confused :)How does this work in Python? Thanks for any info :)
First of all, if you look at the pickle docs, specifically:pickle can save and restore class instances transparently, however the class definition must be importable and live in the same module as when the object was storedSo what this is telling us is that pickle will import the module that defines the object you are unpickling. We can show this with a small example, consider the following folder structure:sub is an empty sub-foldera.py holds an example classNow starting the python console in the parent directory:Exit the shell. Move to the sub directory and try to load the pickled ExampleClass object.We get a ModuleNotFoundError as pickle cannot load the class definition from the module a (it's in a different directory). In your case, python can load the collections.defaultdict class as this module is on the PYTHONPATH. However, to continue to use the module(s) imported by pickle you will still need to import them yourself; eg you want to create another defaultdict in script2.py.To find out more about modules look here, specifically 6.1.2 The Module Search Path.
