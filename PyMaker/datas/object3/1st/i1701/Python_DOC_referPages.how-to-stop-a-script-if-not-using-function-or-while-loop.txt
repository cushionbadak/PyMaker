So basically want to stop a script if an if statement is not met, the statement is this:abbrevationabbrevationIf the user enters 41 for example, I don't want the program to continue running, but at the moment it does. 

A simple solution could be to raise an exception that will ultimately stop your script from runningyou can call sys.exit() which will raise SystemExit exception or raise the same exception to play safe
As mad_ mentioned, you can just use exit from the sys module
You can use a break statement. Simply put break in the if condition or the while loop
