I am writing python in Linux. I want to write the python output and error into different files than output them on the console.Say if I have this python file example.py:  I tried different way. 1. By executing the following commandpython example.py >output 2>log 2. Update the example.py and execute python example.py >output The logs are different. 1st method: and for 2nd method:So I want to ask:why two logs are different? And how to make the 2nd output same as 1st one.Which is better way of write error into files? Or there is a better way of doing this.Thanks for helping with my questions.
Leave the script the simple, original way:Use easy trick in shell:If you wanted some other custom behaviour on unhandled exceptions, set a sys.excepthook.
To combine both stdout and stderr into one file, which is also helpful when using more (or less) commandTo make each go into separate filesTo ignore stederrHope this helps.
