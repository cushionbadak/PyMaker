I used pip install zipfile, and error went out:Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement zipfile (from  versions: ) No matching distribution found for zipfileAddition Info: pip 18.1 from  /Users/xxxx/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/pip (python  2.7)
You don't need to install it. zipfile is in the Python standard library. import zipfile should work just fine on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.7.
