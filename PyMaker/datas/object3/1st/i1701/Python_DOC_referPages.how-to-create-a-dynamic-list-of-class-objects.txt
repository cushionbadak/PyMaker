When trying to add new element to my cells class object list, I noted that all list values are the last value of added item. I use append to add new items. How can I get the correct answer?
This is because in your class you defined x within the class's body, not it's __init__ method. That makes it a class variable, one and the same for all instances of the class, as per the documentation.
You should create new instaces of class cells, not changing cells's class cells.x attribute.So you should define __init__ method for class cells (more info about __init__: link, link):Appending values to the list: Create new object, otherwise you'll change first object:...and so on. You could append objects instantiated inside parens:
