Need to create a function that validates my password strength having trouble with the third question.Both entered passwords are identical.The password is >= 8 characters in length.3.If the first and last characters of the password are alphabetic then the first character of the password must be a different alphabetic letter to the last character of the password regardless of case.  e.g 1st char is A so last char cannot be A or a.How do i ignore the digits at the end of the password and look at the nearest alphabetic letter which would be the d.
You might try to solve it with a regex. This checks if the first occurrence of a letter equals (case-insensitively) the last occurrence of a letter.You have to adapt the regex or the if clause if you really just want to check the first char of the string or the last one.You also can do an extra check to see if the last char in the pwd equals the last letter in the list chars below.I also think, it might be enough only to check
I'm not an expert, but as someone who tries to continually improve at python it's recommended to write out the words instead of using abbreviations.also you rother functions to verify the password strength are being checked only if the password was the same as the previous, so make sure you take length greater than 8 out of the first checkThings worth looking at would be:islower, isalpha HEREwith lower() HEREand I recommend youtubing regex because it's a tough concept imo
