I know how to read a whole file into a list line by line, but I cannot figure out the syntax for searching a file for a string and grabbing the whole line, and then appending that to a list.
Simplest way I can think of:This will preserve the newlines at the end of every line since that's how iterating a file works. To remove the newlines, call line.rstrip('\n') before appending:Other options are line.rstrip() to remove all trailing spaces including newlines, and line.strip() to remove all trailing and leading spaces, including of course the newline.
The simplest way would be to use string.find() on each line as you parse the file: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.findFor example:
