If I create lists to hold a column each for what will be a database table. How would I loop though the ID list to add one row at a time to a new object. So each object will hold one row for what will be a database table.Example ListsI then want to create a function that will iterate though ListID and create a 'list object' eg, [1, 34, 644, 622] would be the first object then [2, 56, 64, 12]. I'm not sure how to preform this but keep it in a format that can still be persisted to a database table
If I understood correctly, you could do something like that, using zip:Output:An alternative would be to use map function, along with zip:
You can use dictionary combined with zip, and this way you can also retrieve data using ListID:
If you don't want to use any third-party libraries like pandas, you can use defaultdict for an easy implementation:
