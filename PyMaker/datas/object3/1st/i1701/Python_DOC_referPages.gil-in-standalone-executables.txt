I am not thoroughly sure in how GIL is implemented, but in theory, if I was to compile a python script into exe using pyinstaller, would it still have GIL implemented? Any way to bypass that?
GIL will be there, if you are using CPython (the "standard Python"). Pyinstaller does not compile, but bundles the Python script, its dependencies, and the interpreter in use in the executable. Because of that the standard ways to bypass GIL apply:C extensions and Cython code may release the GIL while not manipulating interpreter state or Python objects, or calling Python/C API functions.Divide the work between multiple processes.
