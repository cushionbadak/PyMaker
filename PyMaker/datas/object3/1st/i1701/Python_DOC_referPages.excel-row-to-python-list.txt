I am absolute beginner and don't know how to do it.Could you please advise me how to turn excel row to a Python list? The next row should be the next list and so on.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-excel-file-using-python/ this should get you started. If you still have issues post some code/attempts so we can further help. 
Assuming a csv file named test:Will print open the file in read-only mode then loop over the lines, storing each of them in the variable "line" and printing them. Read section 7.2 here for more details.
