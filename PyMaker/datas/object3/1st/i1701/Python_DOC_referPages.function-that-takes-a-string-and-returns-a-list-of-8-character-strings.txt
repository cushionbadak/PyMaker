I'm very new to programming. I need to create a function that takes any string and a fill character and returns a list of 8 character strings.For example:As you can see, the string has 13 characters. The function splits into 2 strings, where the first contains 8 characters, and the second contains 5 characters and 3 fill characters.So far, I've figured out how to do this for strings less than 8 characters, but not for more than 8 characters, where the string is split up, which is what I am stuck on.How do you split a string up?
You can use a slightly modified version of this chunking recipe:str.ljust performs the necessary padding.
A slightly modified version of @jpp's answer is to first pad the string with your fill character, so that the length is cleanly divisible by 8:And if you needed the size to be variable, you can just add in a size argument:
Yet another possibility:
I am also new to programming but I think you could use this...Just change x to whatever value you want..Check out https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-split/amp/Hope it helps.
Here is the simple answer that you can understand that solves your problem with few simple ifs:
