Natural Text
I am trying to read a word from the file and select one word at random. I can select a random word however some of the words have extra space after the word, e.g an indent. How do i remove this?
I think you need strip() Example:
Use .strip()
I think applying rstrip() to your word should work : https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstripSo you can do :    secret_word = random.choice(random_word).rstrip()
I would apply a rstrip() method to you code: More derails here : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_rstrip.htmCheers
