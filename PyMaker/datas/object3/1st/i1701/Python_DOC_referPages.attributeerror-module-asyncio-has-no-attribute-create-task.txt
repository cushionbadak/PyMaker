I'm trying to asyncio.create_task() but I dealing with this error:Here's an example:Out:So I tried with the following snippet code (.ensure_future()) instead, without any problem:Out:[UPDATE]:With borrowing from @user4815162342 answer, I updated my question:What's wrong?[NOTE]:Python 3.6Ubuntu 16.04
The create_task top-level function was added in Python 3.7, and you are using Python 3.6. Prior to 3.7, create_task was only available as a method on the event loop, so you can invoke it like that:That works in both 3.6 and 3.7, as well as in earlier versions. asyncio.ensure_future will work as well, but when you know you're dealing with a coroutine, create_task is more explicit and is the preferred option.
