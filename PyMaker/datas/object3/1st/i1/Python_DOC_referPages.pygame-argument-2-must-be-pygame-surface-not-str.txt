My code so far, the problem I have is that when I enter the sprite from the selection, I get an error stating that the argument must be surface not string. I am wondering how to fix this. What I am trying to do is have the user select a sprite from the following, SP1R, SP1O etcetera. But after I input one of the sprites, the program does not accept it and it gives the following error:
After the inputthe content of the variable UserSprite is a string. You have to find the variable with the name, which is stored in the variable UserSprite.You can get the dictionary with the local variables by the built in function vars(), when you call it without any parameter. This means vars()["SP1R"] will return the object SP1R.
