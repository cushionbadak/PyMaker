I came across a function named any with numpy and I could not understand its usage in some context which is given as folllows:Could someone help me understand what is happening here? What is being checked? The documentation says, Tests whether any array element along a given axis evaluates to True.Is it being checked for equality? To understand this better, how could I rewrite the any call?
np.any(x) checks if any of the elements in x is true. In your case, it checks if the arrays original and duplicate have at least a different dimension.You could rewrite this as:
It's being checked for "True"ness.Try this:
The any method checks if at least on element in the given data is evaluated as True.In python the following things are evaluated False:NoneFalseany numeric zeroempty strings, sets, lists, dictionaries ...anything that has a __len__ method which returns 0 or a __bool__ method that returns FalseEverything else is evaluated True.If the data checked by the any method contains at least one item that does not meet these requirements, it returns True else False
