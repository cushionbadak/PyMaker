There are few problems with your pattern, correct usage is:Your pattern '((a-z)+(-)(a-z)+/(a-z)+/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{2)(-)(a-z)+(.)(a-z)+)' do not work because:\d{2) - you should close { with } not )a-z - this is equivalent to any lowercase letter inside and only inside [ ] not ( ). - you should use \. if you mean character .

If you only need to see if that path is valid in the sense that you want to know if it exists, then just use:
