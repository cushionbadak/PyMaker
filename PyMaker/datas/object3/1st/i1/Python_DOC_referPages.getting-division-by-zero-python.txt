this is my code. but when I  do print(percent_of_goal(0, 1000)) with 0 as the donation, I get  a zero division error? how do I fix this? error message: 
The first line in your function is causing the problem...perc = float(goal/donation)Reverse your ratio by replacing with this (Considering this note: You do not need to deal with the case of a goal of zero):Otherwise, just add a simple if statement:
To calculate the donation-to-goal ratio, you should divide donation by the goal, rather than the other way around:
Before using the division operator, you should always check that your denominator is valid, and provide an alternate output that is appropriate to your use case.In this example, perhaps you want a function like this instead of using /:
The problem is you can not divide by zero (just regular math) perhaps you could try using an if statement, where the perc returns zero if the donation <= 0:
