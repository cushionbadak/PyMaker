This question already has an answer here:Turn string into operator                    7 answers                I want to use arithmetic operations in python from given tuple. Thing is i know i can use if statements for each of them and depending on user input it will give the correct answer. I don't know but is there a way to do it without ifs.

You can use the operator module and a dict !5
It is basically the same as @Fukiyel's answer, but without the use of operator module. You implement all the operations you want your calculator to support, then you create a dict with key the operator characters and value the functions:
You can use eval but be careful with it, as it allows arbitrary code execution if not handled correctly.
