one step further than How to implement conditional string formatting?Basically: is it possible to add if, elif.... else in a format string?
Author of the questions asks if it is possible to add if, elif, else in string formating. So, I do assume author wants to change the value of the string depending on some condition but wants to use if, elif, else for some reasons.Here is my answer:I personally do not like if, elif, else logic in such case.
Although I would not recommend it - to answer the question:It is not possible to use elif in a format string.It is however possible to use nested conditional expressions:outputs:see https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions
