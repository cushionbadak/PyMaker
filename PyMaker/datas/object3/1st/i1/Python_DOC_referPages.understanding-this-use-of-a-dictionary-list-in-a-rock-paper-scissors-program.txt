I do not understand what this is exactly saying: a.lower() == x and b.lower() == rules[x]:I get the a.lower() == x part, but what exactly is the b.lower() == rules[x], specifically what rules[x]is saying?
Let's have a detailled look.What are all the x in rules ? You have x = "rock", x = "scissors" and x = "papers".rules is a dict, so there are keys and values in it. For example, it has the value "scissors" attached to the key "rock", so rules["rock"] == "scissors".Therefore, we are here checking if the player a gets a key with as value what the player b have (in our example, it would be a gets "rock" and b gets "scissors".If so, player a wins.You really need to learn more about dictionaries though, because this is more than essential. Check on this to learn basics of dict objects.
