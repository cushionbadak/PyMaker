I am manually trying to get permutations of all elements in a list.This is the code I have written.This returns 23 whereas I should be getting 24 unique lists. What am I doing wrong? What I am looking for is guidance to why one of the lists is missing. 
You can just see the code from itertools.permutations() which does the same thing.https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations
