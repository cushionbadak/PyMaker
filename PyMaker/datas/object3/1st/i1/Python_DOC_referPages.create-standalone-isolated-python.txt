I'm to deploy Python into a production system and the python script I have has a number of modules associated with it.Is there a way to install python with only a specific list of modules? Abit like with generating a jar, you can have a folder with all the other dependency jar's in a folder, which is nice and clean. I don't want to compile the python code so I want something similar.(Note: I also don't want to create a virtual environment - I want the default environment like this)
You can either use virtualenv, which basically is what the name suggests, or you can use Docker, which personally I prefer
If you don't want to do like what Amir is suggesting above, then 2 other options are available:Copy those modules and place them in the same folder where your script is installedCreate a requirements.txt file with the name & version of those modules and then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install these modules in your site-packages folder
To manage your python packages you can use great virtualenv tool, it looks really simple and works well on linux/macOS/Windows. Any package which will be installed in activated virtualenv will be available only in this virtualenv, so you can have for example 3 different versions of "Django" package on your machine and work with them using different virtual environments:Install virtualenv:Create your virtualenv:Activate your virtualenv:Check what packages have been installed:Install any package for example "Django":Confirm installation:Uninstall any package from your virtual environment:Uninstall all packages from your virtual environment:Deactivate virtualenvMore info in the official documentation: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
