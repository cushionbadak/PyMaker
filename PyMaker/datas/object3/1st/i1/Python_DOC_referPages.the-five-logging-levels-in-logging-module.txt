I read logging — Logging facility for Python — Python 3.7.3rc1 documentation and find there are 6 kinds of log level are definedUpon referring to linux syslog ,8 kinds are defindedsyslog(2) - Linux manual pageAdditionally, SSH defined 8 kinds as wellSSH LogLevel sshd_config(5)Where does the definitions of the five kinds logging level originate?
You'll notice that the logging module lets you define additional levels if you need to, and that the missing ones are rather specific to the domains of the tools whose documentation you are referring to."Quiet" is identical to disabling logging entirely and a "fatal" error would presumably be one where your Python program has to terminate. If you want additional debugging levels in a particular application of yours, go ahead and define them - though a better approach might be to just use logging.DEBUG for everything, and instead selectively enable or disable debug-level logging for individual submodules in your system.
