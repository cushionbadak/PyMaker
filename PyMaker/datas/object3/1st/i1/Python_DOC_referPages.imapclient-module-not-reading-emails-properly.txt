Natural Text
I am using python3 and, using my email credentials, this function prints a block of text that appears to be divided into formal sections. Here is my code for reading emails:This email can be accessed through less secure apps by the way, by google's settings. Anyway, when you run this with your credentials, you get this big block of text. The side notes tell you what is what, and the quotes were there in my script to remind me where things are:I can see the \n, \r and b'' in there but it doesn't function. It's just printed out completely. How do I print this formally?
The imapclient docs demonstrate how to create email message objects using Python's email package:If you want to print a complete message you could doThe email.message.EmailMessage class provides various methods for accessing different parts of a message such as headers, body, mime parts.
