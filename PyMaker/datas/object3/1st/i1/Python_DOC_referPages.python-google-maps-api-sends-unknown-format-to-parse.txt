I use the Python Client for Google Maps Services to get following data from google-maps:Now I want to extract certain  variables, like the "street_number". I don't know which format this data is, so I worked with it like a dictionary:The problem is, that the index "0" isn't always the same position of the data I want, i varies. Is there a way to extract the data in another way? Perhaps I have to use a JSON-parser or something similar?Thanks a lot.
The answer is: List comprehensionsSince this will probably be a common operation, make a function:PS, regarding:Perhaps I have to use a JSON-parser or something similar?JSON is a data transfer format - it's plain text. The Google API server used it to get the data across the wire. In your program it has already been parsed - by the Google API client library you are using. What you are looking at is not JSON anymore, it's a Python data structure (nested dicts and lists and values). It just happens to look quite similar to JSON when you print it to the console, because Python uses a similar format to represent data.On other words, no, you don't need to JSON-parse it again.
