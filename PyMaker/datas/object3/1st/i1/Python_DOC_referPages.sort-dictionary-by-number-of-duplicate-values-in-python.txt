You can start by counting the amount of times each value appears with collections.Counter:And now sort the dictionary looking up how many times each value appears using a key in sorted:Note however that if you obtain a dictionary from the result, the order will not be mantained, as dictionaries have no order.So one thing you can so is use collections.OrderedDict to keep the order, simply call OrderedDict(res) on the resulting list of tuples.
First, we count occurences of each value. Counter can be used instead of defaultdict. Then sort them according to count_dict lookup table we just created.Update : You can create count_dict with Counter like:
I'm not sure if you want to keep the order of months. I assume you want, so here is the solution.And the result is:
