I recently ran pip install pyodbc. Which says it installed pyodbc successfully on the cmd. However when I do import pyodbc in IDLE I receive an error saying 'No module named pyodbc'. It seems only two files have been installed when I ran pip install pyodbc.The two files:pyodbc-4.0.26.dist-infopyodbc.cp36-win32.pydVERSION of Python:Python 3.6.3Complete Error Message:Error MessageHow do I resolve this issue? Any help would be much appreciated, I'm new to python and this is quite frustrating.
The files that installed are fine. *.pyd is compiled library (see https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll).Issues that may cause this:IDLE running main python installation and you installed the package in virtual environmentYou have several installations of python e.g. python 3.x alongside python 2.xI think first of all try to run all the steps from the same cmd:This should work...And then try to understand if you have several virtualenvs or python instalations.You can check which python IDLE run, by right click on it's shortcut and "open file location" for example
