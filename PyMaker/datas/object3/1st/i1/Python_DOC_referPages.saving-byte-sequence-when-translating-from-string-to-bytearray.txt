Natural Text
I get a string that is formed from messages of different types. I'm interested in the message, which before the appearance in the string was in the format bytearray, but now comes in the format str. For example, I need to translate 001bc5045000043a, obtained in str format, into byteray format, saving the numbers from this sequence to bytearray.
To convert a string of hex digits to a bytearray, assuming two hex digits per byte, use bytearray.fromhex:Python will represent bytes as the equivalent ASCII character if the byte is in the ASCII range (0-127 / 0 - 0x7f) and the character is printable, hence 0x3a is displayed as ':'
