I'm using python 2.7 and Jenkins latest version.When Jenkins is triggered, results from python script is stored in pickle files for the future use.Whenever a build happens, I want to store every build results of a python script in pickle files. I'm able to store the results in pickle files.How can I save every build's results with different file names so that I can access the files from the python script.Is it possible to add build_number and job_name as a file name or appending/prepending build_number to current file name ?Later with another python script I should be able to access the current and previous successful build (last 2 successful builds) pickle files to compare the results.For the solution, Changes in Jenkinsfile or python script or both are welcome.Thanks.
