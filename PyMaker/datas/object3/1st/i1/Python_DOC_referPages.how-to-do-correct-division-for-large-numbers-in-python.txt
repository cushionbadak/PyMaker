Why is there an error for division in both: int and float? and how to correct it?
Here is a very nice explantionWhat you need is The use of // rather than / for integer division is for compatibility with Python 3.x for no extra effort.Also make sure to take a quick lookfor the / and // operators
There seem to be two questions here. I'll address the first part of your print statement, which is print(int(231871064940156750/5)): see this related post long integers division error in python...I tried the suggestion therein (using two slashes) and it arrived at the quotient you expected.Informit.com explains, "...Python has two division operators, a single slash character for classic division and a double-slash for “floor” division (rounds down to nearest whole number). Classic division means that if the operands are both integers, it will perform floor division, while for floating point numbers, it represents true division."
