I'm working on a CNN and need to grab some images from URI's in a json file but keep them associated with the corresponding ids. I have a json file that looks something like this. I want to iterate through each product and extract 'id' and from 'image_uris' the "large" uri. I then want to put them into their own dictionary like this. At least this is what I think I want to do unless there is a better idea:My endgame would be to grab the images at those URI's and save them with the 'id' as the image name like this:Eventually these images will be used for CNN as I mentioned earlier. When the image is recognized a lookup can be performed and return all the other values from the json file.So far here is the code I've been using to extract the data I want. It grabs the 'id' fine but it grabs all of the image uris. I only want the  'large' uri. I've made various attempts to single out the 'large' uri without success Not really sure how to do it with a nested dictionary without throwing an error. I'm sure it is something simple but I'm still an amateur coder.
Using list comprehensions this can be done quite simplyNote that this assumes that in each dict within the list that there is always an id and a value for large in image_uris. If these aren't present you will get a KeyErrorIf this is the case you will have to utilise dict.get like so
Your edits to the product.json file still don't make it valid JSON, so I used the following instead, which is:So, ignoring that and assuming you're able to do it somehow yourself, you could create the dictionary you want using something called a dictionary display which is very similar to a list comprehension.Output:
