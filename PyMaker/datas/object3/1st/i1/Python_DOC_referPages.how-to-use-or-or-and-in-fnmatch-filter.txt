How do you apply OR or AND in the fnmatch filter?
fnmatch does not support that (in the general case), the syntax is quite limited - same as shell-style wildcards. You'll have to use regular expressions, or call filter twice and union the results (for OR) or intersect the results (for AND).
You can enclose 5 and 6 in square brackets to denote a character set:Please refer to fnmatch's documentation for details on the supported patterns.
