Is it possible to redirect logs from the built in logging module to a Slack channel, rather than stdout or a file.I was thinking there might be some way to do this using the Slack API client:
There is a package ‘slack-log-handler’ on PyPI.It contains a ‘LogHandler’ which can be used by the python logging module.
