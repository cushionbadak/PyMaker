I want to calculate something in C++ and return result to python. This is part of the C++ code:The error when running python script is: After debugging, I found that the error comes from this line:I'm not good at C++. Could anyone tell me how to fix the error? Thanks in advance!
You can't because encoded_x.data() is not UTF-8. You probably want bytes for a copy of the raw data:Using PyObject* PyBytes_FromStringAndSize(const char *v, Py_ssize_t len). Or you can use PyByteArray_FromStringAndSize for a bytearray with the same arguments.In this case, you can get rid of the vector and use flow_img_x.data and flow_img_x.total() directly.Or a memoryview to not copy the data, but just access the std::vectors dataUsing PyObject* PyMemoryView_FromMemory(char *mem, Py_ssize_t size, int flags)(If the vector was const, you would const_cast<char*>(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(encoded_x.data())) and only use PyBUF_READ)You have to make sure the vector stays alive in this case though, but it won't create an unnecessary copy.
