Suppose I have multiple async tasks running on my main thread.I use 'await' in my function to allow the execution of one function to be suspended at a blocking call, to allow another to continue. All good.However, is there a guarantee that the blocks of code between these calls will be executed continuously?I'm wondering if I can make modifications to global state between async calls -- without worrying about race conditions?
Yes.Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html
