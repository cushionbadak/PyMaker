python doc names single asterisk symbol Multiplication, which makes sense when I use this on numbers.this line of code produces number.this line of code produces a string consists of 8 characters. asterisk operator did the job. is the name of this job character time, string repetition something else? this question is NOT the same question in this post what i need is a official python doc link to name this operation.
It does not have a specific name and is just listed under string sequence operations in official document: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operationsIn some online courses this is simply referred as String Repetition.
