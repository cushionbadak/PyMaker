Natural Text
I have two tasks to do.1)I have to extract the headers of any CVS file containing invoices data.In specific: invoice number, address, location, physical good. I have been asked to create a text classifier for this task, therefore the classifier will go over any CVS file and identify those 4 headers. 2)After the classifier identifies the 4 words I have to find the attach the data of that column and create a class.I researched the matter and the three methodologies that I thought were must be appropriated are: 1)bad of words2)word embedded3)K-means clustering Bag of words can identify the word but it does not give me the location of the word itself to go and grab the column and create the class.Word embedded is over complicated for this task, I believe, and even if give me the position of the word in the file is too time-consuming for thisK-means seems simple and effective it tells me where the word is.My question before I start codingdid I miss something. Is my reasoning correct?And most important the second question Once the position of the word is identified in the CSV file how I translate that into coding so I can attach the data in that column  
I would simply:look at the first line of the file (the header); filter out the column names you are looking for, use enumerate so the result will contain the column indicesretrieve the column indices from the filtered resultiterate over the rest of the file;  use those indices to extract the specific columns' data from each line/rowput that data in a container for use later (maybe use a list)
