Today, I used math.log() function to get the logarithm of 4913 to the given base 17. The answer is 3, but when I ran the code below, I got 2.9999999999999996.1) Is it because math.log(x, b)'s calculation is log(x) / log(b)?2) Is there any solution to get the correct answer 3?
Yes, the documentation says so explicitly.Another solution is to use the Decimal class, from the "decimal" library:
you could use the gmpy2 library:which tells you the result and whether or not it is exact.also have a look at Log precision in python and Is floating point math broken?.
