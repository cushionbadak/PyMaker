Attempting to convert this EGCD equation into python.The test I used was egcd(5, 37) which should return (15,-2) but is returning (19.5, -5.135135135135135)My code is: 
a / b in Python 3 is "true division" the result is non-truncating floating point division even when both operands are ints.To fix, either use // instead (which is floor division):or use divmod to perform both division and remainder as a single computation, replacing both of these lines:with just:
Change q = a / b for q = a // b
