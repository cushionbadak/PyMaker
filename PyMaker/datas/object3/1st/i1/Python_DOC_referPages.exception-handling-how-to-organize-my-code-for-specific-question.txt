Natural Text
So, I'm currently taking an intro to programming class and we started learning about files and exception handling. I'm having trouble with a question that is based on exception handling. This question is asking me to read the data from population.txt, checks to make sure the file exists and is in the right format (if it isnâ€™t throw an appropriate exception), calculates the combined population of the countries in the text file and prints that total.This is how the file looks likeI did something like this. As you can see, I am confused as to how to organize my code, but I know I am onto something. Should I have put the if statements under the except clause? How would you guys have done this?
Exceptions need to be raised inside a try block to be catched. That part of the code is correct. You need however to catch all the different exceptions that may be raised and definitely in this case you do not need to raise them by yourself:As you see here the raise statement is not used explicitly: exceptions are raised by the built-in functions when their argument is not valid:OSError is the class of the exception raised by open if the file does not exists.ValueError is the class of the exception raised by int(wordList[1]) if the string wordList[1] cannot be converted to an integer.IndexError is raised by wordlist[1] if the length of wordlist is 0, hence Index out of range. It may happen if a line is not splitted because ':' is missing.It seems to me that you do not need other exception classes in this code. However the list of all the built-in exceptions is in the docs, if you wish to know what other exceptions are available.
You can use With Statement Context Managers to avoid exceptions while reading data from the file.
