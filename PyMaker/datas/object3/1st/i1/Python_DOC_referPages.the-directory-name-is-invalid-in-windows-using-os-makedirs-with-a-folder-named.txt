I'm trying to create a folder that is valid according to the lib os in Windows.But it failes with the following errorThe problem? You can't use "aux" as a folder name in Windows.Is there a workaround in python to:"Really" check if the folder is valid (the "if" in the code above is not enough)Create the folder anyway?
In general, filesystem operations are where it's Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission.The best way to do this is to try to create the directory, catch the OSError if it fails, and then handle the failure.
