I'm very new to programming, and to vscode.I'm learning Python and currently I am learning about working with files.The path looks like this: /home/anewuser/learning/chapter10. The problem: completely basic "read file in python" lesson does not work in vscode because no such file or directory error raises when running my .py file, located in ~/learning/chapter10. But vscode wants that my .txt file I am supposed to open in python, to be in ~/learning directory, then it works. I don't like this behaviour.All I want is to be able to read file placed in the directory where the .py file is. How to do this?
Because in your case ~/learning is the default cwd (current working directory), VSCode looks for pi_digits.txt in that location. If you put pi_digits.txt beside file_reader.py (which is located at ~/learning/chapter10), you'll have to specify the path (by prepending chapter10/ to the .txt file). So you should do this: If you want to change the default current working directory (for example you want to change it to ~/learning/chapter10), you'll have to do the following: ~/learning/chapter10/file_reader.pyWith os.chdir('chapter10') you've set chapter10 as the default cwd, in which VSCode now will look for pi_digits.txt. For detailed information about os.chdir() you can read through the official documentation or take a look at this post on stackoverflow.
