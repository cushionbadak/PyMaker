You can't change the length of the iterable while iterating over it. If you want to print the minimum item and delete it until the list is empty, you should loop on the condition of the list beein empty, something like this:output:The problem of changing the iterable length is that python's interpreter basically will try to get the next element based on the previous position on the list.For example, if you loop trough:the first item will be a (the item on index 0). The next iteration of the for loop it will try to retrieve the item on index 1 but if you remove a, the Ã¬ndex 1 will not be b anymore, because your current list will look like this;and the index 1is now c, skipping every other item on neext iterations
if you want to clear the whole list, the use the inbuilt function clear(). below is the example how to do that.
