I've got youtube comments in the form of .csv files, what I'm trying to do is search for specific words inside of the comments. I have a list which I think I'm comparing the row containing the comments to, but it doesn't seem to be adding to the slurCount when it comes across a term inside that list, while noSlurCount counts up all the comments.Any help would be awesome
You should at least test against your slur-list. This is wrong:It is never true because you test:which is False because .. it is not in it :o)Even better would be to use a set and set.intersection():Create slurred file:Program:Output:Doku:set.intersection (2.7 - but ident in 3.8)str.strip()
