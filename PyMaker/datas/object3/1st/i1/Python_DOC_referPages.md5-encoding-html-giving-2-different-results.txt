Natural Text
Can someone help explain why this is happening? If I scrape HTML from a site using the requests module and use hashlib to get the md5 checksum I get one answer. Then if I save the html as an html file, open it, and do the same md5 checksum it gives me a different checksum. The results look like:
When reading from a file in text mode, Python may convert newline characters depending on the value of the newlines argument provided to open.  When reading input from the stream, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is '', universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated.This difference will affect the generated hash value.
