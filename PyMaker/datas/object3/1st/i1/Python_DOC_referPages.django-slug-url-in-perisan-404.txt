This is an addition to Selcuk answer given hereto pass such language/unicode characters you have to Write some custom path converterUse re_path() function1 . Custom path converterIf we look into the source code of Django, the slug path converter uses this regex, [-a-zA-Z0-9_]+ which is inefficent here (see Selcuk's answer).So, Write your own custom slug converter , as belowThen register it,2. using re_path()You've already tried and succeeded with this method. Anyway, I'm c&p it here :)
According to Django 2.1 documentation you can only use ASCII letters or numbers for slug patterns:slug - Matches any slug string consisting of ASCII letters or numbers, plus the hyphen and underscore characters. For example, building-your-1st-django-site.whereas regex \w pattern also matches Unicode word characters:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#index-32For Unicode (str) patterns:  Matches Unicode word characters; this includes most characters that can be part of a word in any language, as well as numbers and the underscore. If the ASCII flag is used, only [a-zA-Z0-9_] is matched.
