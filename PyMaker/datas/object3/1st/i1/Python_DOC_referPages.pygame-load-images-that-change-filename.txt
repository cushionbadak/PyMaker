I have a raspberry pi and a picamera that takes photos and displays them with pygame. I changed the captude code to save the date and time and it works fine.My question is on the pygame image load function how do I open the last saved image. As more images are saved the file name will change.How would I load the last saved image and then close pygame? Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
If you use ISO-8601 date format - YYYY-MM-DD (which sorts alphabetically), it will be the last file in the directory listing.  And then get a sorted directory listing, so the last file will be the latest:
