You need to check if the current char is "a" and the next is "i" or the other option ("h" and "i").Let's do some code:I splitted the String into a new String (removed the spaces into a String and the other, having as result a vector of Strings).Next I'm running the vector string by string with the first for. With the second for I'm running the entire string char by char. Then I do some checks to identify if my string has a "ai" or "hi". If the String has some of these characters I print them.Now, you have only to change the respective char for a char you want
