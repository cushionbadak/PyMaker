in pinax Userdict.py:why does it do this on self.__class__.__missing__.thanks
The UserDict.py presented here emulates built-in dict closely, so for example:just as you can override the special method __missing__ to deal with missing keys when you subclass the built-in dict, so can you override it when you subclass that UserDict.The official Python docs for dict are here, and they do say:New in version 2.5: If a subclass of  dict defines a method __missing__(),  if the key key is not present, the  d[key] operation calls that method  with the key key as argument. The  d[key] operation then returns or  raises whatever is returned or raised  by the __missing__(key) call if the  key is not present. No other  operations or methods invoke  __missing__(). If __missing__() is not defined, KeyError is raised.  __missing__() must be a method; it cannot be an instance variable. For an  example, see collections.defaultdict.
If you want to use default values in a dict (aka __missing__), you can check out defaultdict from  collections module:
