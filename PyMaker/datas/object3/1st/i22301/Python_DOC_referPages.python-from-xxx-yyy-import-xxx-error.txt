I'm working with the PyFacebook package in Python, and I've seen people mention numerous times that you can write an import statement as follows:However, it does not work. It states that facebook.method_name exists in the facebook module, rather than the djangofb module. I assume I'm importing the facebook.method_name as facebook, not that I'm receiving it from the facebook package itself.I'm using Python 2.6.How can I alias facebook.djangofb as facebook?
This is the proper way to alias a module via import:
From the python 3 documentation (it works the same way in python 2.6, but I found the python 3 documentation explained it clearer):If the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module.So your statement should look like:and then facebook.method_name will work.Also see Can you define aliases for imported modules in Python? for additional aliasing options
If you're looking to import djangofb as facebook, that's how you need to do it.This way, you can access facebook.djangofb.method_name like facebook.method_name.That being said, it's more common to give it a non conflicting name, here it would be fb or face. Something that doesn't override the root facebook import.
