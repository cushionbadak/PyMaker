I was just wondering, how would I be able to send a xml-rpc request in python? I know you can use xmlrpclib, but how do I send out a request in xml to access a function?I would like to see the xml response.So basically I would like to send the following as my request to the server:and get back the response
Here's a simple XML-RPC client in Python:Works with this server:To access the guts of xmlrpclib, i.e. looking at the raw XML requests and so on, look up the xmlrpclib.Transport class in the documentation.
I have pared down the source code in xmlrpc.client to a minimum required to send a xml rpc request (as I was interested in trying to port the functionality). It returns the response XML.Server:Client:
What do you mean by "get around"?  xmlrpclib is the normal way to write an XML-RPC client in python.  Just look at the sources (or copy them to your own module and add print statements!-) if you want to know the details of how things are done.
