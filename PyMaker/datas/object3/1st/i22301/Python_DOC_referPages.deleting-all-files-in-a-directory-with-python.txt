I want to delete all files with the extension .bak in a directory. How can I do that in Python?
Via os.listdir and os.remove:Or via glob.glob:Be sure to be in the correct directory, eventually using os.chdir.
Use os.chdir to change directory .Use glob.glob to generate a list of file names which end it '.bak'. The elements of the list are just strings.Then you could use os.unlink to remove the files. (PS. os.unlink and os.remove are synonyms for the same function.)
In Python 3.5, os.scandir is better if you need to check for file attributes or type - see os.DirEntry for properties of the object that's returned by the function. This also doesn't require changing directories since each DirEntry already includes the full path to the file. 
you can create a function. Add maxdepth as you like for traversing subdirectories.
First glob them, then unlink.
On Linux and macOS you can run simple command to the shell:
I realize this is old; however, here would be how to do so using just the os module...
