I noticed that this recipe seems to use __rlshift__, __ror__ like operators. But, they aren't in the documentation! Can anyone explain these and perhaps point to some docs?
See the documentation for:object.__rlshift__()object.__ror__()__rlshift__ is the swapped operands version of __lshift__, used when the right-hand operand supports the operation but the left-hand operand doesn't.
