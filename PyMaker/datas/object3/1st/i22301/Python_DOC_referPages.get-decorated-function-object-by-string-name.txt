How do you get the real f object (not decorator wrap)?
You don't.1  Store it if you need to access it later.1 You could mess with the closure, but I can't recommend it.
The functools module also provides a wraps decorator which makes sure that the wrapped function looks more like the real function: correct name, module, and docstring, for example.
If you're running python 3.2 or above, and you use functools.wraps then you will find the wrapped function on the __wrapped__ attribute:functools.wrapsis a convenience function for decorating a decorated function with the function that does all the work, including adding this attribute functools.update_wrapper.
