I'd like to get from this:to this:Is there a pythonic way of doing it?This is an ugly way to do it:
dict.fromkeys([1, 2, 3, 4])This is actually a classmethod, so it works for dict-subclasses (like collections.defaultdict) as well. The optional second argument specifies the value to use for the keys (defaults to None.)
nobody cared to give a dict-comprehension solution ?

Output:

In many workflows where you want to attach a default / initial value for arbitrary keys, you don't need to hash each key individually ahead of time. You can use collections.defaultdict. For example:This is more efficient, it saves having to hash all your keys at instantiation. Moreover, defaultdict is a subclass of dict, so there's usually no need to convert back to a regular dictionary.For workflows where you require controls on permissible keys, you can use dict.fromkeys as per the accepted answer:
