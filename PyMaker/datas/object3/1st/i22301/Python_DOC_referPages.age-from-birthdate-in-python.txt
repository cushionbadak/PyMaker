How can I find an age in python from today's date and a persons birthdate? The birthdate is a from a DateField in a  Django model.
That can be done much simpler considering that int(True) is 1 and int(False) is 0:
Update: Use Danny's solution, it's better
In Python 3, you could perform division on datetime.timedelta:
The simplest way is using python-dateutil
As suggested by @[Tomasz Zielinski] and @Williams python-dateutil can do it just 5 lines.

Unfortunately, you cannot just use timedelata as the largest unit it uses is day and leap years will render you calculations invalid.  Therefore, let's find number of years then adjust by one if the last year isn't full:Upd:This solution really causes an exception when Feb, 29 comes into play.  Here's correct check:Upd2:Calling multiple calls to now() a performance hit is ridiculous, it does not matter in all but extremely special cases.  The real reason to use a variable is the risk of data incosistency.
The classic gotcha in this scenario is what to do with people born on the 29th day of February. Example: you need to be aged 18 to vote, drive a car, buy alcohol, etc ... if you are born on 2004-02-29, what is the first day that you are permitted to do such things: 2022-02-28, or 2022-03-01? AFAICT, mostly the first, but a few killjoys might say the latter.Here's code that caters for the 0.068% (approx) of the population born on that day:Here's the output:
Here is a solution to find age of a person as either years or months or days.Lets say a person's date of birth is 2012-01-17T00:00:00Therefore, his age on 2013-01-16T00:00:00 will be 11 monthsor if he is born on 2012-12-17T00:00:00, his age on 2013-01-12T00:00:00 will be 26 daysor if he is born on 2000-02-29T00:00:00,his age on 2012-02-29T00:00:00 will be 12 yearsYou will need to import datetime.Here is the code:Some extra functions used in the above codes are:AndNow, we have to feed get_date_format() with the strings like 2000-02-29T00:00:00It will convert it into the date type object which is to be fed to get_person_age(date_birth, date_today).The function get_person_age(date_birth, date_today) will return age in string format.
If you're looking to print this in a page using django templates, then the following might be enough:
Expanding on Danny's Solution, but with all sorts of ways to report ages for younger folk (note, today is datetime.date(2015,7,17)):Sample code:
As I did not see the correct implementation, I recoded mine this way...Assumption of being "18" on the 28th of Feb when born on the 29th is just wrong.Swapping the bounds can be left out ... it is just a personal convenience for my code :)
Extend to Danny W. Adair Answer, to get month also
import datetimeIn your case:
Slightly modified Danny's solution for easier reading and understanding
