When coding in Python, I often need to write a function like this one:Which is basically just a remove command with a user prompt to double-check (I also have one for deleting files). Given the large amounts of Python modules out there, including in the standard library, I'm wondering if something like this already exists out there?
It wouldn't be a Python thing, but if you keep using os.system() to make the delete call, you can pass the -i parameter to rm. The man page explains it:-i       prompt before every removalEDIT: I just read your code again and it looks like you're only prompting once before the entire delete process, not for each file. You might be interested in the -I flag instead:-I       prompt  once  before  removing  more than three files, or when  removing recursively.  Less intrusive  than -i, while still giving protection                against most mistakes
to remove directory, use os module os.rmdir(), os.removedirs(). Or shutil.rmtree() .check the docs for more information
well ,you could save this function in a module and reuse it in other modules,that way ,your problem will be solved !
