When reading through a file, I know it's possible to get the next line via next(), but is there a function like, say, prev() to go to the previous line?In a similar vein, when looping through a file, is it possible to get the second line after the target line? next() will only return the line after as a string.
No, there is no counterpart. You can just store previous lines in a variable:For multiple items you could use a collections.deque() object:You cannot know what comes next until you retrieve it from the iterable, but you can certainly track what came previously.You are not limited to calling next() once; if you need to retrieve two lines from the iterable, call next() twice, or use itertools.islice() with next() to retrieve multiple items.
