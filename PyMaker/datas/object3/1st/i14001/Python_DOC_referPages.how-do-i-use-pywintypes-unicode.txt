How do I use pywintypes.Unicode in Python 3.3.5?This produces an error:I've seen other code uses that look the same to me, so what is wrong here?
TL;DR: It's a bug affecting Python 3, and you don't need pywintypes.Unicode(text) in Python 3. Just use text directly if you need a string and bytes(text, encoding) if you need them as bytes.The errorhints at the bad format char in the C++ source, t#, which is impossible (unknown).Thanks to eryksun's comments and by looking at the documentation pages of PyArg_ParseTuple() for Python 2 and Python 3, it becomes clear that the bug is in win32/src/PyWinTypesmodule.cpp.t# only exists for Python 2, for Python 3 it should be something like s*, and according to eryksun, MBCS-decoding is unnecessary as Python already handles Unicode strings automatically.
