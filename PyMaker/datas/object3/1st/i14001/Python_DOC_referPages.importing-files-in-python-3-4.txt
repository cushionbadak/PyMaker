I'm having trouble importing my own Python file. My file structure looks as such:In the settings.py file there is a method, get_config() that uses configparser to parse the config.ini file to gather values for settings that are stored in a dict.The contents of caboose.py are simple:bot\\__init__.py contains:And settings.py just contains the method get_config(). The method works fine; it was originally in the caboose.py file, but for cleanliness, I wanted to move it to its own file.However, when I run the caboose.py file, I get this error:I'm sure there's some fundamental part of importing modules/files in Python that I'm not understanding, and I've decided to ask for help. Thank you for your time and any possible answers!
You are facing the issue because your first item sys.path still remains at caboose2\ directory when the bot's __init__.py is run.__init__.py is used for doing initialization logic for the module, you do not need to import settings.py into your __init__.py file.Leave the __init__.py file empty and do the following in your caboose.py - If you really need to import settings.py in your __init__.py file, try -
EDITED First read this - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesThe __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the  directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent  directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally  hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In  the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can  also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__  variable, described later.There are 2 options - Eeither use the module export If you wish to use the __init__.py then do this - First add and __all__ to export the method from package - File: __init__.py:File: caboose.py:OR Ignore the __init__.py completely and remove everything from inside it. Then the code in caboose.py will work automatically.File: caboose.py:
