What is the role of that if on the second line? Does it checks if there is an argument?
In python, an empty string, or an empty list or set, etc are all False in boolean context, also None is False in boolean context (also number 0 is False) (that is when used in if statement), the check if month: , checks whether month is not None or month is not empty string (I am guessing month is string, as you call capitalize() on it).Only if month is not empty and month is not None, the statements inside if are executed.Examples to show this behavior -Reference for Python Truth value testing .
The line if month: is a Truth Value Test.This means it checks that the variable month is not one of these values:NoneFalsezero of any numeric type, for example, 0, 0.0, 0j (and 0L if Python 2.7).any empty sequence, for example, '', (), [].any empty mapping, for example, {}.instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a __nonzero__() or __len__() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False.
As per your sample program:if month is list:A list of months are passed to the function valid_monthThe first if checks if the month is not a empty list then you have used a function capitalize() on the list and getting a value In second if you are checking if the value is present in the list and returning itIf month is a string:A string month is  passed to the function valid_monthThe first if checks if the month is not a empty string then you have used a function capitalize() on the string to capitalize the month In second if you are checking if the capitalized month  is present in the input month and returning it
The if statement is to validate the parameter (i.e., check if it is null).
