I'm writing a piece of code that returns profiling information and it would be helpful to be able to dynamically return the implementation of Python in use.Is there a Pythonic way to determine which implementation (e.g. Jython, PyPy) of Python my code is executing on at runtime?  I know that I am able to get version information from sys.version:but I'm not sure where to look in the sys module to get the implementation that the code is running.
You can use python_implementation from the platform module in Python 3 or Python 2.  This returns a string that identifies the Python implementation.e.g. return_implementation.pyand iterating through some responses on the command line: Note as of this answer's date, the possible responses are 'CPython', 'IronPython', 'Jython', 'PyPy', meaning that it's possible that your implementation will not be returned by this python_implementation function if it does not identity to the sys module as one of these types.python_implementation is calling sys.version under the hood and attempting to match the response to a regex pattern -- if there's no conditional match, there's no matching string response.
