I am using Boto in Python to connect to Amazon MWS. I have successfully connected using their scripts but am having trouble parsing the response as I don't fully understand the documentation, and there are little to no examples on the internet. I am new to Python.Here is how I get my response from MWS:The first product gives a response of this:My Issue is trying to get the details from the ItemAttributes:At this point I believe it is a dictionary object.As I am new to this language I can't figure out how to get all the information that is located in the () such as Brand, Studio, etc.Boto has some built in functions such as Response and ResponseFactory, but I am lost again as I keep hitting a wall trying to get info such as Brand, etc..Thank you again for any help you can give in this.
If you want "to get the details" for output, you can try Python's Data pretty printer:The pprint module provides a capability to “pretty-print” arbitrary  Python data structures...Its output is very much configurable, and you can go down the structure to an arbitrary depth, with depth=....If you want "to get the details" for using it elsewhere, I would suggest a few things:Try not indexing with [0], you may be losing information stored somewhere else in Attributes.Check available methods with How do I get list of methods in a Python class?, or Finding what methods an object has.Check type with What's the canonical way to check for type in python?.With the information obtained on Attributes you should be able to extract any info stored in it.
