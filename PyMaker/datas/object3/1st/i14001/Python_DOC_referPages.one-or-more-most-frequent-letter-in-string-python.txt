The question asks me to return a string in lowercase with the most frequently occurring letter(s) in s in alphabetical order. So far I have:If I put in 'aaaabbbb' it should give me 'ab' but it only gives me 'a'. How do I fix this?
You could use the builtin collections.Counter:If you can't use Counter for some reason, you could use a default dictionary:
I recommend using the set() function so that you're not checking repeated characters multiple times.This first turns the string into a set, eliminating duplicates. It then sorts that set according to how often each element appears in the original string, in reverse (descending) order. Finally, it joins the sorted elements into a single string and returns it.
The other answers are more pythonic. For your code though there are a few mistakes you made. See them in the comments of the following code
Here, the solution which is adapted to the code you offered and without using a Set :)
