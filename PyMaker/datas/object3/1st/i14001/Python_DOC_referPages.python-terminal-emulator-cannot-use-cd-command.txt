I found this code snippet online for a python terminal emulator, I thought it looked cool so I went ahead and attempted to use it. I noticed that I'm not able to use the "cd" command, I'm stuck in the directory I ran the file in. Why is this? What's going on? And how can I modify this code to make it  run like a perfect native terminal? I'm still very new to programming and have only played with the subprocess module once in my life. Please help! 
When you open a new process you change the current directory for the new process and not for the calling process. You should use os.chdir instead to change the directory of your program. So you need to parse the command line and check if the command is cd and then decide not to call Popen but os.chdir instead.
