I am newbie to Python.Basically, I want to write a program to read column D & E from an excel file, and calculate the total Incoming and Outgoing duration.Which Python module is used to read excel files and how to process data inside it?Excel file:
there are a couple of options depending on the version of excel you are using.openpyxl - used for reading Excel 2010 files (ie: .xlsx)xlrd - used for reading older Excel files (ie: .xls)I have only used xlrd, which you could do something like the below** Note ** code not tested
It seems like simply using Excel's =SUMIF() function would be sufficient.  However, you're asking for a Python solution, so here's a Python solution!Pandas is a library that provides a DataFrame data structure very similar to an Excel spreadsheet.  It provides a read_excel() function, whose documentation you can find here.  Once you have a DataFrame, you could do something like this:You can get Pandas for Python on Windows, but it's a bit difficult.  The easiest way is a Scientific Python distribution for Windows, like Anaconda.  On Linux, installing pandas is simple as sudo pip install pandas.
Using xlrd 0.9.3 in Python 3.4.1:It puts all values from row D and E in two separate list.It then combines each parallel elements of these lists (simply elements with same index) to a tuple using zip(). Then, these generated tuples are combined to a list. Using sum() and list comprehension, incoming_sum and outgoing_sum are calculated.Output:To install xlrd: (Windows)Download here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrdExtract to any directory, then change cmd's current directory ( chdir ) to the directory where you extracted, then type in cmd python setup.py installTake note that you will extract xlrd-0.9.3.tar.gz two times, first to remove .gz, second to remove .tar.The extracted directory (where you will change your cmd's current directory) will look like this:
