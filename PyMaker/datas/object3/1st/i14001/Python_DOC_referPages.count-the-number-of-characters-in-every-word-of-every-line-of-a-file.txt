Natural Text
this code will print the whole number of lines, total words and total number of characters in a text file. It is working fine and giving expected output. But I want to count the number of characters in each line and print like this :- Code :- Asis counting the whole lines, but how to take the each line for this operation? I am using Python 3.X
Store all the info in a dict then access by key. The code will only work for words delimited by whitespace so that is something you need to keep in mind.
Define a set of the allowed characters that you wish to count and then you can use len to get most of the data.Below, I have chosen the character set:['!', '"', '#', '$', '%', '&', "'", '(', ')', '*', '+', ',', '-', '.', '/', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', ':', ';', '<', '=', '>', '?', '@', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', '[', '\', ']', '^', '_', '`', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', '{', '|', '}', '~']
I was assigned the task of creating a program that prints the number of characters in a line.As a noob to programming, I found this was very difficult :(.Here is what I came up with, as well as his response -Here’s the core part of your program:It could be simplified to this:Note that the argument to the strip() function isn’t required; it strips whitespace by default, and ‘\n’ is whitespace.
Here is an easier version using the builtin collections.Counter which is a specialized dict which counts its inputs. We can use Counter.update() method to  slurp in all words (unique or not) on each line:Notes:I tested this and it gives identical counts to your codeit will be way faster since you're not iteratively appending to a list words (better to just hash the unique words only and store their counts, which is what Counter does), and also no need to iterate and increment charCount every time we see an occurrence of a word.if you only wanted word_count not char_count, you could just directly take word_count = sum(word_counter.values()) without needing to iterate over word_counter
