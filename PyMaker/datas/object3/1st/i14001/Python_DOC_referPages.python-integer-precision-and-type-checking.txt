I'm writing a python (2.7.6) script that pulls JSON data from a webserver and publishes it elsewhere. I only want to publish those JSON values that are numeric, e.g. no sub-objects or strings. It's very likely that the numeric values will exceed the size of int (in the C sense of size). My current code looks like this:My concern is the type check. If Python decides that int is no longer appropriate and uses long instead it means some metrics will not get published. And what to do if long gets exceeded?What I really want is a way to check that currentValue is numeric.There is isdigit but that doesn't work for negatives or floats.
You should use isinstance instead of typeExample -If you want to consider float as well, then -
