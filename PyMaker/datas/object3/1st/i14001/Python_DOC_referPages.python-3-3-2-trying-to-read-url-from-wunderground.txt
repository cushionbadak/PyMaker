I have been struggling for a while trying to convert some code from an older version of Python.  I'm simply trying to run an api lookup from wunderground and I can't get past my errors in python.  Here is the error: f = urllib.request.urlopen(fileName)AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'request'The code is pretty straight forward, I know i"m missing something simple, thanks for any help. 
Sometimes importing a package (e.g. numpy) automatically imports submodules (e.g. numpy.linalg) into its namespace. But that is not the case for urllib. So you need to useinstead of in order to access the urllib.request module. Alternatively, you could usein order to access the module as request. Looking at the examples in the docs is a good way to avoid problems like this in the future.Since f.read() returns a bytes object, and json.loads expects a str, you'll also need to decode the bytes. The particular encoding depends on what the server decides to send you; in this case the bytes are utf-8 encoded. So useto decode the bytes.There is a small typo on the last line. Use to interpolate the string "Current temperature in %s is: %s" with the values (location, temp_f). Note the placement of the quotation mark.Tip: Since zip is a builtin-function, it is a good practice not to name avariable zip since this changes the usual meaning of zip making it harderfor others and perhaps future-you to understand your code. The fix is easy: change zip to something else like zip_code.
I would recommend using the requests library Python HTTP for Humans., the code below will work on either python2 or 3:Getting the json is simply requests.get(fileName).json(), using str.format is the preferred method and I find less prone to errors, it is also far more feature-rich in comparison to the older printf style formatting. You can see it works under both 2 and 3 with a sample run:
