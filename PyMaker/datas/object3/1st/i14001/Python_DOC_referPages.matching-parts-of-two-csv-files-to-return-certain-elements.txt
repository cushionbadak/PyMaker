Hello I am looking for some help to do like an index match in excel i am very new to python but my data sets are far to large for excel nowI will dumb my question right down as much as possible cause the data contains alot of irrelevant information to this problemCSV A (has 3 Basic columns)CSV B (has 2 columns)CSV C (I want to create this using python; 2 columns)All I want to do is enter a date and have it look up all rows in CSV A which match that "date" and then look up the "score" associated to the "value" from that row in CSV A in CSV B and returning it in CSV C along with the name of the person. Rinse and repeat through every rowAny help is much appreciated I don't seem to be getting very far 
Here is a working script using Python's csv module:It prompts the user to input a date (format is m-d-yy), then reads csvA row by row to check if the date in each row matches the inputted date. If yes, it checks if the value that corresponds the date from the current row of A matches any of the rows in csvB. If there are matches, it will write the name from csvA and the score from csvB to csvC.Sample csv files:csvA.csvcsvB.csvSample Run:csvC.csv (generated by script)
if you are using unix you can do this by below shell scriptalso I am assuming that you are appending the search output in file_C and there are no duplicated in both source fileswhile truedoecho "enter date ..."read datevalue_one=grep $date file_A | cut -d',' -f1tmp1=grep $date' file_A | cut -d',' -f3value_two=grep $tmp1 file_B | cut -d',' -f2echo "${value_one},${value_two}" >> file_cecho "want to search more dates ... press y|Y, press any other key to exit"read chif [ "$ch" = "y" ] || [ "$ch" = "y" ]then continueelse exitfidone
