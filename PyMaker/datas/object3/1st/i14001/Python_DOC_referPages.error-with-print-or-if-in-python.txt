This is the code I have written with python (I have just started today).I got this error "expected an indented block" in line 5, I dont know what my mistake.Thank you for help.I use 3.4.3 python.
You should indent lines of code 4 spaces if it's part of that code block. In python this will include if statements, loops, def, and class. I recommend you read this article: Python-Indetation. To answer your question, change your code to:
Python requires indentation under if statements, as well as for and while loops, functions, classes, etc. You appear to be missing indentation. I would consider going through the Codecademy interactive tutorial for Python
You need indentation after your if statement.And undo the indents for the first three lines of your code. 
In C programming language a block of code (instructions) is enclosed in parenthesis. It does not matter the indentation. In Pascal the block is enclosed in 'begin' 'end'. As you have noticed by now in Python the block of instructions contained in an 'if', 'else', 'for', 'while', 'def', etc. statement is not enclosed by anything. Python knows that several instructions are the same block if they have the same indentation. Indentation can be any number of spaces or tabs and can vary through out the Python script. The only rule is that inside the same block it has to be the same indentations. Please see the code bellow checked with Python 2.7:
You need to indent print("you are great") in order for the program to compile
