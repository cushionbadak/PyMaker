I have a snippet like the following.I understand os.path.join is used to join one or more path components intelligently. So does that mean "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) is also a path component? Why would that be? Many thanks for your time and attention. 
Let's analyze your question:What you already know is: out_dir is a variable name, os.path.join is a method that creates a directory path out of two (or more) strings.What you're not completely sure about are the arguments of the method: dir being some variable declared before is also clear to you, but the expression "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) is little confusing to you.myfile-{0}" is a string and and one can call the method format on strings, the zero in the braces {0} is replaced by the first argument, and if there were {1} it would be replaced by a second argument. The return value of os.environ['JOB_ID'] is inserted in place of {0}.Let's say the return value is 1, so this would produce the string "myfile-1". And let's say the value of dir is "/path/to/the/directory". Then the variable out_dir is assigned the value "/path/to/the/directory/myfile-1". Pay attention to the slash /. os.path.join creates the path to the file taking care of the directory separator.That means  "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) is also a path component.
