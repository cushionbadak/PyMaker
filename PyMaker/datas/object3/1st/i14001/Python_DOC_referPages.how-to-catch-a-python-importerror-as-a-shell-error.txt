I have a following script which checks whether a python module is installed or not.This is a typlical try..catch syntax of bash. If the command before && would work it will execute the command after that otherwise execute the command after ||.But in this case, whether package is installed or not, or should I say whether the commandreturns None or ImportError, bash reads it as successful execution and prints "Successful import"How can I check for a successful import of a python package using bash? EDIT : And return with exit status 1?
You have at least two possibilities:Using "pip" on your shell script to get the list of installed packages then grep for tour package:pip list |  grep yourpackage && echo installed || echo "NOT Installed"Using Python-bash script, I don't know exactly how to call it but I know how to use it:Something like:here you have alot of alternatives to check for the existence of the package/module, so, intead of trying to import the package, you can check it's existence in a pythonic way. You can grab the different solutions for this answer or this and replace the import your_package; with one of them.
You can use the exception SystemExit(msg=None) with any message that's not None or 0. If it's uncaught, it'll cause the program to end, and if the msg is not None or 0, with an exit code of 1. (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit). test.pyin bash:
Use the python command for running code snippets programmatically, instead of ipython.There's an outstanding bug about this:https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/6912
