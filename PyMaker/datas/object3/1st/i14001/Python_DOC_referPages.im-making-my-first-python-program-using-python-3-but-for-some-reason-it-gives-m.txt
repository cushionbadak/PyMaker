I wanted to test my program in the middle of writing it, but it won't start for some reasonCODE:This is the error I got:1.LoginTraceback (most recent call last):2.RegisterFile "C:/Users/Joseph/PycharmProjects/LearningPython/Login_System.py", line    30, in    main()1.HelpFile "C:/Users/Joseph/PycharmProjects/LearningPython/Login_System.py", line 2, in mainmenu()File "C:/Users/Joseph/PycharmProjects/LearningPython/Login_System.py", line 5, in menu    input = int(input("Enter the corresponding number to the action you would like executed: "))UnboundLocalError: local variable 'input' referenced before assignment
input() ins in build function,In code you give variable name as input, give different variable name.
Your variable name input clashes with the built-in method input. The compiler is getting confused, thinking that the input() call is calling your locally-bound variable, and then complaining that you haven't defined it yet. Changing your variable name to user_input should fix this.
