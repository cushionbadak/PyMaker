I have pickled a model in python 2.7 with following sentenceHow I am in python 3.X and what to unpickle the model, but get errorThe code I tried is:
You pickle with 'w' but you unpickle with rb... So maybe that's the problem... The other thing I found out: 0x86 can be decoded using latin-1. So maybe you can try to change this, or both.I also read in the pickle docs that the pickle protocoll is automatically detected and should not cause the problem. So it seems to be all about encoding...
