Let's say I have a list of strings:I want to append spaces to the end of each string so that each string is 4 characters long. That is, I want the end product to look like this:I think list comprehension is the way to go, but I'm not sure exactly how to go about doing this. I know how to, for instance, pick out the strings that are of length 3 and add one space to them:But I don't know how to add varying numbers of spaces for varying lengths of strings
Another solution is to use str.ljust
You can use python's format. The general form for format specifier is:so, if you provide the width it will be padded with space:
The key point being "x"*4 gives you "xxxx"
