I wanted to implement settings as explained by "Two Scoops of Django". I referred their book and also their github sample code.I am getting the following error:The problem is solved when I add the following code to __init__.py in settings folder:Kindly explain what is happening as there is no code in __init__.py in all the examples on internet.I am using Django 1.8.2 on Python 3.4
When you include __init__.py in the folder, that folder is marked as a package called settings, from which you can import modules like your local moduleThis is a fairly standard thing in Python, even if not every Django programmer uses settings as a packageFrom Python docs:The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the  directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent  directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally  hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In  the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can  also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__  variable, described later.Source: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packagesmy question is do I need to write from .local import * in init.py  for the package to work?Check your manage.py file it should load the settings.local, e.g.Also check the actual value of SECRET_KEY in the local module see if it is empty or not (if e.g. you use some variable interpolation)
