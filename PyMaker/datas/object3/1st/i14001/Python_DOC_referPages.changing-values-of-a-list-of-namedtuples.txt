Named tuples are immutable, so you cannot manipulate them.Right way of doing it:If you want something mutable, you can use recordtype.PS: You may need to pip install recordtype if you don't have it installed.Bad way of doing it:You may also keep using namedtuple with using the _replace() method.
This looks like a task for Python's data analysis library, pandas. It's really, really easy to do this sort of thing:Now isn't that just much, much better than labouring with namedtuples?
In Python >= 3.7 you can use dataclass decorator with the new variable annotations feature to produce mutable record types:Output:
