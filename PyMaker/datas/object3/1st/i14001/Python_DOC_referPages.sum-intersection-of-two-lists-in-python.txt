I'm new to Python. If I have a 'data' variable like this:and I have a list like this:How can I return the sum of data[i][4] for i in data that contain both of those values and append it to the list.The final element in ls is the sum of those data[3][4] that contain ls[1] and ls[2]

Here is my approach: use the Counter from collections to keep track of the sum. We use the first two items in each sublist as a key, and the last item as the value:Since Counter behaves like a dictionary, and a dictionary does not take a list as key, we have to turn the list of the first two elements into a tuple (hence tuple(item[:2])).
