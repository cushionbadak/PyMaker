I have this code:Should I use os.walk() or os.path.walk(), and why? Or is there any other better method?
It depends on the Python version you use. In Python 2 there is os.path.walk() (docs) but it has been deprecated and replaced with os.walk() (docs) in Python 3.Python(x,y) you claim to be using in comments, seems to be based on Python 2.
The os.path.walk() function is deprecated and is no longer available in Python 3. For that reason you should prefer os.walk().os.walk() can also follow symbolic links to directories by setting the followlinks parameter to True. To do the same for os.path.walk() you must specifically check whether each directory is a sym link, and resolve it yourself. There are a couple of other possibly useful options for os.walk(), so overall, choose it over os.path.walk().
os.walk(dir) returns a tuple with you must unpack.It's quite simple really.For Python 3.6+ you can simplify this a bit:
