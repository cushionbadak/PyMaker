I asked a similar question but left out the database part:Implementation of the Linux find command in pythonThe problem with most of these answers is that subprocess methods do correctly implement find but only can search within my computer. I'm trying to search in an ftp database and have attempted the following types of things:intooramong other attempts, but nothing has worked so far. I am trying to search for a specific file or directory within directories and subdirectories in an ftp database and printing out the pathway. Is there a useful method that is not subprocess or is there a way to correctly adapt subprocess to accept the additional arguments (sitename, filename)?
try using a list for the command elementsRe-reading your question you'll want to use an ftp client to connect to the ftp server and look at the files there.See the Python 3 ftplib docs
I think you have a few problems you need to address:1) As you noted, find on linux execute local to the machine it's run on. 2) You trying to access a remote FTP file system (I presume).If you remote system is linux and you want to go through its file system using find, remotely you'll need to connect to that machine. SSH may be a good example. I just modified from one the answer on your original question.
