I want to specify a sequence of large integers (with many zeros) like:My intuition is to use scientific notation. But in python, it's a float instead of integer. Is there a easy way in python to write these integer literals without writing all the zeros, because making sure the number of zeros correct is a nightmare.I believe I can cast the floats back to integer using int, but just wonder if there is a better way?
Using * and **, it's not beautiful but gives you the right result.You can also generate a whole list like this:
For future viewers.Since python 3.6 PEP 515 would be included.So you can do a = 1_000_000_000_000 for better code's readability.
You could use comma separators for thousands, as a string, then convert to an int.
You can setup some suffixesor use the longer names (kilo, etc).
You could do something like this, which avoids float to int conversion issues and is fairly readable in my opinion:Output:
