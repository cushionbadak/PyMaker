I have a list of dictionaries. Each has a key, and a 3 value list.  Each value is an ADC reading, I have a function to take and spit out the converted value. I would like to take each value and convert it with this function, however.This prints the values as a list, but I want to take each value individually and pass it off to the function to be convertedThis prints out each dictionary I am not sure how to nest these loops all together to take the individual values and append the current list of dictionaries with the converted values or generate a separate list of dictionaries altogether.  Appending would be more efficient I suppose.
You can use map function to apply your function on all value items :And if you want to create a new dictionary you can do it within a dict comprehension :Also you may note that this depends on your function signature and your values for example if your function accept more than 1 argument you can not use map here.Example :In that case you can use a list comprehension :
