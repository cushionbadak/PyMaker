Here's a solution using QT convenient QFileInfo. It will work with a file name, or with a path.Or without QT:NB: With "filename.foo1.foo2", the first method will give you "filename.foo1" and the second method "filename"
Use os.path.splitextThis works even if you have more than one period in the filename, and also doesn't count the period at the beginning of the filename used to make hidden files.
