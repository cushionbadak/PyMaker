I met some problems when I'd like to check if the input regex if correct or not.I'd like to check is there one backslash before every symbol, but I don't know how to implement using Python.For example:number: 123456789. (return False)phone\:111111 (return True)I try to use (?!) and (?=) in Python, but it doesn't work.Update:I'd like to match the following string:\~, \!, \@, \$, \%, \^, \&, \*, \(, \), \{, \}, \[, \], \:, \;, \", \',  \>, \<, \?Thank you very much.
Does it work?
Reading between the lines a bit, it sounds like you are trying to pass a string to a regex and you want to make sure it has no special characters in it that are unescaped.Python's re module has an inbuilt re.escape() function for this.Example:
Check that the entire string is composed of single characters or pairs of backslash+symbol:Python regex reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
