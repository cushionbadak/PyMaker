I have a list of dictionary values, as given below:It is barely readable. I want to format it this way:My code for printing is given below:The error is:I cannot understand how to access each dictionary in the list value of each key. I searched a lot, but couldn't really find an answer. Can someone help?
dict.items returns a tuple of the key value pairs. Return a new view of the dictionaryâ€™s items ((key, value) pairs)You will have to do this instead. Also you can not concatenate an str object and a dict object using +. You will get a TypeError. So you will have to cast it to a str. Instead you can use format as in print("{} : {}".format(key,v))
