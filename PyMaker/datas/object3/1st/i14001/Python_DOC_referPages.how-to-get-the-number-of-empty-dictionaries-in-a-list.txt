I have a list that is in this format [['A', 'B'], {}, {}, {}]i'm trying to get the number of empty dictionaries in the list what is the most pythonic way of doing this properly, i've been able to do it but i find myself having to create a temporary list in the process is there a more efficient way of doing this without creating a temporary list?
As Luke commented, just count it
A generator expression is handy here, along with the built-in sum function:Also, you don't need to check len if you just want empty ones; since empty dictionaries evaluate as False in a boolean context, not x is sufficient.
