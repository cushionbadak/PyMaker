currently, I'm programming a GUI, which should allow the user to save a file and select the filetype (lets say: jpg, bmp). I'm using tkinter with Python 3.4.Unfortunately, I am unable figure out, which filetype the user has selected: I'm using the asksaveasfilename-dialog and all I can get is the path:I can try to extract the extension from the path, but that can leed to unexpected behaviour:if the user doesn't provide the extension in the filename but selects the filetype, "path" doesn't contain any extensionif the user first decides to use the filename "example.bmp" but afterwards selects jpg as filetype, the extension is not updatet (as it normally is in window). So "path" will still be: C:\ ... \example.bmp Is there a way to get the filetype, that the user selected?Is there any other way around?
As I struggle with the same problem of automatically updating the extension, I stumbled over your question. Apparently you can try that with addins:See:https://geonet.esri.com/blogs/thespatialextentpythonaddins.SaveDialog = saveFileDialogThis one is almost identical to OpenDialog except that instead of filtering files, we have the ability to automatically append a particular extension to the user's input. It's also possible to pass in a tupled list of filetype descriptions and extension which would then populate the Save As Filetype Dropdown, but again the only thing that is doing is filtering the files displayed. It's actually the FileExtension parameter that is appending the extension to the return value.Sry for the necro!
