This might seem a bit generic unfortunately, but I'm just so lost...The code seems to work, but it keeps giving me an indexing error.
I think you are unclear about some of these points :range(start=0,stop,step=1) function starts from a default value 0 and stop when the value is equal to stop i.e. the stop value is not included. For further information, see the docs.Lists in Python are indexed from 0 (like arrays in C).  So if you want to traverse a string with length n, you need to define your range as range(n).If you want a more compact code, a few changes might be:
You are indexing from 0 through to len(first_list), but the last index in first_list is len(first_list) - 1, because indexing starts at 0.Remove the +1 from your range:Rather than use range() you can use enumerate() to generate indices and access the value; use zip() to pair up the two lists:
