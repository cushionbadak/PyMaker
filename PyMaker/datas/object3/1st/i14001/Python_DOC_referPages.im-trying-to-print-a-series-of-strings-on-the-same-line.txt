Natural Text
I'm trying to print three strings next to each other like so:However, whenever I run my code no matter what I've tried it always prints them on different lines. How do I fix this? My code is as follows:Where array is the data passed into the function in the form of a list. Also forgot to mention im running 2.7
Try using print(thing, end = ''). That should work fineEither that or append them to one string
You habe 3 possibilities:create a big string which you print at the endprint(text, end=""), see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2456292/562769use the system module: sys.out.write, seeHow to print without newline or space?
print(t), should work unless t contains a newline. Use print repr(t), to find out. If you now see \n, then the array contains newline characters which you need to remove first.If the newlines are at the end of the string, you can remove them with t.strip(). If they are in the middle, use t.replace('\n', '')
