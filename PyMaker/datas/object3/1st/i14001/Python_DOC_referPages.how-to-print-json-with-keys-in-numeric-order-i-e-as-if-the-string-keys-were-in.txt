Natural Text
I have the following JSONThis is made like so:print(json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True, indent=4)) which is great because it prints the keys in alphanumeric order.  However, I need these printed in actual numeric order, so above the key "2" to come before the key "10".I know that python usually doesn't sort keys in a dictionary, but I need to do this as the json will actually be read by humans and ordering it would be great.  Thank you.
