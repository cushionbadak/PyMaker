But, we don't know how many lines will it reply with. My code is as follows right now. This gives me the desired output.So,I tried to write stuff up in a file by adding :But, unfortunately, it only writes the first link. How can I add other links too?
Make sure to write the link inside the for loop. Using a with command save you for manually closing the file as well.This should work:
Just open the file first then write as you iterate:Unless you want all links in the one line you need the \n at the end of the joined link. Your code would also write the last link not the first.Output:
The following code should allow you to write multiple lines to a file.
