I was reading this post and I had a question regarding __cmp__().My codeOutput== operator on strings returns a Boolean value.In this code the cmp() compares two strings (namely the titles) so the return value of the cmp() must be a Bool.   How come I am getting an integer ? (I am looking for an explanation with respect to the comparison of objects x > y)Even when an integer is obtained, how is its value decided ?How can I make the 1st and the 3rd object equal ?
How come I am getting an integer ? __cmp__ returns an int.  Your __cmp__ is returning a bool, which is a subclass of int, so Python interprets it as an int.Even when an integer is obtained, how is its value decided ?-1 means the first operand is less than the second0 means both operands are equal+1 means the first operand is greater than the secondHow can I make the 1st and the 3rd object equal?The problem with your code is your __cmp__ returns the result of ==, which returns a bool, which is a subclass of int, and True is 1, so instead of returning 0 your __cmp__ is returning True/1 -- which is wrong.The methods you should be using (as __cmp__ gets removed in later Pythons) are __eq__, __ne__, __le__, __lt__, __ge__, and __gt__.Using __eq__:Note that this is only comparing by title, and not considering the year (which may be fine, or may not be, depending on how you will be using your Book class).You can find out more about them here.
