Is there a way to generate passwords from an input string so that the results are always the same? Like an md5 hash but with special characters?
Why would you have special characters?Special characters are added to a password to increase its entropy, but a hash will never increase the entropy since it depends only on the input.For example. If you know that the input to your special_characters_password_generator() function is always a number in the range 0..255, then you will only have 8 bits of entropy in the output no matter what. Or in other words, you will always generate one of 256 passwords no matter what. One reason to do this is to have a human-readable but more compact representation.Maybe you want to represent the hash (which is just a sequence of bits, after all) using more characters than 0-9A-F, you could for example use the base64 module to encode the output of your hash function:An even better method of hashing (or "derivate keys", to be correct) passwords is pbkdf2_hmac found in newer versions of hashlib (also available as a backport in pip).
