i want to raise ConnectionError (a python 3 subclass) when my program fails to  connect to a local service. i'm using python2.7. testing this out though, it looks like i have to import a module to get this working:how can i raise this type of exception?
ConnectionError does not exist in Python 2, as you can see from the Python 2 documentation.  You can of course create your own subclass of OSError (and even call it ConnectionError if you want), but no such thing is built in.
