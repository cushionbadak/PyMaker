So I was thinking it would be awfully convenient to have a Python interpreter DLL, and to what I know, the interpreter is a DLL, but I don't know how to use it/if it can be used that way.I want to execute python files from Gamemaker Studio through a DLL, (Python 2.7, preferably.) and if I knew the functions of the DLL, I could make the proper GML scripts to do it.Any help is greatly appreciated.
It is called embedding the Python interpreter. Read the section on extending and embedding the Python interpreter of the Python documentation.You might consider some other interpreter, in particular Lua, which is free software, widely used in games, and rumored to be faster, or GUILE (also faster, and with a much more powerful and expressive language, Scheme; read also SICP)
