I can't figure out were I'm going wrong and help would be much appreciatedWhy does it say there is a syntax error on the last line. (This is not the complete code)Here's the whole code if it helps
Are you sure there is a colon in the code that gave you an error? The only way I can make a syntax error on that line is to remove the colon, or to replace the colon with a semicolon, like this:or this:which do give the error:This exact error happens to be the example error for the definition of 'Syntax Error' in the Python documentation(Python 3 or Python 2 docs).P.S. welcome to Stackoverflow! Next time you should post the error message you get too. And if you are a beginner, which is just fine, googling for your error message usually works great.
