Is it possible to use XPath Query in Python while processing XML. I am using minidom which doesn't support that. Is there any other module for that?
http://docs.python.org/library/xml.etree.elementtree.htmletree supports XPath queries, just like lxml.etree is included in the standard library, but lxml is faster.
My favorite XML processing library for Python is lxml which, because it is a wrapper around libxml2, also supports full XPath.There is also 4Suite which is more of a pure Python solution.
ElementTree is included.  Under 2.6 and below its xpath is pretty weak, but in 2.7 much improved:
