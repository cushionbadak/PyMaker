I have a list in Python, and I want to check if any elements are negative.  Specman has the has() method for lists which does:Where it is a Specman keyword mapped to each element of the list in turn.I find this rather elegant.  I looked through the Python documentation and couldn't find anything similar.  The best I could come up with was:I find this rather inelegant.  Is there a better way to do this in Python?
any():Also, if you're going to use "True in ...", make it a generator expression so it doesn't take O(n) memory:
Use any().
Python has a built in any() function for exactly this purpose.
