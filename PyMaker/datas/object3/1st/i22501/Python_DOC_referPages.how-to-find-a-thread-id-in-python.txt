I have a multi-threading Python program, and a utility function, writeLog(message), that writes out a timestamp followed by the message. Unfortunately, the resultant log file gives no indication of which thread is generating which message. I would like writeLog() to be able to add something to the message to identify which thread is calling it. Obviously I could just make the threads pass this information in, but that would be a lot more work. Is there some thread equivalent of os.getpid() that I could use?
threading.get_ident() works, or threading.current_thread().ident (or threading.currentThread().ident for Python < 2.6).
Using the logging module you can automatically add the current thread identifier in each log entry. Just use one of these LogRecord mapping keys in your logger format string:%(thread)d :     Thread ID (if available).%(threadName)s :  Thread name (if available).and set up your default handler with it:
The thread.get_ident() function returns a long integer on Linux. It's not really a thread id.I use this method to really get the thread id on Linux:
I saw examples of thread IDs like this:The threading module docs lists name attribute as well:
You can get the ident of the current running thread. The ident could be reused for other threads, if the current thread ends.When you crate an instance of Thread, a name is given implicit to the thread, which is the pattern: Thread-numberThe name has no meaning and the name don't have to be unique. The ident of all running threads is unique.The function threading.current_thread() returns the current running thread. This object holds the whole information of the thread.
I created multiple threads in Python, I printed the thread objects, and I printed the id using the ident variable. I see all the ids are same:
Similarly to @brucexin I needed to get OS-level thread identifier (which != thread.get_ident()) and use something like below not to depend on particular numbers and being amd64-only:andthis depends on Cython though.
