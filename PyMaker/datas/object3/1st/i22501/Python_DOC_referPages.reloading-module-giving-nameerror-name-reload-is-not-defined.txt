I'm trying to reload a module I have already imported in Python 3. I know that you only need to import once and executing the import command again won't do anything. Executing reload(foo) is giving this error:What does the error mean?
reload is a builtin in Python 2, but not in Python 3, so the error you're seeing is expected.If you truly must reload a module in Python 3, you should use either:importlib.reload for Python 3.4 and aboveimp.reload for Python 3.0 to 3.3 (deprecated since Python 3.4 in favour of importlib) 
For >= Python3.4:For <= Python3.3:For Python2.x:Use the in-built reload() function.

To expand on the previously written answers, if you want a single solution which will work across Python versions 2 and 3, you can use the following:
I recommend using the following snippet as it works in all python versions (requires six):
For python2 and python3 compatibility, you can use:
You deleted your __builtins__ variable. How to fix this? Don't delete __builtins__.Also can someone explain step by step what that error message means?It means python can't find the function "reload".reload (script4.py)This is incorrect. if you did "import script4", then you must do "reload(script4)"
