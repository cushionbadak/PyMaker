I want to trap values that are like this (in which there is not 'time info' on the datetime):Is there a better way to detect these values other than testing hour/minute/second?
The time method works here. Evaluates as boolean false if there's zero'd-out time info.
I see nothing wrong with your method, but you could compare it to a 'zeroed' time object.
For python 3.5 and above:For python lower than 3.5:Explanation: the boolean evaluation of a datetime.time instance was changed in python 3.5 : In boolean contexts, a time object is always considered to be true.Changed in version 3.5: Before Python 3.5, a time object was considered to be false if it represented midnight in UTC. This behavior was considered obscure and error-prone and has been removed in Python 3.5. See bpo-13936 for full details.
You would actually need to check microsecond as well. Another option:
