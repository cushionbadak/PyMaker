I keep getting this :How do I make this message go away? Is there a way to avoid warnings in Python?
From documentation of the warnings module:If you're on Windows: pass -W ignore::DeprecationWarning as an argument to Python. Better though to resolve the issue, by casting to int.(Note that in Python 3.2, deprecation warnings are ignored by default.)
I had these:Fixed it with:Now you still get all the other DeprecationWarnings, but not the ones caused by:
You should just fix your code but just in case,
I found the cleanest way to do this (especially on windows) is by adding the following to C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\sitecustomize.py:Note that I had to create this file.  Of course, change the path to python if yours is different.
None of these answers worked for me so I will post my way to solve this. I use the following at the beginning of my main.py script and it works fine.Use the following as it is (copy-paste it):
Pass the correct arguments? :POn the more serious note, you can pass the argument -Wi::DeprecationWarning on the command line to the interpreter to ignore the deprecation warnings.
Convert the argument to int. It's as simple as
When you want to ignore warnings only in functions you can do the following.Just add the @ignore_warnings decorator on the function you want to ignore all warnings
Not to beat you up about it but you are being warned that what you are doing will likely stop working when you next upgrade python. Convert to int and be done with it.BTW. You can also write your own warnings handler. Just assign a function that does nothing.How to redirect python warnings to a custom stream?
