I'm trying to get a list of all log files (.log) in directory, including all subdirectories.

You can also use the glob module along with os.walk.
Checkout Python Recursive Directory Walker. In short os.listdir() and os.walk() are your friends.
I have a solution:orThese two take the advantage of find . -type f -name *.log.The first one is simpler but not guaranteed for white-space when add -name *.log, but worked fine for simply find ../testdata -type f (in my OS X environment).The second one using subprocess seems more complicated, but this is the white-space safe one (again, in my OS X environment).This is inspired by Chris Bunch, in the answerhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/3503909/2834102
If You want to list in current directory, You can use something like:Just change theto other path to get results there.
