I've written a buffer class that provides a File-like interface with read, write, seek, tell, flush methods to a simple string in memory. Of course it is incomplete (e.g. I didn't write readline). It's purpose is to be filled by a background thread from some external data source, but let a user treat it like a file. I'd expect it to contain a relatively small amount of data (maybe 50K max)Is there a better way to do this instead of writing it from scratch?
You can use the standard Python modules StringIO or cStringIO to obtain an in-memory buffer which implements the file interface.cStringIO is implemented in C, and will be faster, so you should use that version if possible.If you're using Python 3 you should use the io.StringIO instead of StringIO and io.BytesIO instead of cStringIO.
I think you might be looking for StringIO.
