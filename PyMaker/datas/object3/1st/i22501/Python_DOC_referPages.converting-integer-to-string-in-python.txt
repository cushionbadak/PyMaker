I want to convert an integer to a string in Python. I am typecasting it in vain:When I try to convert it to string, it's showing an error like int doesn't have any attribute called str.
Links to the documentation:int() str()The problem seems to come from this line: d.str(). Conversion to a string is done with the builtin str() function, which basically calls the __str__() method of its parameter.
Try this:
There is not typecast and no type coercion in Python. You have to convert your variable in an explicit way.To convert an object in string you use the str() function. It works with any object that has a method  called __str__() defined. In factis equivalent toThe same if you want to convert something to int, float, etc.
To manage non-integer inputs:Ok, if I take your latest code and rewrite a bit to get it working with Python:It gives me something like:Which is the first characters of the string result pow(a,b).What are we trying to do here?

In Python => 3.6 you can use f formatting:
The most decent way in my opinion is ``.
Can use %s or .format(OR)
For someone who wants to convert int to string in specific digits, the below method is recommended.For more details, you can refer to Stack Overflow question Display number with leading zeros.
