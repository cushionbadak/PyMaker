What is the equivalent of the backticks found in Ruby and Perl in Python? That is, in Ruby I can do this:What does the equivalent statement look like in Python? I've tried os.system("cat /tmp/baz") but that puts the result to standard out and returns to me the error code of that operation.

The most flexible way is to use the subprocess module:capture_output was introduced in Python 3.7, for older versions the special function check_output() can be used instead:You can also manually construct a subprocess object if you need fine grained control:All these functions support keyword parameters to customize how exactly the subprocess is executed. You can for example use shell=True to execute the program through the shell, if you need things like file name expansions of *, but that comes with limitations.
sth is right. You can also use os.popen(), but where available (Python 2.4+) subprocess is generally preferable.However, unlike some languages that encourage it, it's generally considered bad form to spawn a subprocess where you can do the same job inside the language. It's slower, less reliable and platform-dependent. Your example would be better off as:eta:baz is a directory and I'm trying to get the contents of all the files in that directory? cat on a directory gets me an error.If you want a list of files:If you want the contents of all files in a directory, something like:or, if you can be sure there are no directories in there, you could fit it in a one-liner:

From Python 3.5 onward, the recommended way is to use subprocess.run.  To get the same behaviour as you describe, you would use:This will return a bytes object.  You might want to append .decode("ascii") or .decode("utf-8") to the end to get a str.
Easiest way is to use commands package.Output:'bganesan'

I'm using(6:0)$ python --version  Python 2.7.1One of the examples above is:For me, this failed to access the directory /tmp.  After looking at the doc string for subprocess I replaced [ "prog", "arg"]with "prog arg" and got the shell expansion behavior that was desired (a la Perl's `prog arg`)print subprocess.Popen("ls -ld /tmp/v*", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True).communicate()[0]I quit using python a while back because I was annoyed with the difficulty of of doing the equivalent of perl `cmd ...`.  I'm glad to find Python has made this reasonable.
If you use subprocess.Popen, remember to specify bufsize. The default is 0, which means "unbuffered", not "choose a reasonable default".
This will not work in python3, but in python2 you can extend str with a custom __repr__ method that calls your shell command and returns it like so:Which you can use like
