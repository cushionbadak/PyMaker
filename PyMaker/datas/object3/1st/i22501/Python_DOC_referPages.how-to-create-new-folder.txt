You can create a folder with os.makedirs()and use os.path.exists() to see if it already exists:If you're trying to make an installer: Windows Installer does a lot of work for you.
You probably want os.makedirs as it will create intermediate directories as well, if needed.
Have you tried os.mkdir?You might also try this little code snippet:makedirs creates multiple levels of directories, if needed.
