As we know, Python has boolean values for objects: If a class has a __len__ method, every instance of it for which __len__() happens to return 0 will be evaluated as a boolean False (for example, the empty list).In fact, every iterable, empty custom object is evaluated as False if it appears in boolean expression.Now suppose I have a class foo with attribute bar. How can I define its truth value, so that, say, it will be evaluated to True if bar % 2 == 0 and False otherwise?For example:so, a(myfoo) should print "eggs".
Refer to the Python docs for __nonzero__.
In Python < 3.0 :You have to use __nonzero__ to achieve what you want. It's a method that is called automatically by Python when evaluating an object in a boolean context. It must return a boolean that will be used as the value to evaluate.E.G :In Python => 3.0 :Same thing, except the method has been renamed to the much more obvious __bool__.
