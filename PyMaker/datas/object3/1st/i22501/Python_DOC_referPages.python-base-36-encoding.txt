How can I encode an integer with base 36 in Python and then decode it again?
Have you tried Wikipedia's sample code?
I wish I had read this before. Here is the answer:
Here is information about numpy.base_repr.
terrible answer, but was just playing around with this an thought i'd share.
You can use numpy's base_repr(...) for this.Here is some information about numpy, int(x, base=10), and np.base_repr(number, base=2, padding=0).(This answer was originally submitted as an edit to @christopher-beland's answer, but was rejected in favor of its own answer.)
You could use https://github.com/tonyseek/python-base36.and then
This works if you only care about positive integers.To convert back to int, just use int(num, 36). For a conversion of arbitrary bases see https://gist.github.com/mbarkhau/1b918cb3b4a2bdaf841c
