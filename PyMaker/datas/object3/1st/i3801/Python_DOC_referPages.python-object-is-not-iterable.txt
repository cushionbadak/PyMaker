When I run this code of a spambot it gives me the error that the  "'StringVar' object is not iterable", I am new to python and I don't really know exactly what that means, if you can help me with an working code of this please post it.I don't exactly know that the other part of the code is fully working but I made a console one and it s perfectly working.
StringVar is a wrapper for a string, not the string itself. To access the string it contains, try for char in var.get(): instead of for char in var:. Strings are iterable in Python, so that will work.That something is "iterable" in Python means that it has a method called __iter__ that, when called, returns an iterator that can in turn be called to loop through the elements it contains, one by one. A for loop implicitly calls an object's __iter__ method to access its iterator. Read https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators for a more detailed explanation.
