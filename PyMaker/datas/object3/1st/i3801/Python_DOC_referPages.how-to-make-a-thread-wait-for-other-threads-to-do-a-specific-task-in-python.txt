i have multiple threads doing the same job : to calculate a distance and put it in a list than each thread needs to compare it to the other threads and do a certain task.how do i make a thread wait for the others to finish the task ( and having others task to follow up joins won't work in this case) 
There's a name for what you want, it's called a Barrier.  I don't know enough about the Python ecosystem to know whether there's a ready-made one that you can just use, but here's what it is:It's an object that contains a count (initially greater than zero), and a condition variable.  It has a method, await().The await() method decrements the count, and then;It signals the condition variable and returns if the count became zero, orIt waits on the condition variable until the count equals zero, and then it returns.If you initialize a Barrier with count = N, and then N threads await() it, none of the threads will "get past the barrier" (i.e., return from await()) until all of the threads have "arrived at the barrier" (i.e., called await()).Barrier often is implemented as CyclicBarrier, which is the same thing with the additional feature that it automatically resets the count to its original value when the barrier opens.Update:  There is a threading.Barrier class in the standard library for Python3 (v. 3.2 and later).https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#barrier-objects
