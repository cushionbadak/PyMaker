I'm unable to understand the logic behind python returning False for the following condition:while returning True for:
Although the comment by @jonrsharpe is the right answer, it wasn't trivial to me, and maybe also to you, so I'll break it down:The expression is evaluated like this:3 > 5 in range(10) 3 > 5 and 5 in range(10)False and 5 in range(10) == False (False and ... short circuits to False)The reason for 1 -> 2 is explained in the documentation. To sum it up, it's like x < y < z means x < y and y < z.Trying something like (3 > 5) in range(10) would be evaluated like this:(3 > 5) in range(10) False in range(10) 0 in range(10) True The reason for 3 -> 4 is that 0 resides inside the range(0,10) and the expression 0 in range(10) is evaluated to a Boolean result (i.e. True or False) depends on whether the left side (0) is indeed in the right side (range(0,10))
