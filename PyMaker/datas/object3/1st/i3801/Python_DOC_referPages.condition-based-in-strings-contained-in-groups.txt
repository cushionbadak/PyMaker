You can use groupby + transform to create a flag for the groups that satisfy that condition. And then you can mask the original df by that flag. If you don't want to modify the original df you can create a separate Series named flag, otherwise you can also just assign it to a column in your original dfThen you can filter the df
create an array of dates as the intersection of dates that contain John & dates that contain Susan:then use the dates array to filter the dataframeTimings:Comparing the solutions provided by jpp, ALollz and mine above:The numpy based solution is several times more efficient than the others.However, the solution proposed by ALollz can be sped up 2X by omitting some extra unneeded operations and going down to numpy arrays for comparison.
Create a series mapping each date to a set of names. Then use set.issuperset via syntactic sugar >=:
