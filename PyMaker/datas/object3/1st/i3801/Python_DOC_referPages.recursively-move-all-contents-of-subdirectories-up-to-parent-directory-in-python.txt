The title pretty much explains what I am after.  However, I would like to note that the sub directories won't contain any directories only .JPG files. Essentially, just moving everything up one level in the file tree.For example, ~/someDir/folder1 , ~/someDir/folder2 , ... , ~/someDir/folderN and I want all of the contents of the sub directories brought up to ~/someDir/
shutil.move is a good option to move files.For Recursive move, you can try shutil.copytree(SOURCE, DESTINATION). it just copies all files and if needed you can manually cleanup the source directory.
Use the shutil module.Official documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#module-shutil
