I have in my server two Python versions: the Python default, already present in Ubuntu Server 16.04 and Anaconda Python.When I run the Flask application with Apache, because this is running in user www-data, the application runs in Python default, but I have to run in Anaconda installation.How to configure to use the Anaconda Python version and how to install new modules in this version?The path of Anaconda installed is /home/wandre/anaconda2
This is one way that worked for me to let Apache run the python module in Anaconda environment so that Flask app can run. First is installation. Install Apache with the command sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-bin apache2-dev. Then, install Anaconda under the directory /opt as sudo. After having Anaconda installed on /opt/anaconda2, install conda packages as below:Now you need to update the Apache configurations. This involves updating three files:wsgi.loadOpen the file /etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.load and add the following (this is the output from mod_wsgi-express install-module so yours could be different)If the LoadModule wsgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so was originally included in this file, comment it out. Otherwise (at least from what I checked), the apache server will run the default python instead of the one in Anaconda. Next, enable the wsgi mod:wsgi.confOpen the file /etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.conf and add the following000-default.conf (your filename may be different)Open the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and add the followingYou are all set.Please note that I was not able to find tutorial for setting 'Anaconda + Flask + Apache' so I referred to a post on 'Anaconda + Django + Apache'.
