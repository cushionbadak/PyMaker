This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                Having trouble understanding why this is returning a str although I entered an int.  Could someone please explain this? When you enter a value in input does it only capture the value as a string?
In Python 3.x, input returns the entered value as is (str) instead of evaluating it, so you should do int(input('Please input number:')) to get the value as an int.In Python 2.x, however, raw_input would return the raw str value, while input would evaluate the entered value, as you can read on the docs:input([prompt])Equivalent to eval(raw_input(prompt))....Consider using the raw_input() function for general input from users.You can mimic this behavior in Python 3.x with eval: eval(input('Please input number:')) if you really need to, but first take a look at Security of Python's eval() on untrusted strings?
