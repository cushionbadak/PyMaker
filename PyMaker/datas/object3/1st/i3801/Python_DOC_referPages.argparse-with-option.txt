I have been using argparse to parse command line options and worked great. Now I would like to use + instead of - for some options.Ex: script.py +opt -f <filename>Is it possible to use such + options with argparse?
You can set the prefix_chars option to something other than '-':at which point you can start using either - or + in the definition of arguments:The above defines +opt; you have to use the right prefix to invoke it, -opt won't work.
