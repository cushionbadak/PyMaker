Updated question & code:I have a PDF - Excel comparison programme which reads in approx 4 tables, then reads in an excel page and compares the elements within it.I would like this output (in Ipython console using spyder) to save to a file.I'm quite happy for this to print to a .txt fileThe file has the comparison messages however the 'now comparing page..' 'now comparing part..' messages aren't being printed. (yesterday all the 'now comparing' messages were printed prior to the data matching messages but for some reason that's not happening anymore...) I would like it to be of the format:Now comparing page..Now comparing part..All data matches...All data matches...Now comparing part.. etc.This is PART of a function which is in a different file which I call in my programmeThis is part of the code from my programme
Accumulate all of the comparison result strings in a list then return the list when the function ends and write the results to a file all at once.with open(filepath, 'a') as f: will open the file for appending which means each time the function is called, it will append to a file if it already exists.  Adding a filepath parameter to your function gives you a bit more control.
