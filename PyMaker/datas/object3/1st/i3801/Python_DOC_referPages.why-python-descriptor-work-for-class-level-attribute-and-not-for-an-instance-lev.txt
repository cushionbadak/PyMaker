Why Python Descriptor Work for Class Level Attribute and not for an Instance Level Attribute.Output:looks like the descriptor is not used for the instance_att. I found this identical question, but it doesn't really answer the question All answers refer the second question in the post.   The Python documentation specifys:Instance Binding If binding to an object instance, a.x is transformedinto the call: type(a).__dict__['x'].__get__(a, type(a)).But:The first part of the (my code equivalent) statement type(t).__dict__["instance_att"], raises an KeyError as type(t).__dict__ does not have such an attribute. It is an instance level att. Isn't it?What am I missing?
The quick answer: t.instance_att is handled by object.__getattribute__, and its definition simply ignores the value's __get__ and __set__ methods when it is found in the instance dictionary of t.The longer answer starts with explaining how attribute lookups are handled. They aren't built into the language, but rather handled by the __getattribute__ method of some class. Being rarely overridden, this almost always means object.__getattribute__, which is implemented in C by _PyObject_GenericGetAttrWithDict.Rather than explain that algorithm in detail here, I refer you to https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2015/02/09/understanding-python-metaclasses/, which has fantastic diagrams to explain both object-attribute lookup and class-attribute lookup.There is at least one answer here at Stack Overflow with includes the diagram, but I cannot locate it at the moment, so I apologize for the off-site reference. I'll include a link (or possibly close this as a duplicate) if I can find it.
