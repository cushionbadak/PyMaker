So, 4! is 4*3*2*1 = 24.My output is only 16 and it wants me to output 24
A few things are wrong with your program.It overwrites the input by using N as your loop variable.The loop's range does not depend on the input.The multiplied value is always 4 instead of being incremented from 1 to N in your loop.Here is the correct way to implement the factorial:Or alternatively, use the math standard library.
This finds factorial of number inputted from command line:
I recommend use math lib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html (cf math.factorial(x))
You inquire N from sys.argv and then overwrite it within your loop. That's one problem.Next: range(a,b) will create integers from a to b-1 (assuming stepsize is 1). So range(1,4) will create [1,2,3].Your code does the following:It changes N to 1*4, then to 2*4, then to 3*4 (which is 12, not 16).If you want to code a factorial the hard way, you need a seperated iterator (usually indicated as i) and multiply all the way up to N times.
