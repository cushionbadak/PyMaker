have this problem that when i try connecting to an API it keeps sending me wrong signature and I realised that it is because when I read from the file, python 3 has these square brackets on it. When I hard code the API key and secret inside the program it works.I realised the problem might be because of the square brackets cause when I used REPR i see the square brackets being printed. Is there a way to remove it?['Your API Key']['Your API Secret']'Your API Key''Your API Secret'
You are creating the "single element lists" you see yourself, by using splitlines() on the result of readline(). What you probably ment to do, was removing the newline at the end. Thats what rstrip(chars) is for.splitline(..) returns a list of split lines (doh). Just don't do that:Also, use the using ... approach with open(..) - its more robust if encountering errors and autocloses your filehandle for you.
