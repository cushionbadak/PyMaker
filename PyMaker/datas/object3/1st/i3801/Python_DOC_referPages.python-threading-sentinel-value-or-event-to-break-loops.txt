I can think of two ways to break out of a loop in a Python thread, minimal examples below:1 - Use a sentinel value2 - Use an EventIn the Python documentation, it discusses events but not the simpler 'sentinel value' approach (which I see used in many threading answers on Stack Overflow). Is there any disadvantage to using the sentinel value? Specifically, could it cause errors (I have never had one but I imagine if you tried to change the value of the sentinel at exactly the same moment it was being read for the while loop then something could break (or maybe the CPython GIL would save me in this case). What is considered best (safest) practice?
If you look at the source of Event, you can see that the function you are using don't have any more value for you:So in your case Event is just a fancy wrapper for a sentinel value with no actually use, that will also slow down your operation time by a really tiny amount.Events are only useful if you use their wait method.
