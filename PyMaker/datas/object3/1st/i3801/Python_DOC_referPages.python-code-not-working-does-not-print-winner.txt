I was wondering why my code keeps printing 'tan', I can't seem to get it to print the actual winner.I tried winner_color[0].
I think I may have found the error in this code.I found out that with your code the last string value in the list turtle_color always wins.This is because of this part of your code:So, the correct code (in full) is:Tell me if there are still any errors (etc)!
It is possible the winner is in fact 'tan' at the end of every race.The cause of this can be that random.seed is not called yet.  Therefore, the code will initialize with the same seed every time it is run, causing the same sequence of random numbers generated every time having the same winner as result. You can increase randomization by for instance initializing the seed before every call, or only at the top of your code.Adding this line:anywhere in your code should randomize the outcomes.On the note of reading out the winner_color: I'm assumingis now a string containing the color 'tan'. In this case, the index [0] will work on a string, and not a list.

This will increase the chances of your question being answered and studied.Welcome to stackoverflow, I hoped this helps you get your code to work!
