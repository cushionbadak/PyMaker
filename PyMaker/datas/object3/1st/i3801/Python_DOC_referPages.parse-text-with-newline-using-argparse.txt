Natural Text
In Python, using argparse, is there any way to parse text containing a newline character given as a parameter?I have this script:which prints as expected:but if I give the argument at the command-line (after changing to args = parser.parse_args() in the script above) it's not doing the same. For example:Any ideas on this?
Your \n is taken as \ followed by n and not interpreted as it should. Use a command like echo or printf to correctly interpret it. This should work on almost any shell (sh, bash, zsh, etc).There are plenty of alternatives.
If you want escape sequences to be processed in a shell string, surround it with $''Note that this is a bash extension, it may not be supported by all other shells.
