How can I send a file from one pc to another ip address to a specific path in it using python? I don't need full client-server, I just need to send the file. 
File transfer, at least if it's not the store-on-floppy-and-carry-to-other-computer kind, by definition requires a listening component (/process) on the receiving computer and a sending process on the transmitting computer.  That is client-server by definition.  So your saying "I don't need full client-server" most of all suggests that you have hardly any clue of what you're asking for.You're clearly asking "how can I get this simple job done in two or at most three simple commands" and that's just not how it works.
I always use ssh to send files to other computers. It is possible to use ssh from python. How to do that is explained in this question: SSH Connection with Python 3.0
