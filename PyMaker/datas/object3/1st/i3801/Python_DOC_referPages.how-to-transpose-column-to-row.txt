I have the data in a file:Sample:I want to transpose column to row:Is there any function in python which can do this? I have done it in sql using xml path but I don't know best way to do in python.
Here's a solution using just the csv module from the standard library.For convenience we use csv.DictReader to read in and use headers via the OrderedDict objects which are returned`.Note I have changed your data in a minor way: VeryPoor is the category rather than Very Poor - you may need to specify specific treatment for non-standard whitespace in headers.
