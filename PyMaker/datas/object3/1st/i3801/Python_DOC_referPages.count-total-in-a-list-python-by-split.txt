I like to know how to use split function to count a total from list.For example,Output should be like thisI have worked 14 days.
That's not a list. You are using a dictionary with key and value. Get the value, split on comma and find length using len.Also, you could count the number of commas and add 1 to it to get the same result like so:
Hint: You can access a value in a dictionary by its key:Second hint: You can split a string using str.split(delimiter) like so:Third hint: len()
Use str.split with lenEx:Output:
I'll do something like this:measure the lenght of a list containing each day
