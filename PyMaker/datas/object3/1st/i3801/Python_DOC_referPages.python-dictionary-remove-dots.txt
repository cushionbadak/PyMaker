i have multiple CSVs which i need to import into MangoDB. These csv's have a dot in the header which is failing when i insert them into MangoDB. apparently they dont allow dots in the keys. How can i remove the dots? i cannot modify the CSV as the csv's are loaded at runtime
You are converting your data to a dictionary here:Thus, you can just apply a dictionary comprehension (I am assuming operating on the dictionary keys here, as per your question.) You can just use a regex to replace individual items. For example (note that this assumes Py 3):However, the overall approach of just replacing dots seems dangerous as it can lead to duplicate keys / dropped keys; you might reconsider it based on your data.
