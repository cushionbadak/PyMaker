This question already has an answer here:Best way to strip punctuation from a string in Python                    24 answers                Made a function to count 20 most common words in a book that I downloaded as a plain text format. The python textbook I am going off of said to use the import string and then the replace or the translate method to remove any punctuation, but when I print out the lines after the replace step, all the lines still have punctuation in it. I tried moving around the line = line.strip() and the line = line.replace(string.punctuation,'') step, but that did not work. I have never used replace so I may be using it wrong for all I know. Rest of my program works, just that step is frustrating me.
