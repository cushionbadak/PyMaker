I'm using Python's concurrent.futures framework. I have used the map() function to launch concurrent tasks as such:I am interested only in the first n results and want to stop the executor after the first n threads are finished where n is a number less than the size of the input list. Is there any way to do this in Python? Is there another framework I should look into?
You can't use map() for this because it provides no way to stop waiting for the results, nor any way to get the submitted futures and cancel them.  However, you can do it using submit():The above code takes about 11 seconds to run--it executes jobs [1,2,3,6,7] but not the rest.
