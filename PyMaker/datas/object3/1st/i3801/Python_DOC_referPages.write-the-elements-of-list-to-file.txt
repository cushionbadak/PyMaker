Bigram is a list which looks like-Now I am trying to wrote each element if the list as a separate line in a file with this code-but I am getting this error :TypeError: write() argument must be str, not generatorI want the result as in file-
you're passing a generator comprehension to write, which needs strings.If I understand correctly you want to write one representation of tuple per line.You can achieve that with:orthe second version passes a generator comprehension to writelines, which avoids to create the big string in memory before writing to it (and looks more like your attempt)it produces a file with this content:
Try this:
This is the operator precedence problem.You want an expression like this:Instead, you get it interpreted like this, where the part in the parens is indeed a generator:Use the explicit parentheses.Please note that ("%s" % ''.join(ele)) for ele in bigram is itself a generator. You need to call write on each element from it.If you want to write each pair in a separate line, you have to add line separators explicitly. The easiest, to my mind, is an explicit loop:
