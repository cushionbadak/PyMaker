I want to calculate the length of (any number of) line segments using Python. I used the following code, but I encounter that tuples can not have subtraction as operands. How can I overcome that? I would like to know if I missed any important Python concept.
As already mentioned, it has to be Point(*p) intead of Point(*args). The latter would pass all the point-tuples to the constructor of each point. You also have to fix distance, though.However, instead of creating your own Point class, an "important Python concept" that you can use instead are built-in complex numbers, making distance much simpler:
Python doesn't support exponentiation (and other math operations) for tuples. While it's possible to have code like this:it's not a vector computations on the entire tuple. It's just a syntactic sugar for tuples concatenation.Also it seems that the snippet has a few typos/bugs. The line self.args=[Point(*args) for p in args] should be rather self.args=[Point(*p) for p in args]Class LineString doesn't have move() method.And the distance() calculation should be slightly changed (notice that I replaced - with + in the formula):
