I'm writing data from dataframe to json file using pandas function .to_json like this:The output of this looks like this:How is it possible to get rid of columns in the output if there are null values?:
The best way is to check every element in the dict and remove the keys which have the null value. It would look something like this.With json_dict[key] you get the value of the key and with the pop() function you delete the element from the dictionary. The pop() function also returns the value of the key that is going to be deleted.
You can iterate your dataframe to remove null columns and create a list of dictionaries.Then use the json module to write the list to a file.
singledispatch is your friend, you can use this to handle null/None cases in different data types with one function (you can do this on a dataframe, dict, file, or json string).
