This might be frivolous, but what's the symbol % as an abstract concept name?   For example, \ is called "escape symbol" in addition to "backslash", while % is just called "percent symbol",Is it named "formatted symbol"?
Analagously to \ serving the function of an "escape character" % can be one of:Remainder or Modulo operator. It is implemented through the __mod__ special function (and can be invoked by the mod operator). From the docs:The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second...Interpolation operator or formatting operator. This is a special implementation of the modulo operator for strings and string-like objects. The operation it performs has nothing to do with integer division, but aside from that, it's just a regular binary operator. From the docs:String objects have one unique built-in operation: the % operator (modulo). This is also known as the string formatting or interpolation operator.and:Bytes objects (bytes/bytearray) have one unique built-in operation: the % operator (modulo). This is also known as the bytes formatting or interpolation operator.
