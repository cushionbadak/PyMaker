I use to write this statement for output items.Is there a way to merge both print and loops. Something like:Correct me if I am wrong!
You can use the argument unpacking operator * (also called the "splat" operator):You need to set sep='\n' too because print defaults to separating arguments with spaces.Just for completeness, when you do:It will create a generator over the items in items and then print that:If you want to use this in Python 2.x, you will need to import print_function from the __future__ module first:
You can use list comprehension:And. . . you only need to add two characters to your code!There is a good discussion about list comprehension versus generator expressions here:Generator Expressions vs. List ComprehensionI think either is valid.  A genexp may be more efficient in this case, but the listcomp more clearly documents what you are doing.
