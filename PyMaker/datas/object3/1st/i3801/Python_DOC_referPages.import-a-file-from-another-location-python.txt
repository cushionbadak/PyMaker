Python's import is going to look for the modules (.py files) in the python path. You can see what is in python path in the sys.path variable.By default, sys.path will include directory where the script you ran is located. It will also include everything defined in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.So, if you have two directories with .py files, you can either put both in python path, or you can make sure everything all of your source is under the same path entry.Option 1(this syntax depends on your shell, here it is for windows)Then, you can simply import b.Option 2Create an empty __init__.py in both directories and a run.py in the directory above them, so you have:Make run.py your entry point (run python run.py) and then you can import any of the modules from any other module using their full module names:
If the files are in the same directory type this
