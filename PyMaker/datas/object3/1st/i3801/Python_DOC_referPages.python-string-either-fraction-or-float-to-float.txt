I have a problem where I want to take a string which could say either a fraction like '1/6' or a float '2.0', and have them both evaluate to a final float value. What I don't know how to do is deal with the potential for either case to come up or how process them so I get the float output of the fraction.Input:Output:
I'm new to python so this may not be the most elegant solution, but maybe something like:
The fractions.Fraction constructor already knows how to parse both float-like strings and fraction-like strings, and produce a Fraction result. For example:Since Fraction can be converted to float, you can use this to unconditionally produce a float result:I took the liberty of dramatically simplifying your code; f.readlines() would already return a list, so it's pointless to iterate it again to populate numberArray, and since you only seem to populate numberArray to iterate it once anyway, it's simpler to just iterate the file directly rather than making two pointless temporaries. If you really need the list, you just do:to load the list once and store it directly, rather than copying element by element.
