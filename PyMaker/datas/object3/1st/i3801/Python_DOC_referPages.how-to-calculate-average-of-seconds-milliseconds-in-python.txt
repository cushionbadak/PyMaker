My data is in the format of HH:MM:SS.milliseconds. How can I calculate average of such data in Python? I need average in form of miliseconds. I looked at several other similar postings but they do not answer my question.
I don't know you data size or if you require a built-in solution or not.However, one simple solution involves using pandas. If you haveYou can use pd.to_timedelta and mean and just doMight be/might not be overkill, but its really readable and straightforward.
The first step is to parse all those timestamps into something that you can perform arithmetic on. This can be timedelta objects, or integer microseconds (or milliseconds, since your times all have 0 micros), or float seconds, or any other reasonable type.For example, assuming that input is one big string:If it's a list of strings, or a file object, etc. just change it to iterate that and do re.search on each one, instead of iterating re.findall.Then we can average them the same as any other values:Since I used timedelta values, that's what the result will be:… or, if you print it:… or, if you want it as, say, a number of seconds, just call its total_seconds() method:
It looks like the input consists of strings. Those should be converted to datetime.datetime objects. Use datetime.datetime.strptime to do that.After that, the average of anything is calculated as sum(values) / len(values), but unfortunately you cannot sum dates. What you can is sum date differences, so you'll have to make some conversionsFor example:
I'm assuming that each of these is a string, you can do the following using no libraries in both python 2 and 3
Here's one approach using datetime.timedelta. The tricky part is converting strings into timedelta objects. Sequence unpacking makes this easier and efficient to implement.Note that sum only appears to work with timedelta objects with the added timedelta(0) argument, this trick courtesy of @JochenRitzel.
