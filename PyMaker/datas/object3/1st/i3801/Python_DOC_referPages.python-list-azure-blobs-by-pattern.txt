With the Python Azure API I would like to query blobs by a pattern.For example, get all report pdf's (with the Unix style path name pattern expansion):
Unfortunately you can't do that. From the server side filtering perspective, only thing you could do is filter blobs by prefix i.e. filter blobs where name starts with a particular value (e.g reports/). All other kind of filtering needs to be done on the client side itself.
