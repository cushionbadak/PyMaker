Not asking to be spoonfed, more in what 'direction' I should be looking in order to learn this.So I have this file/database and I want users to type a name from the "Name" section. then the files searches for that name and gives the email/IP as output.The format is:NAME:UUID:EMAIL:IPI want the name which the user asked to search only get 'searched' from the "NAME" part. and the output has to be "EMAIL" or "IP"Could someone help me out and point me in a direction where to make this? I've tried searching but I can't seem to find anything.
This is how I would approach it:1) Scan for the separator on your NAME:UUID:EMAIL:IP2) For every value in your database, retrieve each field based on the separator.3) Check if it matches the user's input.4) Based on the matching name, spit the output for other fields.Check out Split function documentation
