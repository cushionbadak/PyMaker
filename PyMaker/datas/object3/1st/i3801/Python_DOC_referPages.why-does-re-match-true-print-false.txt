it is printing False but the string given is fullfilling all the conditions of the regular expression.
Neither a match object nor None, the two types of objects that re.match() can return, is ever equal to True:Don't use == True. If you need to see if the match succeeded, test for is not None:You should almost never use == True or == False. In a boolean context like an if statement, just drop == True; it is the job of the statement to test for the boolean truth. For == False, put not in front instead. Moreover, as seen above, most objects are not equal to True or False; to test for the truth value, just pass in the object itself, or convert the truth value too a boolean using the bool() function.
