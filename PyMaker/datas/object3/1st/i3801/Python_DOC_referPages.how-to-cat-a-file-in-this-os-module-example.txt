I need to cat a file inside the OS module of python.What I'm trying to do is what I have accomplished in Perl. Please note the cat /tmp/illinois.txtI would like to do the same thing in python.
You can use the subprocess module to run commands from your script: The run() function also takes parameters like shell=True if you want to keep the environment variables or stdout=subprocess.PIPE if you want to retreive the output of the command. Honestly, just take a look at the docs ;)EDIT: as Alan mentionned, the shell=True option is often considered not desirable, as you cannot be sure which shell is used by the system. More details here.
