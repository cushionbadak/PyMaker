In my program I'm finding n-grams and printing out how many there are within a dataset.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram For those who don't know what an n-gram is.Here's my code:Here's an example output of my program with a dataset:And here is what I should be getting (ignore formatting differences):It seems the problem is when I am finding the max of my items in my defaultdict, I am only getting one of the 3 3-grams for example, but I want to get all 3 3-grams. Any ideas? Thank you in advance
Yup that is the reason. From https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#maxIf multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one encountered. This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving tools such as sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc, reverse=True)[0] and heapq.nlargest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc).Just find the maximum as you're doing and then use the max value i.e. result[1], and get the complete list of most common n grams, with a list comprehension.
