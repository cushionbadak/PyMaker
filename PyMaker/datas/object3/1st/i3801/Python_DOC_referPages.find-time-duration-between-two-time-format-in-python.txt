You can do a program such as this: The time difference is two hours just, similar to what you're asking for. A timedelta object in python 2.7 or higher has a total seconds method. So after subtracting the two times you are left with a timedelta object. You can perform the total_seconds() method on it, and then divide by 60 obviously to get minutes. You can then print that result, and you will find the total minutes between two times:

For date time variables, you should use pendulum. Install pendulum and import it. Then your code goes likeOutput:
If you wonder how to transform a string like "08:00:00" to a datetime object, see Suhas Bachhav post abovefor more information on timedelta objects see the official documentation
