Try addingat the beginning of your code. This will initialize the random number generator with current system time, ensuring a different image every time the code is run.The initial seed determines the sequence of random numbers your randint calls will receive. Same initial seed, and same sequence of random number requests will yield the same 'random picture'.For more detail, see random.seed.
