I am comparing numbers from 2 dictionaries (total comparisons ~ 1M). Here is a code snippet:I am finding percentage difference and writing the difference when more than 3% in dict3. After execution of script, I found some of the numbers in dict3 are What is effective/efficient way I can get rid of the numerical roundoff and ignore the comparison when numbers are these small?(Using python 2.7 with numpy)
numpy.isclose is close (pun intended) to what you want. I evaluatesthe formula:absolute(a - b) <= (atol + rtol * absolute(b))So you could use that to filter your data, with atol the smallest absolute difference you want to still consider and rtol set at 3%.
