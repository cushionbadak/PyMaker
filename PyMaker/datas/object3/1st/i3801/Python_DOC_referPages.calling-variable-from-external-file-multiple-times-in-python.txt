I'm trying to call variable from external file. And for that I wrote this code,But when I run my code it only calls varible A once and prints the same result. See the output of code,How can I call variable A from file rand_gen.py with updated value, every time it goes into loop? Please help.
This is not how import works in python. Once imported, module in cached in sys.modules as key, value pair of module name and module object. When you try to import the same module again, you simply get the already cached value back. But sys.modules is writable and deleting the key will, cause python to check for module and load again.Though Olivier's answer is the right way to approach this, for your understanding of import, you can try this:OutputWould recommend to read official Python docs on The import system and The module cache, for thorough understanding.
If you assign a random value to a variable, referencing that variable does not make the value change regardless of how the value was obtained.In the same way, when you imported your module, the module code was execute and a value was assigned to A. Unless the module is reloaded with importlib.reload or you call np.random.randint again, there is no reason for A to change value.What you might want is to make A a function that returns a random value in the desired range.
