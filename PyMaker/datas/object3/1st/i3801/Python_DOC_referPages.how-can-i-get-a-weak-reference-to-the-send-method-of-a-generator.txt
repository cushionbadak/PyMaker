The weakref documentation doesn't seem to provide a method for creating a weak reference to the send method of a generator:I didn't think it would work but I did try the weakref.WeakMethod just in case as well:How can this be done without wrapping the generator in a custom class? Like this:I don't want to do this. Is there a better way?The reason I want to do this is I am working on an idea for a simple messaging protocol for an app I might build. The messaging looks something like this:...used like this:a hears messages on channels 1 and 2, b hears messages on channels 1 and 3.
From the docs:Not all objects can be weakly referenced; those objects which can  include class instances, functions written in Python (but not in C),  instance methods, sets, frozensets, some file objects, generators,  type objects, sockets, arrays, deques, regular expression pattern  objects, and code objects.Since generators are a builtin type written in C, you cannot create a weak reference to a generator's send method. The workaround, as you've already discovered, is to wrap the generator in a python class.
