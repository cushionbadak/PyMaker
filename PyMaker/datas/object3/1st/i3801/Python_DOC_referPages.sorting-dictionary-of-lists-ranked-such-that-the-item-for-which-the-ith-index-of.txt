Working in python 3 i've got the following problem:My dictionary consists of units (keys) and lists of activity (values), I have to sort it such that is is ranked by peak activity. Meaning that I want to find per index i, the dict item for which this ith value is the highest value in the list of values.I fear it might be the case that there is not per se an optimal solution in which case i'm happy with an arbitrary choice of solution.
For each list, find the index of the maximum elementGroup the lists by that indexPick an arbitrary element from each group and put it into the result at the correct indexUse the remaining elements to fill the empty slots in the resultUseful functions and classes I used:collections.defaultdict for groupingcollections.OrderedDict to store the resultoperator.itemgetter as a key function for sortediter and next to get an arbitrary element from a dict
