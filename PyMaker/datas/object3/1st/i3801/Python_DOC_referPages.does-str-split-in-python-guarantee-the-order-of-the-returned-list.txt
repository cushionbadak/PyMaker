Natural Text
I want to split a string based on a sep where the original position of the tokens is important.In the official documentation of str.split(), nothing is mentioned about maintaining the order of the tokens as they appeared in original text before splitting. Is it guaranteed that str.split keeps this order?Having a text like: A > B > C, how can I get a guaranteed output like: [(1, A), (2, B), (3, C)]?

This would lead to your output - split alone does not.Output:If you do not trust split ... make it explicit:Iterating should be guarateed to be in order - would not make much sense else....
