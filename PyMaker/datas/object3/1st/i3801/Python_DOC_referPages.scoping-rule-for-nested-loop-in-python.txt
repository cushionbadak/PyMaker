Why does the above code the following output? The variable i seems to get overwritten by whatever that is last assigned in the inner loop. Does python not obey the scoping rule like Java or C? 
Like any function-local assignment, the loop index is in scope for the entire function the for loop appears in. A for loop itself does not create a new scope.
