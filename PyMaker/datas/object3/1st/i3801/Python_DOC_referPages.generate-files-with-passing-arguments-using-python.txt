Natural Text
I would like to generate files using python is such way.For example, I have script_1.aas file. Inside it, there are 2 parameters which are actually a different path of a network, in the example below, there are 2 folders script_1 in different path :...;char const * const outputDir = "output\\script_1";...success = readNetworkWithLogLevel( net, "network\\script_1", LOGLEVEL_WARNING);I would like to generate or create files using python with the same content and changing only these two parameters with the corresponding number (from 1 to 20), for example, 20 of script_1 with incrementing the number one by one. script_1, script_2, ... script_20.
Read the file:Iterate through the numbers 2-20; use string formatting to construct new strings and replace script_1 with script_n; write to a new file.For python versions 2.7-3.5 replacef'script_{n}' with 'script_{}'.format(n)f'script_{n}.aas' with 'script_{}.aas'.format(n)f-stringsString formatting
