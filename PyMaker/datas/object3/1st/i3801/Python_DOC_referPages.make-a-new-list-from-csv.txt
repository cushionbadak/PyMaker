So, I've search for a method to show a certain csv field based on input, and I've try to apply the code for my program. But the problem is I want to get a certain item in csv and make a new list from certain index.I have csv file like this:at first I have this code, and it works show all the row:then, I try to make a certain row in the result to add the items to a new list. But it didn't work. Here's the code:I want to make a new list that contains row name1, name2, name3, and name4, and then I want to print the list. But I guess the loop is wrongly placed or I missed something.
There are a couple of things you could fix in your code.You are not skipping the header line when iterating through the rows. This means you will not always match an actual row number.Your y variable is not re-initialized. It would be more idiomatic to use a for loop instead of a while anyhow.If more than one row match, it will break (see 2.). If you know you will never have more than one match, you should break after you append the values to the list.Your file is never closed. Also it should be opened with newline='' (see csv module docs)Lastly, you match the actual string ('001'), vs. an integer (1), which could be the source of confusion when entering the input.An updated version:
