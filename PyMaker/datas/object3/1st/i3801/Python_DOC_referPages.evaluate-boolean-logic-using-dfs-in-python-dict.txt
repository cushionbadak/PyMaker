I have a dict structure that appears like the following:}For each rule, I derive a decision and attach it to the policy rule. I do that via a simple recursive walk of the dict. In the above sample policy, the boolean logic equates to the following:I'd like to have a function that takes this policy in and is able to derive the boolean logic in order to return the final evaluation. I know a depth-search first approach is liable to be the direction here, but am struggling with how to maintain the boolean state and know which level I am at within the structure.
Create a dictionary to hold functions that correspond to 'conditions'Write a recursive function that will recurse when 'conditions' is a key in a rule, otherwise iterate over the rules and accumulate 'decisions' in a list.  Use functools.reduce to apply the condition to the decisions.if func is None: return was meant to be the base case but I'm not so sure it's needed - if that happens the dict is messed up and it probably should raise a ValueError  I think this has an implicit base case (if there is such a thing) - it relies on the for rule in d['rules']: loop to run out of items.If the conditions limited to 'AND' and 'OR' you can use all and any.
