In the following code I'm showing a function that lets you add students to a dictionary (book) with rut being the key, the issue I have is that I'm trying to make a function that can search by department and then print all students of that are part of that department, basically I'm asking how do you search a dictionary with 1 key that is associated to a lot of values and you want to search for a particular value and then print all keys that have it along with their info?
You can use a list comprehension.This will give you a list, which you can then print out if you so choose.
