This question already has an answer here:How can I read inputs as numbers?                    19 answers                I have to create a rental car cost estimator by collecting customer input, calculating the costs from the input, and then displaying the results. The part where I'm stuck on is collecting the odometer readings for the total miles they drove. It's giving me an error:I uploaded the code to Pastebin and was hoping someone could give me some insight on how to fix it. Thanks!
Convert all your inputs into numeric form.For example, apply int or float to your input strings:The default behaviour is noted explicitly in the docs:input([prompt])If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output  without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input,  converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.
