Is the order of items obtained from itertools.combinations() deterministic?I am currently writing a script which produces an excessively large number of objects using itertools.combinations, large enough that I can't retain it all in memory. For each combination, there is a function which returns a value that I store in a numpy array (since those are fairly memory efficient). I have just barely enough memory to store all of those floats.I then iterate over those floats, and if it's an index of interest, I run itertools.combinations again with a counter variable to access the combination that produced that result (which only takes a few seconds).I have tested this with various smaller datasets for which I have enough memory, and the entries all are the same in those cases, but I am worried that this is not a "safe" approach to doing what I want.
From the docs:Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input  iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted  order.Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their  value. So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat  values in each combination.
