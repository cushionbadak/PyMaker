I have two lists : one contains the column names of categorical variables and the other numeric as shown below.These are the columns names in a table in Redshift.I want to pass these as a parameter to pull only numeric columns from a table in Redshift(PostgreSql),write that into a csv and close the csv.Next I want to pull only cat_cols and open the csv and then append to it and close it.my query so far:This is the first time I am trying to do selective querying based on python lists and hence stuck on how to pass the list as column names to select from table.Can someone please help me with this?
If you want, to make a query in a string representation, in your case will be better to use format method, or f-strings (required python 3.6+).Example for the your case, only with built-in format function.If you want use only one item from the seg array, use seg[0] or seg[1] in format function.I hope this will help you!
