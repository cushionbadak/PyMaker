This function generates a list of 10 random numbers. I need to modify this function to select and print the smallest number from the randomly generated list Please help, I am having a very hard time with it:
you can use min function for O(n) complexity
I would use numpyShort explanation:will print something like thisand then you just access the minimum value with min().In your implementation you would just doas @Austin mentioned in the comments
This sounds to me like some sort of homework assignment. If you need to make minimum number of changes to the existing function and you need to find minimum yourself (without calling built-in functions), then I would suggest:Even better, but at the expense of modifying/restructuring function's code:If you are allowed to use built-in functions, then simply call min(my_randoms) as suggested by @Aran-Frey.
