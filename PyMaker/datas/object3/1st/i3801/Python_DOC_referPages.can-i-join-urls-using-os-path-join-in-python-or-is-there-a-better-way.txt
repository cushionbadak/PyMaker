I need to navigate to different urls to download images from each of them.The urls are sequential, so I thought best to manually creating them rather than using the Next button in each page.I'm trying to generate the different section of the url and then join them together with os.path.join().This is my working code:However, I get the error:But they should all be strings.
Can I join urls using os.path.join() in Python [...]?Not portably, no. In the case of non-Unix operating systems, the path separator will not be '/', so you'll create malformed URIs.[...] is there a better way?Yes. You can use urllib.
