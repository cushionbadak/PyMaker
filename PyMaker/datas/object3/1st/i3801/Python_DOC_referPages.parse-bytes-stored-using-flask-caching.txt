I used Flask-Caching to cache the response of a Flask view in Redis. Getting the cached data directly from Redis returns some bytes. How can I parse this in Python to examine the cached value?
Flask-Cache uses the RedisCache backend provided by Werkzeug, which serializes values using pickle.dumps. It also prepends a ! for help when deserializing. You should typically not mess with these values directly, and let Flask-Caching handle it.You can use pickletools.dis to safely examine the representation, then pickle.loads to deserialize it. Security note: pickle.loads can execute arbitrary code, so make sure you understand untrusted data first using pickletools.dis.
