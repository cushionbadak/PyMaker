I am making a game right now, but here is the stripped down code of the issues I have run in to. This scenario would be in a class in my game, however recreating it in a test file has yielded the same error message, so I assume that doesn't matter for now.Here is the code:Again the error message is 'TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()'I thought I understood how .remove() works, but maybe I don't?Please let me know what the issue is if you knowThanks in advanced!
list.remove is an in-place operation. It returns None.You need to perform this operation in a separate line to new_list. In other words, instead of new_list = list_of_directions.remove('right'):In the above logic, we assign new_list to a copy of list_of_directions before removing a specific element.Notice the importance of assigning to a copy of list_of_directions. This is to avoid the highly probable scenario of new_list changing with list_of_directions in an undesired manner.The behaviour you are seeing is noted explicitly in the docs:You might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort  that only modify the list have no return value printed â€“ they return  the default None. This is a design principle for all mutable data  structures in Python.
