I have this python script, I now open an image from a given path in the script itself, what I need is a dynamical way to pass the image to the script.For example: python pixel.py 9tiff, I will be running this from php with shell exec and I will need to pass different images each time, so I can't hard code the image name in to a script itself
Parsing command line arguments in python are fairly simple. you can change the your script to as follows:In Python argv[0] variable is always reserved for the name of the python script. python myScript.py 9tiff here argv[0] is held by myScript.py and argv[1] is used by 9tiff
There are tons of similar questions out there, but if you want an easy solution, use sys.argvBut the best is always argparse
