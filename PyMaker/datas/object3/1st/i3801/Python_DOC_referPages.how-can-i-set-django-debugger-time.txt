The Django debugger is import pdb; pdb.set_trace().Sometimes we push the code on the server without remove debugger from the code.In this conditions when we request the view (that views contain debugger) then the page will not load and the browser will hang because of that debugger.So my Question is.Can I set a debugger timeORHow can I avoid debugger after a few minutesIt's the exception case because we always check in the code but sometimes we missed it by mistake.How can I achieve this task?Thanks in advance 
If you are using python 3.7+, you can use the builtin function breakpoint(). The specific effect of this function can be modified by setting the environment variable PYTHONBREAKPOINTThe default behaviour of breakpoint() is to use pdb.set_trace(), but you can use a third party debugger instead.If you set PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0, the debugger() function will not do anything (immediately return)If you are not using python 3.7, you can check out this question about disabling pdf.set_trace()how to disable pdb.set_trace() without stopping python program and edit the code
