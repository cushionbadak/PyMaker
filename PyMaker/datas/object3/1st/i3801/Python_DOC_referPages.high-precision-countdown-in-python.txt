I need to implement a countdown timer in python. I tried this, but the program get stuck and I have to do a forced quit.  For the same reason, I can't have an infinitive loop into the run() method. How can I do?
You didn't say which OS you're using, so I'll assume that you're using a system with a standard ANSI/VT100 terminal, so we can use ANSI escape sequences to move the cursor, etc. If you're using a non-standard OS these sequences may not work in your terminal.This program displays the number of seconds since the program was launched, at the top of the terminal window. The time display is updated every 0.1 seconds. Beneath the time display there's an input prompt, which waits for the user to close the program.This code was derived from this previous answer of mine.Here's a more primitive version, with no cursor control, apart from using the '\r' Carriage Return control character, which should work on any system. You probably don't need the flush=True arg to print, depending on your terminal.
