Currently, I am building a project that allows the simulation of a Magic The Gathering game so I can see how often I draw specific cards and how long it takes to win a match - i.e. take the opponent's life down from 20 to 0. The code that I am using now uses OOP for individual cards and individual decks. These are imported into a main piece of code - the project is on GitHub at https://github.com/jimbob88/MTG.Card.py:This is a simple class that stores the name, casting cost and the type of card. It also contains a variable - cardData - that returns a list with the name, casting cost and supertype. Then these cards are inputted as a list to a class named Deck. Deck.py:The Deck class than places this list into a variable - self.cards. The Deck also contains the variables for the name of the deck, the author of the deck and the colour of the deck. Finally, I have my main script named MTG.py that builds the deck than runs it - here is the area where I have encountered a problem. MTG.py:This code has an infinite loop that asks users for a card name, casting cost, Supertype and the amount of those cards. It then inputs that into the class - Card(userCardName, userCC, userSuperType) - in a list with cardData. It then goes onto repeat this process until the loop is broken. After this, it places all the user gained data into the Deck class.. My problem is my next stage of development is to allow the casting of cards and the basic rules that apply to this. Basically, only one land can be cast each turn and if I want to cast - for example, a creature - I have to tap a land type. So to have a land type tapped it can't be used again. Until the next turn. My idea to fix this was to input each card as an object instead of as a list so I could have a separate self.variable inside this object named isTapped.Although this causes the card to be seen as -  <Card.Card object at 0x7f8dad97f630> - the memory allocation not as it's actual value. Does anyone know how I could do this, any help in other bits of the code would be appreciated,Thanks in advance,James Blackburn.
If you print a list of Cards the list itself will print its elements using repr() of that element, not str(): Output:
