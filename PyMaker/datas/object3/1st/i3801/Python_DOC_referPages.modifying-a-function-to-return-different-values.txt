I must modify the function gp so it will handle + and - grades by adding or subtracting 0.3 points. For example, a B + is worth 3.3 points, and a C- is 1.7 points. Example. The suggestion is I could just add a bunch of elif clauses to test each grade separately, but a similar design is to use a call to s.startswith to figure out the value of the letter grade, then use s.endswith to see if you should add or subtract 0.3 points.So far this is what I have.
Instead of a series of if/elif statements, you can store the numeric values for the grades and the suffixes in dictionaries. Also, you do not have to use startswith or endswith, you could just use s[0] and s[1] to get the first or second character in the string, after checking the length. You can also use s[1:] to get everything starting at the 1th position, even if it's empty.
There are several problems with the gp function.While it is possible to enumerate them, I suggest you read the following resources:How to declare a Python functionHow to use function argumentsWhat is the purpose of the return statement?When you're ready, I strongly recommend you use dictionaries to store your mappings. Here's an example:Edit: My schooling didn't involve GPA, so I didnt't catch this. If you need to cap at 4.0, you can use this modification:
My suggestion would be to use a dictionary for how many points each specific grade would get. Using a dictionary is somewhat like the Python equivalent for a switch statement and is generally consider more idiomatic than a long if/elif/else chain. (My answer is assuming you're using the standard 4.0 GPA calculation scale. If not, this can obviously be changed to suite your needs.)
You should use dictionnariesThen add or substract 0.3 depending on the sign
Another dictionary (hash) approach.
