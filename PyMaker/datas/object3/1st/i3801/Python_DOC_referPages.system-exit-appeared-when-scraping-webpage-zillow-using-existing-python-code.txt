Full disclosure: Python rookie. Trying to use code shared by other people to scrape the internet page (real estate listing) by tweaking the arguments. My questions are probably very rudimentary, so if you can provide some links for further reading and study, that will be great too. I just can't seem to figure out how to proceed from this step. Thanks for your time in advance.I usually don't expect the code to work from the get go and was ready to quick. After I ran it, the error appears:I know the first one was to make me run "%tb" but I don't know how to deal with the second one, where shall I run 'exit' or 'quit'?After I ran "%tb", following messages appear:What shall I do with this? Is there something that I shall do in the command line to fix it?Thanks again
I had some issues with the tabbing which I had to fix but I'm going to assume those were from copying it over or from Stack Overflow.Other than that, everything seems to be working. Just run the program from the command line with the command:python YourFileName.py 12345 where 12345 is the zip code you want to query.Make sure you are using Python3 not ipython as mentioned in the comments.
