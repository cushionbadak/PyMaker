I am wanting to read pairs of lines in from a file, and perform operations on them. How do I go about doing this in Python?I can read the file once with the code below, but I don't know how to turn this into being able to read a whole file of lets say 20 lines, with the rest of my code having to operate on the 10 sets of data that the 20 line file has. There will always be an even amount of lines in the input file.Input:Output:
In Python 3.4+ (3.6+ for the f-string usage), how about this:Note that I did not neglect the with ... context manager - Path() handles that for you.I'm not clear on what you're trying to do with the 'name' line - looks like a no-op, which is how I coded it, but you could wrap the l.split() in reversed() to flip the order.
This is one easy way to do:
I propose to iterate manually in the file with next and use an infinite loop.When there are no more lines, next throws StopIteration exception, that's where we break the loop.Then the classic elegant way of summing a comma-separated list of integers is to split then map to integer conversion and feed to sumprints:If the file has an odd number of lines, the last line information is dropped since the StopIteration exception happens when reading the name information.
Have a look at itertools.islice: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice
