This question already has an answer here:How to run an IPython magic from a script (or timing a Python script)                    5 answers                I am currently following the Holoviews tutorial. Everything in there is done in notebooks, and makes use of the '%' syntax. I've never used notebooks (and don't particularly want to either). How can I write these lines in a normal .py file? Here's an example:I've tried a few things, such as:These all throw errors. How does that % syntax actually work? How are there no commas in that list? I just want to set the width and height of my graph normally. Thanks!
Tl;dr: If your real interest is to use holoviews outside the jupyter notebook environment (like the OP does), see the section Outside the notebook in the holoviews documentation. Briefly, the magic %%opts Graph [width=400 height=400] corresponds to calling the method g.options(width=400, height=400) on some Graph object g.If you are reading this because you are curious about jupyter's  % "magics", read on. The "%" commands that you can use in notebooks are the so-called ipython "magics". You'll find a list of the standard ones here. So they are not available in ordinary Python, but ipython understands the % syntax and translates it to calls to the particular library. So the simplest way to get access to them, and with the same % syntax to boot, is to run ipython instead of python.You also ask how the % syntax works. A third-party package can "register" some of its functions as custom ipython magics by using a simple decorator:See more in the documentation on defining custom magics.Finally, you are of course more interested in going from the hv magics to the corresponding Python code. It seems that the %%opts magic that's been stumping you is a method of this class: holoviews.ipython.magics.OptsMagic. I don't use holoviews, but it seems that something like this might be equivalent to the magic in your question:Note that you may also need to select a graphics backend, e.g. with the backend keyword option.
