Natural Text
I am trying to understand when a tweet is retweeted. To do that I learnt how to use twitter API and tweetpy. This is the first time I use both of them.I got the retweet I am interested by using the following line at the end:Now, when I look at the output I see datetime.datetime(2018, 5, 28, 15, 44, 56) this result. However, I cannot see the timezone this timestamp belongs. How can I know that according to which time zone is this written ?
According to https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-object created_at is a string attribute with the value of "UTC time when this Tweet was created."
