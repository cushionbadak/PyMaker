Guys I'm working on a program and came across a problem! I've had a bit of a search for a solution but I couldn't get any of them to work. Here is my codeAnd I want to be able to print the list out all as strings, However keeping the Integers at the end of the entrys as Integers in the list so that I can use them later in the code. This is how I would like the code to lookOr something along those lines. I have tried a few different methods but couldn't get anything to work that successfully, I'm relatively ne to Python and still trying to learn so if you could give me a brief explanation it would be really beneficial to me :)Your input is much appreciated!!!
myList is a list of lists. First we iterate over it using sequence unpacking to unpack the 3 elements. We then format the elements and print them - I use printf-style formatting here, but the newer str.format formatting is also available. (Some background on the difference between the two)
