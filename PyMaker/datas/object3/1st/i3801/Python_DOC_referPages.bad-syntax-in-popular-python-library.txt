I am trying to use the mitmproxy Python API but the line from mitmproxy import http gives a syntax error. The "http" module contains lines like and which don't look like Python.Am I missing something, or is this just bad code? 
As stated in the mitmproxy docs, you will need to have the most recent Python version.Please make sure to install Python 3.6 (or higher) and pip3 for your distribution.What you are seeing are type hints which have been added in Python 3.5.
