How to code a program that shows me the item that appears most side-by-side?Example:I want four, not six, because there are only two sixes together.This is what I tried (from comments):
Depends on what exactly you want for an input likeIf you consider the four 2 the most common, because it's the longest unbroken stretch of same items, then you can groupby same values and pick the one with max len:If you are interested in the element that appears the most often next to itself, you can zip the list to get pairs of adjacent items, filter those that are same, pass them through a Counter, and get the most_common:For your example of 6 1 6 4 4 4 6 6, both will return 4.
