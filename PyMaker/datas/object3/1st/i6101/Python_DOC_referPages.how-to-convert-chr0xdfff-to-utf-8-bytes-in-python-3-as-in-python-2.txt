The code below explains my problem. It works as expected in Python 2.7, yet, all of the encode calls I've tried fail in Python 3.5 (see exception below)... does anyone on a way to circumvent this error and make it work in Python 3.5 as it did on Python 2.7?Error in Python 3.5:Note that a different encoding wouldn't really suit it as I have files written this way to disk in Python 2 and I need to be able to load it back and dump it again on Python 3 so that Python 2 can read it again (so, the actual bytes written shouldn't really change).
The problem is that char belongs to utf-16:That compiles and works, but... acording to this answer, you will have problems with surrogates
After searching a bit more I noticed that https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#codec-base-classes points to a surrogatepass which is specific to utf-X codecs, so, using surrogatepass instead of surrogateescape does seem to get the trick done and works properly on Python 3:
