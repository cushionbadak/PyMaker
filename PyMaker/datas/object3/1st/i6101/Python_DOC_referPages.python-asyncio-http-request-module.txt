Here is how I'm making a request:The expected response in case of successful request here is response status 302 and a Location header in response, which will contain the url on which redirect needs to be done.The issue is, I'm getting response status as 200, which is response from the final url. How can I achieve what I want?"allow_redirects=False" should have worked, but it doesn't. I'm not sure how can I get it to work as I need.
Note: if you use old generator-based syntax you should use decorator asyncio.coroutine. If you're using Python 3.5+ use new syntax for coroutines.Please provide also minimal code snippet that can be reproduced (including url, other params, your Python version), since I don't get behavior you're talking about:Output:
Request supports an optional allow_redirects parameter, that you can set to False.
