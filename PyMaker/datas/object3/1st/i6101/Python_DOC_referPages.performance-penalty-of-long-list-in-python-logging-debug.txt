How lazy is evaluation in Python? If I have code that looks likelogging.debug('My very long list: %s' % list(x for x in long_generator))and the logging effective level is such that debug messages are ignored, do I incur a performance penalty for having this line?
This will not be lazily evaluated, but Python logging has a solution to this problem: isEnabledFor().Your list will be built and formatted only if logger's level is higher than DEBUG.
You will have a performance penalty because list(x for x in long_generator) will be created before calling logging.debug() even if debug messages are ignored.  There is no lazy evaluation in Python. Every line is evaluated/executed before the next line. It means that expressions are evaluated when they are bound to variables.
