I try to check if a variable is an instance of a number of any type (int, float, Fraction, Decimal, etc.).I cam accross this question and its answer: How to properly use python's isinstance() to check if a variable is a number?However, I would like to exclude complex numbers such as 1j.The class numbers.Real looked perfect but it returns False for Decimal numbers...In contradiction, it works fine with Fraction(1) for example.The documentation describes some operations which should work with the number, I tested them without any error on a decimal instance.Decimal objects cannot contains complex numbers moreover.So, why isinstance(Decimal(1), Real) would return False?
