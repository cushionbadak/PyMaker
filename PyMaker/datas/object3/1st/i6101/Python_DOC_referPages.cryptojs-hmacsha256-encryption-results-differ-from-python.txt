CryptoJS encrypted string can pass different parameters in python can only pass a string? How to implement the second CryptoJS implementation in python ,how to get clientKey2,This will only give the first result.Thanks!i use this way can get clientKey1,How to get the second result in Python,Thanks!
To get the desired clientKey2 you need to encode the hex digits of your saltedPassword string to bytes. One way to do that which works on both Python 2 & Python 3 is to use binascii.unhexlify.Your HmacSHA256 function is a bit odd. It won't work on Python 3, since bytes objects don't have an .encode method. In Python 2, bytes is just a synonym for str.Anyway, here's some code that works on both Python 2 & Python 3.outputThe output is identical on Python 2 & Python 3.BTW, it would be simpler to do this task in Python 3, which makes a clean distinction between text and byte strings. Also, the Python 3 hashlib module has a pbkdf2 function.
