I have made a logic gate that takes in two inputs which will then feed through into a AND gate in this case. For example the user will enter 0 and 0 then the AND gate will process as 0. The problem here is when we use the IF statement to determine our two inputs, they are not recognised otherwise everything else in the program to process the two inputs along with a temporary storage for the output. So the part above I am able to enter the inputs and create a storage for it.The program tells me that A and B are unrecognised so does anyone know what I am doing wrong here?this is where the problem takes place: everything from here to the else statement is ignored.it skips all my elif statements and just prints an error. 
I cleaned up your code for you: you should read up on python syntax, f.e. https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html (for 2.7.x) and do some tutorialsMAIN Program
