I need to send an object from a client to a server, but sockets only let you send bytes.  How do I convert a custom object to bytes in Python 3.5 so I can send it via the socket?
You can serialize the object using pickle, which will convert it to bytes and allow you to send it.  You can read up on how to use pickle here
Depends on what you are trying to send over the webs, if it is just some basic dict or list of basic types you could serialize it to json. See here.If you really want to serialize entire python class then use already mentioned pickle, although it can be dangerous, see here.And remember to NOT execute anything deserialized which came from the internet.
You'll need to serialize your object, which can be done with the pickle library.
