This question already has an answer here:Saving an Object (Data persistence)                    3 answers                easy save/load of data in python                    6 answers                When I run a program for the second time, how can I make it remember the variables that have changed?  So for the first time it is run:  And then the second time it is run it remembers what foo[2] is without the user having to put it in again.
You can write data to a file, and read that data back in on subsequent runs.  (If the file doesn't exist, or if it is zero length, let the program start from scratch.)  This approach is quite practical if you only need to save one or two items of data.Slightly more generally, persistence is a term commonly used to refer to maintaining data across multiple executions of a program.See, for example, persistence for Python 2.7 and persistence for Python 3.  There, pickling or marshalling data are described.  Use functions like dumps() to serialize data for storage, and loads() to de-serialize it.  This approach is practical if you save lots of data or if you save complicated data structures.
I don't really understand what you are saying. But if I could guess you have to bind the values you want to certain variables like you do. The second time you run it, it remember the variable's value. Or you can save it to a file and have it there.
