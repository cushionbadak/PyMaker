Im trying to make a while loop in python, but the loop keeps looping infinitely.Here's what I have so far:I want num to be returned as ans as follows:if num is 5, I want ans to be BBBBBif num is 10, ans is Aif num is  22, I want ans to be AABB.
You may want to learn about the break statement.As for your code:Is much better, the case when num == 9 is now handled properly
Use the break statement to get out of the loop.
