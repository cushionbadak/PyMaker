Title, for example I want to make 'A3G3A' into 'AAAGGGA'.I have this so far:
Here's a simplistic approach:OUTPUT: AAAGGGAIt assumes valid input.  It's limitation is that the repetition factor has to be a single digit, e.g. 2 - 9.  If we want repetition factors greater than 9, we have to do slightly more parsing of the string:OUTPUT: DAAAAAAAAAAGGGABC
Assuming that the format is always a letter followed by an integer, with the last integer possibly missing:Assuming that the format can be any substring followed by an integer, with the integer possibly longer than one digit and the last integer possibly missing:
A minimal pure python code which manage all cases.with input="WA5OUH2!10",   output is WAAAAAOUHH!!!!!!!!!!.+'a' is to enforce the good behaviour at the end, because output is delayed.   
Another approach could be -Explanation - 
using the * to repeat the characters: assumption repeater range between [1,9]
