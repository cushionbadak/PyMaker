I'm running into a weird error trying to install Django on my computer.This is the sequence that I've typed into my command line:What could be causing this?EDIT ___________________As requested this is what I get when I type in echo %PATH%
You need to add the path of your pip installation to your PATH system variable. By default, pip is installed to C:\Python34\Scripts\pip (pip now comes bundled with new versions of python), so the path "C:\Python34\Scripts" needs to be added to your PATH variable.To check if it is already in your PATH variable, type echo %PATH% at the CMD promptTo add the path of your pip installation to your PATH variable, you can use the Control Panel or the setx command. For example:Note:According to the official documentation, "[v]ariables set with setx variables are available in future command windows only, not in the current command window". In particular, you will need to start a new cmd.exe instance after entering the above command in order to utilize the new environment variable. Thanks to Scott Bartell for pointing this out.
For windows when you install a package you type:
For me command:worked immediately (try after echo %PATH% and you will see that your path has the value C:\Python34\Scripts).Thanks to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/9546345/1766166
also, the long method - it was a last resort after trying all items above:this after cd in directory where the wheel is located
Alternate way.If you don't want to add the PATH as the previous well written answers pointed out, but you want to execute pip as your command then you can do that with py -m as prefix.Given that you have to do it again and again.eg.as inAlso make sure to have pip and py installed
set Path = %PATH%;C:\Python34\;C:\Python27\ScriptsSource
Try going to windows powershell or cmd prompt and typing:python -m pip install openpyxl
As per Python 3.6 Documentation It is possible that pip does not get installed by default. One  potential fix is:
Go to control Panel >> Uninstall or change Program and double click on Python XXX to modify install. Make sure PIP component is checked and install.
I realize this is an old question, but I was having the same problem just now. After adding the proper folder (C:\Python33\Scripts) to the path, I still could not get pip to run. All it took was running pip.exe install -package- instead of pip install -package-. Just a thought. 
In latest version python 3.6.2 and above, is available in C:\Program Files (x86)\Python36-32\Scripts You can add the path to our environment variable path as below Make sure you close your command prompt or git after setting up your path. Also should you open your command prompt in administrator mode. This is example for windows 10. 
Control Panel -> add/remove programs -> Python -> Modify -> optional Features (you can click everything) then press next -> Check "Add python to environment variables" -> InstallAnd that should solve your path issues, so jump to command prompt and you can use pip now.
Even I'm new to this but, C:\Python34\Scripts>pip install django ,worked for me. The path should be set as where the Script folder of Python installation is i.e.C:\Python34\Scripts. I suppose its because django is a framework which is based on python that's why this directory structure has to be maintained while installing.
Yo can try pip3, something like:
refer the ENV path setting up :http://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/  make sure the env path is added correctly, for 2.7-"c:\Python27\Scripts;" refer Get Pip section : http://www.tylerbutler.com/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/make use of these resources.this will solve issue for you
I continued to recieve this error after correcting my PATH.If your codebase requires that you have an earlier version of Python (2.7 in my case), it may have been a version prior to the existence of pip.It's not very canonical but installing a more recent version worked for me. (I used 2.7.13) 
I had this same issue. You just need to go to your C:\Python27\Scriptsand add it to environment variables. After path setting just run pip.exe file on C:\Python27\Scripts and then try pip in cmd. But if nothing happens try running all pip applications like pip2.7 and pip2.exe. And pip will work like a charm.
I have just installed python 3.6.2.I got the path as C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts
In Windows, open cmd and find the location of PYTHON_HOME using  where python,now add this location to your Environment PATH using:or  Refer thisIn Linux, open terminal and find the location of PYTHON_HOME using which python, now add the PYTHON_HOME/Scripts to the PATH variable using:
I think from Python 2.7.9 and higher pip comes pre installed and it will be in your scripts folder.  So you have to add the "scripts" folder to the path.  Mine is installed in C:\Python27\Scripts.  Check yours to see what your path is so that you can alter the below accordingly, then Go to powershell, paste the below code in powershell and hit Enter key.  After that, reboot and your issue will be resolved.
Or If you are using PyCharm (2017.3.3) like me, just change directory in terminal and install: 
A very simple way to get around this is to open the path where pip is installed in file explorer, and click on the path, then type cmd, this sets the path, allowing you to install way easier.4 years late, but I ran into the same issue a couple days ago and all the other methods didn't work for me.
Try uninstall Python, delete the remaining program files, then install it again fresh. It worked for me. This error happened to me when I migrate to a new laptop and used a migration software to move my software from the old laptop to the new one. And yeah, didn't work quite well.
Small clarification: in "Windows 7 64 bit PC", after adding ...Python34\Scripts to the path variable, pip install pygame didn't work for me.So I checked the "...Python34\Scripts" folder, it didn't have pip, but it had pip3 and pip3.4. So I ran pip3.4 install pygame .... .whl. It worked.(Further open a command window in the same folder where you have the downloaded pygame...whl file.)
In windows environment, just execute below commands in dos shell.path=%path%;D:\Program Files\python3.6.4\Scripts;  (new path=current path;path of the python script folder)
