I'd like to read the contents of every file in a folder/directory and then print them at the end (I eventually want to pick out bits and pieces from the individual files and put them in a separate document)So far I have this codeat the end I dont get any errors but it only prints the contents of the last file in my folder in a series of strings and I want to make sure its reading every file so I can then access the data I want from each file. I've looked online and I cant find where I'm going wrong. Is there any way of making sure the loop is iterating over all my files and reading all of them?also i get the same result when I use in the 5th line Please help I'm so lostThanks!!
you forgot indentation at this line allLines = file.readlines() and maybe you can try that :
This also creates a file containing all the files you wanted to print.This is a similar case, with more features: Copying selected lines from files in different directories to another file
Separate the different functions of the thing you want to do.Use generators wherever possible. Especially if there are a lot of files or large filesImportsDeciding which files to process:[variation] Filter filesif you only need files with extension .extProcess filesSave the lines you want to keep
You forgot to indent this line allLines.append(file.read()).Because it was outside the loop, it only appended the file variable to the list after the for loop was finished. So it only appended the last value of the file variable that remained after the loop. Also, you should not use readlines() in this way. Just use read() instead;
