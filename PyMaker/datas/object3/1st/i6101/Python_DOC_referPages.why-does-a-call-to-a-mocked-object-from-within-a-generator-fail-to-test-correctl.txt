In the following code under test the Generator class contains two methods each of which calls the next_count method of the Counter class. These two calls to next_count are tested with two almost identical tests using assert_called_with. The test of the generator method fails. Why? How can this call be tested?Code Under Testgenerator.pyTest Moduletest_generator.py
This has nothing to do with generators. You test 2 different things, and tested the wrong thing in both tests.Your two tests test something different:This tests if the class was called. It is indeed called, as Counter(). Remember that mock_counter mocked the class, not an instance.This tests if an attribute Counter.next_count was called. This was never called, because it is instead called on the instance.The correct test is to see if that attribute on an instance is called:orUse this is both tests.Because mock_counter is the class, it could perhaps be better named MockCounter.In future, print out the mock_calls attribute of your mock; it'll show what was called instead. For both tests this prints:
