If I write my function f as this:I can call it normally with positional arguments:And I can also call it using the positional arguments as keyword arguments:However, if I do that with the print function, I get an error:I tried to use value as keyword because it was what it showed me when I did help(print):edit: Now I understand the *objects and I get that print is looking for a tuple of values. The pow function illustrates what I ask better:Why can't I never seem to refer to the parameters by their names if I use python functions? As I showed above it worked for my f function.
The implementation of print is this:print(*objects, sep=’ ‘, end=’\n’, file=sys.stdout, flush=False)The objects parameter has a * before, so it is expected to be a variable number of positional arguments**Edited after @brunodesthuilliers comment.
