I have an array of tuples like:I want to add the values myArr[1][0],myArr[1][1],myArr[1][2] and myArr[1][3] to a new data frame:not sure how to iterate through the array while adding a value to the column t.
myArr is not exactly a tuple but rather a namedtuple (see scipy.stats source code), which allow to access its fields like arguments, and the names of these fields. As in your case it encapsulates two numpy.array (see scipy.stats.ttest_ind doc) you can use it directly as values for your new columns.inspired from this answer
