Suppose I have a numpy array of the form:I want to find the indices of the first index (for every column) where the value is non-zero.So in this instance, I would like the following to be returned:How do I go about this?
Indices of first occurrencesUse np.argmax along that axis (zeroth axis for columns here) on the mask of non-zeros to get the indices of first matches (True values) -Extending to cover generic axis specifier and for cases where no non-zeros are found along that axis for an element, we would have an implementation like so -Note that since argmax() on all False values returns 0, so if the invalid_val needed is 0, we would have the final output directly with mask.argmax(axis=axis).Sample runs -Extending to cover all comparison operationsTo find the first zeros, simply use arr==0 as mask for use in the function. For first ones equal to a certain value val, use arr == val and so on for all cases of comparisons possible here.Indices of last occurrencesTo find the last ones matching a certain comparison criteria, we need to flip along that axis and use the same idea of using argmax and then compensate for the flipping by offsetting from the axis length, as shown below -Sample runs -Again, all cases of comparisons possible here are covered by using the corresponding comparator to get mask and then using within the listed function.
