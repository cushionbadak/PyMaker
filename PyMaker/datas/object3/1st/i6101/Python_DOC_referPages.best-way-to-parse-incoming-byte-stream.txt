Natural Text
I am wondering what the best way to look for a start and end sequence in a byte stream from a file. The way I have been doing this is:I am sure there is a better way to do this. What is the cleanest way to look for these beginning and ending identifiers?
What you want to do sounds like something Python's re regular expressions (aka regex) module can handle. You can use it to parse a byte-string (instead of the usual text-string) if you pass it a byte-string to parse and also define your pattern as a byte-string. Note: The easiest way to do that is to use the b string prefix in front of them (not in front of each character, as you're doing in your question).For testing the code coming up I used a file with this in it (sorry, not very imaginative):Then used the module on it with the proper regex pattern like so:The output from it looks like this, displaying the list of strings returned from re.findall():
