I need my code to work faster, this one I currently have sometimes even takes up to 5 seconds to print an answer.How can I make it run faster? And what is the problem in this code, so I can avoid this problem in the future?
What should be written in your questionTo summarize:You have a list of n integers.You want to calculate every combination of p integers.You want to calculate the sum of every combination.You want to sort those sums.You want the k-th sum.Code with itertools.combinationsWith this description, the code becomes straightforward:Using itertools.combinations might speed your code up, especially since you don't need to calculate math.factorial(n) for large n.Most of all, this code is much more concise and shows your intent much better.PerformanceIt's unfortunate that triple_sums isn't sorted even if integers are sorted. Every combination needs to be calculated, and the whole list has to be sorted. There might be an alternative way to produce the combinations with which triple_sums would be sorted directly but I cannot think of any.If your list has 7000 integers, there will be 57142169000 triples. Using itertools won't help much for performance. You'd need to provide more information about the list and k.
Some advice:1，Using python 2 instead of python 3.2,When calculating large numbers，Using "xrange" instead of "range";Using "ifilter" instead of "filter".3,If you use iterative algorithms, try to use "yield".
