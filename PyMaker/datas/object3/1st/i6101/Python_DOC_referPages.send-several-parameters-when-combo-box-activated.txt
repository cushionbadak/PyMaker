Natural Text
At the moment when a combo box gets selected only the value of the combo box gets passed on to the function on_combo_activated.How would I do if I wanted to send another two variables?
One way to solve this is by using a lambda function:The functools.partial function does something similar, but it can sometimes be awkward to use it with positional arguments. If you used it to connect the above slot like this:the slot would actually print str1 str2 text, because extra positional arguments are always appended, rather than inserted. However, with keyword arguments, it would work as expected:This last approach might be preferred over the others as it is self-documenting, and therefore perhaps more readable.
