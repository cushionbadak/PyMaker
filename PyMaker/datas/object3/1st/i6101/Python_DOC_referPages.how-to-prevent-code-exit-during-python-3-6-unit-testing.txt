AS I write functions and classes with Python 3.6 I try to write unit tests as soon as I am capable.  I am writing a simple function that tests whether or not a file exists at a user specified location, that looks like this.The unit test for the above function looks likeIf the file exists at the desired location, the test passes successfully; however, if the file does not exist, the program exits with a Fatal Warning.  This is how i want the program to behave during normal operation; however, in unit testing, I want to purposefully be able to place an incorrect path and register that as a successful test, to prove the program does what I want.  In other words during one test case, I don't want the program to exit.  Is there any way to do this during unit testing?
You can handle the error gracefully using try/excepthttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions
Try doing try except statements:
