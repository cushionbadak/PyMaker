Natural Text
If I create a folder in a root directory, where the folder name is generated by a script.py giving it a name with todays date(YYYY-mm-dd). how do I reference that folder from another script (or the same script at a later stage) in the same directory after it's creation? 
There are several options: Use today's date to construct the same name in the other scriptHave the scripts share a common parent environment or calling script that passes the name to both scriptsUse interprocess communication between the scriptsHave the scripts read the filename from a common location (e.g. a file known to both scripts)
