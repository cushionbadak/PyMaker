This question already has an answer here:How do I trim whitespace?                    15 answers                I've tried I don't think strip() and rtrim() is what I want because they'd either remove all occurrences of \n or only at the end of the string.
You can use re.sub:Output:This will work for any number of \n at the beginning of a string.
You want str.lstrip(). Exact same as strip() except it strips from the left only, not both directions.
