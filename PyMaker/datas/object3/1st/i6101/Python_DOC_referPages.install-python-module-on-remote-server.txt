I have a internal scheduler tool which runs a python script on a remote server. I am using configparser module within my script. When I run this script through the tool it gives me below error. I don't have access to that remote server so I can't just login to server and install required module.Is there any way through which I can install configparser module by running any installation script on remote server through the tool ( I can neither download package on remote server nor run any commands, All I can do is, running scripts through this tool.) Please let me know if you need more clarification on this.
How about you do something like this. Create a python script that calls a bash script to do what you want:install.py:I am assuming you are using a virtualenv. If not, I assume the account that the script-runner uses has sudo access.
