Let's say you have the following Python program:You can terminate it when it outputs 2500 like this:Note, this a bit dirty, you might receive aBut if you want to kill the program anyway ...Important note: This won't work if the script is writing to stderr (like logging.StreamHandler does by default), or if it's handling BrokenPipeError. The former can be easily fixed with |& redirection, but in the latter case, kill -INT would work better.
