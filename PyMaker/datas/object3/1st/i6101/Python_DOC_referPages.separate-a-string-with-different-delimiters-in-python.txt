I came across a csv file which made me wonder what should be the correct processes to get the info out of it. I want to read each line and then each row in variables lastname, firstname and department but,structure of the csv file is like thislets say we have a name Jean-Claude Van Dammewhat would be the best way to separate such string and store in variables lastname, firstname and the department?task is to separate Jean-Claude and (Karate-Master)
You can use Pandas library:Use two separators , andd (Then you can strip )[2] in this case is column number.
You could use regular expressions and capturing groups:
if it's from a csv file, then I think you can import csv module. Then you can iterate it row by row and each row you need to split it by comma. On last name you can search word between the bracket using regex \((.*?)\). at last you need to remove the bracket.
