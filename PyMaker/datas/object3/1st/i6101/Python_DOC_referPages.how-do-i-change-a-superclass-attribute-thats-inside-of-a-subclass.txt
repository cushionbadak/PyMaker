When I define the __init__ of ProductionWorker, I also need to set the attributes of EmployeeClass. I entered "Bob" and "001121" as a test and it works but I need to be able to change it in my main from the input of the user.My main:This is the result I get:
You have to use arguments as any with any other parameters:
I would include the parameters of the EmployeeClass in the init method parameters of the ProductionWorker to pass along to the superclass. For python 3 you can do super().__init___() rather than EmployeeClass.__init__(). Additionally you should consider using descriptors rather than implementing getters and setters as that is the pythonic way to do that.
