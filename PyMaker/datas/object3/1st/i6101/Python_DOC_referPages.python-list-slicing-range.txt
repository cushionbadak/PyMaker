I am a new Python learner. I was stopped by some codes like below:Especially what does it mean: [i%-3&-4:i%-5&8^12]Thank you so much!
: is the range symbol, meaning give me the list elements between start and end in list[start:end].% is the modulo operator, & is the binary (bit-wise) and operator, so the first part:i%-3&-4is equal to mod(i, -3) & -4^ is the exclusive or operator, so the second part:i%-5&8^12is equal to mod(i, -5 ) & 8^12The modulo operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. If you need to know more about python binary (bit-wise) operators look hereAs stated in the comments, without the back-tics `` , the last part after the or statement returns a range from 1 to n+1, if the resulting fist list is empty.The back ticks, in that statement is Python2 syntax for the repr() function.See repr documentation  for more info
