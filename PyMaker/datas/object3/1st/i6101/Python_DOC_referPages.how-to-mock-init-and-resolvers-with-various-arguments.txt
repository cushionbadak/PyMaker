I've seen a lot of examples of mock tests but none that show how one could mock something like <graphql.execution.base.ResolveInfo object at 0x106f002a8> For instance, if I wanted to test that the two methods in this class were working properly, how would I mock the values that are being passed in?The __init__ method returns: args: {}, context: <Request 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' [POST]>, info: <graphql.execution.base.ResolveInfo object at 0x106f000c8>And the resolve_my_search method returns:args: {'page_type': [u'MyCorgi', u'YourCorgi'], 'query': u'Corgi family', 'domain': u'corgidata.com'}, context: <Request 'http://localhost:8080/graphql' [POST]>, info: <graphql.execution.base.ResolveInfo object at 0x106f002a8>I know I can mock the dictionary value with mock_args.json.return_value but... not sure about the Request and object. Any ideas? Guidance? I've already spent a week on this and have found no way out.
Use unittest.mock python package. Here is an example:
