I want to create a function that returns the count of each attribute value from a csv, the output should be a dictionary (for every attribute one) where the keys are the distinct attribute values and the associated values are the number of times that value occurs in the data...for example I have the following CSV-File (the first line is the header):and I would wish to have that as output then,I think I could do it with using the Counter class from the python collections module when I use the DictReader type for the CSV so that each row is a dictionary as well. But I still can't bring it to work, does anyone have an idea if that is possible? Here what I tried until now. :)Would be great if anyone has an hint or an idea how to solve that. :)
In addition to collections.Counter, you could use a collections.OrderedDict to keep things simple plus make the processing largely "date-driven" in the sense that the contents of the csv file itself will determine what the attributes are (instead of hardcoding their names).The use of OrderedDict preserves the order of the attributes in the csv file's header row. Here's what I'm saying:Output:
Solution:You just need to check if the key in the dictionaries exist, if it does, add value 1 or get 0 when it does not exist and add 1. .get method  in dictionary solves it.Ref: dict .get methodEDIT:Solution 2 (Using collections.Counter):
