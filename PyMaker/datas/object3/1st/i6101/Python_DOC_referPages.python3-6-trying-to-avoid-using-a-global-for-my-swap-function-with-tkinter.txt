I have only been programming 3 months so any advice on improvement to my code is appreciated even if it inst related to my specific question.Its a simple small project with tkinter. Two fields to enter your first and last name then you  hit the swap button and it will swap what ever you put in the name fields. Problem is I dont want to use globals and I cant seem to figure it out I know its probably something easy and I did spend time trying to figure it out.If you have any improvements to the code let me know.
One of the solutions can be wrapping all the code related to the initialization and working with Tk in a separate class, so instead of global variables, we will use the class instance variables:A small comment to the code above: adding a prefix __ to variables or methods allows you to hide access to them directly by name outside the class using the name mangling.UPD: According to @Coal comment, changed the double underscore prefixes to single underscore, as there is no need to use a name mangling.
This is assuming that when you say you don't want to use global, that you also mean that you don't want to use self:
