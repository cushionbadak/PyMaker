Natural Text
I am quite new to python and i am trying to figure out the way we can write a function which can compute the number of python files(.py extension) in a specified directory recursively.
Why do you want to do that?You could just do find -iregex .*.pyon any linux box.Alternatively you could import walk from os and use it to walk a directory and check the last 3 characters of each file name.
