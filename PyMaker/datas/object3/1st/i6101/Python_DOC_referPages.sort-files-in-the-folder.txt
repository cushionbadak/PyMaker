I need to clean up my archive folder such that only top two files sorted by type of release and the version id are retained. I broke the file name into a list and tried with an operator.itemgetter but sorting multiple times is a costly operation.Example: 1.0.0-release-735586.zip1.0.0-release-447088.zip1.0.0-release-436044.zip1.0.1-patch-480506.zip1.0.1-patch-968125.zip1.0.1-patch-532147.zipshould be 1.0.0-release-735586.zip1.0.0-release-447088.zip1.0.1-patch-968125.zip1.0.1-patch-532147.zip
Use itertools groupby and sorted i.e Here we can group the list elements by excluding their last 10 characters ie '1.0.0-release-735586.zip'[:-10] will give '1.0.0-release-'. For every group we are taking only first two elements by sorting them in descending order. Which is done by sorted and [:2]
