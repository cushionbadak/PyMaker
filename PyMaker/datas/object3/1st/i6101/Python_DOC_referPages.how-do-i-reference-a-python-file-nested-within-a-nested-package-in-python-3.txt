Trying to understand how to properly use another module when its nested within a folder. I tried implementing a package using the __init__.py as documented in the Packages section of Modules. I am not finding much success. Here is the file structure. For example, I want to be able to reference a class contained within credentials.py in propeller.py. Another use case, I want to reference a function from within base.py in propeller.py. Looking forward to hearing how other approach this. Thanks! 
It depends. Is the main module 'the_machine' in your Module Search Path?  If so, you should be able to import the_machine.credentials. Otherwise, either add it to your sys.path or  import it directly using the path..
