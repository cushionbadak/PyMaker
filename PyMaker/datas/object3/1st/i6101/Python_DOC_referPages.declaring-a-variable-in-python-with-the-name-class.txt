I'd like to declare a variable (string, in this case) as such:In Python (3.6.3), and I get an error:It obviously doesn't like the fact that I'm using an equal sign (=) after class. Let's say I really need to have a variable with the name class, and I can't change it to myClass or whatsoever, what would be the correct way of doing something as such?
Thankfully Python doesn't allow you to do this, class is a keyword that can't be used as an identifier. One alternative also mentioned in PEP 8 is using a trailing underscore:but you really should avoid such names since they mostly serve to confuse. You should always strive for more descriptive ones.If class is the only option, the other (somewhat) viable approach would be to use a dictionary:
You cannot do that, as it explicitly stated in the Python documentation:link to the documentation
It is not possible, however it is some kind of a tradition in Python to append class _ to get a new identifierUse like this:You can read Official Documentation 
You can't declare reserved words as variables.
