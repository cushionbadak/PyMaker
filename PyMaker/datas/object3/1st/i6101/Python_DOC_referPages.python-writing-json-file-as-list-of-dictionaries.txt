I am writing a json file from information extracted from a url. How do I print each element of the dictionary on a separate line?This is my current code:For example, it currently prints like this:I would like it to print like this:
Other people have remarked on using pprint, but I would like to add that pprint prints the representation of the Python values in your dictionary. They are not always the same as their JSON counterparts, for example:(the correct JSON serialization here is {"value": null}The better option, for these kinds of values, is to use json.dump or json.dumps. You can use the indent parameter to sort of make it print one line per element. Note though that this will also print each list element into their separate lines (so you don't exactly get one line per one JSON key):But you're guaranteed to at least always get the correct JSON. Plus, you can also extend the behavior with your own JSON encoder. This allows you, for example, to serialize Python datetime objects into JSON strings.
Update Actually what you have is a list of dictionaries. When you want to add more elements you need to remove the [] around the dictionary.To slve your specific problem you want to use indent=0. Also consider using json.dump directly.Output:ContinuingTo add more elements you need to do this:Output now contains a list with 2 dicts.
Don't use json, pprint is perfect for this job.There are a few parameters for customization, please check the doc for more details :https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html
Use prettyprinter:Also: you are currently putting the dict in a list. [] is a list {} is a dict in python.By putting [{}] you are putting the dict into a list. Just remove the [].
