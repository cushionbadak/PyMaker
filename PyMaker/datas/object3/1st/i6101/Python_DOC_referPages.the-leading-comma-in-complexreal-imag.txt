In documentation's guideline:2. Built-in Functions â€” Python 3.6.3 documentationIt's obvious that [object] means it's an object inside bracket.as forSearch it,the results cycle back to the offical documentation.What's syntax behind 'leading comma'?
Bear with me but I'm going to cite a bit here (emphasis mine):dir([object])Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object. (Python 3.6.3 Documentation source)The above notation for the Python documentation implies that the parameter, object, is optional and supplying it affects the behavior of the method (as described in dir()'s description).As for your example of complex([real[, imag]]), the syntax indicates that it is valid for you to supply none, only real, or both of the arguments. The behaviors of the method under those circumstances are also listed in the method's description (emphasis also mine):...If imag is omitted, it defaults to zero and the constructor serves as a numeric conversion like int and float. If both arguments are omitted, returns 0j. (PyDocs source)However, be careful as this is not the same as complex([real, imag]). complex([real, imag]) only implies that you can supply either none or both of the arguments, not any single one of them.Hope this helped!
