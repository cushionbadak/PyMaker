This question already has an answer here:What does “while False” mean?                    3 answers                I understand that the following is an infinite loop (until you break out of it):So then, what would be the need to ever use the following:Or:Since the while loop only executes the code below if the while (condition):evaluates to the boolean True, is it correct to assume that the "code" show below would never execute?:
while only executes the loop body if the expression evaluates to a true value.As such, hardcoding the expression to False (or anything that always produces False or other false value), has no use other than to ensure the loop block is not executed.
