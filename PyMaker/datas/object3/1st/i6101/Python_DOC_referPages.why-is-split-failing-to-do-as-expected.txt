I'm hoping this is a quick one.I am trying to get the second level domain from a given URLhere is my code:the problem is with the last line, for some reason it doesn't seem to do anything.if I feed it url = "http://www.nba.com/sports"i get back "nba.com/sports"im trying to just get "nba.com"
Print url after each result and you'll see what you need to do:After here, it's clear all we need to do is just split at the /. Don't overcomplicate it too much :)As @Mark mentioned in the comments, you can also use urllib.urlparse:And you can then strip everything from the first . if necessary, but depending on what you're doing you might not need to.Note, if you're using Python 2, then the module is urlparse.
Correct solution: Don't reinvent the wheel, use the existing libraries for as much as you can:which gets you nba.com.
