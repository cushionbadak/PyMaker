I am using the python multiprocessing/pool module to compare program running times of a function that checks if a number is a prime. I can get the prime function to work by itself, but can't seem to merge the two so they work together. The pool function below:The function I am using to check if a number is a prime is the following:Then I am calling the pool_process functionAnd I am getting the following error:
data in the third code snippet needs to be a list.The variable data is fed into pool_process as second argument.In there it is given to Pool.map as argument to iterate over.After I put that integer into a list (and correcting the import statements) the code runs fine on my machine.
