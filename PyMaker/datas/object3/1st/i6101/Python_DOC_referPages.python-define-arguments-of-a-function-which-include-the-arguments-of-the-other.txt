Please let me know if there are duplicated ones (I believe there are) and I will remove the post. I am just not sure about the jargon for this question.When writing a new function augmented_func which contains the other function already defined original_func, I am trying to avoid defining arguments that are already in original_func:How do I avoid writing a's when defining augmented_func, and make it simpler especially when the number of arguments for original_func is more than, say, three in the example?
Use * notation for an arbitrary number of positional arguments:Or use keyword arguments with **:
I think what you looking for is something likeyou can call it then as augmented_func(1, 2, 3, 4)*args and **kwargs is a good way for passing the variable number of arguments and passing them to other internal function calls.Python docs for further info.
