I'm currently taking images from a webcam that should be processesed as soon as they are captured. The code uses the cv2.videocapture() function afterwards the images are extracted. Idea: As soon as an Image is captured I want to use the time the system needs to capture a new image for computation on the previous image. To achieve this task I use the asyncio library. First of all I define a function that produces n images which should be stored in a queue `After that I implemented a producer method which waits for a entry in the queue and computes some image features (here a simple threshold):To start the functions I created a run function and added it into an event loop (The run method contains a parameter of how many images i want to process):As long as I use print statements I get a async output like this:producing 0/10producing 1/10consuming 0...producing 2/10consuming 1...producing 3/10consuming 2...producing 4/10consuming 3...Which is exactly what I desire in terms of order. However, I cant get back any thresholded image. What am I missing? Thank you in advance
