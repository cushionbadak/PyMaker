Here thereI currently have a string as followsand I called it locationString.I am trying to find all indexes for all the brackets (both '(' & ')') inside this string as followsbut it doesnot work, can anyone help?
re.finditer accepts regex pattern, and parentheses have special meaning in regex (they form groups). If you want to match literal ( and ) you have be escape them (like \( and \)), or enclose them in character class (like [(] and [)]).
