I am trying to make a SQL database in python that stores users names and birthdays. At the moment I have this code;But when I enter it, it gives me an error message. I have already created the database with the appropriate name and columns and I have defined the name and birthday variable. I am using SQLite 3. Any suggestions that anybody has would be much appreciated.
You're trying to use normal string interpolation instead of param substitution. Change %s to ? as shown in the docs.
I have changed the %s to ? and it now works perfectly. This is the code I used;sql_command = ("""INSERT INTO birthdays(name, birthday) VALUES (?,?);""", (name, birthday))cursor.execute(*sql_command)
