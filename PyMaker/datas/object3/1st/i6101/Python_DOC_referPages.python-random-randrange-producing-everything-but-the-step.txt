When using this following code: the output is producing everything excluding the step, so for example i would like this to output a random from these numbers: 2,4,8,16,32,64. However it will output everything but these numbers. Can anyone offer any advice, the reason i'm using variables here is because the amount of sticks will decrease.
Instead of using random.randrange you could use random.choice (docs):
You can try thisI would suggest you to use this instead of random.choice, which requires you to generate a list, which is unnecessary.
