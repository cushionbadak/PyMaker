This snippet worked fineWas studying loops and these worked fineWhen I triedI get an error "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"I do understand the outside parenthesis is making for loop go crazy (error) but which part of the syntax am I violating? it worked fine in while loop
syntax of for is (simplified)more precisely:since you're parenthesizing <variable> in <expression>, the syntax becomes invalid.for and in must be present at the same nesting level.syntax of while is much simpler:thus allows parentheses, although not necessary in Python
You can't just lob on extra parenthesis anywhere you want. The while syntax, generally stated, is:Here, you're just surrounding a condition with parenthesis, which is fine, as you saw yourself.  The for loop's syntax is:You could surround the expression in parenthesis, but no arbitrary parts of the syntax.
