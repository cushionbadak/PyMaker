I am trying to use the "pdb" python debugger (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) in a Jupyter Notebook, but it is not behaving as expected.In particular, when I run the following codethe debugger is entered as expected, displaying with the (PBD) command line.  However, when I type n into this command line, and hit "enter", attempting to move the debugger to the next line, something unexpected happens -- the output is updated toEntering n a few more times givesWhat's going on here?  The code the debugger is stepping through is not mine...
