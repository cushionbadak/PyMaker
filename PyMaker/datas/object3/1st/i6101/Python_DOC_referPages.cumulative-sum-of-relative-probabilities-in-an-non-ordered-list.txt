I was trying to calculate the cumulative probabilities for such a data structure, however, I need to keep the order of the values for indexing them to the respective individuals in the same positions in another list. The programs performs the operations sequentially, giving a higher weight for the last position, which in this case would be the lowest fitness. Does anyone know if there is a way to perform the cumulative sum in the correct way (crescent order of fitness values), without changing their position in the output list?Thank you very much!
In your dictionary you have associated fitness(?) values with a unique identifier. Presumably these identifiers came from somewhere else in your program and dataset.  Instead of trying to rely on the order of construction of the dictionary to preserve this relationship, I've maintained the association and constructed a new dictionary with the values being the cumulative sum obtained after sorting the fitness from low to hi.Hopefully with the dictionary you will be able to relate the cumulative sums to the original individuals in the other part of your code.I see that you have been asking other questions related to this dataset and project.  You may want to invest some time learning Pandas or even consider keeping the data in a database instead of individual containers scattered throughout the project.
