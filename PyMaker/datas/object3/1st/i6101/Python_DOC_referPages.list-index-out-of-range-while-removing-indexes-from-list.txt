You are modifying a list while iterating over it. Because of that, the list is changing in size while you are iterating cause an index out of bounds. What you could do is create another list from the elements you don't want to remove.If you want to keep the same list and not create a new copy then you could use the slice operator.The itertools library also provides a tool to do this called filterfalsehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.filterfalse
