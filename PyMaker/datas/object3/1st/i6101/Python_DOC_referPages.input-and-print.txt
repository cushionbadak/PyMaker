Natural Text
I am trying to get a input to be typed after the "Choice: " but i also want to continue "*" around the whole text... Im  not sure how to do it even after trying multiple times with variations and research i couldn't dind an answer...so that it is printed with "Choice:(here will be the input) * "
Technically, you could just do this:All the text in the quotation marks do is that it just acts as text to be prompted, which is why this works.
I can do it this way. But I feel this is really a hack...
