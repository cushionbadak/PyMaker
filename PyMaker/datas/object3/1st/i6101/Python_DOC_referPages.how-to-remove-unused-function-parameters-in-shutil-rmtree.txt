In this question, an answer to how to remove read-only files is presented. It's super effective but requires having unused parameters. In this other question it was asked how to tell pylint that multiple non-adjacent parameters are unused without adding a specific comment (e.g., by using _). Many of the answers were approximately "ZOMG YOU'RE DESIGNING IT WRONG" so I promised I would put up an example where this is needed and out of my control. Here is that example.
