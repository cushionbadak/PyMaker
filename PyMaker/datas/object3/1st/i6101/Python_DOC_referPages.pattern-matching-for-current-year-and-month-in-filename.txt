When you write './.log.cur_year-cur_month' it is considered as a whole string. If you want to use the variables you have to concatenate them with the string and not putting them into quotes : './.log.' + cur_year + '-' + cur_month
there's no formatting, no string interpolation or any wildcard. It means that glob will look for exactly one file, which is literally './.log.cur_year-cur_month'. This file probably isn't in your folder.You could use:as the glob pattern. It should give you every file ending with .log.2017-11.
You need a glob pattern *.log.2017-11, this can be created as follows:
