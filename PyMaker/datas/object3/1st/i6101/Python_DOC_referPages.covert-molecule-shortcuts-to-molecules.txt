PLEASE no imports. Trying to grasp the fundamentals on python.say I want a simplified input of a molecule to give me the actual moleculeFor example:molec('C3H8O3') would give me 'CCCHHHHHHHHOOO'I'm sure I'm completely wrong, please point me in the right direction.EDIT: fixed the typos
In order to provide you with a working example, this is how I would have implemented that function. I found the building of res a little hard to read how you did it, so I split it up. The comments should explain what's happening, in case anything is unclear I'll be happy to elaborate.Beware this might not be the most Pythonic way of doing things.Running this results in:Edit: made it a little more Pythonic by iterating directly over the input string, without a loop var.
