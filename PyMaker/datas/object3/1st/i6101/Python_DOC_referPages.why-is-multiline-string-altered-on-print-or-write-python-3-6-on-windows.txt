Well, turns out properly stating a question often leads to the answer presenting itself:The reason for this behaviour is to be found with Python's universal newline (quoting from PEP 3116 on TextIOWrapper):On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If newline is '', no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated to the given string. (Note that the rules guiding translation are different for output than for input.)This means, when opening the file for writing, the newline parameter can be set to '' to achieve the desired output:
