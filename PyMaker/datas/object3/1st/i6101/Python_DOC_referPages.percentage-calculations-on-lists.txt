I have created a quiz system which tests the user on two different topics. They are can choose whih topics they would like to do and a difficulty they wish to complete it in. If they get the question correct they get a point if they don't it will display the correct answer.I am struggling to calculate the percentage based on the user's correct answers. For example, I have came up with "percent = score/100 x 100" which doesn't work. Any suggestions of calculating the percentage from these lists? 
The following seems to work. Note there are a couple of issues with your code snippet:The elif in the for loop needs to be an else.You need to initialize score to zero before entering the for loop.I've fixed these problems and added some code at the end illustrating how to compute the percentage of correct answers, as you asked how to do:ExplanationThis works because a percentage is "a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100" (from the Wikipedia article on percentage), so the expression calculates the ratio of right answers, score, to the total number of questions, len(questions). It then multiples that by 100 since percentages always express this ratio as a "fraction of 100". I also added a call to round()—which wasn't strictly necessary—to limit the number of digits after the decimal point to two, so long numbers like 6.666666666666666% would get converted to 6.67%. Technically this makes the final value computed slightly less accurate, but I doubt that matters here.
