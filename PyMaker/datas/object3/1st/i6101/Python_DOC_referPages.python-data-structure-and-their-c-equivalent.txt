I am looking for python equivalent to these data structure in C++sorted by keythe value to be a set andsorted by keyAfter reading this: https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDictI still didn't find anything suitable. 
There is no perfect mapping between c++ and python; python is dynamically typed.map<string,set<string>> is equivalent to (using OrderedDict to preserve the order of the keys, otherwise, dict suffice.): OrderedDict(), where the keys are strings, and the values are sets in which you insert stringsnote. The OrderedDict will not be ordered "by key", but by insertion  order of the keys (thanks to @timgeb in the comments)
In python do you have 4 data structures: lists, tuples, sets and dicts.You can create your own structure combining them:First:Second:And you can sort this data structures using the collections module.How can I sort a dictionary by key?
