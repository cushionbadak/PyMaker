I am currently trying modify the example given from the tutorial on this page That generates the GUI shown below. (You can download the example yourself on the second page of the tutorial).TutorialRunning this code with Python 2.7 with wxPython and Comtypes will open a GUI similar to that on the last page of the tutorial that gives the properties of a beam of light.Essentially, my goal is to extract the data from the buttons and either write it to a file or compile it as a list, but I have no idea what command to use to access that data.I know most people don't have access to the hardware I am using, but my question is more focused on the wxPython controls with buttons, and how to get that data.If it helps, here is the documentation of the OCX controls with the camera.DataRay OCX DocumentationLet me know if there is question I can answer. Thank you in advance for your time and help.
According to docs it should return a double value with the contents with e.g. b1.ctrl.GetParameter() for button b1.This of course requires to store the button objects, e.g. in the MyApp object.
