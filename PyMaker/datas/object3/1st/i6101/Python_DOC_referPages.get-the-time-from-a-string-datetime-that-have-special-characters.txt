Natural Text
I am trying to get the time from this string 2017-11-07 16:56:34.787-08 while using the code below:However my_string is slightly unique as it is appended with -08 that is appended behind, and at times it can be in 3-digits form eg. -123Instead of doing a roundabout method, using split('-') then remove the last element, is there a better method that I can get the time directly?
I would suggest using rsplit(), which will avoid having to join() the split() result (since the date contains other dashes).There is no way to use strptime() with characters to ignore, date string and format must match:If string [...] has excess data after parsing, ValueError is raised.
