Is there any way to compare lists that reference themselves in Python? You can see what I've tried below:I can understand that it cannot keep going into the list forever, but is there still a way to compare lists that have Ellipsis?[EDIT]:How a was created:How b was created:
Using all and a generator based on list comprehension we can achieve a compare function that works on every case I could figure out:ExamplesFor comprehensibility sake I'll write the lists as they are represented when printed instead that building them constantly with appends.If you'd like for me to test and add more cases I'll happily do it.
