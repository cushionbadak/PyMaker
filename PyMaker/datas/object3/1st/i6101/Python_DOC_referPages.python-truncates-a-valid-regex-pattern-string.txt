Honestly, trying to find a solution to this problem has been driving me insane, because every answer is either about using regex to truncate a string, or regex patterns having a max length (in which case, shouldn't it throw an error, not truncate the pattern string?)Anyways. I'm using a regex pattern supplied by my employer. The intent is to match only the host name in any url string (so like python.org from https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html). I've seen recommendations to use urllib.parse, but it doesn't strip out the hostname properly if there is a subdomain. Here is the regex string I was given to use:It's very long. If I place it into a regex checker such as https://pythex.org, it happily tells me that it works perfectly. However, if I use either a Python shell or the Python interpreter, compiling it and then returning the compiled pattern gives me this:Can someone tell me why it's being truncated (for my own knowledge), and suggest a better way to do things? The goal is to do something like this:
Can someone tell me why it's being truncated (for my own knowledge),  and suggest a better way to do things?Python has a regex pattern limit. See this and this. Questions where max limit is reached.suggest a better way to do things?Casimir's comment is right though, urllib.parse's urlparse would achieve your intended result in a much neater fashion.This answer is probably a combination of urlparse and however you determined what is an extension and what isn't. This may help: Get root domain.
