I am am trying to find out, if I can somehow find a matrix exponential in kind of closed form for the symbolic matrix:howeverseems not to work, "TypeError: cannot create mpf from a1"!Then I tried to get an estimate using the series expansion, but again:gives: "ValueError: Matrix det == 0; not invertible". I guess they try to get the power of the matrix by joran blocks and my structure is not good for that. How can I proceed anyway? A**2 can be calculated, but the sum over A**1 and A**0 not?!
The method expm belongs to mpmath library, used by SymPy for numerical calculations. It only works for numerical matrices.SymPy uses exp for matrix exponentiation. I recommend using it with simplify, as the output of exp  for your matrix is more complex than it could be. The simplified result, simplify(exp(A)),  isIf one wishes to compute a partial sum of the power series for exp(A), the way to do it is not because the above will attempt to raise A to symbolic power n before plugging in specific values. Raising a matrix to symbolic power is   implemented only for invertible A; it's hard to imagine what it should be for non-invertible ones. Instead, use Python's sum, giving it a zero matrix as initial value of the accumulator:
