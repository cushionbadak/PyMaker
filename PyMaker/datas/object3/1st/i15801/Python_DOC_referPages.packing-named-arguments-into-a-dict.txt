I know I can turn function arguments into a dictionary if the function takes in **kwargs.However, is the opposite true? Can I pack named arguments into a dictionary and return them? The hand-coded version looks like this:But it seems like there must be a better way. Note that i am trying to avoid using **kwargs in the function (named arguments work better for an IDE with code completion).
It sounds like you are looking for locals:Note however that this will return a dictionary of all names that are within the scope of foo:This shouldn't be a problem if your functions are like that given in your question.  If it is however, you can use inspect.getfullargspec and a dictionary comprehension to filter locals():
