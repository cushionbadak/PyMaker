I have my code: My mnuRead method allows the user to open a file of their choice. I want to use the string of this filepath in thebtnHDI method below. Setting my fn variable to global is giving me a syntax error. How do I use this filepath in other methods? 
global is only used for declaring one or more names as being global.  You need to move the assignment of fn = dialog.GetPath() to the line below:Also, it is a common practice to put global declarations at the start of a function:That way, they are easily visible.
