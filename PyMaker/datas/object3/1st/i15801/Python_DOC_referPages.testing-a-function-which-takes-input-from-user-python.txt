The function below takes password from user. I need to test this using Unit testing/(mocks).i am new to python, any hint would be helpfulThanks
Using mock.patch:
Generally speaking, you should always separate user input from program / business logic.This makes your code more maintainable:your core logic is separate from user input, so you can easily switch where that input comes from in the future (maybe you want to expose your program on a HTTP or a RPC server? Or get input from a GUI instead of a CLI)You can unit test without mocking. Mocking is very useful, but if you find that you're needing to mock more and more things as time goes on, it's a good indication that your code is not following separation of concerns. Take a look on dependency injectionIt's much easier to construct multiple test cases using a list of input values (but some people prefer to have multiple independent tests, check with your team/project)
