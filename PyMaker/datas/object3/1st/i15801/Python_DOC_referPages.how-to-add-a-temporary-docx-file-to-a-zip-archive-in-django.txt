here is my code for downloading a zip file, containing a .docx file, the only problem is, it also creates the .docx file, which i dont need. I wanted to use BytesIO for a docx file too, but i cant add it to the archive, the command zip_arch.write(BytesIOdocxfile) doesn't work. Is there another command to do this? Thank you!
Use the writestr() function to add some bytes to the archive:I've only done this with StringIO, but I don't see why BytesIO would't work just as well.
