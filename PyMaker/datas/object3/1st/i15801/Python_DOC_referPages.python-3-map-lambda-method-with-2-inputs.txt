I have a dictionary like the following in python 3: I want to convert all he values to int using map function, and I wrote something like this:but the python complains:TypeError: () missing 1 required positional argument: 'val'My question is how can I write a lambda function with two inputs (E.g. key and val)
ss.items() will give an iterable, which gives tuples on every iteration. In your lambda function, you have defined it to accept two parameters, but the tuple will be treated as a single argument. So there is no value to be passed to the second parameter.You can fix it like thisIf you are ignoring the keys anyway, simply use ss.values() like thisOtherwise, as suggested by Ashwini Chaudhary, using itertools.starmap,I would prefer the List comprehension wayIn Python 2.x, you could have done that like thisThis feature is called Tuple parameter unpacking. But this is removed in Python 3.x. Read more about it in PEP-3113
