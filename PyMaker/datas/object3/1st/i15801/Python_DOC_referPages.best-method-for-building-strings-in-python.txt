Does Python have a function to neatly build a string that looks like this:Without building a string like this:The function I'm looking for might be called a StringBuilder, and look something like this:
Normally you would be looking for str.join. It takes an argument of an iterable containing what you want to chain together and applies it to a separator:However, seeing as you know exactly what parts the string will be composed of, and not all of the parts are native strings, you are probably better of using format:
You have two options here:Use the string .join() method: " ".join(["This", "is", "a", "test"])Use the percent operator to replace parts of a string: "%s, %s!" % ("Hello", "world")
As EmployeeNumber is a int object , or may you have may int amount your variables you can use str function to convert them to string for refuse of TypeError !  
Python has two simple ways of constructing strings:string formatting as explained here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.htmland  the old style % operator https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting
Your question is about Python 2.7, but it is worth note that from Python 3.6 onward we can use f-strings:'hallo world'This f prefix, called a formatted string literal or f-string, is described in the documentation on lexical analysis
