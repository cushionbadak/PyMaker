I am calling the following script from another Python script:test.py logfileIt should run the test and save the result in the logfile.But for some reason the commands after unittest.main(testRunner=runner) are not being executed.I am not even sure if the file gets closed after writing to it.Is there another way to script it?!
unittest.main accepts an optional parameter exit. The default value for it is True; cause sys.exit to be called. Explicitly pass False to prevent that.
