There's a uuid.uuid1, uuid.uuid3, uuid.uuid4, and uuid.uuid5 but no uuid.uuid2.What happened to uuid2?
From What's new in Python 2.5 in which uuid module was added for the first time:(Version 2 UUIDs are not specified in RFC 4122 and are not  supported by this module.)
The UUID2 is a special UUID generated in combination with DCE Security server. It's rarely used nowadays. I guess the effort to implement that was in no relation to the request for such a functionality.
