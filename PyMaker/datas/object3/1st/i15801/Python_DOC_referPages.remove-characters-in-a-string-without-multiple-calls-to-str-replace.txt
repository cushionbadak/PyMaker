Natural Text
I'm doing this project for my class and I was just wondering if would it be possible if I could replace a list of vowels, Uppercase and Lowercase in just one line instead of how I have it. This is in Python. I would like it to be a bit more simple then writing this out completely Thanks
you can use re module
You can use str.translate and a dict comprehension:The dict comprehension is used to create a mapping for str.translate of what characters should be translated into what.  Mapping characters to None causes the method to remove them.Note that you could also use str.maketrans instead of the dict comprehension:
