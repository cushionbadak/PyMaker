Python newbie here. In learning about Python I have come across some very nice, succinct bits of code such as:I can see immediately that there are lots of possibilities for these kinds of expressions ("these kinds" meaning contained inside a []).I'm unsure of what this kind of expression is called, and so I am having trouble searching for information on how to use it. Would be great for some knowledgeable folks to direct me toward the part of the Python docs, or other resources, that discusses these, and perhaps provide some suggestions of how to effectively use them.
The code you posted is an expression, not a statement.It is commonly called a list comprehension and its basic structure is:where the if condition clause is optional.  The result is a new list object created from the items in iterable (possibly filtered by if condition):In addition, there are dictionary comprehensions:and set comprehensions:which each do the same thing as the list comprehension, but produce dictionaries or sets respectively.  Note however that you need Python 2.6 or greater to use these constructs.A final tool that you should be aware of is a generator expression:Similar to the list comprehension, it creates a generator object which produces its items lazily (one at a time as they are needed):
