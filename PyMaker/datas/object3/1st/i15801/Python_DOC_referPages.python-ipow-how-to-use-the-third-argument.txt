In the official python documentation in the Data model section, the __ipow__ method is defined as:Then, the documentation explains that These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic assignments (**= for __ipow__)But what is the syntax of **= that allows to use the modulo argument ?
The third argument is there just for symmetry with __pow__.The argument was included in the original 'add in-place operator equivalents' commit but there is no support to use it from Python code, other than calling the __ipow__ method directly.For example, the INPLACE_POWER opcode handling passes in None as the third argument:Most likely it is there to make implementing __ipow__ as an alias for __pow__ trivial even from C code.
