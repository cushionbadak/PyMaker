I'm trying to do something really simple:All I want to do, is access the key and value inside of a loop.But when using a for loop like so:I get the error:What am I doing wrong?
You need to call the items1 method of the dictionary:Otherwise, you will only iterate over the dictionary's keys.1In Python 2.x, you should call dict.iteritems instead to avoid creating an unnecessary list.
its dictionary you cant handle the way you are doing itdictionary has key,value pair, follow like thissome intro in dictionaryvowels.keys() will give you list of keysvowels.values() will give you list of valuesvowels.items() will give you (key,value) pair
