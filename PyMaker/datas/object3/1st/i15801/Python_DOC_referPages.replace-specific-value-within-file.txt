I'm trying to replace one value in a file with a values. Everything works fine but when I look at the file after its completed there no change at all. What can I use for this?Content of the file:I just want to change the tird value from 1 to 0.Here is the code as I have it:CanIi do this with str.replace?
You said in your question that you want to replace the third value with a 0.  If so, then str.replace is not what you want to use because it will replace every 1 with a 0.Instead, you can use the following:The string methods str.split and str.join are documented here.
