I have tried a few different thing here and I'm just at a lost.  Any help would be appreciated, here is my code.
In python 3.4 you can use statistics.mean and a list comp:Not sure what your if statement is doing but you could just create a list if nums when you get the input:
You could use a list comprehension to easily accomplish this:If you're not familiar with list comprehensions, this basically says: for every element a in your_list, add a to a new list if it's greater than the sum of the list divided by its length (i.e. its mean). Return the new list.For example, for the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], this returns [6, 7, 8, 9].
