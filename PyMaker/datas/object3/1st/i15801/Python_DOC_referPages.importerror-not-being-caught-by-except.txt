I am fairly new to python and playing around with the code when I noticed something interesting.File atomicPast.rb version 1:I would like to run this code from a python prompt ( not a Windows prompt ). This is how I do it:And I get the time printed. However, executing import atomicPast again won't work as it is already imported.  So I found about this:For me this is an unimport and it behaves like it because subsequent import atomicPast will get me my time ( as long as it is unimported again ). However, I want to be able to execute import atomicPast and not worry about whether it is already unimported. I decided to add the unimport bit to the end of my code to act as a cleanup.File atomicPast.rb version 2:In #1 I am  getting the name of the file without the extension ( atomicPast ) and passing it into the del sys.modules[...]. However, at this point atomicPast is not fully imported (I guess?) so trying to unimport it does not really make sense and throws an exception:import atomicPast    2014-10-31 10:42:32.368000    Traceback (most recent call last):      File "", line 1, in     ImportError: Loaded module atomicPast not found in sys.modulesInterestingly though, the unimport works and I can repeatedly execute import atomicPast.I thought I could just handle the exception and get rid of the error print.Within the file:This does NOT work. I still get the same exception.Analysing further: the above works as expected, importing cowabunga results in an ImportError and is caught.So I am stuck with the realization that some exceptions in some scenarios might not be catchable. 
Don't use import to execute the commands or call functions. The correct way is to write something like this:atomicPast.pythen from python console just do import atomicPast() and then time_now()Import command is for importing libraries not to execute code, it doesn't work as php import. Read herehttps://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.htmland also here https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.modulesMy advice is to play with sys.modules only if you know what are you doing.
