I don't know how to convert a matrix of 10x10 into four matrices of 5x5, for example:I need to convert into this:
You can use slicing and a list comprehension:sequence[:5] gets the first five items in sequence.  So, matrix[:5] gets the first five sublists in matrix and x[:5] gets the first five items in each of those sublists.  pprint.pprint is only used to format the output.
