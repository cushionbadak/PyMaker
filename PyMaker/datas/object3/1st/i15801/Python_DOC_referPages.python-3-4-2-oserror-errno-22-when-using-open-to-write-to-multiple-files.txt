hello im trying to write a game about having a village and keep it alive for 100 days but while writing the save system i came across an error this is my code:  the population one works but when it gets to name it gives me the error  
This is because "\n" is a new line.  Try "\\n" or r"\n" and this should solve your problem.  Also python accepts forward slashes "/" for paths on Windows, so it is probably safer to use those.Read about escape characters here.Also, it is generally bad form to name a variable "file" because file() is a built-in function in python.
