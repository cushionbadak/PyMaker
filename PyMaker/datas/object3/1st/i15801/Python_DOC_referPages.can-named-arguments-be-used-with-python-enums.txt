Example:Ref: https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#planetWhy do I want to do this?  If there are a few primitive types (int, bool) in the constructor list, it would be nice to used named arguments.
While you can't use named arguments the way you describe with enums, you can get a similar effect with a namedtuple mixin:... which to my mind is cleaner, since you don't have to write an __init__ method.Example use:Note that, as per the docs, "mix-in types must appear before Enum itself in the sequence of bases".
The accepted answer by @zero-piraeus can be slightly extended to allow default arguments as well.  This is very handy when you have a large enum with most entries having the same value for an element.Beware pickling will not work without the __getnewargs__.
If going beyond the namedtuple mix-in check out the aenum library1.  Besides having a few extra bells and whistles for Enum it also supports NamedConstant and a metaclass-based NamedTuple.Using aenum.Enum the above code could look like:and in use:1 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
For Python 3.6.1+ the typing.NamedTuple can be used, which also allows for setting default values, which leads to prettier code. The example by @shao.lo then looks like this:This also supports pickling. The typing.Any can be used if you don't want to specify the type.
