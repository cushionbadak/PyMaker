I have a simple subroutine written in Fortran. Just for testing reasons it is as simple as this:It compiles well with gfortran and with f2py. I compile it with f2py like so:If I go to python, I can import it and everything works ok:In django I have an app called just myapp. It has a view which looks like this:The error message is: AttrubuteError at /myapp/ test. PS. I'm a python and django newbee, so I guess I could make some "stupid" error. EDITNow, thanks to laike9m, I manage to call a fortran function, at least I do not have error any longer. But at the same time it seems as if the function does nothing. I mean this. I changed my fortran function a little bit, so that it now writes some stuff to a file. If I check it in pure python, I see that it works - a file is modified. But if I call it in django, it does not modify it. So, my codes now look like this:So, my question is how to check whether fortran module works or not?EDITThanks to laike9m and Vladimir, I finally did it. The problem was in the path to the file. I had to put the file right in the root folder of the project. 
If you import test, then it's test.test()If you from test import *, then it's test()See The import system
