I have a list of dictionaries:What is an elegant/short way to convert that into a [exercise x student] "mapping table" dictionary? Like so:You can assume the map contains at most one answer per exercise per student.
This generates the output you want:    
The straight forward way would be to gather them in a dictionary, like thisOutputFirst, if the item["exercise_id"] is not there in d, then a new dictionary will be set as the value and then in that dictionary, if item["student_id"] is not there, we set an empty list as the value and we append the current dictionary in that list.
