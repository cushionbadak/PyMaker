"(%d goals, $%d)" % (self.goals, self.penalties)Original question: String Formatting in Python 3Python3 Format String Syntax Ref: https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax
It has no special meaning. It just inserts a $ character:Sometimes a dollar is just a dollar.You also linked to the wrong documentation; the formatting syntax documented there only applies to the format() function and the str.format() method. You want to look at the printf-style String Formatting section instead.
