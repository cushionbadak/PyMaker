I am getting an error saying "dict_key object does not support indexing" at:I realised it used to work in python 2.7.x but not in python 3.How should i change this statement to make it work in python 3.
In Python 2.x, G.keys() returns a list, but Python 3.x returns a dict_keys object instead. The solution is to wrap G.keys() with call to list(), to convert it into the correct type:
In Python 3, the objects returned by keys, values, and items are dictionary view objects, which don't support indexing. Try, instead:This gets the dictionary view object for the dictionary's values, gets its iterator, grabs the first item from the iterator (the first value in the dictionary), and returns its length.Unlike other methods that create a new list of the keys or values, it should take approximately the same amount of time no matter the size of the dictionary.It works in both Python 2 and Python 3 (though to be efficient you'd need to use itervalues or viewvalues on Python 2).
