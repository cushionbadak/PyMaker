That's not what you want; you want to pass the function itself, and the arguments, to the Process object so that it can call them. That's exactly what the args parameter is for, as shown in most of the examples for multiprocessing. In your case:Or, you can always build a zero-argument function with lambda or partial, of course:As a side note, just creating, starting, and leaking a bunch of child processes is a bad idea. You probably want to store them all in a list, and then join them all (whether immediately, or later). For example:
You want the args keyword argument:
