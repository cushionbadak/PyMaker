This question already has an answer here:Python 2.7 __init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)                    2 answers                I don't quite understand if I need the self argument in the call to the super class method when inheriting, as I'm having trouble with repeated parameter definition errors when using it.The code is basically:With self in the super call, I get that:TypeError: method() got multiple values for keyword argument 'arg'`Without, it seems to work, but I don't know whether I will miss out on any side-effects that I need. Is it that self is in the super statement?
Read the docs!Here's how you should use super:You have to pass self to the super call, not the method call.Also, If you are using Python 3, it's even simpler:
Don't supply the self explicitly in the arguments of method, it is not needed.  In python 2 it is still needed where you have it in the arguments of super.  Note in python3 this would just be super().
