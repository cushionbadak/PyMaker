i spent last night trying to deal with strings in Python3.It would be very helpful from your part if you could help me to resolve this problem.So, suppose that i've a string like this : NB: the string a is a user input and may change every time.i want to manage the string to be like this : then i can replace "√" by "sqrt" using a.replace("√","sqrt").Any suggestions ? And sorry for my bad english :) Thanks
You could try re.sub():But if you need anything more sophisticated, you'll probably have to write a parser of some sort.
