Natural Text
I am trying read a txt file and put the data into a dictionary. My file looks something like this:Basically, a word and integer separated by a colon. I want to open and read the file, split each line where the colon is, and put the data into a dictionary like this:{'Alex':3, 'John':6, 'Sam':8}So far my code looks like this:How do I assign the name as the key and the integer as the value and put it into the dictionary?
Like this:str.split() returns a list of all the tokens in the string.  You can grab both of these values using the syntax I showed.You can then index it in the dictionary via the name variable, as you can see.Edit: As @MauroBaraldi in the comments points out, you don't need the line.strip() anymore as int() will do that work for you.
Your problem is with split() will return a list.  You can unpack the list like this:And then do:
Here are another approach to solve the problem.A good practice is open files using with. It closes automatically when get out of context.
You can use following code to get desired output. You can separate the words by using split . rstrip is used to remove the newline.output:
In the above code, line.strip() will remove the new line character, line.split(":") will split the string on ":", so you will get two value name and age that will be stored.   d[name]=age name is key and age will be the value stored
