In a Python list, how can I map all instances of one value to another value?For example, suppose I have this list:Now, perhaps I want to change all 1's to 'a', all 2's to 'b', and all 3's to 'c', to create another list:How can I do this mapping elegantly?
You should use a dictionary and a list comprehension:The dictionary serves as a translation table of what gets converted into what.
An alternative solution is to use the built-in function map which applies a function to a list:Here the dict.get method was applied to the list x and each number was exchanged for its corresponding letter in subs.
