Natural Text
I have a list, which contains the names of several text files, like this:How can I check AND return these elements of the list, that start with "order_" or any other given sequence?
Explanation:A list comprehension typically looks something like:In our case, we only want to select items from data, not manipulate them.  So, somefunction is not needed and the expression simplifies to:In our case, the condition is that the string starts with order_.  Python has a handy string method to test just for this.  It is called, naturally enough, startswith.  So, the final form is:If you ever have need for it, there is an analogous string method to test the end of a string.  For example:
You can use a list comprehension to filter the list with str.startswith:You can even make this an in-place operation by using [:]:Finally, it should be noted that str.startswith allows you to specify a tuple of prefixes to search for:
As a function:More generally:
Try this code:Samples and output
