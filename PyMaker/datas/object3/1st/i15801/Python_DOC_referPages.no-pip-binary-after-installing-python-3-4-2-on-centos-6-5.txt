After successful installation of Python I can't find the pip executable.The contents of the /usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pip are:How can I use it?
From https://docs.python.org/3.4/installing/index.htmlpip is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it  is included by default with the Python binary installers.Before python 3.4, pip was a 'seperate package' and was just called 'pip'.Because they have now included it with the python installer, and other versions of pip might have been previously installed on the system, the new pip that comes with python 3.4 was named pip3.4 to be able to easily distinguish between different pip versions.Also see https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html and http://bugs.python.org/issue20139
