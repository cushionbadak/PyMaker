I have three feature vectors as :Is there a python library that can help me compute the std dev of these ?
You can use numpy.std for population standard deviation:However, if you want to stick to built-in modules (and have Python v3.4+), you could check out the functions pstdev and stdev in the statistics module to calcultae population standard deviation and sample standard deviation respectively.
