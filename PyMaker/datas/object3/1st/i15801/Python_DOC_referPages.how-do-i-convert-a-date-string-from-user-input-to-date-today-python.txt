Python newbie, i need to convert a string from a user input in the format dd/mm/yyyy and check to see if it is in the future?, will i need to re order the format of the input for comparison and convert it to a date object.
Not sure what you're specifically wanting to do, this will take in dd/mm/yyyy and tell you if it's older than now.
