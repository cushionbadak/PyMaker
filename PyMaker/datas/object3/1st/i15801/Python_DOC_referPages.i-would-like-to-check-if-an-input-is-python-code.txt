Natural Text
I would like to check if an input is code before joining it to a larger variable to eventually execute, is there any way I can do this?For example:But I know of no command that works like .iscode()
You could try parsing the input with ast.parse:The function will raise a SyntaxError if the string is non-parseable (contains invalid Python code).
