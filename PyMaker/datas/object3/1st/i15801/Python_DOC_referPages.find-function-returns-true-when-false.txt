Natural Text
I am loading the source code of a web page as a string and then want to search that string for a specific phrase.This is what I have so far:I want to see if there have been any incidents today - if there haven't, there is no need to continue. I have waited until I know the number of incidents is greater than 0 (by going to the site and manually monitoring) but I still get it found; what am I doing wrong?Or is there a way of grabbing that phrase and seeing what the number is in the brackets? This might be useful, as I will set up a loop later based on that number.
string.find() returns -1 on failure, not false.
