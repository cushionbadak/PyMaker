In the below random array:Could you please tell me how to remove element at a specific position. For example, how would I remove a[1][3]?I understand list.pop is used for only list type DS here.
Simple, just pop on the list item.
You should use del to remove an item at a specific index:list.pop should only be used when you need to save the value you just removed.
In this case, a[1].remove(9)removes a[1][3]link to python list document
