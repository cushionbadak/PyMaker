Natural Text
So I have opened my file and split each line into a list using the readlines() module but I am trying to get each source IP, src port, dest IP and dest port out of the readlines(). Basically what I am being asked to do is: "open the provided dump file and split out each line for the src and dest IPs as well as the src and dest ports". Furthermore, "Create a dictionary called Hosts; the keys of hosts will be the IPs parsed from the file (both src and dest). The value for each key will be a two element list where the first item will be how many times an IP is the source and the seconds is how many times an IP is the destination". Here is part of parsed file...FYI the file is formatted like this:IP (source.Sourceport) > (dest.Destport)Here is what I have so far:UPDATENow I am looking for the best way to split a str (one line) at one char to another char. So say split it at a ":" to the next ":".
I think that you need to look at the string's split methodgives:
