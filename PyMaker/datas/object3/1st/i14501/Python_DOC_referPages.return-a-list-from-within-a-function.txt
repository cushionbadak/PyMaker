I'm trying to call a list I created within a function in another function, but I get the error that the list is not defined. When I tried to do Menu = The_menu(), it runs the while loop within the function. The problem occurs when I call Restaurant_strHere's the traceback,
The problem is that you're calling Dishlist_display(Menu) from inside Restaurant_str, but you don't have a variable named Menu in that function.The fact that you happen to have a local variable of that name in another function doesn't do you any good. Once that other function returned, that variable disappeared.What you need to do is either take the value returned from The_menu and pass it along the chain from one function to the next, or stash it somewhere that everyone who needs it can find it.If you wrote this in normal OO style, the right thing to do would be to stash it in an attribute of the Restaurant instance that these functions would all be members of. If you really want to write in (non-OCa)ML fake-OO style ported clumsily to Python as you seem to be doing, the right thing to do is stash it in a nonlocal variable in the closure that represents the object. If you want a pure functional style, then the right thing to do is to pass it alongÂ from function to function. But you have to do something to get the value returned by The_menu into something that Restaurant_str can access.
Looks like you're trying to reference an unknown variable  "Menu"  instead of calling the function that builds the menu.should readAlternatively, you can create the variable you're trying to reference by using Menu = The_menu()
