How do I print a greeting message when I initialize a python interpreter?  For example, if I were to initialize a python interpreter with custom pre-defined variables, how might I advertise those variables to the user?
There is an environment variable called PYTHONSTARTUP that describes a path to a Python file to be executed on the invocation of Python shell. The script can contain normal Python code that is executed on invocation, therefore variables, prints or whatever else you want. It can be set in your ~/.bashrcand then creating the file itselfThe output when starting python then looks somewhat like thisBecause it is a normal Python file, setting the variables and showing them/announcing availability can be done like this:Output when invoking a Python repl and printing variable foo:iPython acts different in a sense that it does not execute your PYTHONSTARTUP file, but has it's own mechanism called profiles. Default profile can be modified in ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/, where each *.py and *.ipy file is executed (see ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/README).
You can embed a console from a script using the built-in console or IPython's console.If you want to use Python's built-in console, pass the banner argument.  Assuming you have a dictionary of variables to inject:With IPython's console, pass banner1.
