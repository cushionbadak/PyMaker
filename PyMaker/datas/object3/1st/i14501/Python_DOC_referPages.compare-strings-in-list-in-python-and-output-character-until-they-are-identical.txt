How can I compare all strings in a list e.g:And output until which character they are identical:In the example above it would be: And output the most similar strings.I tried with collections.Counter but that did not work. 
You're trying to go character by character in the two strings in lockstep. This is a job for zip:Or, if you prefer "…as long as they are…" is a job for takewhile:If you have a list of these strings, and you want to compare every string to every other string:First, you turn the above code into a function. I'll do it with the itertools version, but you can do it with the other just as easily:Now, for every string, you compare it to all the rest of the strings. There's an easy way to do it with combinations:But if you don't understand that, you can write it as a nested loop. The only tricky part is what "the rest of the strings" means. You can't loop over all the strings in both the outer and inner loops, or you'll compare each pair of strings twice (once in each order), and compare each string to itself. So it has to mean "all the strings after the current one". Like this:
I think this code will solve your problem.
