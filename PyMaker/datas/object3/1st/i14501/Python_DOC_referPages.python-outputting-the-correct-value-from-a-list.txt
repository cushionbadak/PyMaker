I have a csv file that I've turned into a list() so that I can iterate over it to do some simple transformations with the data, however when I try to get the output I only get the key for each of the items (when what I need are the values).The code I'm using right now is as follows (slightly truncated for clarity):If I do a simple print lines[i] I get something like:but the output of print ','.join(outline) just gives me the keys for the [k for k in lines[i] if k is not ''] and the correct output for [cx,uf,rf,pc] (like so):adjusted timestamp,fishType,playerID,timestamp,targetID,lights,event,1,1,2,1What I'm wondering is how I get it to give the values (and not the key) for the [k for k in lines[i] if k is not '']
Lines is a list of dicts.  If you iterate over a dict, you get its keys.  To get the values instead, use dict.values().  So you need to change this line:to
You can use the keys and values builtins:and These will iterate over the dictionary's keys and values. Check out the dictionary documentation here.
