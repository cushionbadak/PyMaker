I have n lists of different lengths of wich I want to create all possible permutations. so e.g. if a=[1,2] and b=[3,4,5] then I would love to obtain res=[[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]I've been trying to achieve this using a recursive function, which turned out to be neither very efficient nor very pythonic. How would an experienced python programmer tackle the problem?
It's called the Cartesian product of two sequences.This is already available in Python as a library function: itertools.product.Example:
you can do this by product function in itertools,
itertools is definitely the way to go but if you don't want to go the easy route.....
