Natural Text
I have the following letters:What I would like is to write a generator function that will create strings that can be formed by taking a combination of any of the letters, preferably in some deterministic order like from smallest to biggest.So for example if I were to run the generator 20 times I would getHow would I write this generator?
Use the combinations functions from the itertools library. There's both combinations with replacement and without replacementhttps://docs.python.org/3.4/library/itertools.html
Generator function:Usage:Output:A self-made alternative without using itertools:Golf-version (admittedly starts with the empty string):
Use itertools.product():['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ad', 'ae', 'ba', 'bb', 'bc', 'bd', 'be', 'ca', 'cb', 'cc', 'cd', 'ce', 'da', 'db', 'dc', 'dd', 'de', 'ea', 'eb', 'ec', 'ed', 'ee']
I use a recursive generator function (without itertools) you get
