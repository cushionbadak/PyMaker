Is there a way in python 3 to append, to a list, both a string and a number as a single entry.For example if I had a list of class names, and wanted to be able to sort the list alphabetically, I would use:This would produce something like the following once names were appended:But if I wanted to be able to assign a score for a test such to produce:Would this be possible? Can I do it using lists or do I have to use other more complicated syntax?
You can insert a tuple containing the elements you want.then a[0][0] will be equal to "Test", a[0][1][0] will be 12 and a[0][1][1] will be 15.To my mind, you don't need that 12/15 business.
There is a fractions library therefore you can structure your data like so:As it has been pointed out you can also use a named tuple: 
You can use a tuple:Or you could store the numerator and the denominator separately:You could also fore go the list and just use a dict:EDIT:After consideration of my discussion in the comments with @TigerhawkT3.  Though based on an assumption, I felt he had a good point.If your denominator is a constant across all your data it would be better to store it once in some variable and only score the number of questions answered correctly by each student:or as a dict
