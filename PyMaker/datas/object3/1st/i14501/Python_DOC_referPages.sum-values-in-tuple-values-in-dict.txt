I have a dictionary data that looks like that with sample values:I get this from collections.defaultdict(list) because my keys have to be lists.My goal is to get a new dictionary that will contain the sum values for every tuple with respect to their position in the tuple.By runningI get However, I don't know in advance how many items will be in every tuple, so using the sum(tup[0] for tup in v) with hard-coded indices is not an option. I know, however, how many integers will be in the tuple. This value is an integer and I get this along with the data dict. All tuples are always of the same length (in this example, of length 2).How do I tell Python that I want the out dict to contain tuple of the size that matches the length I have to use?
I think you want the built-in zip function:
