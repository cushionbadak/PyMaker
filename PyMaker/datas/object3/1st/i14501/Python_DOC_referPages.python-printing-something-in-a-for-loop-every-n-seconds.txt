I have a for loop that iterates over a number and performs some simple calculations.  I am trying to figure out how to print out ( or log to file) the current value of 'val' every .5 to 1 second with out having to pause or sleep during the loop.  Here is a super simple example
Just use time.time to capture the time before starting, then check how long it's been after you calculate val2:
You can use time.time():
You can achieve this using Threads.Here's a documentation on how to utilize Threads : https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html ( If you're using Python2.7 then change the 3 in the url to a 2 )Here's a link which is similar to what you want and should also point you in the right direction : Python threading.timer - repeat function every 'n' secondsBasically you have to create a Thread that will only execute ever n number of seconds. On each iteration it will print the value. The above link should suffice for that. Good luck !
