Natural Text
I'm doing a search for hierarchical dictionary, and I have to put the content into a variable named "content":But the "content" should be an exceprt from the text, not the full content, i.e. several words from behind and several words in front of the searching phrase.E.g.:phrase: "looking for"content: ... she was looking for him...How to crop the content in a function in order to achieve this result?Thank you!
Your problem is that all you know is that s in contentâ€”in other words, you know the string is in there somewhere, but you need to know where to get the context.Just use content.find(s) instead, and you'll have that:Now, to find "several words behind", just search backward for several word separators from pos, and to find "a couple words ahead", search forward for several word separators from pos + len(s).Of course you have to define what "several" means, and what constitutes a word separator, but you should be able to work out the rest from here. (Make sure you see rfind along with find in the docs, and look at all of the parameters to both methods, and don't forget to handle the edge case where s is found right near the start or end of content.)One last side note: Are you sure that s in content (and, equivalently, content.find(s)) is really what you want? For example, if I search for "sing out", should that be found in "The star is losing outer layers"?
