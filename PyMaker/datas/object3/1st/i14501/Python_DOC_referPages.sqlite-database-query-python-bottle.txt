I'm trying to make a function where that returns the name of the logged in user if one can be identified or None if not. i want to do this by finding the session id from the cookie in the Bottle request if present, and using it to look up the user in the sessions table.My code so far:The table in database:When i use the current code in my function i get a unit test error:
See the cursor.fetchall documentation:Fetches all (remaining) rows of a query result, returning a list. Note that the cursorâ€™s arraysize attribute can affect the performance of this operation. An empty list is returned when no rows are available.Since an empty list in Python is a false-y expression this normally works out well - when not doing explicit compares with False/None. Always returning a list also makes code that iterates the result set (or checks the length) easier because no special case for None has to be done.Use the aptly named fetchone to get a single result record, or None.
