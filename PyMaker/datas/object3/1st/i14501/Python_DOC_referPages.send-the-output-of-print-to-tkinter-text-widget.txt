Natural Text
I wrote a python 3.4.2 programme to get a user input from python IDLE, perform some processing on the input and display a few statements in the python IDLE using print().Now I am in the process of converting this to use a GUI using tkinter. This is the simple tkinter code I wrote for the GUI.So far I was able to get the user input through the Entry widget named inputentry in the GUI and send it to a variable in the original code using inputval.get(). Then it performs the processing on the input and shows the outputs of print() statement in the python IDLE.My question is how can I modify the programme to send all those print() statements to the Text widget named outputtext and display them in the GUI?I would be glad if you could show me how to do this without using classes as I am a beginner in python 
3 easy steps:1) Get the content of your variable and put it to a variable that I'm gonna name varContent; 2) Clear your text widget, that is, if the name of your text widget is text, then run text.delete(0, END); 3) Insert the string you've got in your variable varContent into your text text widget, that is, do text.insert(END, varContent).I would do my code like this:
If you're using Python 3.4+ to run the program too, you can use the contextlib.redirect_stdout to capture the print output for a duration of a few statements into a file, or even a string:Otherwise a better though a bit more arduous way is to make a StringIO file and print to it, so you'd have
