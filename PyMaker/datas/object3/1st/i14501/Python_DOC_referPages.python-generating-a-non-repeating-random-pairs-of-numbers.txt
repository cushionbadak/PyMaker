I'm trying to generate random pairs of numbers to place objects at random locations in a grid. I've tried looking for answers but I haven't found one that works for what I need. I don't want the pair to repeat but the objects can still be placed in the same row or column. Also the size of the grid and the number of objects is inputted by the user
Python's sets are meant to do just what you need: membership testing is very fast, with them (constant time):Now, I like @abarnert's answer too: it is a bit wasteful, as he indicates, but it is very legible.
One way to think about this is: there are X*Y possible positions (specifically board_size * board_size, in your case), and you want to pick N (self.bomb_num) random samples from those positions, without repetition.The sample function in the random module does this perfectly:Creating that list is a little wastefulâ€”but given that board_size is probably something small, like 30, a temporary list of 900 elements is not worth worrying about.
