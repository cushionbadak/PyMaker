Natural Text
I have a file I need to remove a section of text following a string pattern match.text from file:How do I search for domain2, then delete that line plus the next 7 lines below it?There will be many domains.
You can write to a NamedTemporaryFile, skipping 7 lines every time  "domain2.com" is in the line with itertool.islice, using shutil.move to replace the original file at the end: Output:delete=False means the file won't be deleted, if the process is interrupted then nothing will be written to the original, finally we use move(temp.name,"test.txt") to overwrite the original.
If you know it will always be 7 line the following regex selects them:I don't know how to do that in python, but I think it will be easy to figure out if you know python.

If you want to use a regex on a larger file, use mmap.Then copy the temp file onto your original. If your file has the absolute pattern of 7 lines after the target -- Padraic Cunningham's solution is better. If you have variable line blocks or something better described with a regex, this approach is handy.    For what you are working on, try:
