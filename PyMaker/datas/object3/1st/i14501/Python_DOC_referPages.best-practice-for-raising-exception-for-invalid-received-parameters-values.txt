Each time I write a function which has (one ore more) parameters, the first thing I do in the function body is to check that the received value of each parameter is valid. For example:Why do I do this? Because in this way, if exception is received, the developer which debugs, can know immediately in which function the problems happens, what are expected value/s and what is the actual value. This error messages makes debugging this kind of problems much more easier.As said earlier, If there have been more parameters,I will do the above code for EACH parameter. This makes my function body to me much bigger in terms of number of lines of code. Is there a more pythonic way to print all of the above details in case there is an exception due to invalid parameter value received (function name, parameter name, expected values, actual values?I can write a function which receives 4 parameters (function name, parameter name, expected value/s, actual value), and then use it each time I would like to raise this kind of exception (this will cause each exception of this sort to be just one line of code instead of several ones)I will appreciate any help here. Thanks in advance. 
Note that checking the types of your arguments is against duck-typing, which is part of the python philosophy. If you want another developer to be able to debug your code more easily, you should use an assertion:for more about assertions look here.Note that assertions will be remove if you optimive your code with the -O flag.
