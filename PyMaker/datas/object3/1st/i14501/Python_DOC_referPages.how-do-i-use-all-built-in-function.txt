I am attempting to use all() but it is not working for me:I am trying to check if all the names begin with "R", and even though I added "Paul" to names, all() still returns True. How do I fix this so that all() returns False until "Paul" is removed?
You misunderstand how all works.  From the docs:all(iterable)Return True if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the  iterable is empty).In your code, you are first collecting all names that start with R into a list and then passing this list to all.  Doing this will always return True because non-empty strings evaluate to True.Instead, you should write:This will pass an iterable of booleans to all.  If all of them are True, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.As an added bonus, the result will now be computed lazily because we used a generator expression instead of a list comprehension.  With the list comprehension, the code needed to test all strings before determining a result.  The new code however will only check as many as necessary.

The reason why you were getting wrong result was because you are already creating a new list using list comprehension by applying the desired condition, So if we do a little breakdown then:So the correct way may be:
