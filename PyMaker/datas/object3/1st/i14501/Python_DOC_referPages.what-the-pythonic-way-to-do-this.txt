I want to write some shorthand expression in while(like c),but it wouldn't work in python.     
You can't do this in Python. Assignments are statements in Python, not expressions.So, what can you do instead? The most pythonic is probably using the iter function:The docs for this are a little confusing to a novice:â€¦ If the second argument, sentinel, is given, then object must be a callable object. The iterator created in this case will call object with no arguments for each call to its __next__() method; if the value returned is equal to sentinel, StopIteration will be raised, otherwise the value will be returned.That's great if you already understand how iterators and for loops work under the covers, but if you don't, the example below may be more helpful:One useful application of the second form of iter() is to read lines of a file until a certain line is reached. The following example reads a file until the readline() method returns an empty string:That makes it a lot clearer: for line in iter(fp.readline, ''): calls fp.readline() over and over until it gets a ''. Just like you want to do calling TokenBuffer.peek() over and over until it gets a sentinel.
