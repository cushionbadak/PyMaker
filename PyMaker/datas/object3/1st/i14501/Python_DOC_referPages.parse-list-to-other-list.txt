I have a list in python that looks like so:It has a lot of data that I do not need.  All I need is the last two numbers in each entry.  What would be the best way to traverse this list and put all the data that I need into another list of lists where each pair is its own list?
You could go through the list items and split the items after the first one, and get the last two items from the list and append it to a new ListOutput
That is: for each x in the original list (less the first entry, which looks like a header), take the last 2 items you get after splitting it by commas, and strip each of those 2 items (to remove extra whitespace, like the trailing \n).
