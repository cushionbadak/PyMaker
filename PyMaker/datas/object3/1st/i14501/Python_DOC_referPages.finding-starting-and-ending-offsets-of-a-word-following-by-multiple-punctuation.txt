But why? What's so special about a word following by multiple punctuations that makes re search not working?? I don't understand it :(
? is a special character in regex, meaning "optionally match the preceding rule".  In this case, it's optionally matching "n", which is fine, but then expects the next character to be "!".Instead, escape the "?" in the regex.  Now it matches "?" rather than acting as a special character.The docs on the re module explain this.
Since you don't appear to know regular expressions anyway and thus are unlikely to really want/need them, may I suggest this?But what I really want to know is why you want start and end index. If you for example want them in order to replace that substring, there's a much better way:
If you have meta characters that you want to match literally, you should use re.escape to help you escape them by prepending a \ to all non-alphanumerics:This allows you to escape metacharacters in unknowns:There is a great discussion about the backslash plague on the Python 3.4 re HOWTOBased on comments:
