A value like 0x0F or 0x05 has to be given to a function as a string without the 0x at the beginning so 0F or 05.If I use str(hex(0x0F))[2:4] I only get f. It is crucial that the missing 0 is still present in my application.How can i do that?
You'd use str.format:In this context {:02X} is equivalent to {0:02X}. Preceding the colon with 0 tells Python to apply this to the first argument of str.format (0x0F in this example). 02 sets the minimum field width to 2 and Preceding the width field by a zero ('0') character enables sign-aware  zero-padding for numeric typesX is one of the available integer presentation types:Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper- case letters  for the digits above 9.Both quotes are from Format Specification Mini-Language.
