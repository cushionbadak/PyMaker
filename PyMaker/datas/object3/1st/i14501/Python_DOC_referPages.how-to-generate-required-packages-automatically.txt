I gave my friends a project. and I use lots of 3rd part packages among the scripts.How could I generate all the necessary packages automatically.Otherwise, my friend should run my script and catch the exception and install the missing package, again and again.By the way, is it possible to install all the necessary packages at once ?
Thatâ€™s what requirement files in pip are for:"Requirements files" are files containing a list of items to be installed using pip installBasically they document your dependencies, so when you do a pip install later, pip will get all the required dependencies to run your script.
