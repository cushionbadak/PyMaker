I'm still getting to grips with dictionaries in Python.  Is it possible to reference the Key in a dict of dicts by using either a regex or a startswith function?I have a dict of dicts in the following format and I am trying to do a general search for 'AreaOfInterest1','AreaOfInterest2','AreaOfInterest3' etc.  I make it general as I then refer the associated list value[0] to perform actions.My dict of dicts would look something like...The kind of functionality I am looking for is either to use startswith (like below) or otherwise try regex..Thanks.
No, dict does not support lookups based on functions of the key or partial matches of the key. dict does support iteration, so you can do your own lookup, at a O(n) cost. (dict lookup is ordinarily O(1)).
Just keep looping:So your code would look like
