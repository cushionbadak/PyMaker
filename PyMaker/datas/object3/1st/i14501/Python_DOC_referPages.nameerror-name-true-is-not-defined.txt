I have the following code and get the following error message when trying to run it:I am trying to make the Raspberry Pi run a HTML script when it receives input on port 17:
Pythonâ€™s boolean constants are capitalized: True and False with upper case T and F respectively.The lower-case variants are just valid free names for variables, so you could use them for whatever you want, e.g. true = False (not recommended ;P).
You haven't defined a variable true. Maybe you meant the built-in boolean value True?
while True:# but seems like inifite loop
