What is the best to use between integers and arrays when you have a lot of data to process ?I wrote a small script :And I got :With integers : 2.107954978942871 seconds.With array : 2.6036949157714844 seconds.So it seems that using a lot of integers is more fast but in the example, only 2 integers were created. How to manage this problem when we have 10 million integers ?
Python is not very efficient because it is a dynamic type language. In static type languages such as C, the compiler knows exactly that a variable is of type integer. But in case of python, the variables store in python objects. This is very convenient but not very efficient in term of memory and speed. I strongly recommend you to read the article Why Python is Slow: Looking Under the Hood.If you are dealing with large numbers of data your best bet is NumPy or SciPy that are built using C and are available as a Python package.
