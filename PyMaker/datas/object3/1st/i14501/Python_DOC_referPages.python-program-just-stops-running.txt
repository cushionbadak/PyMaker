I'm having a problem with my program, where it shows no error but suddenly stops running, pauses for a minute, then stops.For example, the program stops after producing:There is no error message produced whatsoever.The goal of the code is to print out a list of data, containing 7 pieces of information (such as Zip Code, State) about the specific ID Number.If the ID Number entered is not in my list of ID numbers (AKA new_match_list), then the "chunks" will remain blank (hence, len(chunks) will be 0), and the user will be forced to re-enter the ID number until it matches the one on my (new_match_list).If the ID number does match, it should fill out (chunks) and print out the specific part ([x]) of (chunks) related to the ID.What can I do to fix this error?Edit: I've tried different ways to fix this error, such as substituting:withbut nothing has worked. As always the program just stops without giving me an error
Your question is a little unclear, but I suspect that when control reaches print (chunks[x]) you want x to have the value it had when new_match_list[x] == ID_Input was True. If so, you need to put a break statement as the last line of that if block, i.e., after the chunks=[new_ID_info_list... line. And, as Paul Cornelius mentioned, you need to change the variable in that list comprehension so that x doesn't get clobbered.However, there's a better way to find the first matching entry in a list: use its .index() method. You will need to put this inside a try: ... except block; alternatively, use the in operator to test that the ID is in the list before attempting to fetch its index.
