Other than by subclassing (from list for example) how do I make a python object implicitly convertable to ndarray?Example:Error:It's calling array(arg) but that yields an array like [arg,], it's shape==() so dot tries to multiply the A instances together.It's ok (in fact, expected) that the conversion to ndarray will require copying the data.
__len__ seems to be the key feature: just adding a made the class work in numpy.dot.
