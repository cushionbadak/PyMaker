How can I use a query element tree findall('Email') given the following xml?I have a feeling it has to do with the namespace but I'm not sure. I looked at the docs and had no luck. 
You should read the docs more closely, in particular the section on Parsing XML with Namespaces, which includes an example that is almost exactly what you want.But even without the docs, the answer is actually contained in your example output.  When you printed the root element of your document......you can see that it printed the root element name (DocuSignEnvelopeInformation) with a namespace prefix ({http://www.docusign.net/API/3.0}).  You can use this same prefix as part of your argument to findall:But this by itself won't work, since this would only find Email elements that are immediate children of the root element.  You need to provide an ElementPath expression to cause findall to perform a search of the entire document.  This works:You can also perform a similar search using XPath and namespace prefixes, like this:This lets you use XML-like namespace: prefixes instead of the LXML namespace syntax.
