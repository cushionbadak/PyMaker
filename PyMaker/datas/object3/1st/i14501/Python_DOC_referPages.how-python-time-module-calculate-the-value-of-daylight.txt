OS : Windows 7, 8.0 or 8.1One of the Computer in Eastern TimeZone has set a daylight option.It's time.daylight value shown to me is 69. Yes, daylight is defined, time.localtime().tm_dst is returning correct to 1.When I check time.daylight python docs, it only mentioned that,time.daylight   Nonzero if a DST timezone is defined.I have tried changing time with almost every time zone in the list. But always I got value of time.daylight to 1 only.Is there any way to produce time.daylight value to greater than 1 ?Any help would be appreciated ?
Not sure what are you looking for. As the docs say time.daylight just indicates whether the system has some DST timezone configured or not, so it’s just a “yes”/“no” value. What do you expect to it to be if it is greater than 1?Are you looking for time.altzone which contains the offset of DST in case one is defined?
It is strange that it uses an integer and not just a True / False boolean, but it does appear to just be a flag. Check help(time) and you'll see:I don't know where the 69 is coming from, but I think you should just take it to mean non-zero. As kirelagin suggests, you should us time.altzone to find the DST offset.Because you're only supposed to use time.altzone if time.daylight is nonzero, you could use one of the following to get the DST offset in hours:
