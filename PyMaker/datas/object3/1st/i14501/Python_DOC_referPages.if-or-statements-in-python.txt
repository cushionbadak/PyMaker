This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                output is yeshowever if I put in output is nothingsame with:why?I thought or was supposed to be either one?but if individually inputed both are false but with or it becomes true?or that's the wrong way to write an if or statement?should it be written like this?
is equivalent toWhat you want is:The first test is successful, because "long"  or "is" in wow returns "long" and the string "long" is truthy*. The following tests fail, because wow is a list with 1 string, and the in operator tests for list containment here, instead of string containment.*the or "is" in wow part would not get tested here, because the if short-circuits. Has nothing to do with your problem though
OK, we have several different problems here.That means this:So yes, you need to change it to this:But that still doesn't do what you want, because wow is a list.  You're asking whether "long" is an element of that list.  But "long" isn't an element of the list.  The only element of the list is the string "wowza this is a really long string wows", which is not the same as "long".  You want to check against the string itself, not the list.
How about you send your condition to the interactive prompt (run python or ipython if you have it) to see what it returns?You probably want to test the string, not a single item list:
