I have a string likeI also have val=1 for example. Is there a clean way to split the foo/bar/baz into a multi-dimensional dict with the last item in the dict to equal 1. So it would look like
You can use reduce and reversed functions, like thisIf you are using Python 3.x, then you need to import reduce from functoolsHere, the last argument to reduce is the starting value. It will take values one by one from the iterable passed, call the function with the result and the current value and then the next time onwards, the last result will be the first argument and the current value as the second argument. When the iterable is exhausted, it will return the result.So, the execution would have gone, step-by-step, as followingLet's say func is the lambda function and it gets repeatedly called like this
If this needs to be extended to create something like a directory tree, you might want a solution based on defaultdict:Demo:
