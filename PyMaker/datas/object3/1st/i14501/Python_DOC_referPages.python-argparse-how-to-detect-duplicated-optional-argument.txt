I'm using argparse with optional parameter, but I want to avoid having something like this : script.py -a 1 -b -a 2Here we have twice the optional parameter 'a', and only the second parameter is returned. I want either to get both values or get an error message.How should I define the argument ?[Edit]This is the code:
append action will collect the values from repeated use in a listproducing an args namespace like:After parsing you can check args.alpha, and accept or complain about the number of values.  parser.error('repeated -a') can be used to issue an argparse style error message.You could implement similar functionality in a custom Action class, but that requires understanding the basic structure and operation of such a class.  I can't think anything that can be done in an Action that can't just as well be done in the appended list after.https://stackoverflow.com/a/23032953/901925 is an answer with a no-repeats custom Action.Why are you using nargs='?' with flagged arguments like this?  Without a const parameter this is nearly useless (see the nargs=? section in the docs).Another similar SO: Python argparse with nargs behaviour incorrect
