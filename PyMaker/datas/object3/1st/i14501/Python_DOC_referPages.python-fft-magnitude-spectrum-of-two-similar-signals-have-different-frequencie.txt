My goal is to compare the FFT of similar signals. For some reason, when I take the magnitude spectrum of two signals of the same length, the frequencies are different... I can't do a simple side by side comparison of two signals because of this. Anyone have any tips on how to get the same FFT on the signals?So for instance Signal1 provides the following: Update: Here's the two signals plotted from 0-400HzHere's my code:The logic behind the code is to import the signal, find where the sound starts, chop the signal to be 1 second in length, perform FFT on signal for comparison.xsig is the amplitude and ysig is the Frequencies. Here's links to the .wav files if you're interested in trying it out yourself:.wav1.wav2Note: originally i uploaded the wrong .wav1 file... the correct one is now up.
I'm guessing your signals aren't actually the same length. If you're thresholding them independently, your thresh_start value won't be the same, so: will give you different-length arrays for the two files. You can either calculate the threshold value separately and then provide that number to this module as a constant, or make your onesec array be the same length from the start of each threshold value:(Remember that slice notations is [start:stop], not [start:length])
