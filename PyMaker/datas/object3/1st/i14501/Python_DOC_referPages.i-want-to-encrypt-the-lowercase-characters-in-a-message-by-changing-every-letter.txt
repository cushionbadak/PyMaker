Natural Text
If there is more than one uppercase letter, it will output the uppercase letters at the front of the encrypted message.For example: 'Hello World' becomes 'HWfmmp psme'. However, the output should have been 'Hfmmp Xpsme'
translate can help you to do this kind of conversion.The result is Hfmmp Wpsme.It's easy to change the encrypt function to work with a flexible offset.This will print Hgnnq Wqtnf and Hdkkn Wnqkc.
