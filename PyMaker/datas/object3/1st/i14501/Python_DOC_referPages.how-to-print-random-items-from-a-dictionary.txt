Natural Text
everyone. I'm trying to complete a basic assignment. The program should allow a user to type in a phrase. If the phrase contains the word "happy" or "sad", that word should then be randomly replaced by a synonym (stored in a dictionary). The new phrase should then be printed out. What am I doing wrong? Every time I try to run it, the program crashes. This is the error I get: Here is what I have so far:
The reason for your error is that phrase is a string, and strings are immutable. On top of that, strings are sequences, not mappings; you can index them or slice them (e.g., happy_index = phrase.find("happy"); phrase[happy_index:happy_index+len("happy")]), but you can't use them like dictionaries.If you want to create a new string, replacing the substring happy with another word, use the replace method.And there's no reason to check first; if happy isn't found, replace wil do nothing.So:While we're at it, instead of explicitly looking up each key, you may want to loop over the dictionary and apply all the synonyms:Finally, notice that this code will replace all instances of happy with the same replacement. Which I think your intended code was also trying to do. If you want to replace each of them with a separately randomly-chosen synonym, that's a bit more complicated. You could loop over phrase.find("happy", offset) until it returns -1, but a neat trick might make it simpler: split the string around each instance of happy, substitute in a different synonym for each split part, then join them all back together. Like this:
Generate a random number from (0..[size of list - 1]). Then, access that index of the list. To get the length of a list, just do len(list_name).
