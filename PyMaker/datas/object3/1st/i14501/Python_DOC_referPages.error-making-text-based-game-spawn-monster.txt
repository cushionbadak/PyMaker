Natural Text
I am making a text based game with my friend for a programming class, we are avoiding using object oriented stuff so please avoid those suggestions. to use the program I would normally do type "help" then I can go in any direction to move like "right", "left", "down" and "up" when I try to use those commands I get an error. this happend after I added the spawnMonster command part
The random.choice function requires a sequence.In a previous version of your code (or maybe it was code from a classmate of yours just having similar but not identical problems with similar code?), you had the monsters stored in a list, like [("Goblin", 1), ("Troll", 3), â€¦]. For that code, random.choice works, because a list is a sequence.But now you have a dict. And a dict is not a sequence.You can get a list of all of the keys in a dict just by writing list(d). So, you could do this:But you're not actually getting any benefit from monsters being a dict from what I can tell, so why not just use a list in the first place?
monsters is a dictionary. It is being passed to random.choice(), however, random.choice() accepts a sequence as its argument (from which it randomly selects one element). This will not work for a dictionary and you will see a KeyError exception if you try.Since you just want to return an enemy from spawnMonster() you can instead use the keys of monsters which is a list:UpdateSince you are using Python 3 you can do this instead (also works in Python 2):
