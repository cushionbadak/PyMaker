I have this csv fileI want to make all the words start with a small letter and create a list which will include all the unique items from the above csv file.Have you any idea? Thanks in advance!So far, I have managed to convert all the words with a small letter:But i can't manage the other one.Which does not give the results I want
If you can't figure out how to do everything at once, do it step by step.So, let's write an explicit for statement over the rows:But if you look at this, you're trying to use a list as a set; it'll be easier (and more efficient) if you just use a set as a set; then you don't need the if â€¦ in check:And now, adding each element from one set to another is just unioning the sets, so you can replace those last two lines with, e.g.:And now, if you want to turn it all back into one big expression, you can:Also, in Python 2.7+, you can just use a set comprehension, instead of calling set on a list comprehension or generator expression:In fact, you can even turn the whole thing into one big comprehension with a nested loop:Or, alternatively, you don't have to make it one big expression:Also, as Padraic Cunningham pointed out, one of the dialect options the csv module offers is skipinitialspace, which does just like it sounds like, so you don't need the strip anymore. For example, using the big set comprehension:Or, alternatively, it looks like your format is really using comma-space rather than comma as a delimiter, so:
To store all the words in lowercase , you can use .lower() method on strings and after creating a list of all the words in the list we create a set which returns only the unique values.
