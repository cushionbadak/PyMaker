I have the following sample string:I want to obtain:The numbers can be floating point numbers with exponential notation i.e. - 2.5e-7.My current regex looks like this:But it doesn't produce the correct output, what is wrong with it?This is a sample output:or it matches nothing.
I adapted the Floating Point Numbers with a Regular Expression regex for you and shortened the regex a bit (note the alternative list is gone that means less backtracking, and the (?i) case insensitive matching option in front to turn [A-Za-z] into [a-z]):Output of the IDEONE demo:
findall will put all the submatches in the results. In your case, the empty strings come from the unmatched decimals if they are present; so use non-capture groups instead:I also moved the space at the second capture group outside so you don't get that leading space.regex101 demoideone demo
