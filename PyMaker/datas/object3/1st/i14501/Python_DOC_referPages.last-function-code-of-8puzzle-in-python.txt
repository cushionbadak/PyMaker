I have this code in Python. Swap_blank_tile function creates a new matrix from old matrix. I want to put a value to "liste" from my first matrix. Therefore I used matrix2 in "swap_blank_tile" function, but "matrix" also is affected from "swap_blank_tile" function but i do not want it. Only matrix2 must be affected from this function. I can not solve why matrix is also affected from this function.
In your code when:matrix2 and matrix are still references to the same object, so if you change one you'll change the other. You'll probably want to create a deepcopy.
What data type is matrix?Possibly it is a list of lists, in which case you need to make a complete copy of matrix. Use copy.deepcopy():The reason for this is that matrix2 = matrix does not make a copy of matrix, it simply binds the name matrix2 to the same object. Therefore any change made to the object is visible from both variables. deepcopy() will descend into the object and make a copy of any nested objects resulting in 2 independent objects.
