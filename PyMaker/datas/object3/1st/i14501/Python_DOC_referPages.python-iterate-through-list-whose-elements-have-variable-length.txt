How can I iterate through a list or tuple whose elements as lists with variable length in Python? For example I want to do and then have the elements of tup that are short to be completed with, say, None. I have found a workaround with the following code but I believe there must be a better way.Where 4 is actually the length of the "longest" element. Is there a better way?
To match your own output you can use izip_longest to fill with None's and transpose again to get back to the original order:If an int, float etc.. would be better then you can specify a different fillvalue argument to the izip_longest function:Judging by your print statement you are likely to be using python2 but for anyone using python3 as @TimHenigan commented below it is  zip_longest.If you don't need a list you can use itertools.izip which returns an iterator:
In Python 3 we can do like this:
