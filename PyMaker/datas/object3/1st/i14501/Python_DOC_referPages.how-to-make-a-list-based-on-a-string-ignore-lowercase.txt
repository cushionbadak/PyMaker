Using these, I want to make a list:My main goal is to create a list of numbers starting from an integer  (a =100 for example) corresponding to the letters in the string by ignoring the lowercase letters.Is there any solutions to do this with python? I will apply the solution to a large file consisting of lots of fields and rows.
You can use the enumerate() function to create a counter, the second argument is the starting value, letting you set it to a if you need that as a starting point.To test if a string is uppercase, use the str.isupper() method.Combined together in a list comprehension with filter gives you:This numbers all characters in s starting at a, but only includes those numbers in the output list where the character is uppercase; the numbers are converted to strings:
Martijn's answer indeed the best. I have tried to make use of map and filter functions1. Do note that this is terribly slow compared to the List comprehension. Another lambda expression as Pochmann has mentioned below is lambda x: x[1].isupper() and str(x[0]). The difference between the two lambdas is negligible. 1Any list comp can have an alternative using these functions
