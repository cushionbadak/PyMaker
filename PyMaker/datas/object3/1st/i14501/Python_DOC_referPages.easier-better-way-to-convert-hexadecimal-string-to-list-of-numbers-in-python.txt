My goal is to  get a 64 characters long hex number from a user (which represent a serial number) and convert to c_type 32bytes number.Serial Number is defined like this:I accept SN string from user into args.sn variable. Here's how I managed to solve it. I'm sure there is an easier and more elegant way, would appreciate your help.
The very easy way, using binascii (Python 3):Example:In Python 2, you would useExample:
Expanding on @nneonneo's comment (binascii.unhexlify is equivelent to binascii.a2b_hex):Example (with the hex ffaabb):
First, you can use a list comprehension to eliminate most of the overhead code. Second, it's not necessary to prepend 0x to the string when you convert to int, as long as you've specified the second parameter. Third, if you need to validate the string to make sure it contains the correct number of digits, that should be a separate step. Or perhaps you can just rely on a raised exception when things go wrong.
