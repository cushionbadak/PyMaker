How do I search for an executable file using python in linux? The executable files have no extensions and are in a folder together with files that have different extensions. ThanksEDIT: What I mean by search is to get the filenames of all the executable files and store them in a list or tuple. Thanks
To do it in Python:
If by search you mean to list all the executable files in a directory than use the command from this SuperUser Link.You can use Subprocess module to execute the commands from python code.
Function os.access() is in some cases better than os.stat(), because it check whether the file can be executed by you, according to file owner, group and permissions.
