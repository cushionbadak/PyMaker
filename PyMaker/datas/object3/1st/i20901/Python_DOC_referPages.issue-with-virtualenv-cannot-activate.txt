I created a virtualenv around my project, but when I try to activate it I cannot.It might just be syntax or folder location, but I am stumped right now.You can see below, I create the virtualenv and call it venv. Everything looks good, then I try to activate it by running source venv/bin/activateI'm thinking it might just have to do with my system path, but not sure what to point it to (I do know how to edit the path). I'm on python 7 / windows os, virtual env 2.2.x
source is a shell command designed for users running on Linux (or any Posix, but whatever, not Windows).On Windows, virtualenv creates a batch file, so you should run venv\Scripts\activate instead (per the virtualenv documentation on the activate script).
I had the same problem. I was using Python 2, Windows 10 and Git Bash. Turns out in Git Bash you need to use:
For activation you can go to the venv your virtualenv directoryby cd venv.Then on Windows, type dir (on unix, type ls). You will get 5 folders include, Lib, Scripts, tcl and 60 Now type ./Scripts/activate to activate your virtualenv venv.Your prompt will change to indicate that you are now operating within the virtual environment. It will look something like this (venv)user@host:~/venv$.Congratulation..And your venv is activated now.
For windows, type "C:\Users\Sid\venv\FirstProject\Scripts\activate" in the terminal without quotes. Simply give the location of your Scripts folder in your project. So, the command will be location_of_the_Scripts_Folder\activate.
I have a hell of a time using virtualenv on windows with git bash, I usually end up specifying the python binary explicitly. If my environment is in say .env I'll call python via ./.env/Scripts/python.exe â€¦, or in a shebang line #!./.env/Scripts/python.exe; Both assuming your working directory contains your virtualenv (.env).
You can run the source command on cygwin terminal
I was also facing the same issue in my Windows 10 machine.What steps i tried were:Go to andconda terminalStep 1Step 2or Step 3You can check it via spider tool in anaconda by typing import tensorflow as tf
A small reminder, but I had my slashes the wrong way on Win10 cmd. According to python documentation the activate command is: C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.batWhen you're browsing directories it's e.g. cd .env/ScriptsSo to create my venv I used python -m venv --copies .env and to activate .env\Scripts\activate.bat
If you see the 5 folders (Include,Lib,Scripts,tcl,pip-selfcheck) after using the virtualenv yourenvname command, change directory to Scripts folder in the cmd itself and simply use "activate" command.
