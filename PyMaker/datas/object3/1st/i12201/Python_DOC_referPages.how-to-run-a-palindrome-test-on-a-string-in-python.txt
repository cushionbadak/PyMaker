Write a function that takes a string consisting of alphabetic  characters as input argument and returns True if the string is a  palindrome. A palindrome is a string which is the same backward or  forward. Note that capitalization does not matter here i.e. a lower  case character can be considered the same as an upper case character.This is my code:It shows the correct output for majority of cases but there's one problem with this program. When I input 'Radar' its reverse should be 'radaR' and according to the question, I have to consider upper and lowercase characters as equal while comparing. How to achieve this? Any help would be appreciated.

This will display:Note: The [::-1] string slice has the effect of reversing the string.
