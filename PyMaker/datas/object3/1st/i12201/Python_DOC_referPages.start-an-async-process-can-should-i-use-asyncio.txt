Natural Text
Here's what I'm trying to achieve: there's a long running process, i.e. rabbitmq consumer. When it receives a specific message, it should start a parallel process that does something (whatever... print, sleep for a minute...) and finishes. In the meantime, the main process still consumes messages.This scenario could be simplified to this example:Is this something asyncio should be used for, or should I stick to multiprocessing/threading modules?
Yes asyncio can deal with that, but you have to pick the right tool depending on the nature of the task:Links:asycio standard libraryaio-lib, third-partyProcessPoolExecutor (+ run_in_executor)ThreadPoolExecutor (+ run_in_executor)
