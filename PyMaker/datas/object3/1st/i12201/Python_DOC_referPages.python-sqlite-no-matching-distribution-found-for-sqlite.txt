I tried to install that library by pip in console. I'm using win7 and python v. 2.7.10. But failed to achive. Acording to this - It can be used for my version of python too.I tried to install by several ways:pip install sqlitepip install sqlite3pip install sqlite-develWhat is wrong here?
What makes you think you need to install this? sqlite is part of the standard library, and does not need installing.
I had similar issue in RHEL7.4 it worked with below solution If you compiled and installed Python 3 yourself, install the dependencies (libsqlite3-dev or sqlite-devel or similar, depending on your Linux distribution, for example), then re-compile and re-install Python 3.after installing the sqlite-devel I have reinstall Python3.6 on my machine using below stepsdownload wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/Python-3.6.3.tar.xztar xvf Python-3.6.3.tar.xzcd Python-3.6.3 and then run ./configuremakemake install after doing this when I launch jupyter notebook it got launch Credit goes for this answer to Martijn Link  https://stackoverflow.com/a/41440858/5863866 
Another simple solution would be pip install pysqlite
