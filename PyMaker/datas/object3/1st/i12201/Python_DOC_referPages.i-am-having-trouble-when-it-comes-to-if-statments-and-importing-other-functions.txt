Natural Text
What I have written looks like thisand then the second file backward is typed like thisWhen the user inputs "forward" it will import into the backward file then going forward will work again but if they try and go backward the program shuts down and I can't figure this problem out.I have almost completed a text based adventure but I can't find anything on how to resolve this problem.
The problem is that Python modules aren't imported multiple times!Since imports are cached, and only run once, running an import two times or more will not execute or reload the module again.If you want to reload a module, you have to use the reload function inside importlib (Python 3.4) or imp (Python 3.0 to 3.3):Note that as the documentation states the argument passed to reload() must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. So in your case it would look like
I guess what you are trying to do is :Ask the user for inputIf the input is 'Forward' or 'forward', then import the Forward moduleIf the input is 'Backward' or 'backward', then import the Backward moduleIf this is true then I guess the following should work.That being said, I don't understand what do you need to import the modules multiple times if you have imported them from the start.
