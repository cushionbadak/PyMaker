I have the below code which is working fine but when my string is "hello I am in 12th grade but i am 230 years old", I am getting 12, 230 but I want 12230 as one integer. How do I achieve that?
Using str.join, you can join multiple strings into one string:BTW, instead of using regular expression, you can use filter with str.isdigit:UPDATEAs Donkey Kong commented, you can also use re.sub to remove non-digit characters:But, with this you can't check whether there was digit or not.
I don't understand what you intended to do with manually assigning values to str1 after taking user input to it.
