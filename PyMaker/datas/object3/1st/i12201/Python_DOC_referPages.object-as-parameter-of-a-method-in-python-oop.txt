I'm trying to build a simple RPG game to learn more about classes in Python, but I'm struggling with the fight method. The idea is that after both player and monster are created, the method fight would have the parameter enemy, that is the monster the player is fighting.Here is what I did in the fight (it's inside Player's class) method:Here is the call I'm doing right now (in the main file):but, whenever I run it, I get the following error:Both classes(Player and Enemy) inherit from the Character's class, so what's the deal with this error? Do I need an import from enemy to solve this?EDIT1 : Above the complete Player class:The Fighter class:And my actual Enemy class:My main.py is as follows
In Fighter.fight you are using super().fight() which instantiates a new Player object and calls fight() on this new instance. Use self.fight() to call the method on the instance of the Fighter.Never use super() to access methods of the super class. You are inheriting from that class so all methods from the super class are available in the scope of the subclass. super()'s purpose is to call the constructor of the super class (__init__()).Edit: Methods from the superclass can in fact be accessed by using super().method(). The problem here is the wrong number of parameters to the fight() method. (See comments below)
