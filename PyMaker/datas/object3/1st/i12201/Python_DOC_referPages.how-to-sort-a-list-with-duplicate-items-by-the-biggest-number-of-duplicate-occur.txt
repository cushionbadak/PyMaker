I have a and the Output should be "five" is the first element because in list1 has the highest number of occurrences (3)"two" is the second element because in list1 has the next highest number of occurrences (2)"one", "three" and "six" have the same lower number of occurrences (1) so they are the last in my list2 - It doesn't really matter what position they will be as long as they are after "five" and "two". On short, list2 = ["five" , "two", "six", "three" , "one"] or list2 = ["five" , "two", "three", "one" , "six"] or any other variations are accepted.I could solve this by creating a dictionary to store the number of occurances and then create a new list with my items ordered by the dictbut I need something cleaner
You could use a list comprehension and Counter:Outputs:
You could use itertools.groupby() to get a list sorted by the number of occurrences:If duplicates are already grouped in list1 (like in your question) then you can drop the sorted() call. groupby() may be more efficient (memory/time -wise) than collections.Counter() -- measure it if it is important in your case.
Use a counter collection That is its specific purposehttps://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html
