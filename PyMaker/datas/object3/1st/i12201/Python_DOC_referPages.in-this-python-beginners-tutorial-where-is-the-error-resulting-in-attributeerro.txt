Should you need it, the tutorial I am following is Python Programming by Derek Banas: https://youtu.be/N4mEzFDjqtA?t=41m26sMy source code follows:
Change to this. It's to do with the variables being private.
To answer your question, Python has "reserved" the use of names starting with one and two underscores within a class. Specifically, per the section on Private Variables, However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the APIAnd for two underscores:Any identifier of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. What that means is that names like _spam are just named, but you should leave them alone unless it's your class. But, names like __name get special treatment from Python, and they are converted to __Dog_name. You were trying to access __name from a subclass - not from within the Animal class that defines the __name. And you can't, because it's designed that way. You are forced to use the accessor method, .get_type().
class Dog(Animal):        __owner = ""This code works for me output shown as below:king is 20 cm tall, 100 kilograms weight and sounds likes groaawSmart is 10 cm tall, 14 kilograms weight and sounds likes lolll his owner is birl
