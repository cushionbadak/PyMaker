I have the following file structure:misc_utils.py contains the following function to retrieve my logger:In main.py, I call that function:If I call extractor.py from main.py, as the import line in main.py does, it doesn't output anything for some reason:And finally here is config.yaml:My question is, why is nothing outputted in extractor.py?
With extractor.py containing this code:and main.py looking like this:it works for me. Here's the output:Alternatively, if you just want to use an existing logger inextractor.py, i.e:Then it is important that the logger was initialized before theimport. With this in main.py:I get:
I finally figured out what the problem was. Since import tools.extractor is called before get_logger(__name__, config=config), the logger in extractor.py is disabled. This is mentioned under the description for the disable_existing_loggers argument for dictConfig, which is set to True by default. Setting it to False solves the problem.
