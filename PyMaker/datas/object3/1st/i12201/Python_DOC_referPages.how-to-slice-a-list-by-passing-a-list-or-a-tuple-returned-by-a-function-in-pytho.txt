I have lambda functions as below:So the outputs as below:So I want a list to be sliced with the values this function returns. For instance, assuming I have a list as below:However, this is not what I want to do. This is (i) too ugly, (ii) executing the same function twice. So I wonder if there is a way to pass a function's return which is tuple or list as a slice argument to a list.
You can create a slice object using slice() and pass in the function result as arguments:The * unpacks the tuple that prange_py() returns and passes it as arguments to the slice() call.
Construct a slice object explicitly instead of using the : syntax.The tuple returned by prange_py is unpacked to pass two arguments to slice. slice(a,b) creates an object that can be used as an "index" equivalent to numbers[a:b].
I believe this method is very readable.
Lst[output[0]:output[1]]Where lst is the sliced And output is the tuple
