Write a function named single_insert_or_delete that accepts two strings as input arguments and returns:0 if the two strings match exactly.1 if the first string can become the same as the second string by inserting or deleting a single character. Notice that inserting and deleting a character is not the same as replacing a character.2 otherwisethats what i reached so farIt actually works good but if you tried tricky words like 'the' and 'that' it will give 1 instead of 2 which is wrong
You may have to return outside the for loop and recheck the comparison logic in if.for c in range(0,limit+1):The problem here is, when the words(the and this) are compared, it satisfies the first condition of t being equal to t and it enters the if condition where it returns 1 and exits the function. It will not proceed with the for loop.If you want something similar rather than difflib, you may also use the following code.Output :C:\Python27\python.exe D:/Python/Mylist.pyOutput-1  2Output-2  2Output-3  0Output-4  1Output-5  1Process finished with exit code 0
I'm not sure if you want to work out how to do it, or whether you just want to solve it, but if the latter you could use difflib.ndiff():Output
