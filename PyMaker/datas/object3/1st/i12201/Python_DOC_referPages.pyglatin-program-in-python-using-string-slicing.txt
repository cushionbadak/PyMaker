I have a Python code like this,The output of variable "new_word" should be "ythonpay", but now the new_word contains "pythonpay". Could anyone let me know what is the mistake i am doing here.
You are not assigning the result of the slice new_word[1:] to anything. You could just do the slice on your previous line, e.g.:What version of python are you using, Python3 introduces a new unpacking syntax that makes this quite easy:No need to slice because the * assignment already separated the string.
You say new_word[1:] but you aren't doing anything with it.  Change that to new_word = new_word[1:].  Slicing creates a copy of the list with whatever items you decide.  In your case it creates a list of all items except the first.  It does not change the original list, however, so you need to assign new_word to it.
The problem is with the indexing and what you are printing.In your code new_word = word+first+pyg returns the original word itself as the first part, you need it to include all of the string except the first letter. That you can achieve by using word[1:] i.e all characters after the first (or 0th) index of the string. The above will output "ythonpay" for python.
