Say that I have a plenty of updating informations, and some variable that needs to display on the console constantly. I want to do the following effect:The info and variables may change differently, how to make those two parts change asynchronously in the console as well? 
For Unix, use curses.On Windows, one option is to use the Console module.
Actually there is no need to change those parts asynchronously. You may use \r symbol to return the carriage on the last line and then use multiple spaces to clear it. The following python code should do the trick.The question is that printing is going to be so fast that you will not be able to capture the output with your eyes, so may need add some sleep() function while printing.
