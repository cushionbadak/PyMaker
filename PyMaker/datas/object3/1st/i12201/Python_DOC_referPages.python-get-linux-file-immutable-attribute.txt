I can use os.stat(pathname) to get pathname's perssmions, mtime, atime....Howerver, I hava a file that has a '+i' attribute, you can see it by:lsattr  /tmp/test.pyIs there a way to know if the pathname has the '+i' attribute by using python?
This related SO post about why os.chflags doesn't exist on Linux shows a way to work around the absence of lsattr in the os module using fcntl.  However, it relies on copying constant definitions from a header file (ext2fs/ext2_fs.h), so it's fragile.  A more permanent solution would require writing some C or something like Cython.Meanwhile, PM 2Ring's answer works, though it should be modified to work with paths that contain the letter "i".  Perhaps someone with some reputation could comment or edit that answer (this is my first post)?
There doesn't appear to be an os module function to get these Linux file attributes, but you can use the subprocess module to call the lsattr command in Python.The code below should work on Python 2 or 3, although it can be made more compact in recent Python versions.FWIW, I have the i bit set on my fstab file because I got sick of it randomly getting wiped out.UpdateThe previous version of this code had However, that will also detect an 'i' if one is present in the file name! The new version only detects an 'i' in the attribute flags. Thanks, sverasch for bring this to my attention.
