I built and installed my custom Django app following the official tutorial https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/reusable-apps/The installation seems successful.Where can I find the source code of all my custom classes and methods?I tried to search it through my system but didn't find them. Is the code compiled?The module seems was not installed correctly.Below, you can see my app directory structure.And my setup.py script.
Because you used --user, the package is installed for current user (the one who issued pip install --user) and not in system site-packages directory. See the docs for site.USER_BASE. So, you should look in ~/.local/ as said in the docs, probably: /home/%user%/.local/lib/python%version%/site-packages/.Also, considering, that the package got installed somewhere on PYTHONPATH, you could try to find it by running the following command in your shell:i.e.Regarding your question update:You should create a top level directory, e.g. django-horizon2fa and put setup.py, MANIFEST.in, README.RST, LICENSE.txt and your horizon2fa package directory inside it. So that installation related files are in new dir and all files related to your module are inside a dir in that dir. Current directory setup doesn't allow find_packages() do it's job properly.P.S. Using solely MANIFEST.in, may sometimes lead to problems with inclusion of package data in distribution, e.g. templates. In that case consider providing  files from MANIFEST.in in package_data dictionary to setup(), see details in the docs.
