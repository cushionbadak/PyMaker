Beginning in Python and I am having some difficulties with dictionaries. I  have these two dictionaries here.The output I want is:Unsure how I would match up the two dictionaries. I could always put them into one dictionary and access every other value but I would like to keep them as two dictionaries. There will never be an instance where a two letter code does not have an associated value. The order is always set as well.An idea I had is to create a third dictionary out of the two, but even then I'm unsure where to go.
All you have to do is to iterate over available keys, and zip lists retrieved from both dictionaries to iterate over pairs simultaneously.Basic implementation may look like this:This prints on standard output following text:Obviously you'll have to handle some exceptional cases, like missing keys in dictionaries etc.

Try this:Don't I love list-comprehension.
Depending on what you want to do after could use a dictionary or just a generatorThen you can use it likeThe advantage of the generator is that you don't need to have the entire dictionary in memory, but you won't be able to access it by key:Edit: If at some time both lists could have different size you may want to take a look at itertools.izip_longest
