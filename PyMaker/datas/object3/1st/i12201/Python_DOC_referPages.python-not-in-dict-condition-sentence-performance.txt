Does anybody know about what is better to use thinking about speed and resources? Link to some trusted sources would be much appreciated.or
Firstly, you'd dosince dicts are iterated over by keys.Secondly, the two statements are not equivalent - the second condition would be true if the corresponding values is falsy (0, "", [] etc.), not only if the key doesn't exist.Lastly, the first method is definitely faster and more pythonic. Function/method calls are expensive. If you're unsure, timeit.
In my experience, using in is faster than using get, although the speed of get can be improved by caching the get method so it doesn't have to be looked up each time. Here are some timeit tests:typical output on my 2Ghz machine running Python 2.6.6:   
Ok, I've tested it on python 3.4.3 and all three ways give the same result around 0.00001 second.
