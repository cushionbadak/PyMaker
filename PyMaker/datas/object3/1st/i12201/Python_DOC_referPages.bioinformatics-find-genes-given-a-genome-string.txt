Biologists use a sequence of letters A, C, T, and G to model a genome.  A gene is a substrsing of a genome that starts after a triplet ATG and ends before a triplet TAG, TAA, or TGA.  Furthermore, the length of a gene string is a multiple of 3 and the gene does not contain any of the triplets ATG, TAG, TAA, and TGA.Ideally:So far, I have:I keep running into errorsTo be completely honest, this is really not working for me - I think I have hit a dead end with these lines of code -  a new approach may be helpful.Thanks in advance!The error that I have been getting -Like I said before, I'm not really sure if I am on the right track to solve the issue with my current code - any new ideas w/ pseudo code is appreciated!
