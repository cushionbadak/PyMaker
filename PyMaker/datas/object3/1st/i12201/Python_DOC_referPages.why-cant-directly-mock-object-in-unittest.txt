I'm new to python mocking.I know we can use mock.patch to mock f1 for f2 testing. Like this:But I found if I directly mock f1 in test case like below, it doesn't work. I have no idea why can't just directly mock "f1" at here?
Even patch and Mock are in the same package they have a different duties: By mock.Mock() you are creating a mock object f1 (local variable) By patch('__main__.f1') you are patching f1 reference in __main__ module (the one you are running)patch default behavior is to use mocks to replace the original reference, but you can use it also for installing stubs or fakes: the main duty is to control the context where you replace the reference.Just a tip: take a look to where to patch ... it can enlightening you.
Not sure why you think that would work. All you're doing is defining a new local variable called f1 which happens to be an instance of Mock; just as if you'd defined f1 = "foo" it doesn't affect the module-level name at all.
