I am totally new to python, so my question may seem stupid. Basically I need to ask the user to determine a working directory, create a folder in that address, and then run the rest of script. I know how to get the directory, but I do not know how to use it in my script.and I need to create a folder in that address, so I try this:But I got error message:Any help would be appreciated. Best,
The NameError: name X is not defined occurs when Python can't find X as a variable name. So that tells you that Python is looking for a variable named X. However, you don't define X as a variable (at least in the code you posted). You want X to be part of a path name, which should be a string. I'd suggest you read up on Python string behavior and how to build longer strings from shorter ones.
askdirectory() returns the full path of an existing directory.  If you want to create a new directory/folder named 'map-C` within that existing directory, then use"If the directory already exists, OSError is raised." (mkdir doc)
