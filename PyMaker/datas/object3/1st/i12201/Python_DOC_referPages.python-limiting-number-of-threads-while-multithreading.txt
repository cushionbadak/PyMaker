Code below.Essentially I need to grab data from a large number of sites (we're talking in the tens of thousands).I'm using the above code as a base, which works great, however, the code freezes after the creation of 750 threads of so.I'm wondering how to limit the number of active threads, or to like close a thread once it finishes.
You can use a thread pool like the one implemented in multiprocessing.In the following snippet, a maximum of 100 threads will be active any time.
