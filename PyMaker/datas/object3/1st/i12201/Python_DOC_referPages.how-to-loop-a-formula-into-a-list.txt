I am new to coding and my spelling is not the best but I need help with something, I am trying to loop a formula to make a sequence that is stored in a list. Here is my code so far;don't worry about the variables they are completely irrelevant as they only make sense to me but i just was to know how i could do this.
Is this what you want to do?This will make total a list which adds the three numbers to it each loop iterationAn alternative is to use extend:Please note that for both of these methods, you need to initialize total somewhere earlier in your code, e.g.Additionally, you are using the range function wrong. If you want to iterate the length of a list, do range(0,len(lst)). Please also note that using the variable name list is ill-advised as it is a built-in function in Python.
