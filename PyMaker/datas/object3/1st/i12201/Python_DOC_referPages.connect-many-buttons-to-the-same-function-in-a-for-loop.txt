I have about 25-30 Buttons which I must to connect to the same function. I don't like to do this all manually by writing All my buttons have the same naming layout, so the next button would be __mybutton_2. I want to do something like thatIs something like this possible in python and how to do that?
It's possible, but not recommended.  You can use eval("self.__mybutton_{}".format(i)).connect(self.__MyConnectedFunction), but it would be better to create a list of your buttons and use buttons[i] instead.
If all the buttons are children of the same widget/window, you could use the QObject.findChildren method to dynamically get a list of the buttons:This also assumes you're setting the objectName of the buttons to the same name as their python variable name (which .ui files should already do).This has the benefit that you can add more buttons in the future and as long as you stick to the naming convention (__my_button_#), the connection code will automatically connect it.
Yes, you can do exactly what you want using getattr:
