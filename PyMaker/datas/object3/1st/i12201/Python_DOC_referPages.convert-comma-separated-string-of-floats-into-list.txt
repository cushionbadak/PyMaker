Natural Text
I need to define a function txtnum(L) that takes a string of comma separated floats such as "1.5,2.5,3.5" as a parameter and converts it into a list [1.5, 2.5, 3.5].I have tried using .split(), .join(), map(), etc and cannot get anything to return a list that does NOT include quotations. I'm pretty new to Python and a little lost here. How would I go about doing this?
You need to convert the datatype of splitted vars because splitting alone string gives you a list of strings.or
1.5,2.5,3.5 is a valid tuple literal in Python (without parentheses, yes, but it doesn't matter), so you can use ast.literal_eval on it:If you really need a list, that's easy, too:
