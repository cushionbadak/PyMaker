i am currently having problem parsing all the tr tags that occur in a table, i am able to parse the first tr tag but i am unable to understand how can i parse all the subsequent tr tags, i have thought of using a for loop but it didn't work.i have included only partial code which includes the tr tags that i want to store in json file.Here is what i tried:Here is the sample html code if the tr tag exists more than one.
You should first iterate throw the rows like below and in each row, query the columns into the columns variable at the startEDIT: Looks like your html has two table structures. You need the inner one. So, use index 1 instead tables[1]I've also added enumerate around the iterator so you also have the row index. And using this, you can skip the header row, when index==0
