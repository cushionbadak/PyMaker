This question already has an answer here:Calling Java from Python [closed]                    9 answers                I need to find a way of communication between java and python program. My application is Java, and another application ( python) will request me some data and trigger some process in my Java Application. EDITED: My application is Java desktop application, that uses Jboss Application server.For  first release, I do not have enough time to make a comprehensive way of communication. So I am planing to use subprocess.Popen for first release. I will provide them a jar. Then they can call me from pyhton. Actually I was planned to make a single class that takes some arguments on main. Then according to parameters, my application can determine to call related function.But there is a problem here. When they want to call my functions in following way. in each call, a new java process will be created and I can not keep some static variables from my application. Actually What I need is to run my application once, then access some functions from existing process.Do you think Can I implement this using subprocess.Popen. If not can you show me an easy way ?
I would suggest using xmlrpc -- it's pretty simple:(Source http://www.tutorialspoint.com/xml-rpc/xml_rpc_examples.htm)Here's some code for a python client:(Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.client.html)All you'd have to do is make your methods and stitch them together.
