I am trying to validate an incoming webhook and so far the resulting hash is not matching the test hash generated by the api.The docs list the following example for Ruby however I am using Python/Django so any help to 'convert' this function would be appreciated!Ruby FunctionThis is roughly what I have put together myself so far using https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html.Python AttemptWhen I run the above the hashes never match obviously due to my incorrect Python implementation.Any help/pointers would be greatly appreciated!
I believe it should be something like this:A few notes:Use the actual request body.  Don't rely on str(json_data) equalling the request body.  This will almost certainly fail as python will print out inner strings using repr which will likely leave a bunch of spurious u"..." that aren't actually in the response.  json.dumps won't necessarily do better because there could be whitespace differences that are isignificant to JSON, but are very significant to the hmac signature.hmac is your friend :-)
