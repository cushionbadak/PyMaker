Natural Text
The following is my code:The "WinUpdates.txt" file contains a lot of lines like these:http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2980245     RECHTS  Update  KB2980245               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   8/18/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2981580     RECHTS  Update  KB2981580               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   8/18/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2982378     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2982378               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   9/12/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2984972     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2984972               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   10/17/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2984976     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2984976               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   10/17/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2984981     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2984981               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   10/16/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2985461     RECHTS  Update  KB2985461               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   9/12/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2987107     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2987107               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   10/17/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2990214     RECHTS  Update  KB2990214               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   4/16/2015http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2991963     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2991963               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   11/14/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2992611     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2992611               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   11/14/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2993651     RECHTS  Update  KB2993651               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   8/29/2014http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2993958     RECHTS  Security Update  KB2993958               NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM   11/14/2014But when I execute my code, it says that it has not found any of those updates? Even though I know that it should find 4.I wrote the "data" list into a new text file, but there it seems everything alright?Why do you think my code does not work?
FWIW, your code can be written in a more compact way that doesn't require a zillion if statements. Also, since the (new) data file is only 63342 bytes you can read the whole thing into a single string, rather than into a list of strings. Contents of checked.txt, using the linked data:Note that this code prints the found kbids in the order that they're defined in kb_ids, rather than the order they occur in "WinUpdates.txt".Searching through the whole file as a string for each kbid is probably not a good idea if the file is large, eg, more than a megabyte or so; you might want to run some timing tests (using timeit) to see which strategy works best on your data.If you want to read a file into a list there's no need to use a for loop, you can just do this:Alternatively, you can process the file line by line without reading it into a list:On more modern versions of Python the two with statements can be combined into a single line.
I added and fixed what you were missing check the two comments to see what I mean. This worked for me so it should work for you. Have a great day!
