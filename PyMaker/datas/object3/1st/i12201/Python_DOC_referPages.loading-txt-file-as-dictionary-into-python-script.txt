Natural Text
I have a txt file (dictionary.txt) that I would like to load into my script as a dictionary. How can I do so? file dictionary.txtCode:This inputs it as a dictionary, but I was wondering if there is a faster way to do so. 
It's unlikely to be faster, or slower, but you can make it much more secure by avoiding eval (which can execute arbitrary code, which makes for a major security and stability risk) in favor of ast.literal_eval; it's like eval, but only for Python literals, not arbitrary code. Depending on format, you might also be able to use json.load or json.loads.
Your dictionary.txt is almost JSON, so I would recommend something like this:For your dictionary.txt, this outputsNOTE: Ellipses have been used to abbreviate the output.
