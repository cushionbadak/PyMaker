Trying to figure out how to get the current date to lock in as a variable to subtract from the self.birthday that is input. I have looked at various examples and links to no avail...suggestions?Error message is "dateNow = datetime.datetime.now()AttributeError: type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'datetime'"I have tried the followingwith no successresources I'm using:https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlhttps://pymotw.com/2/datetime/
datetime.datetime.now() refers to a method (now) of a class (2nd datetime) of a library (1st datetime), however you didn't import the entire library, just the single class (from datetime import datetime). Either import the entire library or call on the class without referring to the library.
TryI will give you the current date in string format then use split().
