I've stumbled upon a strange behaviour with Python's subprocess module:I wonder how the command is run with the PATH environment variable unset? Is there any default PATH?
Yes, there is a default PATH, at least in Linux.Consider this quote from the Linux execl() man page:If [the PATH variable] isn't defined, the path list defaults to the current directory followed by the list of directories returned by confstr(_CS_PATH). (This confstr(3) call typically returns the value "/bin:/usr/bin".)
There is os.defpath:The default search path used by exec*p* and spawn*p* if the  environment doesnâ€™t have a 'PATH' key. Also available via os.path.It is hardcoded to ':/bin:/usr/bin' in posixpath.py (os.path on POSIX systems) and '.;C:\\bin' in ntpath.py (os.path on Windows).
