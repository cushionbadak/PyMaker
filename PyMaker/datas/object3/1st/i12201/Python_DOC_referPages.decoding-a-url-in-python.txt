Natural Text
Can somebody explain how to decode this in Python?I already tried:and I got this: 
The description for unquote is "Replace %xx escapes by their single-character equivalent" (https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html). You can check the results using this site: http://www.degraeve.com/reference/urlencoding.php.  Using the first sequence, %2A you can see that it resolves to '*'.  The last enclosing call to 'unquote' essentially does nothing except echo the previous result.
