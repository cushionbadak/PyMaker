I have a list with different values. It looks like this:I'm getting encoding errors when I'm writing the data to csv and thus want to encode the data before exporting. So I tried this:Now this doesn't really solve my problem to begin with (the data gets filled with \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0 and other stuff). But main thing is it takes ages and my python pretty much crashes.Is there a better method or should I just change export method? (using csv tool and writerows right now)
If you are using python 2.X you can use following unicode_writer class which python suggests in it's documentation:And in python 3.X you can simply pass your encoding to open function.
