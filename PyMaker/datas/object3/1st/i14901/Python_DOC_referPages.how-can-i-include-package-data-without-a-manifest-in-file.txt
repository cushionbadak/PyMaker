How can I include package_data for sdist without a MANIFEST.in file?My setup.py looks like this:Versions:I just can't get foo/bar.txt included.Or is this blog post still true?  http://blog.codekills.net/2011/07/15/lies,-more-lies-and-python-packaging-documentation-on--package_data-/Over the last hour, though, I've learned that these statements are somewhere between “dangerously misleading” and “damn lies”.This is because the primary type of Python package is a source package, and the canonical method for creating a source package is by using setup.py sdist. However, the data specified in package_data are not included in source distributions — they are only included in binary (setup.py bdist) distributions and installs (setup.py install).How can I include package_data for sdist without a MANIFEST.in file?
TL;DR: The keys in the package_data dictionaries are  packages; the values are lists of globs. '' is not a valid name for any Python package. If you want to have bar.txt be installed next to the __init__.py of package foo, useI have the layout:Now, if foo is a package like above, do:And after python setup.py sdist, I check the contents of dist/foo-2015.3.tar.gzHowever, if I run your setup.py with package_data={'': ['foo/bar.txt']}, I can concur that the foo/bar.txt will not be added to the source distribution, except if the foo-2015.3.egg-info/SOURCES.txt already has the line for foo/bar.txt - in that case the file will pop up in the source distribution tooNo manifest was used; the setuptools version was 3.6 (I deliberately installed the same, old version that you were using):The behaviour above also works in standard distutils: 2.6 Installing package data of the "legacy" distutils documentation; with a comment for 2.7, 3.1:Changed in version [2.7, 3.1]: All the files that match package_data will be added to the MANIFEST file if no template is provided.
I had the same issue and fixed it be removing :
