I have a list of real values:I want to have the number of items iterated over, until some condition was met. For example, if the condition was item > 5, the result would be 3.The easiest way, and perhaps most straight-forward way to do this would be:Is there any other way more pythonic, preferably one-liner, which does this?
You can use itertools.takewhile with sum which will take elements until the condition is met, using a generator expression we lazily evaluate:
Your code is equivalent to the following generator expressionnext(gen ) will return the index of the first matching elementor raise StopIteration (if there are no such elements) - if this is a problem consider adding some default value e.g None:or using itertools.takewhile with sum (please note that you'll need to negate the predicate):
For lists, Padraic's answer! Using NumPy is definitely fastest if data structure is already an array...
The most pythonic way to do this is with a comprehension list.
