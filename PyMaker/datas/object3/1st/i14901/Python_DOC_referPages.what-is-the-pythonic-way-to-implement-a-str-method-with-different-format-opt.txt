I'd like to create a __str__ method that creates the string in various formats according to user choice.The best I have come up with is to make a __str__(**kwargs) method, and this seems to work ok, but it isn't compatible with str(obj) or print(obj). In other words I have to use print(obj.__str__(style='pretty')) rather than print(obj, style='pretty').
Implement the object.__format__() method instead, and a user can then specify the formatting required with the format() function and str.format() method:orYou probably want to delegate most of the handling of the format on to str.__format__:That way you can still support all the field width and padding alignment options that the default str.__format__ method supports.Demo:
