If I use this funtion pd.DatetimeIndex(dfTrain['datetime']).weekday I get number of the day, but I don't find any function which give the name of de day... So I need to convert 0 to Monday, 1 to Tuestday and so on.Here is an example of my dataframe:Another question more, which is the difference between pandas.DatetimeIndex.dayofweekand pandas.DatetimeIndex.weekday?
One method, so long as datetime is already a datetime column is to apply datetime.strftime to get the string for the weekday:As to your other question, there is no difference between dayofweek and weekday.It will be quicker to define a map of the weekday to String equivalent and call map on the weekday:For version prior to 0.15.0 the following should work:Version 0.18.1 and newerThere is now a new convenience method dt.weekday_name to do the aboveVersion 0.23.0 and newerweekday_name is now depricated in favour of dt.day_name.
In version 0.18.1 you can use new method dt.weekday_name:
Using dt.weekday_name is deprecated since pandas 0.23.0, instead, use dt.day_name():
Adding to the previous correct answer from @jezrael, you can use this:which also provides your new categorical variable with order (in this example: 'Monday', ..., 'Sunday')  according to this. This will possibly be helpful on next steps of your analysis.
