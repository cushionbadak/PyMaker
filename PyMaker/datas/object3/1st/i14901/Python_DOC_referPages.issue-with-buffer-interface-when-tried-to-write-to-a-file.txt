TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
You need to write bytes, not Unicode strings:The b'...' is a bytes type literal. You could also encode a str type by using the str.encode() method:Generally speaking, you want to use the io library rather than use os.open() and low-level file access. This is easily done by using the open() function.
