QuestionWhat is a clean way to create a file object from raw binary information in Python?More InfoThe reason I need to do this is because I have the raw binary information comprising a jpeg image stored in ram. I need to put it inside some kind of file object so that I can resize the image using Python's Pillow library.According to the pillow documentation, the file object needs to implement the read(), seek(), and tell() methods.
I was able to find a mention of how to handle this situation under the documentation for PIL.Image.frombytes:This is what I ended up with that worked using BytesIO:Note: The comments mention tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile. This seems like it should have worked, but it did not for some reason.
