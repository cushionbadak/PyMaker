In a defined object some values are kept in a dict, and I want to iterate over the contents in that dict as when referring to a plain dict, thus with directly access using [], and loop using e.g. .items().  Code structure is: How to write the __iter__ and, other required methods, so this kind of access is possible through an instance of Klass?
You'll have to implement the .keys(), .values() and .items() methods yourself; together with __iter__ they can all delegate the actual work to the self.values() dictionary:I renamed the attribute to avoid masking the .values() method.The easiest way to delegate __iter__ to iteration over the dictionary (by key) is to use the iter() function to get an iterator for the dictionary object.To be explicit: __iter__ plays no role in how .keys(), .values() and .items() are handled; the latter are just more methods.
