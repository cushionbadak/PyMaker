I have a list a numbers, I want to display 10 per line, and they have to format really niceThe format has to be like this, the "2" in the beginning has to be at the top of "1" in "31" and so on.So I tried some solutionThis will give me something like thisExactly the opposite I want. Anyone have any idea?Thank you!
Try gen = ('%+5s\n' % x if i%10==0 else '%+5s' %x for i,x in enumerate(prime_list,1)), instead of gen = ('%-5s\n' % x if i%10==0 else '%-5s' %x for i,x in enumerate(prime_list,1))
1 is not a prime.Therefore, prime_list should not contain 1. Ideally, prime_list should be generated without 1 in it. If you have to correct the mistake after-the-fact, then useOnce that is corrected, your code works fine:yieldsAlternatively, you could split the problem into smaller parts:format each int as a left-justified string of length 5use the grouper recipe, zip(*[iterator]*n) to collect the items into groups of 10print the groups in a table-like formatyields
