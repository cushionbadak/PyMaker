During the execution of this Python script, I want the password to be extracted.And when the script executes the password gets printed by default on the screen.But when I giveit prints 0.
subprocess.call returns the return code of the called command.Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return the returncode attribute.Use subprocess.check_output.
Thanks to Lutz for giving me a track to proceed, and after trying a lot many things, i observed the below things.Password = subprocess.call(["openssl",    "enc",    "-d", "-aes-256-cbc",    "-a",    "-in", "/home/xxx/xxx/pvcsadminPWwin.enc",    "-pass", "pass:password"],stdout=subprocess.PIPE)    stdout, stderr = Password.communicate()    print stdout[:-1]stdout is a string having endline character in the end. so i picked the whole string except the last character.and then it returns the correct password.
