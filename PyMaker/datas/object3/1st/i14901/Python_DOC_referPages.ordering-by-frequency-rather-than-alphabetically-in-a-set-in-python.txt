Natural Text
I was looking at an example in the Python library where the total number of occurrences of a word in a list are ordered by their frequency count in a dictionary:The output for cnt where the elements are listed in order of their frequency count:I want to make a set where the numerical frequencies aren't included, but the order the elements are listed is retained:However in my attempt to achieve this:I instead receive a set where the elements are ordered alphabetically instead of frequency count:Is it possible to order the set according to the frequency count?
Sets are a unordered collection of unique elements, as such ordering them has no meaning whatsoever.You probably want a list, which is ordered. The following uses a list comprehension to construct a list of the keys. We can iterate over Counter.most_common() which returns a sequence of (key, value) tuples in order.
