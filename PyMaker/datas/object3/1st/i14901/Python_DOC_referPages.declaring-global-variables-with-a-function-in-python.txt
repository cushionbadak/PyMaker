This piece of JavaScript code works well. My issue isn't with fixing the code itself, rather how I can mimic this in Python.When setupSomeGlobals() is called it declares new functions to be used globally. Could this be mimicked in python somehow? I can't figure out how. Python functions don't really seem to run like JavaScript ones, since anything global needs to be returned somehow.
With the standard disclaimer of do not do this in real code, a Python (3) translation of your Javascript would be the following:Docs for nonlocal statementDocs for global statementBut if you are actually doing this then there's almost certainly a much better way to do what you want to do.
You will have to create a separate file with functions you wantto use globally.import this file in any other python file and you should be good to go.Is there a specific reason you want to mimic the exact functionality? If not this should suffice.
I know that this is the worst possible implementation ;) , but I was trying to entertain other possibility, which is somewhat closer to the javascript code in the question.File 1 : setup_some_globals.pythe variable num has scope of the module in which it's defined.File 2 : use_some.pyYou cannot access the functions, unless and until you call 'use_global_functions()'
