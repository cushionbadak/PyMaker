Natural Text
I've been attempting to copy over lines from a csv(comma delimited) to another csv file after performing a simple check. But, the newly created output happens to be in a single column. How can I fix this? I've already attempted to migrate over values using the text solution in excel with no positive results. What I provided in the block quotes is one sample csv input that would be in ~400mb file that would need to be read for the given condition before being copied if the condition is met to the second file.

file_out.writerow([line]) will create a list with only one element for example what you need is a list of the delimiter separated elements. Use the list after line.split(",") in your code would return such list, using the split will solve the problem, for example in the following codeThe reference documentation has more examples about the usagehttps://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
Your code looks good.Why do you say that it opens in only one column?This might be your default delimiter in excel (I guess by default is a space/tab).Open the csv in excel and go to Data->Text To Columns, select 'comma' as delimiter and press finish.The code seems to be fine.you can try to change to:or other delimiter, e.g. ';'
