I can't seem to figure out how to write this piece of Python Code.I need to read something in from a file, which is this:I've imported the file into a dictionary. I then check if the number plate (following the names) contains the sequence of two letters, two numbers, then three letters. Here is that part of the code:As you can see, I don't know what to put for carReg. I need to loop through the dictionary, like in a list when you can use an integer to get part of the list. If the program returns Invalid Reg, then I need to get the key that the invalid reg belongs to - which will be a name.Any help appreciated.
Iterate over dict.items(); it'll give you the (key, value) pairs from the dictionary:
