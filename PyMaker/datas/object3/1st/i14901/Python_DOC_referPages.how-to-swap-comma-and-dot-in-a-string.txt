I am fetching price from a site in format: 10.990,00 which does not make sense as such. What is needed to make it as 10,990.00. I tried following but it's replacing all.What am I doing wrong?
You are replacing the first dot with a comma, after first replacing the first comma with a dot. The dot the first str.replace() inserted is not exempt from being replaced by the second str.replace() call.Use the str.translate() method instead:This'll swap commas for dots and vice versa as it traverses the string, and won't make double replacements, and is very fast to boot.I made the code compatible with both Python 2 and 3, where string.maketrans() was replaced by a the static str.maketrans() function.The exception here is Python 2 unicode; it works the same as str.translate() in Python 3, but there is no maketrans factory to create the mapping for you. You can use a dictionary for that:Demo:
The reason your code doesn't work is because you convert 10.990,00 to 10.990.00 and then you are replacing all dots with comma. Instead you can convert , to a symbol then convert . to , and the symbol to . :Or as suggested by georg Note that i removed the optional argument in replace(), since numbers like 1.200.000,30 would not convert as expected.
@Martijn has given the best answer. you can also iterate over the price and replace.
May be this is a long answer but it is simple to execute and doesn't use any built in function:
