I am doing a maths quiz for my coursework based around differentiation and integration using python 3. I'm finding it difficult to check if the answer, typed in by the user, is correct. I'm currently using the code below. However, if the user types in answer but in a different order it is treated as incorrect. for example if the answer was (2,4) but I typed in (4/2,4) it would be treated as incorrect despite both answers being correct. I've tried using sympify but it isnt working. How would I overcome this issue?
If you are expecting only numbers then you can use S (short for sympify) on the string. Otherwise you might need parse_expr and/or other string processing to to handle additional syntax like implied multiplication and "^" for exponentiation (see sympy.parsing.sympy_parser):
