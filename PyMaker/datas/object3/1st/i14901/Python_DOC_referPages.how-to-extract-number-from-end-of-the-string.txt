Natural Text
I have a string like "Titile Something/17". I need to cut out "/NNN" part which can be 3, 2, 1 digit number or may not be present.How you do this in python? Thanks.
\d{0,3} matches from zero upto three digits. $ asserts that we are at the end of a line.Example:
You don't need RegEx here, simply use the built-in str.rindex function and slicing, like thisOr you can use str.rpartition, like thisNote: This will get any string after the last /. Use it with caution.If you want to make sure that the split string is actually full of numbers, you can use str.isdigit function, like this
orwhen You want add this to the list use strip() to remove newline "\n"~             
I need to cut out "/NNN"Using re.sub you can what you want.
