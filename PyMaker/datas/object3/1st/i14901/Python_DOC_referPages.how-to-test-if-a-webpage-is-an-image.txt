Sorry that the title wasn't very clear, basically I have a list with a whole series of url's, with the intention of downloading the ones that are pictures. Is there anyway to check if the webpage is an image, so that I can just skip over the ones that arent?Thanks in advance
You can use requests module. Make a head request and check the content type. Head request will not download the response body. 
There is no reliable way. But you could find a solution that might be "good enough" in your case.You could look at the file extension if it is present in the url e.g., .png, .jpg could indicate an image:where url2filename() function is defined here.You could inspect Content-Type http header:You could check the very beginning of the http body for magic numbers indicating image files e.g., jpeg may start with b'\xff\xd8\xff\xe0' or:As @pafcu suggested in the answer to the related question, you could use imghdr.what() function:
You can use mimetypes https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/mimetypes.htmlthis will return "png"
