I have a multi dimensional list:I'm trying to sum the instances of element [1] where element [0] is common.To put it more clearly, my desired output is another multi dimensional list:I see I can access, say the value '2' in multiDimList byso I can grab the individual elements, and could probably build some sort of function to do this job, but it'd would be disgusting.Does anyone have a suggestion of how to do this pythonically?
Assuming your actual sequence has similar elements grouped together as in your example (all instances of 'a', 'b' etc. together), you can use itertools.groupby() and operator.itemgetter():
Zero Piraeus's answer covers the case when field entries are grouped in order. If they're not, then the following is short and reasonably efficient.This returns a collection, accessible by element name. If you prefer it as a list you can call the .items() method on it, but note that the order of the labels in the output may be different from the order in the input even in the cases where the input was consistently ordered.
You could use a dict to accumulate the total associated to each stringYou can then access the value for b by using d["b"].
