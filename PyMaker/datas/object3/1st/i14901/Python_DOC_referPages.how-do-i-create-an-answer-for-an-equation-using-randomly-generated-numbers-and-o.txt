I'm wondering how to plus, subtract and multiply a randomly generated number from other random number with a random operator. This is the code I've got so far:I usually get an error message:answer = sum(var1-var2)TypeError: 'int' object is not iterableSorry if this is a simple answer, still fresh to the whole python coding! :)
sum is for summing up an iterable - meaning a list or something behaving as a list.Just use answer = var1 + var2.There is also a fun module named operators that allows you to supply an operator that mirrors the built-in operators, which would allow you to generalize this even further.Something like this would probably be more pythonic :
sum requires iterable. Here, you already know the answer but trying to give it to sum so no need, just remove it.
