When I run fun(list_1) I should get 4 data frames:but I am getting an ouput only with first value.so what should I change in my function.

You could use a generator to achieve what you want or you may return a tuple or a list.Using a generator :This will print the value each time, and return your data frame.But it returns a generator, so you have to call the function multiple times.  What you cannot really do is get your data frames in a loop without wanting to store them in an list or assimilated or call the function only once.A simpler way with a list could be:For reference, I'd suggest you have a look at What does the "yield" keyword do in Python? which may be interesting for you.
