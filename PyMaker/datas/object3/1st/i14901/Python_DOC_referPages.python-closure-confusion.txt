I was playing around with closures in Python and I do not understand why the following does not work and how to make it work:Could anybody shed some light on it?Thanks.
In the inner function, the statement can be understood like thissince you are assigning a value to i in this function, Python thinks that you are creating a new variable scoped to this current function. And then when it executes the right hand side expression, i + 1, it finds that i has not been assigned any value before using it. That is why it is throwingTo fix this, you need to explicitly tell Python that you are not creating a new variable, instead, you are accessing a variable from the outer scope, with nonlocal (Python 3.x) like thisNote: If you are using Python 2.x, follow any of the methods mentioned in this question
