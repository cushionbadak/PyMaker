In my code I get a logger from my client, then I do stuff and log my analysis to the logger.I want to add my own prefix to the logger but I don't want to create my own formatter, just to add my prefix to the existing one.In addition I want to remove my prefix once my code is done.From looking at the documentation I could only find ways to create new formatter but not to modify an existing one. Is there a way to do so?
You are correct. As per Python 3 and Python 2 documentation there is no way to reset your format on the existing formatter object and you do need to create a new logging.Formatter object. However, looking at the object at runtime there is _fmt method to get the existing format and it seems tweaking it will work. I tried in 2.7 and it works. Below is the example.Example code:Output:
You can actually set the format through the 'basicConfig', it is mentioned in the Python document: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging-cookbook.html#context-info
