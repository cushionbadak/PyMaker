Natural Text
Here's what I want to do:But it is not possible, TypeError: cannot serialize '_io.TextIOWrapper' object.So I wonder if there is a good method for "cloning" the text variable, so that I could print all the lines again. I know that I could just read the file again, but that answer does not solve the bigger problem I have so any suggestion on how to get this done is helpful.Here's the larger context as I haven't been able to solve my problem with your suggestions:The thing that I want to happen here is that i want to send the portion of swefile that has not been read yet (i.e. iterated over yet by the for loop) to getFurthest()! And I can't send swefile because that will make the whole thing read so the iterations in the for loop will stop, right? So how can I send only the portion of the textfile that has been read to getFurthest() while still being able to iterate over the rest of it after?
If you're trying to avoid re-opening the file, but want to read it twice, you can use seek():If you just care about the text, you can do this:Here text is a list of the lines in wordsv.txt, and you then copy the list into text2 (i.e. changing text won't change text2). 
Alternatively, if you really do want to wind up with two files for some reason, it's best to use shutil.copy to copy it:
Your line text2 = copy.copy(text) does not work because text is a file object only. To "copy" the text in the file, do as follows:Please note that you don't copy the actual text (content), as strings are immutable.
