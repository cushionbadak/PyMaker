How do I convert the output of os.listdir to a list of bytes (from a list of Unicode strs)? It has to work even if the filename is invalid UTF-8, for example:So what do I need to write to the ... above to make it work?Please note that it's not an option to rename the file, to use Python 2.x, or to use ASCII-only filenames in this case. I'm not looking for workarounds, I'm looking for the code in place of the ...s.
Use an error handler; in this case the surrogateescape error handler looks appropriate:Value: 'surrogateescape'Meaning: On decoding, replace byte with individual surrogate code ranging fromU+DC80toU+DCFF. This code will then be turned back into the same byte when the'surrogateescape'` error handler is used when encoding the data. (See PEP 383 for more.)The os.fsencode() utility function uses the latter option; it encodes to sys.getfilesystemencoding() using the surrogate escape error handler when applicable for your OS:Encode filename to the filesystem encoding with 'surrogateescape' error handler, or 'strict' on Windows; return bytes unchanged.In reality it'll use 'strict' only when the filesystem encoding is mbcs, see the os module source, a codec only available on Windows.Demo:
There is also a corresponding os.fsdecode for conversion in the other direction.Docs here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fsencode
If you just want the filenames from os.listdir in bytes, it has that option.  From the docs:path may be either of type str or of type bytes. If path is of type bytes, the filenames returned will also be of type bytes; in all other circumstances, they will be of type str.
