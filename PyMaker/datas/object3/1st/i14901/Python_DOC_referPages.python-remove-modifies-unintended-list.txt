the code above returns:['1111', '1001', '1011']I am a begginer programmer and I want to know why the remove() function also modifies the x list instead of the intended y list? The code is run in python 3.4.2. How do I fix this so that only the y list will be modified?
it's because you copied the reference of x into y.you can create a copy by y = list(x). for example:
Simple - x and y are not lists, they are just references to list. there is some point in memory containing list data and both x and y just know where it is. So when you do y = x and change list referenced by y, this change will be reflected at print(x).
You have to understand the difference between the variable and the what this variable contains. With this: X and y are exactly the same, you have to copy x and make the assignation you can do it this way: y=x[:], this code copy the content of x and assign it to y
