Writing from file_A to file_B using IDLE always makes IDLE print out the lines as they are being written. If the file is very large, then the process would take hours to finish.How can I make IDLE not print anything while the process of writing to a new file is ongoing, in order to speed things up?A simple code to demonstrate that IDLE prints the lines as they are being written:
I assume you are using Python3 where write returns the number of characters written to the file and IDLE's python shell prints this return value when you call it. In Python2 write returns None that is not printed by IDLE's shell.The workaround is to assign the return value of write to a temporary dummy variableFor your example the following code should workI added two screenshots for all of you to see the difference between the writes in Python 2 and Python 3 on my system.
