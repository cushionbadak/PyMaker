I'm taking an online introductory computer science class for Python. A homework problem says the inventor of chess asked for a grain of rice. 1 grain on the first day, 2 on the second, four grains on the third day, eight on the fifth day...all the way to 68 days. I have to create a function that does this, returning the number of grains for the number of squares entered. I believe all I have to do is get the number of squares from user. Add up all the multiples of two up to the point of the user's input then sum by one. I have no idea how to do this. That's whats irritating; you can know what to do, but not how to do it. 
The same can be accomplished by looking at the sequence 1,2,4,8...as 2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3... you can create a simple function  that will give you the amount based on the number of days.
As per your logic the grains start at 1 and keep doubling from the previous dayfirst day: 1 (2**0)second day: 2 (2**1)third day: 4 (2**2)fourth day: 8 (2**3)So on the fourth day there will be a total of 2**0 + 2**1 + 2**2 + 2**3Using the formula:we get 2**(m+1) -1 when x =2So on the fourth day (i.e. m=3 since we started with zero based index) the total grains would be 2**4 -1 =15Based on above logic your function should be:
