Does anyone know a complete tutorial to learn about writing Python or TCL scripts?I want to write a script to load a molecule , make 3 representations of it,and change attributes(like coloring method, drawing method, isovalue, etc) of each of them and finally render the image. I went through this tutorial, but all it teaches to do with a script are toload a molecule and select atoms. http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/tutorial-html/node4.htmlIs there any source to learn to write a script to do more advanced vmd operations? 
For general learning of Tcl, there's the Tcl Tutorial. For general learning of Python, there's The Python Tutorial (Python 2 version). You'll need to pick what route you use there. Then you'll have enough information to look at the VMD documentation and make your own way, provided you're a bit imaginative about how to go about tackling the problem. You can ask here when you've got a specific problem that you've got stuck on; Stack Overflow is about helping with specific problems, not general “where do I start on this project?!” problems.
One possibility is that you first create your representations, change the attributes etc. Then, when you are done, you save the state into a file (File->Save Visualization State...). The file that has been created in this way is a script that you can edit using a normal text editor. For example, you can search and replace the names of the molecule files you loaded, to apply the same representations to other molecules. You can also add the rendering command at the end of the script file, for example:After editing the file you can load it directly in VMD via File->Load Visualization State...Alternatively you can load it when launching VMD :
