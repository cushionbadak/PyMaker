I have a list  of of SQLAlchemy Model attributes. For example:my_list = ['firstName', 'lastName']I also have a person SQLAlchemy Object with firstName and lastName attributes.I want to search query my database for people with a query as follows:session.filter( Person.lastName.like(query+'%') | Person.firstName.like(query+'%')).all()The tricky part is that I want to generate the above filter dynamically from the my_list list. For example if an emailAddress is added to the list I want the query to also search via the objects email property.
With SQLAlchemy this is pretty easy if you know about reduce; use getattr to get the dynamically named column from the Person class.Though or_ also accepts any number of clauses to or together, so you can use argument unpacking too:
