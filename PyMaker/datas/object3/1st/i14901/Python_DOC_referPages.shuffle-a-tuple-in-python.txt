This question already has an answer here:Why does random.shuffle return None?                    9 answers                I define a tuple called states in my test environment. I then wish to step through this tuple in a random manner as I test my system:Each state should only be visited once. Is this the most pythonic way of shuffling my tuple?
Python comes with batteries included. Use random.shuffle on a sequence.You must be aware that random.shuffle operates in place on a mutable sequence, which is why it does not return the list itself.
