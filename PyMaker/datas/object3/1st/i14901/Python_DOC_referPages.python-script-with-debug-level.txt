I'm a newbie. I'm trying a script a 'snmpwalk' in PYTHON which returns list of OID from the starting ID mentioned. I see Python has various options over shell scripts, so I choose this.I need few ideas on how to do and process it.If I execute the script with --debug option it should list all the OIDs in the stdout (I meant the executing screen) &Always it should log the output of the bash commands to a log file.Then I will check for any anomalies. Please someone give me the kickstart on how to proceed.
Python has some great standard libraries that will help you massively with this. For logging, use the aptly-named logging library. Combine that with argparse to detect the debug flag and you got yourself a shell script with customisable log levels.
