So im trying to create my own type of brute force application.I know there are already versions out there on how to do it but i want help with a certain type of way that I'm doing itWhat I have done is make a loop that loops through an array of valueswhich gives all the possible characters (excluding special characters), I'm adding them later.I set a default password each time just for testing purposes this will be changed to the format of what I'm trying to breach at a later date.So what I did was do a for loop that loops through all of the values in poss and if it is equal to the password it will break and print that it's correctThis code here is fine.. if the password is one character.But now I'm faced with the issue of adding a character. eg if I looped through to the end off poss and it still never matched psw how do i make it add a decimal place, eg once it's tried "0" I want it to restart but with a character before like "aa", then "ab" etc.UPDATE:i tryed adding more lists:etc.I then went on and looped the values in:etc.This is one method but again that is long as I'd have to do this for every character in poss and then again for three characters like "aaa"
