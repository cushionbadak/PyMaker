In the examples I saw,argparse all handles just one positional commandline argument, and arbitrarily number of optional commandline arguments. So I wonder if it can handle more than one positional arguments? If yes, how does it do and how are the commandline arguments specified?  Thanks.
So I wonder if it can handle more than one positional arguments? If yes, how does it do and how are the commandline arguments specified?Well, the very first example in the argparse documentation handles multiple non-option arguments.  So that's probably a good place to start.Here's a trivial example; place the following in argtest.py:And then:Or:
yes, On the command lineOutput:Note that you can put the positional arguments after the optional one on the command line:  python argtest1.py -r R 5 'c'. You could also do this:  python argtest1.py 5 -r R 'c'. Obviously you can't do this python argtest1.py -r R 'c' 5.
