There are many questions related to lambda and printing, but I could not find anything about this exact question. I'd like to print the results of my lambda function within a print statement. However, I am getting the wrong output. I am using Python 3This returns:How do I get the actual results of the lambda function?
just call lambda
lambdas are actually functions only. So, unless you invoke them you will not get any result from them. When you doyou are not actually invoking the lambda function, but trying to get the string representation of the function itself. As you can see, the string representation has the information about what the object is and where it is stored in memory.Apart from that, the other problem in your lambda is, you are actually invoking print function in it. It will actually print the result but return None. So, even if you invoke the lambda expression, you will get None printed. For example,But, the good news is, in your case, you don't need lamda at all.The expression,is called conditional expression and will make sure that you will get + if target is equal to prediction, - otherwise.Note: If you are using Python 3.x, you don't need to import print_function from the __future__. It already is a function, in Python 3.x.
