This probably is a really dumb question but when I type an answer, It is the correct answer, but it still says  "incorrect, the answer is....." then prints out the answer I typed to begin with, so it isn't assigning 'rightanswer' to answer'. help?? (this is the newer version of python so the parenthesis are needed)
In Python 3, input() returns a string; strings are never equal to integers or floating point numbers:Convert the answer to an integer or float first before testing it against your calculated CorrectAnswer integer:The int() and float() functions can do this conversion for you, but take into account that they'll raise a ValueError exception if the input is not convertible.See Asking the user for input until they give a valid response if you want to handle incorrect input better, by catching that exception and re-prompting for an answer.If you are going to use float(), take into account that floating point values are approximations, and a user typing in 0.33 while your 1 / 3 expression actually produces 0.3333333333333333 is likely to lead to issues:See What is the best way to compare floats for almost-equality in Python? for approaches to how to handle this.
input will return a string, but CorrectAnswer is a numeric type, such as float. You should convert answer to a float and then compare - if float(answer) == CorrectAnswer
