I'm looking for an alternative to the list.extend() method that works inline.Instead ofI need an equivalend that works inline, likeBut extend does not return the list itself.Is there any fancy out-of-the-box commmand to achieve the same?
Just concatenate these lists with + operator:Or, if you need an iterator and the list is huge, use itertools.chain:A quick note: range creates a range object in Python 3+, which doesn't allow concatenation:Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except  concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can  only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition  and concatenation will usually violate that pattern).
In Python 3+, like @vaultah said, range creates range object. But you can create list from the range object first.
