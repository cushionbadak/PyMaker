In Python there are several built-in functions.  Take open for example open.  I can fire up a Python console and get some info about open by doing the following:But if I were to do something like this:It appears that, for the rest of my console session, all calls to the open function will not use the built-in function but the one in the gzip module.  Is there any way to redefine a built-in function in Python back to the original?  It's easy if I have a reference to the desired function, like below:How do you obtain a reference for built-in functions once those references have been overwritten?
You can simply delete the global:or you can import the __builtin__ module (Python 2) or builtins module (Python 3) to get to the original:Name lookups go first to your global namespace, then to the built-ins namespace; if you delete the global name open it'll no longer be in the way and the name lookup progresses to the built-ins namespace, or you can access that namespace directly via the imported module.
