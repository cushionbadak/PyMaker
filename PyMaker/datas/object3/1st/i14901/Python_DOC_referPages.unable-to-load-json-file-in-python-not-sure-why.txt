I have to load a json file into a python script for part of my homework. Below is the part of the code which loads the JSON file:For some reason, on the json.load(jsonFile) line, the code fails with this error:Does anyone know why this could be? In the interactive python mode I am able to run the load() call without any problem, I am not sure why it wouldnt work when I am executing my script.
webbrowser.open does not load a file from URL; instead it opens a web browser with that page, and returns True (a bool value), which passed to json.load causes an exception being thrown.If you have a file that you want to open, just remove the from webbrowser import open line.
