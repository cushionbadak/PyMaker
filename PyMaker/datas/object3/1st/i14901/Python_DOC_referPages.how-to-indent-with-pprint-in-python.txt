I am trying to indent the output of pprint so that I will get an 8 space indentation with pprint. The code I used is:OutputDesired outputIn short, I need a space indentation when written to file or printed with pprint. I tried but it does not work
You cannot get pprint() to add additional leading indentation, no.Your best option is to use the pprint.pformat() function instead, then add indentation manually:This uses the str.splitlines() method to split the pformat() output in to separate lines for ease of re-joining.In Python 3, indenting can be done with textwrap.indent():
Minor update to Martijn's answer.  No need to use .format() where simple str concat will do.
