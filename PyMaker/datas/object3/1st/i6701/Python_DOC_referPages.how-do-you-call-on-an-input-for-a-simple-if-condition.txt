We just started learning Boolean stuff, and printing certain things if conditions were met. We made a statement (x=5) and a couple of if conditions for if it was greater than or less than, and a subsequent thing to print for it. I want to do the same thing, but with an input, so I made this:I get the error, "TypeError: 'int' object is not callable" in reference to the first line. What do I need to do to get this to work correctly?
In python functions are objects too, and live in the same namespace as any other variable. You very certainly have a variable named input somewhere before in your code that shadows the builtin function, example:
Assuming the you're using any version 3 (or greater) of python.First, you need to properly ident your code, cause, python works with it.In this case, try to apply this modifications to your code:You can convert the input using int cast to your desire type, and check the conditions with if-elif-else statement.
