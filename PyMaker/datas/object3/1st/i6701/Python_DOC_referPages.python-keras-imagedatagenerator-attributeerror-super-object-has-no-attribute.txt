I am trying to write a data generator, and I would like to inherit the ImageDataGenerator object from Keras. The intention is to use some of the image preprocessing capabilities of the Keras module in my own generatorUnfortunately I am still trying to understand how the super classes work and the inheritance thing, so I'm having a hard time debugging my code.When I try to create an object I get the following error:I am referencing a code sample from mratsim on GitHub:[1]https://github.com/mratsim/Amazon_Forest_Computer_Vision/blob/master/src/k_dataloader.pywhere he inherits the same object. I'm guessing it worked for him..
The __init__ method must have the 4 underscores, just like you did in the def part of it. This is a Python pattern, and the parent class also follows this:Off topic: often, class names begin with capitalized letters, to distinguish them from ordinary value vars. So, DataGenerator would be a better name following that recommendation. 
super() works in python 3.x .Probably you are using python 2.x
