OS: JessiePython: 2.7I want to use psutil to terminate my script I am currently executing. My problem is that I would like to kill it with the ID but I don't know how to get the pid of my script. I know I can terminate with the names of processes, but I think thats not a pretty solution.Has anyone an idea how to make this work?I have set up my Pi with the PiCamera, a GUI and some sensors. I am using the cv2 library and the problem is that the windows won't close.Therefore, I googled how to close them but there wasn't any solution I could use. Killing the process is ok for me.EDIT:I found this snippet in the documentation. How can I make this run with pid's?
and How to terminate process from Python using pid?was the answer.
