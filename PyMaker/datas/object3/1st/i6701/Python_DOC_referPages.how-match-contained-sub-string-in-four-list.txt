I have long four list , I want to check if a word in list_1 and if that word in list_2 with another string (but that substring is still exist) same for all four list , if that substring exist in all four list then print.So suppose i have these four list :so i wanted to match 45,32 in list a and in list b also because 345 contain 34 but it also contain 45 345 and 32789 contain 32 and list c contain 3621[45] and 99[32]643 contain 32 and so in list d 19[45]32 contain 45 and 542[32]56 contain 32 so if a substring (example 45) is in all 4 list then print.I tried with "in" method but that doesn't work and then i tried with set() which also doesn't work , How can i do it ?P.S : is there any method without looping all over list ? because this module is submodule of a large program and that program already contain many loops , if possible without loop otherwise all suggestion welcome :)
Google helped me out.Use any("45" in s for s in a) this to check if the number is in list a, and so on. It returns True if it finds it.Edit: Here's an example.
You can use in with any() and all() functions:
Like you described it, its impossible to avoid loops but you can use comprehension lists.For instance:Every any use an iterable to check if the item x exist in any string of the list b, c or d.This construction could be rewritten using list comprehension:You get:
