Might be a bit confusing, but bear with me on this one...I have a python script which pulls AWS SQS messages, decrypts/decompresses them, and places them in a directory as a JSON file for the user to access. The user is now requesting the name of the file to change...right now the file name is the message ID in AWS, and they would like it to be Transaction Number, which is only found inside the file after it is decompressed and decrypted. Here is my script that is running right nowI don't think there is a way for me to add this to this script, but is there another way I can name the file "TransactionNumber".json when the script is complete? Here is the part of the output json I need to pull and put as the file name...just the number as the file name. I was working on a script to pull this numberThen will use this outcome as a variable, then run a rename script using this variable, but can't seem to get it to work. Any other direction I should take on this?
This doesn't make sense:Use if 'transactionNo' in line:, or json.load(), or:
