I'm creating a User class and inside this class I want to create a method that prompts the user for data. How can I use the init paramaters as valid values in the populate() method? Here's my code:And I'd run this method as user1.populate()Thank you.
I would put the query outside of the class:The class would look like this;Usage:
```Using this, a call like user = User() will issue the prompts at terminal. A potentially more useful implementation would beThis way you can initialize a blank User with user = User() and then ask for the prompts with user.populate().(edited to change the first __init__ example.)
Is this what you were looking for?This code allows you to call User.create() which will prompt the questions and return a User object. This is different from your code with this replaced with self because this doesn't require an existing User object but instead creates a new one.Usage:An example of how to do this might be something like this.
