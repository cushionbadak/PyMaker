I have a function that returns a list of integers.In another module i have a for loop that iterates trough the returned list of that function.Now my Question is:does the for-loop call this function every loop or only one time at the begin?
Actually the answer is invoke only once, when you do the following things:my_function(x) will be evaluated first, and then it return a list, so the statement is like this:you can add a print function in my_function body, and you will see that the print function is invoked only once.
This is indeed a duplicate of this question. However, for the sake of a clearer explanation (credit @Nathan) without getting into technical jargon, here is an example:As you can see here, the function a() was only called once when the for loop was run.Hope this helped!
