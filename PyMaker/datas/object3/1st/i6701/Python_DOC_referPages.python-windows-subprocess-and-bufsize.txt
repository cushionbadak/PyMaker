I have a program, which perfectly runs on Linux but - what an miracle- not an Windows.I already fix one bug with sys, and get a new one : I am pretty sure it is something very easy I forgot to try- any hints? Thanks!
The second parameter of Popen constructor should be an integer and you are passing [player["progname"]]
You may want to wrap both sys.executable and player["progname"] in a list.Otherwise, you're passing player["progname"] as the bufsize argument to the Popen constructor (https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor)
