I am trying to split a dataframe into two based on date. This has been solved for a related problem here: Split dataframe into two on the basis of dateMy dataframe looks like this:How do I split it based on date (say before 2008-04-12 and after)? When I try this:where split_date is datetime.date(2008-04-12), I get this error:
from your codewhere split_date is datetime.date(2008-04-12), I get this error   here datetime.date() takes argument as format 2008,4,12 for more. so you should writeand as you sample input the first column has no name so you can follow to access the first column like thiselse you give the column name as "date" or whatever you wantand lastly TypeError: <class 'datetime.date'> type object 2008-04-12This is occurred basically you try this datetime object to the series of dffor more
Here is a solution:Add the label "Date" to the data file for the first column.When you do a comparision such asboth sides must be of same type.
