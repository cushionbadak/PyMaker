I've gotten a little rusty with python. A friend is taking some tests to prepare for his exams and he's given this piece of code: He's asked what will the screen show and the correct answer is 7. How is it 7? I've even written the code and run it. It is 6. Is it a new version returning the number + 1 or something? Or maybe the answers given by their teacher are just wrong.
Neither Python 2 nor Python 3 return 7 (both return 6).The most obvious answer is that it was just a typo by the teacher or your friend when they sent you the example.is equivalent toBoth return the last (= top) element of a stack.With [3,4,5].append(6) you append a 6 to the stack â†’ you push the 6 on top of the stack.Therefore if you executethe result will be 6 and cannot be 7.For a more detailed explanation of how and why lists in python can be used as various datastructures (stack, queue, ...) consider taking a look at the documentation:https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html
I've running your code here, using CMD and python 3.6.2, and this is the output:Surely, the correct answer is 6
The answer that is given by the teacher is wrong. list.pop([i]) - Remove the item at the given position in the list, and  return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the  last item in the list.Take a look at the documentation of popOutput:
This must be a trick questionreturns 6This is because you append 6 to the end or top of the stack / list / array.A pop command follows the last in first out rule which means when  you pop an item from the stack / list /array you will be taking out the last item.Therefore with 6 being the last item appended, when you pop the stack the return will be the last item, in this instance 6
