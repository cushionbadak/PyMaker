Natural Text
I have a text file containing:and a user is required to enter a country from the text file and the program will output the line where the country lies.Lets say:output:     2 #since germany is at line no.2but I'm testing for cases where the user enters:where its lowercase at start. the program will still recognise it's lowercase representation and will still print the line Germany is at.I'm looking for a method that recognises both lowercase and uppercase representation. I've seen examples mentioning to convert the input to uppercase at start but the problem arises if my text file consists of letters with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Maybewill solve your problem?
When comparing string with unknown casing, but requiring only content of the string to be matched, You can use following code:You can convert both string to lowercase and compare their content. Note strip() after getting line. If stored in file, line will contain newline character, so we need to get rid of it.
You can use re.fullmatch() with re.IGNORECASE:This will only match the complete country name, and will ignore the case of the search term.You could also use re.match() to check for a match starting at the beginning of the line, or re.search() to check for a match anywhere in the line.
We will convert the input to lowercase, strip new lines from the file and convert it lowercase, and compare the input with it.Haven't used regular expression as you might not have knowledge of itHave checked this it works:
