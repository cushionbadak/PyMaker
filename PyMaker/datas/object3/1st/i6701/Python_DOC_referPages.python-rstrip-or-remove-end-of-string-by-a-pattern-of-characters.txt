I'm trying to strip the end of the strings in this column. I've seen how to rstrip a specific character, or a set number of characters at the end of a string, but how do you do it based on a pattern?I'd like to remove the entire end of the strings in the 'team' column at where we see a lowercase followed by an upper case. Then remove starting at the uppercase. I would like the below 'team' column:to look like this:
You can use re.sub(pattern, repl, string) for that.Let's use this regular expression for matching:It matches a lowercase character ([a-z]), followed by an uppercase character [A-Z] and any character .*? until it hits two spaces (  ).The lowercase character and the two spaces are in a group, so they can be re-inserted using \1 for the first and \2 for the second group when using re.sub:Output for your example:This messed the space-alignment up. Might not be relevant for you, but if you want to replace the wiped characters with space, you can pass a function instead of a replacement string to re.sub, which takes a Match object and returns a str:And then use it like this (notice how I put the to-be-replaced part into a regex-group too):This produces:
Well, I don't thing it's so easy : because of the spaces which may separate 2 words that should be removed.I suggest, for your problem only, to remove the smallest ending that is also a begging.hum... not very easy to explain.Here is a little function and its test :Try it, I thing you will get what you want...
