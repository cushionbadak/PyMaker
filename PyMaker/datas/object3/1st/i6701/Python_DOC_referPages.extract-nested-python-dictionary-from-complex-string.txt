I have a complex string with a nested dictionary in it. This dictionary further has a list of three similar dictionaries inside it. How do I convert this into a Python dictionary? Please help. Input: 'name: "data dict" id: 2\nv6: false\nstats {\n  hosts {\n    cnt1: 256\n    cnt2: 0\n  }\n  groups {\n    cnt1: 1\n    cnt2: 0\n  }\n  main_groups {\n    cnt1: 1\n    cnt2: 0\n  }\n  main_hosts {\n    cnt1: 256\n    cnt2: 0\n  }\n}\n group_id: "None"'Expected result: {name: "data dict",id: 2,v6: false,stats: {    hosts: {        cnt: 1, cnt: 2    }    groups: {        cnt: 1, cnt: 2    }    main: {        cnt: 1, cnt: 2    }  main_hosts: {    cnt: 1, cnt: 2    }}}
As TS mentioned, there are a string with a nested dictionary (first time I interpret it as an implicit reference to validity). If the string content is valid JSON you can use json built-in package includes all you need to parse it:Read more in JSON package docs.If not, you can write regular expression or use pyparsing package to process this string.
With some editing of your input, it can be loaded by yaml and the data object is as you have requested it, a set of nested dictionaries.How was the input string created ?. The specific edits are :change "data dict" id:" to "data dict"\nid:",change "\n group_id" to  "\ngroup_id"change all { to : ,remove all } .
