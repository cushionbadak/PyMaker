Apologies for the basic question, but it's mainly the data structure of the list_ that is causing me troubles.EG:

Note the different options in Python 2 and 3:CodeThe middle options leverage dictionary views as opposed to lists.  The last option is most Pythonic (suggested by @Yaroslav Surzhikov).TimingsConfirmed in Python 3 (wherever possible) via %timeit -n 100000: 6.58 µs: [list(d.keys())[0] for d in list_] 3.23 µs: [d.keys()[0] for d in list_] 3.97 µs: [next(iter(d.viewkeys())) for d in list_] 4.52 µs: [next(iter(d.keys())) for d in list_] 1.75 µs: [key for d in list_ for key in d] Contribution by @Yaroslav Surzhikov
