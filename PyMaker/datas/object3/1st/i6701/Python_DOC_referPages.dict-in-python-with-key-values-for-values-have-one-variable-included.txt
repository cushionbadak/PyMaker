I have a dict in python with key values and for values I have one variable included in it . I want to change the value of variable at run time. How to do that as it initializes the dict at inital.Suppose it is as:Now if I do as number = 45 somehow calculated. I want to auto-update the dict to as :But dict is updated at initial stage and it is not changing value of number at run time.
ints are immutable in Python, but you could do a similar thing with a mutable structure, like a list:In this case the dict contains a reference to the mutable list, so the dict is updated when the list changes.

you can use list of list
