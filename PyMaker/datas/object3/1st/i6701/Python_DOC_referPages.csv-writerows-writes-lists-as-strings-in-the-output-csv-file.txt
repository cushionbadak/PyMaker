I am trying to write a script that takes a dictionary whose items are lists, and write those lists to a CSV file. The code I have is as follows:The output CSV file takes the form of All the lists are enclosed in quotation marks, making them a string. I wish for them to remain as lists so when I read them, python detects them as lists, not strings. What have I been missing that causes this issue?I am using python 3.6
csv module writerow takes a sequence as input (list or tuple are ok). For each item it converts them to their string representation, which is fine for integers & floats (and strings).But for lists, it's not what you're expecting.Solution: just create your row by adding the lists together:with your data, the file now contains:
This may not directly solve your problem but if you have a list like a = ["[1, 2, 3, 4]","['round', 'square']","[100, 1000]"]Then following will surely be handy:From literal_eval you can always convert strings back to their original form.
