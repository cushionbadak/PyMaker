Say that we have two dictionaries:And that we need to compute a third dictionary that has the same keys as d1, and for values the sum of the values in d2 that correspond to those keys that are, in turn, values ind1.Example:where 5 is assigned to A because it is the sum of the values of a,b,c, which are assigned to A in d1.My attempt:returns:NameError: global name 'j' is not definedSorry for the trivial question, but what am I missing here?
It's simpler than that if you use dict.items():
