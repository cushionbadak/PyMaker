This question already has an answer here:What is a subtraction function that is similar to sum() for subtracting items in list?                    2 answers                What I want to do is subtract all the items in that list by order:
You could use the reduce() function:Or using operator.sub instead of the lambda:Note that in Python 2.x reduce() is a built-in, so you don't need to import it.
You can iterate through the array and subtract:Or, as vaultah pointed out:
With itertools.accumulate and operator.sub functions:This not pretends to be better than posted functools.reduce() solution, but gives an additional feature - intermediate subtraction results for each pair (the 1st item stays as starting point):
Yet another way of doing it, assuming items as input list.
