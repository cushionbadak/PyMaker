Hello every one I'm trying to convert below code to python (Accessing the raspberry pi 1Mhz timer), I'm stuck when to mmap object we need to + TIMER_OFFSET (timer = (long long int *)((char *)st_base + TIMER_OFFSET);) when I try to do it in Python I got SystemError: mmaps don't support concatenation. I was looking for convert mmap object but I find nothing, Can we fight this ?  It is possible to convert whole this code to python? I mean now I have second  thoughts about it ? Python code (for now I skip this ifs) : 
Almost good  :) Just unpack_from instead off unpack
The mmap object in Python is rather different from pointers in C. The mmap object behaves rather like a bytearray, with some extra methods. However the bytearray interface is the most useful here. The C code adds an offset to the base address to get a pointer to the first byte of the timer value, then converts this to a pointer to a long long int. In Python we can do a similar thing by slicing a part of the bytearray, specifically sizeof (long long int) bytes starting from the offset, and using the struct module to decode the value.Thus we get something like
