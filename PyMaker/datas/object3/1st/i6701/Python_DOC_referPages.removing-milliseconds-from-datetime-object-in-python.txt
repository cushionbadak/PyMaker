I am trying to remove the milliseconds(28109) from this string 2017-09-12 22:33:55.28109 in Python. code:Error:TypeError: must be str, not datetime.datetime
You already have a datetime object, you do not need to parse it again. The datetime.fromtimestamp() call was enough.Remove the datetime.strptime() line. I also changed your strftime() call, it is a method, you just call it on the datetime object you have.I suspect that you printed the return value of the datetime.fromtimestamp() call, and got confused. The str() conversion of a datetime() instance formats the value as a ISO 8601 string. Note that even if you did have a string, you used the wrong format (there is no timezone in that string, so %Z does not apply).If you needed a datetime object, rather than a formatted string, you could also just have converted your timestamp to an integer; the microseconds are captured in the decimal portion of the timestamp:
You can use time as well to achieve what you want.'09/12/2017 10:33:55 PM'
