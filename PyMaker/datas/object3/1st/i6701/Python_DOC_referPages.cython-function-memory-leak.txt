I have converted a python function to a cython one. Now the function works as it is supposed to. But I am getting a lot of memory leak when the main program calls this function multiple times. I have freed the memory that I allocated dynamically, but it does not seem to work.What am I doing wrong here?
PyUnicode_AsWideCharString allocates memory that you have to free. The documentation saysReturns a buffer allocated by PyMem_Alloc() (use PyMem_Free() to free it) on success.You get two strings from this function but free neither of them.
