I am learning python and doing an exercise about classes. It tells me to add nd attribute to my class and a method to my class. I always thought these were the same thing until I read the exercise. What is the difference between the two?
TerminologyMental model:A variable stored in an instance or class is called an attribute.A function stored in an instance or class is called a method.According to Python's glossary:attribute: A value associated with an object which is referenced by  name using dotted expressions. For example, if an object o has an  attribute a it would be referenced as o.amethod: A function which is defined inside a class body. If called as  an attribute of an instance of that class, the method will get the  instance object as its first argument (which is usually called self).  See function and nested scope.ExamplesTerminology applied to actual code:
A method is an attribute, but not all attributes are methods. For example, if we have the classThis class has two attributes, class_name and my_method. But only my_method is a method. Methods are functions that belong to your object. There are additional hidden attributes present on all classes, but this is what your exercise is likely talking about.
A method is a function defined in the class. An attribute is an instance variable defined in the class. Example:Here hello is a method, and name is an attribute.
