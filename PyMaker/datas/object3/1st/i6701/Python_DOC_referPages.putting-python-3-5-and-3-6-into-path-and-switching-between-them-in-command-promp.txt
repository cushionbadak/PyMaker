I seek to be able to type something likepython36or python35in the command prompt to be be able to run 3.6 or 3.5 shells, respectively. When I type python in the command prompt, it only opens a 3.5 shell, and if I try to specify 3.6 by typing python3.6 or python3.5 or python36 or python35, it doesn't recognize the commands. For both installations, I checked the "Add to my path" box, and have since tried to manually add them to my path using system settings/advanced/environment variables, etc, but it's not clear to me how to best do this.I am using Windows 7.
You can add both folders to your environment variables and then copy each python.exe to python35.exe or python36.exe depending on version.Then you can execute it using python35 or python36 to execute different versions.For example:Navigate to python3.5 folderLook for python.exe file and make a copy of it named python35.exeYou can use python35 in cmd now to run 3.5 version of PythonDo the same for 3.6 and you're done.
If you followed anything close to a normal installation process, you will have installed the Python Launcher for Windows. This is invoked by the py command. To run a particular version of installed Python, use - followed by the version:orWhen invoked without any parameters, py will call the "default" Python, which would be whichever one you installed last.
