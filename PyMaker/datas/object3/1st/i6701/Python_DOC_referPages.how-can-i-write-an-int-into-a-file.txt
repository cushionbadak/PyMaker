When I try to write into another file, I get an error saying:How can I write an int to a file? Below is my current code
write() takes only string as argument. Convert sum to string.However, you should read file I/O.
You cannot write an integer directly to a file. you have to convert the int into a string using str function and then write it to the file
Yes, you can't simply write the integer to file and it will be written in string form.However, If you want value to be stored as it is (in your case, it's an integer) and later want to retrieve it, then you can use pickle module of pythonSo give pickle a try and let your values stored in the format that you want them to stored in filehttp://effbot.org/librarybook/pickle.htm [pickle introduction]
