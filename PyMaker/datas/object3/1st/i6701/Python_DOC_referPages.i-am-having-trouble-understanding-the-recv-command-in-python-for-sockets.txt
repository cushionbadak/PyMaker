If I do s.recv(6) does that receive the first 6 bytes of data? I am looking at the documentation, and getting confused.
bufsize value in recv sets maximum amount of data received. So - yes, you will receive first 6 bytes or less (it depends of actual  length of data).Additional information here and here
