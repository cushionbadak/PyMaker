I want two thread, that's say thread1 and thread2. thread1 takes 'c++' as input, and output ['c', '+', '+'], put it in a list, that's say res;and thread2 takes 'python' as input, and output ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], put it in res. So after processing, res will be  [['c', '+', '+'], ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']], not [['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], ['c', '+', '+']]. The logic is like the following code, but I want a thread version code.
You are probably best off using queue object, which is designed for passing messages between threads. In particular, if you call the get() method on the queue, but the queue is currently empty, it will wait until a message becomes available. You will need a queue for each of your two worker threads, and also a third for the original thread to get results. I'm afraid I'm not going to write your code for you! But the example on the page I linked to illustrates how to use that class. 
but this task could be done easily this way:
