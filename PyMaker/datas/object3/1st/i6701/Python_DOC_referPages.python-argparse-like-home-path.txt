I have a question, where I can't find an answer for. This is my codeblock:How can I access the '--home-path' argument like the test argument?
Just replace the - with _ in the attribute name:This behavior is documented under dest in ArgumentParser.add_argument():For optional argument actions, the value of dest is normally inferred  from the option strings. ArgumentParser generates the value of dest by  taking the first long option string and stripping away the initial --  string. If no long option strings were supplied, dest will be derived  from the first short option string by stripping the initial -  character. Any internal - characters will be converted to _ characters  to make sure the string is a valid attribute name.
