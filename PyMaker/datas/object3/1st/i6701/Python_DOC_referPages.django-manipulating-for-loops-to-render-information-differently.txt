Natural Text
On Instagram/Facebook underneath a post, you'll see text like 'Person 1, Person 2 & 10 others liked this post'. I was wondering how this same effect may be achieved using Django for a website?Normally, I would use a for loop like so to loop through all of the likers names;However, this doesn't allow me to achieve the desired effect as previously mentioned and will certainly be too long when the number of likers gets into the hundreds. Any ideas on how to do this? Thank you!
You would have to handle that logic yourself, for example in a model method (see below).Basically, you want to return a different string based on how many people liked the Post. For each case, either return nothing (0 likes), a joined list of people who liked it (1 - 3 likes) or a joined list of the first three people who liked it and the remaining like count (> 3 likes).
Writing a model method may be your best solution as per @olieidel's answer  however if you do want to just do this in the template, use of the below snippet may help.
