This question already has an answer here:Group by multiple keys and summarize/average multiple values of a list of dictionaries                    1 answer                I'm trying to group up the name key values here as a key for a dict value, and count the source value as a key for said parent key, and have the count value with as its value. How do I achieve the below output?{'Gill': {'foo':3, 'bar':5}, 'Dave': {'foo':4, 'egg':7}}I think it may be possible with a 1 liner...
Use itertools.groupby to group by names, then collections.Counter to count the source categories belonging to each name:
This is obviously not a one-liner, but is simple and pretty straight forward. Would work for any number of values.
