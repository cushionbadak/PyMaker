It is also possible that list has 7 '' and just one item is a string.
You can just use any with the list as argument :If there's any element which is truthy (i.e. non empty), it will return True.
It seems you want to filter empty strings from a list:I want a solid Condition which satisfies that if a list has an item which is a string and not ''The condition is if item.  To clarify, '' is an empty string.  During iteration, if the item is '', the condition is False and thus the item is excluded from the result.  Otherwise, the condition is True and the result is added to the list. See also this post.This behavior is because all objects in Python have "truthiness" - all objects are assumed True except for a few, such as False, 0, "", None and empty collections.
I need a condition which is satisfied if there are no '', in the  string.You can use all for checking this. 
The easiest way to see if there is not a '' in your list is to use not in:Which would display:
