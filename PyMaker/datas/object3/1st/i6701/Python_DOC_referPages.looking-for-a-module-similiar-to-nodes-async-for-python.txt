My use case is pretty simple; I have an asynchronous function (calling AWS KMS for decryption) that I need to run multiple times, in parallel. In Node, I would simply use the async package's each function. However, I'm unfamiliar with how Python handles asynchronicity. Time is short here, so ideally whatever package I used would be easy to setup, and would have a function similar to the above: loop through an array of data and perform a parallel, asynchronous task on each of it's items.Thanks much for your help!
you can user python module asyncio task
