Below is a minimal working example. I have tested this with Python 3.4, Python 3.6 32 bit and Python 3.6 64 bit.Result:I have just upgraded lxml version to 4.0.0. (But the same is the issue with 3.7.)I need to export with C14N method, and (although not included in the example) I also need to specify a list of namespaces that need to appear in the resulting canonical form. E.g. I must use the inclusive_ns_prefixes parameter too.UPDATE: actually, it seems to be a problem with Python's built in xml module, not lxml.Here is the method I'm calling:https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/xml/etree/ElementTree.py#L721It does have a short_empty_elements parameter, but it does not accept it.
The default_namespace and short_empty_elements parameters are not supported by the _ElementTree.write() method in lxml. See http://lxml.de/api/lxml.etree._ElementTree-class.html#write.However, both parameters are available in the ElementTree standard module since Python 3.4. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree.write.
