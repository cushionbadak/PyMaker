I've created a function which can take a parameter which defines another call to manipulate a list.  For example if I call sliprotor(Rotorid1, 1) directly, then the Rotorid1 list is manipulated as I want.  Function below:However, if I try to call this 'indirectly' by building the list name and then executing it, 'rotorid' is not translated to the value, as it is when called directly.The way I am doing this is So the 'indirect' call doesn't pass the value created by the set_curr_rotor function into the sliprotor function.  The direct call does use the passed in value. If I look in debug, you can see that it is directly calling rotorid[] as the list, not Rotorid1 or other Rotoridx and hence I get an index error.....  File "", line 3, in sliprotor    rotorid[movers-1+offset_qty]=rotorid[movers-1]IndexError: string index out of rangeI could restructure the way I have the code, but I would prefer not to.  Is there some method / scope issue I am missing?  Is this just an intrinsic attribute of Python?  I'm very new to Python so I'm just doing an exercise to model an Enigma machine.Any help appreciated.Ed
I'll assume that you have defined your rotors already, something like this:And now you're reluctant to change this, because ... reasons.That's fine. But you're still wrong. What you need to do is to create a larger data structure. You can do it like this:Now you have a list-of-lists. The Rotors variable now contains all the various Rotorid variables. (Well, it references them. But that'll do.)Instead of passing in the variable name as a handle to the rotor, you can simply pass in an index number:Also, be sure an look up slicings in Python - you can do a lot by manipulating sublists and substrings using slices.
