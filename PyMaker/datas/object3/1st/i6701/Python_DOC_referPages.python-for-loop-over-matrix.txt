I have a problem with a small python program to cross-match two arrays. As a side note, I'm learning to code in Python in these days, so I assume I'm making some incredibly trivial mistake here.Basically, I want to open two .txt files, create a 2D array from each of them, and compare them to see if they have common elements.So far, I did something like thisbut I'm getting the generic errorI thought the problem might be thatdoesn't return an int (which should be the argument of the function range()), and I tried to change the two for loops tobut I'm still getting the same error. Any suggestions?
Any for loop should end with a colon (:). The colon is required primarily to enhance readability. Python docs explicitly mention here
