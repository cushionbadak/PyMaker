Can someone explain this!  why it does showing 'list' instead of 'set' .After i run the program without the sorted method it shows up class 'set.
sorted(..) is a function that constructs a list. It does not take into account the type of the "source", it takes an iterable as input and constructs a list with that input. Or as is documented:Return a new sorted list from the items in iterable.Since sorted(..) is implemented by Python itself, and does not takes advantage of some protocol of the class itself, it would even be impossible to construct a collection type that is sorted for every collection type.Furthermore the sets in Python are unodered: if you construct a set with elements, there is no guarantee that that order will be the same as the insertion order, nor that the order will be the same when you update the set.
