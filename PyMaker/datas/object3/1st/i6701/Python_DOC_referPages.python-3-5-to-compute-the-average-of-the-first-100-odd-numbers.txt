How can I compute the average of the first 100 odd numbers using the below code?Where i is the initial number,b= sum of the first 100 odd numbersa is the average of the first 100 odd numbers.
Use the mean() function from the statistics module, built in to Python 3. You can generate a sequence of odd numbers using range():Then, If you are not able to use statistics.mean() you can combine range(), sum() and len():And here's a way to do it using just range():If you can't use range():
Please check :
The solution is a 1 byte longAverage sum of first n odd numbers is nTherefore the average is just n^2/n = nIn your case the answer is 100.In terms of codedef avgOfFirsrtNOdd(n): return n
you can use the following code
b = sum of the first 100 odd numbers a = average of the first 100 odd numbers
