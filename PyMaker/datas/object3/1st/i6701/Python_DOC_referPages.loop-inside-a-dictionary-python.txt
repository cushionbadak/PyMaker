I am just starting learning Django and Python... It's been 2 months. I'm doing one of my own personal projects and i have a section where i am querying a webservice and passing back the result to the templates.The webservice is returning a dictionary like below. I am expecting to iterate the list inside the dictionary and create my own dictionary like the below:d = {'First Name': 'John', 'Last Name': 'Doe', 'Age': '25' }I am not sure what am i missing, can someone please help me with learning how to build my dictionary?
Caveat be aware of ordering rules for values method for dictionaries. Ordering rules 2.x documentation and 3.x documentation.EDIT2:To prevent any weirdness with dictionary ordering and the provided solution, wrap your data into an OrderedDict:dict() is a nice option for something like this:output:
Try a dict comprehension and build a new dictionary with key-1 as the  key andkey-2` as the value.Result{'Age': '25', 'First Name': 'John', 'Last Name': 'Doe'}
