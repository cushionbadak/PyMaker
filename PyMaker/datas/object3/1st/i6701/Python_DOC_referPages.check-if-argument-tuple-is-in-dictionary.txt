I'm really struggling on unpacking and iterating over the tuples in this dictionary.  Essentially, the function takes a two coordinate position (Wx, Wy) and checks to see if it is in one of the tuples located in either list, in the dictionary, bonuses.  I feel like I'm overthinking it, or am just way off.Thanks :)
You can use itertools.chain() :Demo:This works because chain(), when combined with the * unpacking operator applied to bonuses.values(), effectively flattens the dictionary's values into a single list for which membership can easily be tested with in.Your function can be simplified further if you have it return a boolean:
You can compare tuple to tuple directly:1- iterate over the values of the dictionary.2- check if pos is in the values, and return True if it is3- if pos was not found anywhere, return False
You can just do this instead. (Assuming pos is a single tuple)
