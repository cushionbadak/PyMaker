Let's say my local ip is 10.212.97.23 and my Subnet Mask is 255.255.254.0According to that, I'm in the same subnet with 10.212.96.* and CIDR would be 10.212.96.0/23So my question is: Is there any python library which takes local ip and subnet mask and calculates the CIDR value? I checked netaddr library but couldn't find this functionality
The basic count in CIDR can be computed manually using the below function without using any libraries:Let me know if it is helpful.
If you want to do it with a module, the ipaddress module can help:Docs here.
