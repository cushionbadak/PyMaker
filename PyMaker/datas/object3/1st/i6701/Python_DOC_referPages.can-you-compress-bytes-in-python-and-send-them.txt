I am writing a TCP python script, and I need the first 4 bytes to be the size of the file.I got the size of the file by doing The size is 392399 bytes.When I doit sends the file, and then on my server I haveThis should read the first 4 bytes, and extract the file size information, but it returns 3923 instead of the 392399.as the file size... what happened? "392399" should be able to fit into 4 bytes.We are suppose to be using big endian.
This is because str(SIZE_OF_FILE) typesets the number using decimal notation - that is, you get the string "392399", which is 6 characters (and 6 bytes in UTF-8). If you send only the first 4, you are sending "3923".What you probably want to do is use something like struct.pack to create a bytestring containing the binary representation of the number.
You are sending the size as a string ("392399"), which is 6 ASCII characters and therefore 6 bytes. You want to send it as a raw integer; use struct.pack to do that:To recieve:The > makes it big-endian. To make it little-endian, use < instead. i is the type; in this case, a 4-byte integer. The linked documentation has a list of types, in case you want to use another one.
