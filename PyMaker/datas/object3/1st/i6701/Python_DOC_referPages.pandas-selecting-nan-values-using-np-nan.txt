Natural Text
So I found out that the float NaN apparently doesn't equal itself. My question is how to deal with it. Let's start with a dataframe:So test1 and test2 aren't the same. Many others have mentioned that we should use pd.isnull(). My question is, is it safe to just use isin()? For example, if I need to create a new column using np.where, can I simply do:Or should I always use pd.isnull like so:
You should always use pd.isnull or np.isnan if you suspect there could be nans.For example suppose you have an object-dtype column (unfortunately these aren't uncommon):Then using isin won't give you correct results:While isnull still works correctly:Given that NaN support isn't explicitly mentioned in Series.isin nor DataFrame.isin it might just be an implementation detail that it correctly "finds" NaNs. And implementation details are always bad to rely on. They could change anytime...Aside from this, it always pays off to be explicit. An explicit isnull or isnan check should be (in my opinion) preferred.
