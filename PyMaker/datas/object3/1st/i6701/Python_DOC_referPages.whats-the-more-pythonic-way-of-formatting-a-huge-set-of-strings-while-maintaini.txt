Natural Text
I'm working on a Mad Lib project. I have a whole story that I would like to print but I get unwanted indentions whenever I use triple quotes to define my strings. When I try to get over this by removing the tabs and spaces that I use to keep it neat and readable, it just looks unpleasant. I ended up going with the code below but I was thinking that maybe there's a better way to do this. Will there be a more pythonic way of doing formatting this?The code that I ended up with:At first I was doing it like this but it ended up with unwanted new lines and indentions:
You can use format with Accessing arguments by name, see the documentation.Try:And you can reuse the name argument in format to be more flexible:
Try the new style for formatting using the format() method. Which works like this:
@CtheSky 's answer is OK, but I prefer using Template from string, it has a method safe_substitute which can handle the case if some keys are missing, no exception will be raised.
There are at least two common ways how to avoid extra indentation in triple quoted text.Write the text starting from column 0:Which is arguably ugly.Or use dedent. An example is included in the link.
