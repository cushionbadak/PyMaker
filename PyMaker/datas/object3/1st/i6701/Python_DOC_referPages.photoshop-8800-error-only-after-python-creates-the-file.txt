I have a bit of a weird situation that I will try to explain the best I can. I am using Python to launch photoshop and run a javascript file. But my goal is for python to generate the javascript first, then run it in photoshop. In order to do that I have python copying the javascript file, then replacing a single line of code and running this new copy.When I run the original javascript file it works as intended with no problems. When I run the copied javascript file it works as intended with no problems.When I run the copied javascript file that has the line replaced, it gives me an 8800 error.At this point, even if I manually type the replaced line to match the original javascript file. I will still get an 8800 error. Does python somehow write files differently? Here is the code I am using to replace the copy and replace the javascript contents:Any ideas?SIDE NOTE: I am only doing this because I have no idea how to pass an argument from python into the javascript file I am subprocess calling. I would much rather send an argument to the javascript file than build new files enitrely.
If you'd rather send an argument to the Photoshop script, I'd recommend using interprocess communication.  You can use the socket module in Python and the Socket object in Extendscript to send messages back and forth.  Check out External Communications Tools in the Adobe Tools Guide for more information.
