Above is the code I used for finding factorial and since the maximum recursion limit depth is '997', I tried to change that using :- import sys   sys.setrecursionlimit()But it still gives error. What else can I do ?
The calling frame also counts. For fact(10), you need 11 frames. Passing in a long integer causes some additional work further down the line, requiring another frame. Add two to the count:Add more if you have other frames calling the code calling the fact() function. Note that there really is no point in calling long() on the input first; Python will produce a long object if needed automatically.That said, I'd not muck with the recursion limit. Set it to a high value once, perhaps, but don't keep adjusting it.A better idea is to not use recursion:or better still, don't re-invent the wheel and use math.factorial() instead. From Python 3.2 onwards, the Python implementation uses a binary split factorial algorithm (plus a table for the first 21 or so results).
This works perfectly and we can increase the limit  > 997
