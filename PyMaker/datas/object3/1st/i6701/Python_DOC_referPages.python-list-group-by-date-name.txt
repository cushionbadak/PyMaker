You can use itertools.groupby():Output:   
You could use Pandas to do thisWhich will give you:(note you shouldn't name your variable 'list', as this overrides the built in type)
You can use defaultdict:Btw, it's not good to use list as a name of a variable. 
You can also use pandasAlso, don't call your lists, list
