Natural Text
I am trying to extract information from some tables in a pdf document. Consider the input:I can get the outlines/titles as such:This gives me:Which is perfect, as the levels are aligned with the text hierarchy. Now I can extract the text as follows:Which gives me:Which is a bit weird as the table is extracted in a column-wise fashion. Would it be possible for me to get the table row by row?

If you only want to extract tables from PDF documents, then look at this answer: How to extract table as text from the PDF using Python?From that answer, I have tried tabula-py which worked for me with tables of figures spread over multi-page PDF. tabula-py skipped properly all the headers and footers. Previously I had tried PDFMiner on this same type of document, and I had the same problem you mentioned, and sometimes even worse.
