I am just starting up Python!!i want to make a CSV file where i have a dictionary and i want to print each member of it in its own column in the same row. like i have an array of dictionaries and i want each row to represent one of them and each column of each row to represent an item inside.the thing i output now is a row which contains the data in the first dictionary, i just want them seperated, each in its own column within its row.
It is surprising there are so many questions here that try to fill in some data in while loop and input() command. In all the fairness, this is not python best use case.Imagine you had the dictionary just filled in your code:After that you can export to csv easily:Note there are many questiona about csv module on SO as well as there are examples in documentation.
