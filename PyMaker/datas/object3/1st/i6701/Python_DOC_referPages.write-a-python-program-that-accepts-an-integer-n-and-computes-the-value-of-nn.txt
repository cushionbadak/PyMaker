In this program, why is two string required for n2? Also how having %(n,n) give a result of 55 and total of 60 if we put 5 as our n? I just didn't get the idea of having % so much. 
You don't want to convert the integers to a string, as it is inconvenient to convert them back and forth. Keep them as integers.
In this code we have to write %s two times in n2 as we are computing nn so basically if n=5 then nn=55 and hence you get sum of 60
%s is a python string formatting operator. You can learn more about it from official documentation. It takes a variable from the right hand side and concatenates to the string in the given location. IE: 'My age is %s, nice to meet you' % (20) would give you 'My age is 20, nice to meet you' as a string. You can use multiple string formatting operators for more complex formatting.The code you've pasted gets an input from user, converts to integer with the following line:For simplicity sake let's say user enters 5. Next line formats it to a string (for some unnecessary reason) and converts it to an integer again. So n1 is integer 5.Next line formats two 5's into a string, resulting in 55 and converts it to integer.So now we have two integers n1 and n2 which are 5 and 55. So summing them up gives you the result 60.For future reference, format() method is newer so somewhat more preferred. And the code you pasted can be written in a much more compact and simpler way, assuming you typed that as a reference I didn't fix anything.
% and format are string formatters for python. Take python 2.7 for example, you can use % like:or use format like:I suggest you have a read of PyFormat: Using % and .format() for great good!
If by n+nn you mean something like n=56+5656, For n=56, just do:
