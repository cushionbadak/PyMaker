This question already has an answer here:How to display a sequence of numbers in column-major order?                    1 answer                I'm trying to print a table in the second function from the list I created in the first function. My current code doesn't line up properly when printing to the console, and it also prints in order from "left to right" across each row instead of "top to bottom" down each column. I don't know what I need to change in my displayPrimes() function.

I've got a solution that's probably not so easy to understand for a beginner, but it allows you to specify the number of columns. There's a grouper recipe in the itertools docs which you can use to split an iterable into n-sized groups/tuples. If you figure out how many items there are per column (items_per_column = math.ceil(len(primes)/columns)) you can pass this number to the grouper and then use this zip trick to transpose the returned iterable: zip(*iterable). Here's a demonstration of this idiom:The solution:Printing more than 10 columns or very large numbers messes up the table.
