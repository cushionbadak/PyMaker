I have sliced the pandas dataframe.How to get rid of end_date's index value 48173 and get only 2017-09-20 04:47:59 string? I have to call REST API with 2017-09-20 04:47:59 as a parameter, so I have to get string from pandas datetime64 series. How to get rid of end_date's index value 48173 and get only datetime object [something like datetime.datetime.strptime('2017-09-20 04:47:59', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]. I need it because, later I will have to check if '2017-09-20 04:47:59' < datetime.datetime(2017,1,9) I need to convert just a single cell value, not a whole column.How to do these conversions?
It seems you need:df will be:After that you can use below code to get rid of index and use as 'Timestamp' object:
Simply cast the result to a string, and recover it using .values[0]:If you want a datetime object, you have to convert it to a timestamp, and then back to a datetime object:Otherwise, you can strptime the string recovered in step 1:You may wonder why there is a 2 hours difference between the results. This is because the datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp takes my timezone into account (currently CEST, which is UTC+2).On the other hand, parsing a string to a datetime object doesn't yield any timezone information, srtptime naively parses the timestamp without regards for the timezone, which leads to a 2 hours discrepancy.
