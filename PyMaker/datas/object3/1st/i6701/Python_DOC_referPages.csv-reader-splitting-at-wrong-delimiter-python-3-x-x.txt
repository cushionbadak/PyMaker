This is probably definitely my fault, but my comma separated value reader seems to be splitting on the wrong delimiter. I'm trying to make it separate time values like "3:00" into a list like ["3", "00"] and then compare those numbers to another list the same format. CSV Reader:I then use the self.surface_rows as so:time_to_find is taken from s and s is s = input() and then it is split s.split(":")What I get vs. What I wantApparently my time_found is "0" and not "1:30" or "1:25" and so it can't be split anymore and nothing really changes except it's a one item list now (["0"]). Now I want something like time_found to be "1:30" into which it becomes ["1", "30"]My CSV FileThe csv file is stored in a .txt file and can be found here
