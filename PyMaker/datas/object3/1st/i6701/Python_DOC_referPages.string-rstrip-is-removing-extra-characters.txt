Why does this statement remove the 'E' in 'PIPELINE':But this statement does not remove the 'S':This statement removes all of the E's at the end:When I turn the rstrip into 2 separate statements, it works fine:
rstrip removes any trailing instances of the characters you supply from the string you apply it on until it finds something that doesn't match. This is stated in its documentation:The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are strippedUsing rstrip('_DEV') it will remove _DEV from the string and then all Es (or 'D's or 'V's or '_'s) since those fall in the character set you've given (and no other character that isn't in that set has been found).When you use .rstrip('DEV').rstrip('_') the first call to rstrip strips off 'DEV' and then stops because '_' isn't in the character set 'DEV'. '_' is then removed when the second call to rstrip is made.
