I am quite new to python and I was trying to make two arrays or matrices, register them into a dictionary, save to a json file. Here is my codeBut I get the following error: Object of type 'ndarray' is not JSON serializable
First convert it to the python list like this:and then try to dump it as a json:
The best and easiest way of doing this is:
First correct your data.Correct data:json_data = {    'array_1': array_1,    'array_2': array_2 }There is a extra ',' at the end of the line (array_2). That is the reason you are getting JSON serialization issue.
