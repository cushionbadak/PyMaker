Natural Text
I am working on a script in which I have a text file that contains name likeAnd I have a folders like:abc   bcd   defThe script should rename the folder to the filename with underscore if the name is similar.So that my folders will also become likeSo far I Have written this:
The following should work for you:Note:with statement allows you to make sure that the file would be closed even is an exception is raised.
Changing folders name is as simple as os.rename(old, new):I've also changed the code to with to open as it closes it automatically once done.I referred the path so the rename explicitly works on full path.
