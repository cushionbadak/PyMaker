This question already has an answer here:Make Python Sublists from a list using a Separator                    4 answers                Let say I have this list:I want to end up with:So, I want to split the list into sub-lists based on the space that in there in list1.
itertools.groupby is the perfect weapon for this, using the str.isspace property to separate the groups, and filtering out the groups with space.result:if you know there are 3 variables (which is not very wise) you could unpackbut it's better to keep the result as a list of lists.
You could do this using a for loop, putting the resulting sublists in a dictionary (as opposed to creating variables on the fly):
Well, you can use itertools module to group items according the fact they are space or not.For instance, you can use str.ispace function as a predicate to group the items:You get:Based on that, you can construct a list by excluding the groups which key is True (isspace returned True):You get this list of lists:If you are not familiar with comprehension lists, you can use a loop:You can unpack this result to 3 variables:
is there something relevant to str.isspace but for the new line, i.e.  instead of the space on the list it will be "\n"?str.join + re.split() solution on extended example:The output:
Just for fun. If you know that the words don't have any space, you can pick a special character (e.g. '&') to join and split your strings:If you want the most reliable solution, pick the groupby one.
