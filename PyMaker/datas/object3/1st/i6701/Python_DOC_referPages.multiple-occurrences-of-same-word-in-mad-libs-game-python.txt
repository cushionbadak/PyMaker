Natural Text
I'm trying to make a Mad Libs game where the user enters in words that occurs multiple times in the sentence. At the moment I'm finding that the user is required to type in these same words multiple times. When you run the code I want the user to only enter GENRE_OF_MUSIC once and for the Mad Libs sentence to use that entry only for each occurrence. 
You're not tracking the replacements to handle duplicate keywords.You could change the code to loop through your keywords:
You're on the right track. What you're not doing is tracking what words you've already changed to what value.I'd recommend checking out Dictionaries in Python and using them. They work in key-value pairs, which is perfect for what you want.For a working version of what you want, check these edits out:
I would suggest using string formatting instead of search-and-replace.Here's how it could work:
Your code is unnecessary too complex.First, you can ask the user the parts of speech to replace. You can do that with a loop over parts_of_speech and store each user input into a mapping:Then you can split the sentence and replace each word by the user replacement, if it exist. If not, you keep the word:You get:Note: word_in_pos function is useless.
