Natural Text
I'm aware I can add it to a particular class or its instance using the setattr method. But in my case I want to dynamically "add" it to say a utilities.py module in a way that every file that does 'import utilities' sees this new function.
let's call your "new function" new_func(). I'm not quite sure which of the following you mean:import utilities will make utilities.new_func() available  ORimport utilities will make new_func() available without the utilities prefix.If it's the former:Just put the function inside the module somewhere in that module's top-level namespace. In other words def new_func() should not be indented at all.If it's the latter:You are out of luck; you'll need to change import utilities to from utilities import * which is not recommended and would be just as much work as explicitly importing new_func().
