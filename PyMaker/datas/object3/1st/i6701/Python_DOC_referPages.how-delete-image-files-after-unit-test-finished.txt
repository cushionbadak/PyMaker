In unit test I create 3 objects (articles) at the beginning. After test complete I notice that there are 3 images in media_root folder.Question: How to delete that images which was created after test finished?P.S. I tried to use next code but it delete media_root folder.NOTE: Problems in methods test_article_form_valid and test_article_crud.tests.py:ERROR:
Use tempfile module in python, use it as settings.MEDIA_ROOT in the TestCase setUp() method,Then, the files created in the test will be automatically removed when the test is finished.UPDATE:Then, the files created in the test will not be automatically removed when the test is finished, so do not forget to delete the temporary directory after finishing the test.
I found this article and it worked to me
