I use asyncio and beautiful aiohttp. The main idea is that I make request to server (it returns links) and then I want to download files from all links in parallel (something like in an example).Code:But, when I try to run it, I have many "Download ..." outputs andAnd nothing about 'OK + filename'.How can I fix that? 
You forgot to yield from the call to asyncio.wait. You also probably have the indentation on it wrong; you only want to run it after you've iterated over the entire raw['files'] list. Here's the complete example with both mistakes fixed:Without the call to yield from, run exits immediately after you've iterated over the entire list of files, which will mean your script exits, causing a whole bunch of unfinished downloader tasks to be destroyed, and the warning you saw to be displayed.
