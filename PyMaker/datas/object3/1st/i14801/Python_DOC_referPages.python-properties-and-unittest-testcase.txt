Natural Text
Today I wrote test and typoed in one of test methods. My tests failed but I don't understand why. Is it special behaviour of Python properties or something else?When I run this testcase with nose tests:If I fix typo with instance creation in testSetFailObjectAction all tests are work as expected. But this example turn me back to question: Is it safe to use properties? What if I will typo again some day?
You can use patch and PropertyMock  from mock to this kind of jobs:By patch you replace the property action just for the test context and you can also check if the property has been used.
Okay, that is Python default behaviour. In testSetFailObjectAction we add new static class variable that hides our properties. There is no way to protect yourself from mistakes like this.The only suggestation is to use Traits library.
