If I have a list with say [7,6,5,4,3,2,1] how can I make it add upp every second number, for instance 7 + 5 + 3 + 1?I've tried adding mylist[0] + mylist[2] etc but it is very tedious.
the mylist[::2] takes every other item, and sum sums it.If you want to have the first, third, fifth et cetera item, you can use:  This will first omit the first item (with the 1 part), then do the same as in the first command.
If you don't want to create a new list you can use xrange adding every even indexed element:Or use itertools.islice:Some timings show islice wins on time and space using python2:And they all return the same result:
