The optional sep argument is used to define the separator between comma separated argument values that are fed to the objects parameter of print. objects is a variable argument parameter, which means it can take any number of arguments (or an unpacked iterable).From the docs:print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)Print  objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end.  sep, end and file, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and  written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep  and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the  default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end.A better way of writing your code would be the following:This uses the * operator to unpack the iterable and feed each of its elements in as arguments to the print function.It is equivalent to:
In this loop, i is always a one digit integer and this can't be seperated.It would be like this:
