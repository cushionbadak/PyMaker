My code currently reads in a string (made of numbers 0-9) and uses that value to blit a tile to the screen in a corresponding array. Since I use numbers it's easy to slice the string to get one character and cast that value to an int to use it as a index, e.g.:Since I use this method, I can only have 10 elements in the tiles array (because I cant slice a number like 10). Can anyone think of a way around this to get, let's say, 20 elements in the tile array?
In the same way that e.g. hexadecimal uses 'a' for 10, 'b' for 11, and so on, just use letters for numbers beyond 9:One advantage of this is that int in Python already implements this for bases beyond 10:which simplifies your implementation.
