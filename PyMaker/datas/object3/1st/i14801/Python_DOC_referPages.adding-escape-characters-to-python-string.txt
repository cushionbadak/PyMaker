I have a file name that I want to pass to a program or a bash script. For example if it's my car's picture.jpg, I have to change it to  my\ car\'s picture.jpg to pass it to os.system like show my\ car\'s picture.jpg. Is there a function to do it the backslashes automatically?
You should use the subprocess module to call shell scripts from Python. Then you don't have to worry about escaping things yourself.subprocess.call() will escape everything correctly for you. If you need to read the output of the shell script, use subprocess.check_output() instead.
You can simply pass as is and use subprocess, os.system is depreciated.To call a script use check_call, if you want to pipe you can use Popen, there are lots of example in the docs linked above including replacing-os-system.
I can offer several incomplete suggestions that could be helpful to you.Use "my car's picture.jpg" -- double quotes escape single onesUsing spaces in a UNIX file system generates only headaches.  You could pass the filename inside of double-quotes.  If you are using filenames with backslashes in a Windows system, use raw stringr"C:\Foo\bah\baz.jpg"
