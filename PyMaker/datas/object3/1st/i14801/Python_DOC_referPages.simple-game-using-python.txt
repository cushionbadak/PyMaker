college student here and I am working of one of my first real coding assignments using python. The main problem is that when it gets to question 1 and the user answers yes or no i get an error. I think that because used "if q1 == "yes"" if the user types yes it should print the next line or if the user types no then it should continue to the next question. Any help much appreciated remember first coding class for me.
