QUESTION: Complete the following program, which reads in a file that has multiple grades, each separated by a comma, and prints out the computed average. That is, write the functions getGrades(): and calculateAverage():I have inserted the given function and wrote a new program, but I am little bit confused, also I am getting an error. Please help!
In your calculateAverage() function, you pass the argument n but for the for loop you use the local variable name readfile of function getGrades().Also, the result of split is a list of strings. To convert them to integers to perform the summations you can use map(). map returns an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable, yielding the results.To remove newline and other whitespace from the lines you read you can use rstrip().Finally, to perform a floating point division if both your arguments are integers you have to transform one of the two to a float. Check this answer.The final program looks like this:If you run this with a test file with contents:5,10,15,20you get:calculateAverage(n) without map() and with list comprehensions could be:Finally you can do it the naive way and have a for loop for converting each element in the list returned by split to integer:
