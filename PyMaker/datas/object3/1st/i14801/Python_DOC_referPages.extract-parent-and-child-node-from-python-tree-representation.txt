Natural Text
I have many of these strings available in Python, which are actually tree representations. I want to extract the parent and child node for every word, e.g. for 'Hello' I want (INTJ, UH), and for 'My' it is (NP, PRP$).This is the outcome I want:How can I do that?
Your string is obviously the representation of a list of Tree objects. It would be much better if you had access to, or could reconstruct in some other way, that list â€“ if not, the most straightforward way to create a data structure you can work with is eval() (with all the usual caveats about calling eval() on user-supplied data).Since you don't say anything about your Tree class, I'll write a simple one that suffices for the purposes of this question:Now we can recreate your data structure:Once we have that, we can write a function that produces the list of 2-tuples you want:This function descends recursively into the tree, yielding the last two Tree names each time it hits an appropriate leaf node.Example use:
