I am making a math quiz game in python, where the computer selects 2 numbers and 1 symbol from a list and prints it, then the user answers the question. In my list with the symbols, I have the math symbols as strings, but when I want the computer to get the answer, It can't, because the symbols are strings. How do I convert the '*' string to the * symbol used in math? Any help is appreciated, I will post what I have of the game so far as well.
You have to give a meaning to those symbols. One way would be by realizing that each of these symbols is a function that takes two arguments. Thus you can do:and then you can do
Use the operator module and map the operators to your desired symbols:Note that for Python 2.x the / operator (operator.div) does integer division - hence I used operator.truediv instead because otherwise you'd get surprising results when dividing integers. 
You can use the eval functionality to evaluate a string as a command:In that case result will get the value of the queried question.However as @icktoofay says, always use eval with caution: if you don't use it properly it can have side effects (like eval("somecommand()")) or even worse, it can allow a user to insert python logic in your program: for instance eval(cmd) where the user can enter the command.
