I have two instances of flask running on a LAMP server.  Both are in their own virtual environments.  I've noticed that if I have both running at once on different users that aren't root they work fine from a "web" standpoint but, I only get console messages / debugging from one instance.  Is there a way I can have both console messages show or such output routed to files?
Flask has a pretty great tutorial when it comes to application loggingMy personal suggestion is to use something like this In this case each file roles over at 500 Mb and there can be 5 copies at once, 500 Mb * 5 files = 2.5 Gb * 2 instances = 5 Gb of total potential space utilization on just logs. I'm stressing these numbers because they're kind of important.A slightly more complicated but overall better approach is to use NTEventLog or SysLog. These are more complicated because they require system changes. For example, SysLog requires UDP port 514 to be open and listeningThe important part is that the address or filename argument is different for each flask application.After you've instantiated the logger then anywhere in flask where app is in scope you can call the logger that way. Now you can explicitly control where your log messages are going.
