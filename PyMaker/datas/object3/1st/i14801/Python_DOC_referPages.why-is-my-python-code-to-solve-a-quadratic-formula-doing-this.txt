So I am quite a novice at coding python, so I decided to try my hand at making a quadratic equation solver. After entering all my user inputted variables i get this error: My code is:Any help would be appreciated a lot.Edit:Forgot to add the actual values i entered.
Python can handle complex numbers, but the math module won't do square roots of negative numbers, for that you need to use cmath.Demo:outputAlthough i is commonly used by mathematicians as the symbol for the square root of negative one, Python uses j; that convention is common among electronics engineers, since they use i to represent current.So the above output is equal to (-1 ± sqrt(-3))/2
That is a basic 9th grad math question:Quadratic equations don't always have real-valued solutions, because you can't take the square root of a negative number. You've entered values for a quadratic equation that simply can't be solved within the real numbers.EDIT: you posted your values:so, what is the square root of (1² - 2*6*2) ? You cannot find a solution in the real numbers to that question, and neither can python, that's why it's giving you a math domain error.Look at it this way: 6x² + x + 2 = 0 really has no real solution. Hint: Look at the graph
