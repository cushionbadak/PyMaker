Natural Text
I was wondering is someone could help me figure out why I keep getting the error AssertionError: Header names/values must be of type str (got b'Content-type')127.0.0.1 - - [26/Mar/2015 20:50:52] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 500 59. The code comes from "The Quick Python Book" from Manning publishing.
Remove the b's from:And add to  return ["<h1>Message Wall</h1>"]. You read unicode/str and write bytes.The old docs had a bug where the examples used b'200 OK' etc.. which is what the book may have been based on, there is an old bug report here. The current docs show the correct usage.Once you do that you will see the output at http://localhost:8000/ and without error.
