Natural Text
I am trying to make a progress bar for a process, but to keep things short consider the following snippet:What I am expecting it to do is to print a star every half a second on the same line (which is exactly what it does when I run the code with an IDE like Sublime Text for example). However, when I run this in the Mac OS Terminal it just waits for 5 seconds then prints the whole string ********** at once.Any ideas why this might be happening and how to get the desired behavior?
It does that because output is buffered. Try this instead:By flushing output each time you do a write, sys.stdout won't wait for the next newline; instead it will write whatever characters are in its buffers immediately.
The output is being buffered, so you will need to call sys.stdout.flush() after each write operation to flush the buffer.  Or, even better, just use print and have Python do it for you.  In versions 3.3+, the code would be:If you are using an older version, you would omit the flush=True:And if you happen to be using Python 2.x, you will also need to write:at the top of your code to use the Python 3.x print.
