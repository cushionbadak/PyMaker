So i'm creating a little experimental python program and I'm using a little tidbit of code (shown below) to determine if a number is whole or has decimal places.My problem is that no matter where I go I can't find a way to just take the returned value and assign it to a variable...Sorry if I seem like an absolute spurglord noob for asking this question but I never even knew that functions could "return" until about 2 days ago, so yeah...
like this:
The return value will always be 1.
Answering your question, how to assign a variable, just assign it to the output of the function as below:As long as you have a return in your function, you can assign a variable to the output:However if you do not have a return, then it returns None, so beware :)
As others have explained, you can just assign the result of calling the function to a variable name to save the value. Perhaps equally important though, is the fact that the code shown in your function will always return "1" since the value of x%1 is always going to be 0 regardless of the value of x (assuming its value is non-zero and a type with a modulo operator).I would suggest that tou instead implement your function to return a True or False value and do it like the following:(See the is_integer documentation for more information.)You can assign the result of calling this function to a variable as shown below:
