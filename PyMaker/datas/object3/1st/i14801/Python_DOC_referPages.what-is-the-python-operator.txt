What exactly is the <> operator in Python, and why is it undocumented (as far as I can tell)?Is it the same as != or is not?
In Python 2.x, <> is the same as != (i.e. "not equal to", rather than is not which is "not identical to"), but the latter is preferred:The comparison operators <> and != are alternate spellings of the same operator. != is the preferred spelling; <> is obsolescent.In 3.x, <> has been removed and only != exists.
It is documented, but you're not supposed to use it. Your guess about it being equivalent to != is correct. Quoting the Python 2 documentation:!= can also be written <>, but this is an obsolete usage kept for backwards compatibility only. New code should always use !=.Then as part of the general cleanup of Python 3, the operator was removed entirely:Removed <> (use != instead).Historical noteIt goes back quite a long way; at least as far as Python 1.4. I found an entry in the old docs:<> and != are alternate spellings for the same operator. (I couldn't choose between ABC and C! :-)The docs started recommending != with Python 1.5.2p2.
