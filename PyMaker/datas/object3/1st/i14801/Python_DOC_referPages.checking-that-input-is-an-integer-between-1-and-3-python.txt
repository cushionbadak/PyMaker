This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I want to be able to check that an input is an integer between 1 and 3, so far I have the following code:This makes the user re-enter a number if it is not between 1 and 3, but I want to add validation to ensure that a user cannot enter a string or unusual character that may result in a value error.
Catch the ValueError:Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that  has the right type but an inappropriate valueExample:Actually, since the range of allowed numbers is small, you can operate directly on strings:
Alternatively try comparison of input in desired results, and break from the loop, something like this:Using Try/Except is a good approach, however your original design has a flaw, because user can still input like "1.8" which isn't exactly an integer but will pass your check.
