How come the code below is not matching the space character?I also tried using:but it's not matching either. I also tried to add an r to make the string raw, but same result.Any clue why?
Replace match by search:
You probably want to use the search method. search "scans through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches."What you were trying to use is match, which "determines if the RE matches at the beginning of the string."
If you really want to get to the answer using match then you can do it this way (not recommended.)since match starts from the beginning you will need to match the 5 letters of the word 'hello' with '.....' and then match the spaceoutput
