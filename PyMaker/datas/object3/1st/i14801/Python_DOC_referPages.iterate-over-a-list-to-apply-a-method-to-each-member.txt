I have a list of strings that I want to apply a method (.split). I know this can be done by a for loop but knowing the mentality of python I assume there is a better way, like the map functionBelow is the thing I want written using for loop
You can use a simple list comprehension, like thisIf you want to use map, you can pass str.split function to it. But, Python 3.x's map returns an iterable map object.So, you need to explicitly convert that to a list, with the list function, like this
As an alternative to anwser by @thefourtheye you can use map:
Create an empty listIterate over each item, split, add to new list.
