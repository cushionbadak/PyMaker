So I was looking at some source code and I came across this bit of codenow in the source code the link is blue and when you click it, it takes you to the full URL where that picture is located, I know how to get what is shown in the source code in Python using Beautiful Soup I was wondering though how to get the full URL you get once clicking the link in the source code?EDIT:if I was given <a href = "/folder/big/a.jpg" how do you figure out the starting part of that url through python or beautiful soup?
Thatâ€™s an absolute address for the current host. So if the HTML file is at http://example.com/foo/bar.html, then applying the url /folder/big/a.jpg will result in this:I.e. take the host name and apply the new path to it.Python has the builtin urljoin function to perform this operation for you:For Python 2, the function is within the urlparse module.
