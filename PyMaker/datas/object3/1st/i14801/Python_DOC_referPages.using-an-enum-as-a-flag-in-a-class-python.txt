I would like to use an enum to represent an internal state of a class:this is what I thought could be a possible implementation. The two annoying things that I see are:to set value I have to do :q = testClass()q.setValue(q.Color.red)and I find the q.Color.red someway umpleasant, I'd rather have something like:Color.red or just red. Maybe the only way to have that is to use some string comparison, but it is exactly what I am trying to avoid using enum.I get an extra method that is q.Color.mro that seems like an internal method of the enum class. What is this for? 
Alternative #1: You can have the Enum class do the string lookup for you:Usage:Reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#programmatic-access-to-enumeration-members-and-their-attributesAlternative #2: If there are no conflicts, you can promote the Enum's members to the parent class:Usage:
If your Class Color wont be conflicting with anything else in your application, you can move Color class out of testClass.Then you will be able to use
