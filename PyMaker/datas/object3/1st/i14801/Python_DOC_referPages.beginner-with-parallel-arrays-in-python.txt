I've been stuck with program for almost a week. What i'm trying to do create a program that inputs the names of salespersons and their total sales for the month in two parallel arrays (Names and Sales) and determine which salesperson has the greatest sales(Max)It doesn't prompt the user 3 times for the Name and salary it instead just asks once and i get this error:
I suggest that instead of having 'parallel arrays' you put the names and sales figures into a dictionary.  Here is what it looks like you need:This code will also continue accepting new names until you enter a blank name.From here you should probably use pythons Counter class like this:
Your code only prompts the user once for input before the beginning of the loop, so the loop will never end unless * is entered the first time.  Since you bounded your arrays as size 3, you get an error when K is larger than 2.  In Python you can use the append method to increase the size of your lists, but if you want them to be like fixed length arrays then you need to include something in your code to catch when the user fails to enter * before K becomes equal to the array size.
