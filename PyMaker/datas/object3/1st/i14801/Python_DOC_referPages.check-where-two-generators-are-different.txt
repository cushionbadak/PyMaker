Suppose I have two generators, for simplicity:what is the best way to know where is the first difference (position 2) or if they are equal? I would like to avoid explicit loop:and use functional programming:The point is that the solution I am using is ugly, more verbose than the explicit loop, ...can you do better?
You can simplify your second example by giving a default value to next:From the docs:next(iterator[, default])Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its __next__() method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is  exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised.
As an alternative answer you can use numpy.where instead loop over your arrays and use enumerate :Or with next :Also for generators you can use numpy.fromiter to convert your generator to a numpy array!  some benchmarks :
I've been experimenting with builtin filter but probably python3 filterfalse might be even nicer.However, we don't get index of differences but just different items in such way.  So I've been thinking some more and check for related but then actually, OP wants index not a result. So, revised   Of course this doesn't even come close to above answers so I wouldn't recommend that in production code. Only benefit? No imports. Here are my timeit results:
