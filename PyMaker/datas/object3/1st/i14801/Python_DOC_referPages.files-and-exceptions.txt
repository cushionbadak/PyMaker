Natural Text
So in python class we are going over files and exceptions but the professor didn't explain it thoroughly hence why I'm lost to what exactly it is that he wants me to do, I would appreciate any help please. I understand that he wants us to copy the table 2 example but not quite sure. Here is the question.The file ALW.txt contains the information shown in Table 1. Write a program to use the file to produce a text file containing the information in Table 2, in which the baseball teams list W-L percentage, as well as the total percentage.Table 2:so I came up with this code but I don't think I'm doing it right.
He basically wants you to convert how the statistics are displayed from one file and copy it to a different file in a different format.I'd suggest that you first read the first file line by line and then split the line with commas. Then the elements at each index of the returned array can be formatted and written to an out file in the format he wants you to.
You teacher wants you to parse the file and produce a similar result than table 2 has.You will need to:open the fileGo through each line until you find the first TeamAdd the strings separated by commas in that line to a list Calculate the percentages Carry on till the endWrite everything in anew fileIt's a good exercise and Python is really good doing it
