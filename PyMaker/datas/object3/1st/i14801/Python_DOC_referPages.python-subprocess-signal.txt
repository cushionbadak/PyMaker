Natural Text
I would like to establish a very simple communication between two python scripts. I have decided that the best way to communicate and to have both scripts read from a text file. I would like the main program to wait while to child programs execute.Normally I would make the main program wait x amount of time and continuously check the text file for an okay flag. However I have seen people talk about using a signal.Could someone please give an example of this.
There is Popen.send_signal() method that allows you to send a signal to a child process.Here's code example that sends SIGINT to ping subprocess to get the summary in the output on exit.
You need one process to write and one to read; both processes reading leads to no communication. Signals are used only for special proposes, not for normal inter-process-communication. Use something like pipes or sockets. It's not more complicated than files, but much more powerful.
