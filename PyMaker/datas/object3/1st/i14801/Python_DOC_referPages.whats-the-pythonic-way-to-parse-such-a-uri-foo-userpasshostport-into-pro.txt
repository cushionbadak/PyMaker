Only the host part is not optional, that is to say the URI may has the following forms:and so on. If we have five variables to save the values of parts in such an URI, Is there a pythonic way to assign these values to the proper variables when they exist in the URI?
You'd use urlparse (python 2) / urllib.parse module.The urlparse() function can handle all forms you mention, but note that without a scheme, the user@host and host portions are seen as a path:That's easily worked around:
You can use the urlparse module for doing this.I think it is worth nothing though that you could also setup a series of regular expressions to grab and assign the wanted data to variables. This might come in handy if you want to do something similar, but not necessarily with a URI.Here is another thread with a good example:How can I get part of regex match as a variable in python?
