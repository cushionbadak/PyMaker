Natural Text
My python project has 2 files. I made a folder called files so when the user writes something in the text editor, it saves it into that folder, then when the user opens the textviewer, they type that file name and looks for it in the files directory. How would I be able to do this?Code for text editor:Text Viewer Code:
If you don't want filename to be considered relative to the current working directory, you should transform it into a more specific absolute path before passing it to open. Use os.path.join to combine a directory name and the file name together in a platform independent way:Unrelated to this issue, but involving the same parts of the code, I'd suggest using with statements to handle your files (with open(whatever) as file:). See the docs for some more details.
