My environment:Django 1.7Python 3.2As a disclaimer, I'm new to Django and Python.I'm going through this doc in order to use Memcachier with Django. The installion process didn't give me any errors, but when I fire up my tests with ./manage.py tests I get the following error: I'm looking at the python 3.x docs for errors and it seems that line 92 of that file is indeed not valid syntax, but I'm not sure. Can anyone suggest a possible fix? 
That library does not appear to be compatible with Python 3.However, as Amir suggests, there is no need to use it anyway; Django comes with a pylibmc backend, as described in the documentation. 
I know you are following the Heroku docs which suggest using django-pylibmc, but Django supports Pylibmc out of the box with django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache. Since these are just python wrappers over the pylibmc C libraries there should be really no reason to go with django-pylibmc.Also if you look at the README (https://github.com/jbalogh/django-pylibmc#requirements) for django-pylibmc it states that it was written and tested with Python 2.7, so the use of Python 3 is also problematic here.I applaud your efforts for using Python 3 with Django, but please make sure that all your third party apps are compatible and I highly recommend reading this from the Django docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/python3/
