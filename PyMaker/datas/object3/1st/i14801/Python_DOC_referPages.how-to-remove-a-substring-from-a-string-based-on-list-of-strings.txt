I have a list of strings(colors), say I have a string:I have to remove chocolate brown and brown from the string. This is just an example. Basically whenever I encounter a color in a string I have to remove it if it exists in the list of colors. What is the efficient way to do it? One approach that I thought was to split the string into trigrams, bigrams and unigrams. But joining these n-grams back and consistently between all n-grams would be a problem. My original list is too huge and the string is short. I need an efficient solution since I have to loop over all the elements of the list. Is it possible if I could check the string for the color and then check if that color is in the list. Wouldn't that be an efficient solution?
You could use re:
Output:Basically just replace what you don't want with what you want (I used an empty string ""), and put this action in a loop.Note that replace() returns a new string instead of modifying the original string, so you have to put it into a new variable, such as str_new.
