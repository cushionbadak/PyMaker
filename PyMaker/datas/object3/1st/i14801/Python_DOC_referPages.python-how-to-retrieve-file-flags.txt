os module contains function chflags that allows user to modify UNIX file flags: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlIs there a function that would let me see which flags the file currently has?I am asking about file flags (equivalent of unix command lsattr or chattr) not permissions (chmod etc)
File flags are made available via os.stat().The POSIX implementation of python's os module returns a stat_result object that has an st_flags field:The possible flag bits are available in the stat module asconstants.
