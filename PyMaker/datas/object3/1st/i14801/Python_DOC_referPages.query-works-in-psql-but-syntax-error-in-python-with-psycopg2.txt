I have a query which works well in psql, but generates an error in my program: Any pointers as to why it's not working? Or any suggestions, how I can fix it?

The good practice for code strings in Python is the triple quoted string which makes it much clearer and can contain both single and double quotes:From the manual:Triple quoted strings may span multiple lines - all associated whitespace will be included in the string literal.
