I was wondering why I should use something like this:Instead of:
For starters, try doing this with +:.format() benefits:Contains placeholders, i.e...{0}..{1}..{2}. Using .format, arguments passed are substituted into their respective placeholders (based on their order). This allows you to re-use arguments, as seen in the example above. In each replacement with .format, you have a format specification (:). This specification allows you control with respect to many properties for each substitution you make, and there's a whole mini-language for it. Additionally, .format is a function, which you can pass as an argument when needed. In Python 3 it is called advanced string formatting as it is much more powerful than simple concatenation. You can do some pretty wild and flexible things if you really want using the .format function as well, for instance:And one further example with a dictionary, to display its ability to take keyword arguments:There's some further examples and uses in the Python docs.
format is much more powerful, and as you can see in the other answer, you can do a loot of cool things with it. However, I would like to add that format is not the fastest (at least in python 3.4 on ubuntu 14.04). For simple formatting, plus notation is faster. For example:
