I have a list of 516 numbers. These numbers range from 0 to 136661043272.12181 and they are not evenly distributed in this range. Now I want to normalize these numbers to [0,1] and I want to use the sigmoid function, i.e., original 0 will become 0 and original 136661043272.12181 will become 1. I know sigmoid function but my problem is that I don't know how to map original values to the exponent of e. Do you have any ideas about this? 
You use the exp function from the math module:
