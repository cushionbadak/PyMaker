how can I generate a string (or Pandas series) like below:the following works, but I would like to know a shorter way
You can just use a list comprehension to generate the individual elements (using string concatenation or str.format), and then join the resulting list on the separator string (the comma):
What about:Output:(This uses a generator expression, which is more efficient than joining over a list comprehension -- only slightly, with such a short list, however)  This now uses a list comprehension!  See comments for an interesting read about why list comprehensions are more appropriate than generator expressions for join.
