When I run this function, I get a type error in this line.What's going on?
Psychic debugging: You probably passed a str object to the function, but base64.b64decode requires a bytes object.  So, you'll need to encode the string.Note that Python 3.3 is more lenient and lets you pass either str or bytes.
