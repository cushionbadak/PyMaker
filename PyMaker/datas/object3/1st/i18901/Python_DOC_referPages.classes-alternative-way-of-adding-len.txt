I am building a string Class that behaves like a regular string class except that the addition operator returns the sum of the lengths of the two strings instead of concatenating them. And then a multiplication operator returns the products of the length of the two strings. So I was planning on doing at least that is what I have for the first part but that is apparently not correct. Can someone help me correct it.
You need to derive from str, and you can use len(self) to get the length of the current instance. You also need to give __add__ a parameter for the other operand of the + operator.Demo:
string is not a class. It's not anything*. There is no context where len(string) will work  unless you define string. Secondly, __add__ does not have an input parameter.You need to fix both of these issues.* You could import a module called string, but it's not something that just exists in global scope.
