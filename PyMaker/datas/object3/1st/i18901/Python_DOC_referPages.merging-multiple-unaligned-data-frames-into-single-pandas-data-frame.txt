I have multiple data-frames with stock prices that I want to align into a single data-frame that contains only the close prices for all stocks.I would expect all dates from all data-frames to be present in the date-column(index) and "NA" in case there was no close price for a stock on that date.Example with two data-frames (df1 and df2):Now I can do and the result is as expected:How would I need to change my code to do the same for a dynamic number of data-frames?Right now, I have 8 data-frames I need to align this way. Is there any way to loop thru a list of data-frames and align them like above - instead of manually tying the data-frame names (something like df[0] to df[7] figuratively speaking)? Thanks in advance and kind regards!Dirk
If you have the data-frames in a list (the actual data-frame objects, I mean, not their names) that looks something like this:then the following code should do what it seems you're looking for:You could do this more compactly with a dict comprehension, but in example code I prefer to spell things out more explicitly for ease of understanding. For reference, the dict comprehension would look something like this:
