I have a project like that :And I import module1.py in main.py by import bar.module1.But I need rewrite bar's function and keep old code. So I change project like that:Now, I do not want to change main.py, and I still use import bar.module1 in main.py.Can I do it? add some code into bar/__init__.py?
In foo/bar/__init__.py you can write:this should allow you to use import bar.module1 from main.py
