Problem: The beautiful soup object seems to delete valuable information from the HTML.  Why is it doing this, and how can I extract this field? Example:  The raw HTML I'm interested in expresses this: When I create my soup object however, the corresponding lines of HTML become: My problem and question:   Why has it deleted the information in between span and /span?  Is it because the "less than/ <" sign indicated some HTML so it stripped that? I want to know WHY this happens.  I couldn't seem to find an explanation in the documentation.... Is there ANY WAY to parse this in BeautifulSoup? Second:  How do I extract this < 1 tsp parameter?   I've tried creating a regex with a left and right endpoint, and that ALMOST works.  I know how to use regex to return text if I specify a "left substring match" and a "right substring match." For instance, the code below will return "cat." The issue is, when I replace the left and right match string with HTML, I get the "index is out of bounds" error, because of the whitespace and indentation implicated with casting HTML into a string.   So as you can tell... I've done a fair bit of research, and I'm still stuck on extracting < and > signs within fields/ attributes of HTML tags using both BeautifulSoup and Python's regex module.  Please help me? :) 
Do you have control over your html? It is malformed. Instead of It should look likehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_referencesIf you are generating the html on the server-side, it should be easy in any language to encode your entities: php python rubyedit: According to this other answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14171433/1253312 You can do this:Which tells BS to use a different parser, which can handle the < character.
The HTML is broken. You can't have an unescaped < character in HTML; the parser will get mightily confused. As a workaround, in this particular example you could replace < followed by a space with &lt; followed by a space:Although this is not a general solution.
