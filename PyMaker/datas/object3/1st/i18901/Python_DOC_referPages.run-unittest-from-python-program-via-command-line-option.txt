Here is my set up - I would like to be able to run my unit tests by calling a command line option in prog.py, this way when I deploy my project I can deploy the ability to run the unit tests at any time.What do I need in prog.py, or the rest of my project for this to work?
Perhaps this is what you're looking for. Implement a load_tests function in test_prog.py and use the following code in prog.py to load and run the tests: 
The Python unittest module contains its own test discovery function, which you can run from the command line:To run this command from within your module, you can use the subprocess module:If your module has other command-line options you probably want to look into argparse for more advanced options.
You must make sure that you consistently follow some naming conventions (which you seem to be doing):All tests are named with the same prefix (test_ is the norm), followed by the name of the module you wish to test.prog.py => test_prog.pyTests reside in test/ directory.Then you can do something like this:prog.pyWhat we are doing, is:Checking the command arguments to see if --unittest is present (since that's the only time you want to run the tests).If it is, then we create the test_prog.py - following the naming conventions we have set.Then we pass that to the TestLoader().discover function. discover(...) starts at the specified directory and finds all test modules (recursing into subdirectories ) that match the pattern provided.In our case, it will look inside the test/ directory for any module named test_prog.py. When it does, it loads it and creates a TestSuite with the TestCases that we want to run.Lastly, we manually test unittest to run the suite obtained in the previous step.Normally, unittest will do all of this for us in the background, but since we are trying to run a specific test module, we have to tell exactly how and where to get it from.Also, note that you will have to do this for every file where you want to do this at.
