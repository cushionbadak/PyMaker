The fine manual does not address what the str() method does when provided three arguments, as I've found in this code from requests/models.py:Where is this documented? What does it do?
You're reading docs for version 2, but looking at code using (or matching) Python 3.The docs for version 3 say:Return a str version of object. See str() for details.Following the link the following is said about the encoding and errors keyword arguments:If at least one of encoding or errors is given, object should be a bytes-like object (e.g. bytes or bytearray). In this case, if object is a bytes (or bytearray) object, then str(bytes, encoding, errors) is equivalent to bytes.decode(encoding, errors). Otherwise, the bytes object underlying the buffer object is obtained before calling bytes.decode(). 
That's not the built-in str function. Look at the imports at the top:Kenneth has defined his own compat module for compatibility between Python 2 and 3, and he overrides several builtins including str.As you can see in that module, in Python 2 it aliases unicode to str, so it pretty much works the same as the Python3 str.
To add to daniel-roseman's answer here's the documentation and what does it do.. Since str in the stated code represents unicode.
