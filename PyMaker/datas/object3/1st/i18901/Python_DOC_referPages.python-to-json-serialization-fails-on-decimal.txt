This question already has an answer here:Python JSON serialize a Decimal object                    14 answers                I have a python object which includes some decimals. This is causing the json.dumps() to break.I got the following solution from SO (e.g. Python JSON serialize a Decimal object) butthe recoomended solution still does not work. Python website - has the exact same answer.Any suggestions how to make this work?Thanks. Below is my code. It looks like the dumps() doesn't even go into the specialized encoder.
It is not (no longer) recommended you create a subclass; the json.dump() and json.dumps() functions take a default function:Demo:The code you found only worked on Python 2.6 and overrides a private method that is no longer called in later versions.
I can't believe that no one here talked about using simplejson, which supports deserialization of Decimal out of the box.
If you're using Django. There is a great class for Decimal and date fields:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/serialization/#djangojsonencoderTo use it:
