Natural Text
While textwrap.fill works with manually entered text, i.e. print("(Really long string)"), it yields unexpected results when printing from a class that has been populated from a csv file.for example:I get the following:Any ideas? There are no line breaks in the CSV already.The line from the CSV reads:That's a single line.Any ideas on removing the random line break? Could it be to do the random whitespace at the beginning of the output? I don't know where that whitespace is coming from and appears even when not using the textwrap module.
I suspect your terminal or console is doing the wrapping; you have a prefix on the line that you need to take into account when wrapping. Include it in the text you are wrapping:I've used str.format() here to create a new string from the .name and .description attributes, with a colon in between.
