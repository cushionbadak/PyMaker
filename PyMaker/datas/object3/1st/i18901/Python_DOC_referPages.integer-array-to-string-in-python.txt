I have an array of integer, and I need to transform it into string.What function can I use for it? I tried with str(), but it returns '1234'. 
''.join([chr(x) for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]])
You can convert a list of small numbers directly to a bytearray:If it is an iterable, it must be an iterable of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256, which are used as the initial contents of the array.And you can convert a bytearray directly to a str (2.x) or bytes (3.x, or 2.6+).In fact, in 3.x, you can even convert the list straight to bytes without going through bytearray:constructor arguments are interpreted as for bytearray().So:If you really want a string in 3.x, as opposed to a byte string, you need to decode it:See Binary Sequence Types in the docs for more details.
