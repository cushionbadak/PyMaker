Natural Text
I'm currently writing validation code for a tool parameter in ArcMap 10 (updateMessages) and need to prevent users from using non-alphanumeric characters within a string as it will be used to name a newly created field in a feature class.I have so far used 'str.isalnum()' however this of course excludes underscores. Is there an efficient way to only accept alphanumeric characters and underscores?  

Try regular expressions:
If you are using Python3 and there are non-ASCII characters in your string it is better to compile the regex with 8-bit string setting. For more information please refer to here.
