How can I sum the first k items in a given list?For example:How can I use k to return 1 for k = 1, 3 for k = 2 and 8 for k = 3?
You have two options, both using sum():Use itertools.islice() to efficiently extract those elements:Slice the list to get a copy with just those first elements:islice() is more memory efficient and can compete with slicing:Even for a large k, the islice() version is within the same ballpark as slicing, but we didn't have to create another list object with k references first.
