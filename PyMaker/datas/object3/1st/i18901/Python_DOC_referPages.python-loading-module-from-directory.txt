Why python load my module from directory, even if the directory shouldn't be treated as a package (doesn't contains __init__.py)? this works, even if fake_module doesn't contains __init__.pyIf i would create regular fake_module with __init__.py and module.py file somewhere in sys.path, will be module.py loaded from this regular fake_module package?I am using pycharm and python3.3
It looks like the __init__.py is optional as of Python 3.3. See also PEP420.
