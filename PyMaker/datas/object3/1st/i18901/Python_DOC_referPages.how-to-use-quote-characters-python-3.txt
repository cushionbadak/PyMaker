Natural Text
I am currently opening CSV files using the following:One of the fields contains commas which are to be printed and not seen as the start of a new set of data. For example:This gives 4 sets of data. I know I'm supposed to used quotechar='"' but I'm unsure of the syntax or where to put it. Where/how should I specify the quote character to get the desired result? Does the system see " as a quote character by default? If not, what does it use by default?Thanks
Yes, it defaults to ". If you want to change it, use keyword arguments (like this example from the docs):Note you'll also want newline='' in the event there are newlines in the quotes (as per this footnote).
