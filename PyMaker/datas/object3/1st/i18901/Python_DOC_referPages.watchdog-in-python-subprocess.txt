I'm looking to execute an application that then binds to a defined port if successful, and then poll it over http, if it fails, restart it (pretty much a single-process simple watchdog). Looking at subprocess, but a bit unsure as to how to continue. Can anyone point me on a path or something?The process has no stdin, no stdout, and no stderr (all can be discarded). Just pretty much a loop that checks if it responds (via urllib/Requests?) then sleep 30 seconds.
