This question already has an answer here:How to make a gui in python [closed]                    10 answers                I've taken some lessons and courses about Python 3.X programing and I've even constructed a few command line apps, but when it comes to build a full GUI desktop app I can't seem to grasp a consensus on how to do so and I'm see my self left with many questions and no "one" recommended path to start at it.Witch framework do I use?Do I even use a framework?How do I install it?My true question is: "Where do I start and where do I go from there?". I feel that that may even enlighten me and hopefully others as well about the same concepts applied to other programing languages. The intent of this post is to receive the necessary support to begin making desktop apps for someone who already have some knowledge of the language it self. Answers here should have a highly readable format, it's personal opinions should be explained and links should be given, rendering a good communitarian guide to Python 3.X graphical apps making.
