Ok.. So probably an example is a good way to explain this problemSo I  have something like  this:Now this script is being called from a ruby script.. and basically it parses the result there.But foobar() has a lot of print statments.. and stdout flushes all those prints as well.Is there a way (besides logging mathods) I can modify something over here which automatically suppresses those prints and just flushes this result??Thanks
You want to shadow (or otherwise hide) the stdout temporarily.  Something like this:You need to assign something that is file-like to sys.stdout so that other methods can use it effectively.  StringIO is a good candidate because it doesn't require disk access (it'll just collect in memory) and then is discarded.
With Python 3.4 and up you can use the redirect_stdout contextmanager like this:

This link shows how to redirect stdout in python. Redirect it to an internal pipe, then read your pipe and filter out the unwanted lines. That will let you keep only the lines you are interested in.
