In Python, I'm getting an error because it's loading a module from /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages but I'd like it to use my version in $HOME/python-modules/lib/python2.6/site-packages, which I installed using pip-python --install-option="--prefix=$HOME/python-modules --ignore-installedHow can I tell Python to use my version of the library? Setting PYTHONPATH to $HOME/python-modules/lib/python2.6/site-packages doesn't help, since /usr/lib/... apparently has precedence.
Take a look at the site module for ways to customize your environment.One way to accomplish this is to add a file to a location currently on sys.path called usercustomize.py, when Python is starting up it will automatically import this file, and you can use it to modify sys.path.First, set $PYTHONPATH to $HOME (or add $HOME if $PYTHONPATH has a value), then create the file $HOME/usercustomize.py with the following contents:Now when you start Python you should see your custom site-packages directory before the system default on sys.path.
Newer Python versions now have built-in support to search the opendesktop location:If you put your local modules there you don't have to any sys.path manipulations. 
If one has multiple versions of a package installed, say e.g. SciPy:and one would like the user installed version (installed e.g. using pip install --user --upgrade scipy) to be prefered, one needs a usercustomize.py file in ~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ with e.g. this content:(the for loop selecting index ensures that packages installed in "develop mode" takes precedence) now we get our user specific version of SciPy:
to prefer packages installed to userbase (e.g. pip install --user --upgrade cool_thing )in ~/.bashrc,~/.profile, or whatever the init file for your shell is, addin $PYTHONUSERBASE/usercustomize.py
