I am developing python application which should work with database. I came along with one problem. In PHP I can make queries with variables directly just by $ sign, but in python I am writing this code:Is there any method doing it like in PHP, I mean doing it inside one string?
You should never concatenate an SQL string like that. You are asking for an SQL injection.Use the built in escaping in the DB API:...and your query will be properly escaped.In general in Python, you can use "+" to concatenate strings. You can also use printf-like syntax "Hello %s!" % "World" and the newer formatting syntax "Hello {0}".format('World!')
Not directly, but you can use string formating operations:In your case, this is however a bad idea. For this kind of things in SQL queries, you should do this instead:This is the easiest and most effective way to be safe against SQL injections.This syntax is supported by all major SQL Python modules (at least MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL).More details about this in the sqlite3 module doc.
How about using formatting:Or like this:
Don't create query by concatenate string like that, use paramterize query like thisThis will save you from a lot of trouble in the long run and it also runs faster. The symbol ? after VALUES can vary between different API
First of all, it's a terrible practice to construct SQL queries this way. You should use parametrized queries instead. Now, Python's DB-API 2.0 (PEP-249) defines few param styles:paramstyleFor example for MySQL the default param style is "format" (which is C-style), thus you'd do
First of all, do not create SQL queries as such. That said, this is how to get named (PHP-style) variable interpolation in Python.Use a string template. Here is an example:
