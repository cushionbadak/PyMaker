I'm trying to build a package for a django application, but excluding all tests modules.I have tried setting on find_packages and defining a MANIFEST.in, but the tests are always compiled and included in the bundle.Any clues?
I found the combination both adding find_packages rule and writing out MANIFEST.in rules i.e. prune testsNote that for python 3.2 and older you must have __init__.py in tests root, for find_packages command to consider tests folder to be a package.Sample find_packages exclude command in setup.pySample MANIFEST.in
Can I asked...did you try:find_packages(exclude=['tests'])
