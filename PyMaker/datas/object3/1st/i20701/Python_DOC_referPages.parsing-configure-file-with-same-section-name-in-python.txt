I try to parse file like:I use ConfigParser in Python, but when i read file:I have error:How can i parse this file? Are any another library? (prefer for python3)
If what you want is to simply merge identically named sections (latest one wins), simply pass the strict=False option to the constructor (added in Python 3.2). You effectively get dict.update() behavior as the duplicate sections are merged in.However, it's clear from the OP's sample data that identically named sections need to be kept separate, to avoid loss of data. ConfigParser stores the sections it reads in a dictionary, so it can't handle multiple sections with the same name. Fortunately the constructor accepts a dict_type argument that allows you to specify a different dictionary-like object. You can use that to support identically named sections. Here's a crude solution that mangles the section names by appending a unique number whenever a section name has been seen before. With a little work you should be able to construct a cleaner solution.
On the latest python there is an option that may do what you want :ConfigParser(strict=True)Cf : https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser
Unfortunately, the format of the provided ini file is not correct according standards. A section's name must be unique in the document.If you can change the file-format (I already read that you cannot, but for completeness...), then a solution like this would be appropriate:If you really can't alternate the file's format, then I fear that your only option is to parse manually the configuration file.
"If you're deviating from an RFC standard and creating your own config format, you're going to have to write your own parser." This http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1110829 worked for me.  I made a couple of small changes.  ** formatting did not come out correctly when posted
