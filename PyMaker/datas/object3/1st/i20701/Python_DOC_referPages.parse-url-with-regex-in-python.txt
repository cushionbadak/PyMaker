I want to get the query name and values to be displayed from URL. For eg. url='http://host:port_num/file/path/file1.html?query1=value1&query2=value2'from this parse the query names and its values and to print it.
I agree that it's best not to use regex and better to use urlparse but here is my regex.Classes like urlparse were developed specifically to handle all urls efficiently and are much more reliable than regex is so make use of them if you can.
Don't use a regex! Use urlparse.
