I have a binary file with a known format/structure.How do I read all the binary data in to an array of the structure?Something like (in pseudo code)EDIT:Solution so far:
Use the struct module; you need to define the types in a string format documented with that library:The above example expects native byte-order, two unsigned shorts, a float and a string of 255 characters.To loop over an already fully read bytes string, I'd use itertools; there is a handy grouper recipe that I've adapter here:This produces tuples rather than lists, but it's easy enough to adjust if you have to:
Actually it looks like you're trying to read a list (or array) of structures from the file. The idiomatic way to do this in Python is use the struct module and call struct.unpack() in a loop—either a fixed number of times if you know the number of them in advance, or until end-of-file is reached—and store the results in a list. Here's an example of the latter:The same results can be also obtained slightly more concisely using a list comprehension along with a short generator function helper (i.e. read_chunks() below):
Add commentsFirst just read the binary into an arraySo you can just fetch some piece of the the arrayand then unpack it as an integera more complex example
