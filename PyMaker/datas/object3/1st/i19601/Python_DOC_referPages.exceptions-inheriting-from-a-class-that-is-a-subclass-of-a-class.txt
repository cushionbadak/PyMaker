I'm getting this error :builtins.TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from  BaseException is not allowed
This works as expected I believe:Prints: __main__.c: my c is bad!You can get the string of the exception in this manner:Edit From what little there is in your question and comment, here is a way you can use multiple class / subclasses of Exception:However, you may also be conflating different instances of a class with subclasses of one class.  You can also try something like this:prints:Note that e1,e2 and e3 and different instances of the class MyException. raise supports calling a class and instance of that class as the exception. If you are truly looking for a hierarchical error class (once error with subclasses), here is the subject in the Python docs. I think that you are not though.
