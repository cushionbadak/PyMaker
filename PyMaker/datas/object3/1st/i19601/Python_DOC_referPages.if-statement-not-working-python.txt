Natural Text
This code asks user for choice of 1 or 2. If 1, then blahblah; if 2 then blahblah. If neither, then repeat until 1 or 2 is entered. Program does not accept 1 or 2, instead going straight to 'else' and repeating input question to enter 1 or 2.Thanks for your help.
You need to store the return value of the input() function:The function argument is the text you want to display, not the variable you want to receive the user input.
you need to store the optionoption = input('Which slice option do you want? even slice (1) or leftover(2)?')And if you are on Python2 ( but not Python3 ) :when you do that, if someone passes in 1, it will be an int, not a string.if option == 1:so input will cause an error if a letter is typed in [ http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input ] , you probably want raw_inputoption = raw_input('Which slice option do you want? even slice (1) or leftover(2)?')
