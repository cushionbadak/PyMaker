I'm reading Programming Python 4th Edition.Following are the codes(Python3.2):When I run it, there is no output on screen:Does anyone have ideas about this?
When the main thread exits, the entire process exits.You will need to make the main thread wait until the other threads complete.  There is no provision for this in the _thread API (it's so low-level).You can use threading.Thread.join(), if you're willing to use a better API.
The underscore _ means that it is a private API (thread module had been obsolete since 2005); you should use threading module instead:You don't need to call .join() method explicitly; non-daemon threads are joined automatically before the main thread exits.
Why don't you use threading module (check here)? In your example the main thread exits before child threads can print anything. For example, if you add the following at the end of your example, works on my system:But still you can't guarantee that main thread will not exit  before all child threads exits in more complicated cases. You have following choices:Set flags from each child thread and keep checking the flags from main thread before exiting (bad approach).Use time.sleep to sleep for maximum time all child threads can take to exit (also a bad approach).Use threading.Thread.join to wait until each child exits (good approach). (as evident from other answers)
