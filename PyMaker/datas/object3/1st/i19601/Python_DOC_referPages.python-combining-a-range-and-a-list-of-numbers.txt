I get the above outpout from a print command from a function. What I really want is a combined list of the range, for example in the top line 5,6,7...15,1,1,5,6 etc.The output range comes from which I naively thought would give a range. The other numbers come from a sliced list.Could someone help me to get the desired result.
The range() function returns a special range object to save on memory (no need to keep all the numbers in memory when only the start, end and step size will do). Cast it to a list to 'expand' it:To quote the documentation:The advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).
