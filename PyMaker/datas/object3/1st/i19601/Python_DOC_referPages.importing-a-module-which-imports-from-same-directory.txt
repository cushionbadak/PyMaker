Suppose I have a project set up as follows:In a.py I have:In test.py I have:When I run test.py I get a ImportError because b cannot be found - since test.py is in a different directory.I know I can fix this in a.py by writing from myproject.module1.b import Something, but this seems far too verbose to do throughout the project.Is there a better way?
from myproject.module1.b import Something is the best way to do it. It may be a little verbose, but it is explicit which is generally a desirable quality in Pythonic code.
I think you can useSince that's relative, it should always work.See http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references
You can try relative imports in a.py, e.g.But this may not be a complete solution to your problem. As with any modules that import modules/packages in a higher level of the directory structure, you have to be careful how you run it. Specifically, running a module as python submodule.py implicitly sets the module's __name__ variable to "__main__". Since imports (relative and absolute alike) depend on that __name__ and the PYTHONPATH, running a submodule directly may make imports behave differently (or break, as in your case). Try running your tests.py as from the top level of the package instead of running it directly.
