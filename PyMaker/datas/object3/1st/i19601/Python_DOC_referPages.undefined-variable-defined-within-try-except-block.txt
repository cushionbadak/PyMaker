I am using the below code to scrape over XFN content from web page http://ajaxian.combut I am getting undefined variable error:My code is as follows:I have two try blocks in my code and it is giving an error undefined variable : item. If I want to re-include the try-except blocks, should I give a blank definition of variable, item outside the try blocks? P.S: Please note that is a standard code followed from a book. And I expect that they would not have made such a trivial mistake. Am I getting something wrong here ?
Assuming that you want to print the URL that failed to load, try changing it to print 'Failed to fetch ' + URL. You aren't actually defining item anywhere, so Python doesn't know what you mean:And in your second block, change item to URL as well (assuming the error you want to display shows the URL and not the content).
item is not defined any where. I guess you wanted to print URL there.As per python tutorialVariables must be “defined” (assigned a value) before they can be used, or an error will occur:
You did not define the variable 'item'. That's what is causing the error. You must define a variable before you use it.
