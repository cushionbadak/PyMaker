I have function declaration like:and if *list_of_objects* not passed (is None) I need to define it like empty list. The explicit way is:orDoes above code equals the next one?I tested it, but I'm still not sure
The idiomatic way is:None is a singleton so you can use is operator for comparison.Your code tests truthness of list_of_objects (all if and or variants are equivalent in this case). The following values are considered false in Python:NoneFalsezero of any numeric type, for example, 0, 0.0, 0j.any empty sequence, for example, '', (), [].any empty mapping, for example, {}.instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a __bool__() or __len__() method, when that method returns the integer zero or bool value False.All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.
No, since None is not the only false object. Also included are [], (), 0, and of course False.
The usual practice is:Use None because it is easy to distinguish from other false values such as an empty list or an empty tuple.Use an is None test instead of equality test because None is a singleton (this is the preferred practice, per PEP 8).
