How do I run the following in Python?I got this:How do I insert the output of the exec process to /dev/null and keep the print output of my python process as usual? As in, don't redirect everything to stdout?
For Python 3.3 and later, just use subprocess.DEVNULL:Note that this redirects both stdout and stderr. If you only wanted to redirect stdout (as your sh line implies you might), leave out the stderr=DEVNULL part.If you need to be compatible with older versions, you can use os.devnull. So, this works for everything from 2.6 on (including 3.3):Or, for 2.4 and later (still including 3.3):Before 2.4, there was no subprocess module, so that's as far back as you can reasonably go.
