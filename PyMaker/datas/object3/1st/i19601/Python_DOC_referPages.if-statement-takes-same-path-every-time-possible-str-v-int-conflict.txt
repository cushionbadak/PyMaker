I'm working on a program that asks the user to pick one of two caves to enter. User may pick either cave 1 or cave 2. That number is compared to the answer (generated by random.randint (1,2)). If the user's choice is equal to the answer, he wins; else, he loses. The issue is that the program never branches to the win condition. No matter what choice user makes, he always loses. I've tried debugging but I cannot see the variable comparison values between caveAnswer and caveChoice.Thank you for your help.
You should also make it so that it'll try again if it's not an int.
You should convert the input to an int:But if you don't want the program to crash upon an input of, say, 'foo', then you need a try-except block, itself inside a while loop, so you can try again.Also, you might want to check if the input is actually 1 or 2.
I tried your program ant it definitely works. To test it, just print out caveAnswer before entering your input caveChoice. If your have an error, then not in this function.
Try converting to int.caveChoice = input ('Enter either 1 or 2. ')
