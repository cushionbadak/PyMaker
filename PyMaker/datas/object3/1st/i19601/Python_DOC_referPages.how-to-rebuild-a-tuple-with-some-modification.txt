For example, I got a tupleI want to build a new tuple b from a but change a little bitanother way to do it All of them work, but look silly.Is there another elegant way to do this job? or are there some skills to modify the original tuple?
This is a bit inefficient in comparison to yours because it does a check on every item, but the general idea is that it looks at each item in your a, checks for a matching key in d and if it finds one, returns the value at that key. If no key is found, the original item is returned:
I don't know what you mean by "elegant", but if you want something more generic that just replaces elements in the 'a' tuple that have a key in 'd', you can use a generator expression and do something like:It constructs a new tuple, since tuples are immutable.
