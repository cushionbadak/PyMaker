I want to draw a continuous line through coordinate points I have stored in a hash, in 3D if possible, but probably 2D to start with.I'd like to process about ten points/sec so that I can see the line being drawn over time.  Does anyone know a good way to visualize this? I have considered Python scripting in Blender, but I am wondering if there's a quicker way to get a working prototype.
Rather than use Ruby or Python solely for this, I'd recommend taking a look at the "D3.js" library.You can take advantage of the browser's ability to generate graphics, and the D3 library's multitude of different plots and charts. It's very impressive and should be easy to integrate with Python or Ruby acting as the data generators, feeding the browser via JSON.
