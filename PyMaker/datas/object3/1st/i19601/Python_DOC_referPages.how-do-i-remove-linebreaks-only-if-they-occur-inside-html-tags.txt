Sorry, another python newbie question. I have a string:I would like:In other words, how do I get rid of '\n' only if it occurs inside an html tag?I have:Which obviously won't work, but I'm stuck.
You should try using BeautifulSoup (bs4), this will allow you to parse XML tags and pages.This will pull out the new line in the p tag.  If the content has more than one tag, None can be used as well as a for loop, then gathering the children (using the tag.child property).For example:Though, this might not work exactly the way you want it (as web pages can vary), this code can be reproduced for your needs.
Regular expressions are a bad match for HTML.  Don't do it.  See RegEx match open tags except XHTML self-contained tags.Instead, use an HTML parser.  Python ships with html.parser, or you can use Beautiful Soup or html5lib.  All you have to do then is walk the tree and remove line breaks.
