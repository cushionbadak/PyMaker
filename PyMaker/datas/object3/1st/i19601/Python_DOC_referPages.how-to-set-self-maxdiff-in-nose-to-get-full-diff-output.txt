When using nose 1.2.1 with Python 3.3.0, I sometimes get an error message similar to the following oneIn many situations, to figure out what the error really is, I need to see the full diff output.  However, I have no idea of how to set that self.maxDiff.  Googling for nose and maxDiff does not help.  With the same version of nose on Python 2.7.1 the full diff is printed to screen.Here is a simple script that generates the error above when run with nosetests-3.3:
I had the same problem in Python 3 (from reading the other answers here) and using im_class did not work. The snippet below works in Python 3 (cf. How to find instance of a bound method in Python?):As @Louis commented, the convenience functions are bound methods on a Dummy instance. They all seem to be on the same instance, so changing this for e.g. assert_equal will change it for assert_dict_equal et cetera. From the Python docs, __self__ is available from Python 2.6 and forward.
You set maxDiff to None.But you will have to actually use a unittest.TestCase for your tests for that to work. This should work.
This works in python 2.7:It'll set the default maxDiff for all TestCase instances, including the one that assert_equals and friends are attached to.
Here you have it (what google told me):
In python 2.7.3, nose 1.3.0, doing the following is working for me:
