I would like to test the example of the use of the nonlocal statement specified in the answer on this question:but when I try to load this code, I always get a syntax error:Does anybody know what I am doing wrong here (I get the syntax error for every example that I use, containing nonlocal).
nonlocal only works in Python 3; it is a new addition to the language.In Python 2 it'll raise a syntax error; python sees nonlocal as part of an expression instead of a statement.This specific example works just fine when you actually use the correct Python version:
Names listed in a nonlocal statement must not collide with pre-existing bindings in the local scope.https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-nonlocal-statement
