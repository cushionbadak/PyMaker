I am working on a graph library in Python and I am defining my vetex this way:Do I really have to define __lt__,__eq__,__ne__....all by my self? It is so verbose. Is there simpler way I can get around this?Cheers.Please dont use __cmp__ since it will be away in python 3.
functools.total_ordering can help you out here.  It's meant to be a class decorator.  You define one of __lt__(), __le__(), __gt__(), or __ge__() AND __eq__ and it fills in the rest.As a side note:Instead of writing thiswrite this:It's cleaner that way. :-)
Using functools.total_ordering, you only need to define one of the equality operators and one of the ordering operators. In Python < 3.2, you're out of luck, something has to define these operators as individual methods. Though you may be able to save some code by writing a simpler version of total_ordering yourself, if you need it in several places.
