What mathematical operation does XOR perform?
XOR is a binary operation, it stands for "exclusive or", that is to say the resulting bit evaluates to one if only exactly one of the bits is set.This is its function table:This operation is performed between every two corresponding bits of a number.Example: 7 ^ 10In binary: 0111 ^ 1010Properties: The operation is commutative, associative and self-inverse.It is also the same as addition modulo 2.
^ is the Python bitwise XOR operator. It is how you spell XOR in python:XOR stands for exclusive OR. It is used in cryptography because it let's you 'flip' the bits using a mask in a reversable operation:where 5 is the mask; (input XOR mask) XOR mask gives you the input again.
