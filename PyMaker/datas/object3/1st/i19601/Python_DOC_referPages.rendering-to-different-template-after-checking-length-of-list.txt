Pretty much a newbie when it comes to both Django and Python. Would appreciate some suggestions here. I did search for similar questions, but couldn't find one that solved my problem.This is a view that I have written. The intended behaviour is to check the length of a list (districts list), and render to one template if there is only one object in that list, and to another if there are more than one. If there are no objects in the list, 404 is automatically raised.Any help would be much appreciated
You are looking for the len() builtin.E.g:The seq.count() method counts the number of times an individual element occurs in the sequence, and requires one argument (the element to count).
