I have a list of objects, and I would like to find the first one for which a given method returns true for some input value.  This is relatively easy to do in Python:However, in my application it is common that there is no such p for which p.method(input) is true, and so this will raise a StopIteration exception.  Is there an idiomatic way to handle this without writing a try/catch block?In particular, it seems like it would be cleaner to handle that case with something like an if pattern is not None conditional, so I'm wondering if there's a way to expand my definition of pattern to provide a None value when the iterator is empty -- or if there's a more Pythonic way to handle the overall problem!
next accepts a default value:and soNote that you have to wrap the genexp in the extra parentheses for syntactic reasons, otherwise:
