In my application, I use two buttons: One for START recording of RS422 link messages and one for STOP the record.The first time, the application runs correctly : Creation of a .txt file with the messages.The second time, when I click on the START button, a new . txt file is created but, now, messages are recording in this file but also in the first .txt file.See my code : Does somebody have an idea?
You'll have to remove the handlers if you want to stop logging like that, using the Logger.removeHandler() method:otherwise it'll continue to be used.
