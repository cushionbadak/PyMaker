So in the past when I've used a unix server to do my python development if I wanted to pass in an entire folder or directory, I would just put an asterisk() on the end of it. An example would be something like users/wilkenia/shakespeare/ to pass in a set of files containing each of shakespeare's plays. Is there a way to do this in windows? I've tried putting in C:\Users\Alexander\Desktop\coding-data-exam\wx_data* and the same with the disk name removed. Nothing has worked so far, in fact, it takes in the directory as an argument itself.Edit: implemented glob, getting a permissions error, even though I'm running as administrator. Here's my code if anyone wants to have a look.
You can use the glob module, it does exactly this.A quick demo:If you want to extend this for your use case, you'll need to do something along the lines of:You'll read your args with sys.argv and pass it onto glob.
For the sake of showing how you can use pathlib to achieve this result. You can do something like this: some_script.py:Demo:Output:The nice thing about pathlib, is that it takes an object oriented approach to help work with the filesystem easier. Note: pathlib is available out-of-the-box from Python 3.4 and above. If you are using an older version of Python, you will need to use the backported package that you can get from pypi: hereSimply: pip install pathlib2
