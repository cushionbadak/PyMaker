I'm creating a Hot Dog simulator in python, with a class "HotDog".When I'm formatting the string, if there are 2 condiments, I wrote this code to add it to the string:If the second condiment is "mustard", the strip() function is taking away the "d" of mustard, so the string prints like this:I've used trial and error to find more info, and it seems "d" is the only letter that will disappear, i.e.: mustarg and mustarb will be fine.Also, it seems to be the "a" of msg = msg.strip(" and ") that is causing the problem.If I only strip "d " or "nd ", mustard will be fine. 
That's the documented feature. the characters in the string will be stripped from the both ends of the string this method is called onSo, if you initially did a raw hotdog, then you'd end up with raw hotdogHow about instead you usedIf I only strip "d " or "nd ", mustard will be fine.But you'd have an a at the end of the message, no? 
The strip method doesn't work the way you seem to expect. Its argument is a sequence of characters that will be removed if they appear in any order (and any number of times) at either end of your string. So when you pass in " and ", you're telling it to strip off all spaces, 'a', 'n' and 'd' characters. Since the 'd' in 'mustard' is one of those characters, it will be stripped if it's at the end.A better way to remove a specific amount of text from the end of a string would be to slice it: msg = msg[:-5] will remove the last five characters.Or you can avoid creating the extra " and " in any number of ways, such as using str.format or str.join (or a combination of the two).
