This question already has an answer here:Python 3 print without parenthesis                    7 answers                I like python 2's print "TEXT" which does not use without parenthesis, compared to print("TEXT") in python 3. Can I keep the python 2 print around to use by binding it to something like pr? I understand has been discussed in this thread, but this wasn't mentioned as one of the solutions:Python 3 print without parenthesis(By the way, the issue for me is typing and escaping the brackets. The keys ( and ) harder to press than a space bar. Also, because my IDE puts them in automatically, I then need to move my cursor out of it.)EDIT: This is neither a duplicate of the question as indicated NOR am I asking how to use python-3.x's print without parenthesis. Instead, I'm specifically asking if I can bind a python 2 function (presumably after importing it). If the answer is no, that is new information. 
In order to achieve what you want you need to define your own keyword, but you can't do this as you can't define or redefine language keywords without rewriting a compiler/interpreter/etc.
