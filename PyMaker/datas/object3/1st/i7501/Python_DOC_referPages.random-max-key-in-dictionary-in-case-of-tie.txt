I have a dictionary: keys are strings, values are float.Example: I'd like to get 'b' or 'c' as answer with equal probability. I found a way to get said behaviour. However I'm not convinced this is best practice.Is there a better (or even more elegant) approach?
Try this:First, we find the maximum value and then we randomly pick one of the keys that match that value. We're using random.choice, which guarantees a random selection with uniform distribution.
