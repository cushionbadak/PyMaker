I know some of these python built-in methods like: __init__ , __eq__ , __cmp__ . What more are there? Where can I find a good explanation of using these?
You probably want to take a look at:Python Data ModelA Guide to Python's Magic MethodsOr for Python 3:Python Data ModelThe following answers are not as good as the links above. They do not provide precise lists and they are just for research & fun.But... for the sport, let's build a code that will give you some basic ones :POr taking it one step further, listing many special functions:Or, if you want to be insanly rude, you can even run:** Probably not all of the functions in the last example are special methods. This is just for the fun.
