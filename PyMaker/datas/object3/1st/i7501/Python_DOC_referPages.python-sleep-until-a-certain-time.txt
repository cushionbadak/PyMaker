I have a Python script and I want too run it at 3 am. Would like to simply put something like this at the top of it.That way it keeps sleeping for 10 seconds until it's 3am. At 3am, it executes the rest of the code below this and then exits the script.  Is there a simple way to do that?
Solution with a sleep-wait loop:If instead of sleeping, you want to do other work, consider using threading.Timer or the sched module.
