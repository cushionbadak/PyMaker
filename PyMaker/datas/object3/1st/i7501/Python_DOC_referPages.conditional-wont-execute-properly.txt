I wonder if you could help me with the code below:It looks right to me, but the elif statement which gives a value to min always prints None. Could you please explain why?
None > number is never true, because Python 2 sorts None before any other type. Don't compare numbers with None.Either test for None explicitly, or replace None with an infinity value.Testing for None:Setting the values to positive or negative infinity:By setting min to positive infinity, any other number is guaranteed to be smaller; the same applies to max negative infinity.
Your min > input is always going to be false if min is None, hence why it never gets set.Also you don't want the elif.  The first number is both the min and the max.Fixed:Good luck!
