Natural Text
My program basically allows users to input a word of their choice and after that, give them the option to remove certain vowels of their choice.It goes like this:In case you were wondering, the top section is a list of all possible inputs for the user when he chooses which vowels he wants to remove from his word. If you can catch it, vowel == v[0-24]: is my attempt to try and access all the elements in the top list, v.  How should I change that?   Basically, if the user types any element in the top list, say, 'IU', he would have the letters I and U removed from his original word.Basically, the logic of that if statement: is if the length of the user's response is less than or equal to 5 and the user's input matches any element of the list v .... remove the vowels...you get the point.I know that if statement is wrong, so what should I change it to? 
Replace vowel == v[0-24] with vowel.upper() in v.
You want to test if a set of letters is included in another set of letters. So, the perfect thing to use is a set, see the documentation in Python built-in types.We create a set of the allowed vowels from a string. It will be the set {'U', 'O', 'I', 'A', 'E'} (sets are not ordered).Later, we will create a set of the vowels you enter (converted to uppercase), and check if this set is included in (or equal to) the first one, with the <= operator:Then, we'll iterate on the vowels we entered, and replace each one (uppercase and lowercase) in our initial word.As a sidenote: as the strings in your code were very long, I cut them using Python's automatic concatenation: strings following each other are simply concatenated.
