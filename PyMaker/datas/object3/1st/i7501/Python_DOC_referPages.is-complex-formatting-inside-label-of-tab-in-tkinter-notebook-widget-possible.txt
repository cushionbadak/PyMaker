Natural Text
I've just finished adding some nice formatting to my logging console where based on the message type the prefix of the message is coloured differently:In order to do that I used tags (tag_config()) along with Font() to make things bold:However I am struggling to add a similar feature to the tab where this console is. Every time an error log message is logged in the console the tab where it is located gets updated to show the number of errors that are currently logged:However I would like to make the (4) (from the screenshot above) coloured with red. I was unable to find font formatting for the tab label:Reason: I've discovered that the logging console gets ignored quite often since the other tab in my widget is where the interaction happens. Since I want to keep things separated in order to prevent clustering too many things on the screen at the same time I'm trying to notify the user in an non-intrusive way that an error has occurred (other types of log messages are not that important).
If you're using the ttk.Notebook, the answer is that you can only configure the tab text style for all tabs using styling. So you can make ALL tabs foreground red...You could also use the tab compound option, which enables you to place both text and an image on the tab. You can change the text or image on a given tab separately. But to do what you are asking, your '(4)' would have to be an image, meaning you'd have to have a lot of pre-existing images waiting to be loaded depending on how many errors you anticipate.
Short answer:No, it's not possible from the scratch, and since appereance of ttk widgets heavily depends on theme in use and/or platform - it's hard to implement without jump to tk environment/hard to keep desired layout.But your question is really interested, so I tried to implement this feature by myself.Long Answer:First of all, you need to know, that each widget has the layout structure, that represented by hierarchy of elements.On my Win machine default theme is vista and layout for Tab is:As you can see - there's a Notebook.label element. And this elements handles all that options:So that's it - you can't do partially formatting text within label, because  -font or -foreground options applies to entire string.But what if we change this layout structure with additional label/text?It's looks like a good idea, that we can use first text for tab title and second for counter!Unfortunately and obviously, it's not gonna work, because both elements react on the same options (text, font, et cetera)According to docs here:The value of an element option is taken from:an option of the same name and type in the widget containing the  element;a dynamic setting specified by style map and the current state;the default setting specified by style configure; orthe element's built-in default value for the option.However, I think it's possible to "map" second text option as text2 for Tab, but with Python on it's own, it's looks like impossible task!Conclusion:Long answer is attempt to implement such a feature, that leads to another question of "how to add options to custom class widget and bind them to element options". The more straitght solution there would be to use compound behaviour of a label, since you can convert any int to image/64encoded image-string, but this option is already mentioned.
I would declare your log windows as instances of a LogWindow class. This may not quite be perfect Python but you get the idea. You can probably move the tag_config commands too. __log becomes a private method and thus doesn't need as strict data checking.
