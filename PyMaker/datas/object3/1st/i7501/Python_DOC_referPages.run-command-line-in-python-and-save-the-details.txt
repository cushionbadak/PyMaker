Simply create a bat file with ping 8.8.8.8 written in it.Then you can use the subprocess command to invoke it from within the python script.
import osres = os.popen('ping 8.8.8.')print(res.read())res.close()But I think it's safer to use subprocess.Popen() instead of os.popen().Here show how to switch over
