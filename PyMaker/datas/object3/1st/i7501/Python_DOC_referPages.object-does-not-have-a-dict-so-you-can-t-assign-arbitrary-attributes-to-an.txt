From https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#objectobject does not have a __dict__, so you can’t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the object class.Why "object does not have a __dict__"? It works for meWhy "you can’t assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of the object class"?
You are confusing the __dict__ on the type with the attribute on instances. object() instances do not have a __dict__ attribute:Note that the __dict__ attribute of custom Python class instances is a descriptor; the instance itself doesn't have the attribute, it is the class that provides it (so type(instance).__dict__['__dict__'].__get__(instance) is returned). object.__dict__ may exist, but object.__dict__['__dict__'] does not.object() doesn't support instance attributes because it is the base for all custom Python classes, which must support not having a __dict__ attribute when defining slots instead.
