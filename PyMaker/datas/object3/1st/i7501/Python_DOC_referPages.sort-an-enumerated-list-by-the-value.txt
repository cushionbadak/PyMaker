This question already has an answer here:Python sorting key function supporting tuples and lists                    4 answers                MWE:Now suppose I want to sort this list by the index 1, i.e. by the original list1, in say, ascending order.How do I do that?I would like something that could then give me both the indexes and the values.
Sort with item[1] as key:
Something like this?By providing a function of one argument to key we are specifying a comparison key for list elements used by sorted. itemgetter is a nice functional wrapper around item getter operator [i].
You need to pass in the whole list (not just the first element), and use a lambda function to sort on the value - x[1].
