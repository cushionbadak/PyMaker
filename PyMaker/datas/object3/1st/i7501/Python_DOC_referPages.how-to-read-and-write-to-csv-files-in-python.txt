I have a csv file, which has only a single column , which acts as my input. I use that input to find my outputs. I have multiple outputs and I need those outputs in another csv file. Can anyone please suggest me the ways on how to do it ?Here is the code : 
Here is a simple example: The data.csv is a csv with one column and multiple rows.The results.csv contain the mean and median of the input and is a csv with 1 row and 2 columns (mean is in 1st column and median in 2nd column)Example:
In pseudo code, you'll do something like this:Now, I won't write a full-working example because it's better for you to start digging and ask specific questions when you have some. You're now just asking: write this for me because I don't know Python.here is the official documentationhere you can read about the csv modulehere you can read about the os module
I think you need read_csv for reading file to Series and to_csv for writing output Series to file in looping by Series.iteritems.
