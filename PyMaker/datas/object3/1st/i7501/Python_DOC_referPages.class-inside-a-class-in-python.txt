How can i call a class inside a class in Python? For example:I want to call POINT class in CIRCLE.Thanks for answers.
Are you trying to do this?That way, you'll have a class Circle which in its constructor accepts a point (an instance of class Point) and a radius, producing and instance of Circle.
Do you want to define the circle's center position using the POINT class? If this is what you want, you throw away the self.x/self.y inside CIRCLE and do self.center = POINT(x,y).
