Most of my work with python uses almost the same modules as well as default settings so I want to do this once for all.This is what I did:1. put export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc into ~/.bashrc file2. put the following code into the /.pythonrc fileHowever, when I run the following codepython3 test.pywith the test.py containing the simple code like this:It gives me the error: NameError: name 'os' is not definedI am not sure which step I did wrong.
It seems what you want is only possible in interactive mode!  From the Python Â» Documentation: PYTHONSTARTUPIf this is the name of a readable file,     the Python commands in that file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive mode. Relevant: SO pythonrc in interactive code
