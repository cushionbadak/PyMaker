Natural Text
I need a regex that matches the below link patterns as follows.'https://website/1/extension1' -> True'https://website/1.1/extension1' -> False'https://website/1/#extension1' -> FalseMy regex isIt works find for the case two. But I wonder why this doesn't return False in case of occurrence of # in link.
Your regex matches the https://website/1/ prefix, and nothing more. It doesn't matter that the string contains more text beyond that / after the version number.You need to include anchors, to make sure you are not just matching a substring. Use ^ and $ to anchor to the start and end of a string, so there is no room left for other strings. You need to match paths that don't include any # characters:I also escaped the dots in the hostname, you don't want to match 'any' character, you want to match literal '.' characters. \d matches one digit (so 2 and 3 for major Python versions, but no more).Online demo: https://regex101.com/r/gL7X7o/3Python demo using Python documentation URLs:
