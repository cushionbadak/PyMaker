I'm using and try/except statement in python inside a very long loop. If the exception is raised, it should do nothing.If i use this first proposition, the total time of calculation for the loop is about 10 minutes.If i use this second propositon, the total time of calculation for the loop is about 2 minutes.Why is it so different, and why is the second one faster as, logically for me, pass is a better solution than None ?The exact code is :I made several tests with both propisitons and it's always the same.How time is calculated : 
Given two functions:They are doing exactly the same thing, the proof using dis:Indeed, here is the definition of pass:pass is a null operation â€” when it is executed, nothing happens. It is  useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically,  but no code needs to be executed, for example:Conclusion: pass statement is as fast as Nonein theory.Edit: why it may be a slower time using None instead of return None (like in OP example).Given two functions:The difference using dis:So it is clear that using None instead of pass will add two extra operation LOAD_CONST and POP_TOP. It shouldnt add 8 minutes though, so I'm sure this isn't the real reason.
