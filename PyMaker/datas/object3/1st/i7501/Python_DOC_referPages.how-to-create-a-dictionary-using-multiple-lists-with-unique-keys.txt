Below is an example:I'm trying to add the list a, b to my players dictionary that I created above:Also, is there a way to make Player_id's value (4, 2) as keys to the players dictionary ( This is what I'm trying to achieve):
All you need is:Details Below:First you will need to change your already made dict to the desired output type like this:will output:then you take your two lists a and b and make an additional dict out of them like this:will output:and Finally, you just put them in the same dict as follows:output:Please notice that you can do this in a loop if you want to add some more membres. For exemple consider these new lists:by doing the same as before:you get as output:You can refer to these links about merging dicts and **dicts for a better understanding.Here is also a link for the built-in zip method.
Note: Whenever you're working with some iteration code, it's worth checking out the built-in itertools package. izip, for eaxample, improves over zip by returning an iterator instead of a list.
