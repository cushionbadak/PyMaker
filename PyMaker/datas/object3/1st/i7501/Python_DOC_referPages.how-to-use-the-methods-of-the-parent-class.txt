Here the SMS_Store inherits the Message, but every time I call the parent method there is the error:NoneType object does not have attribute 'read_message'.and also the object stored in the list returns a None value??
It's unclear where that error could be coming from since read_message() is only called by the inbox.read_message(0) statement at the end of your code, which wouldn't produce it (although the return value of the read_message() method is always None, since there's no explicit return statement in it).Regardless, to answer the titular question, to do that explicitly you would use the super() methodâ€”but that's not the problem here which is that the SMS_Store class shouldn't be a subclass of Message at all, since it's not a specialization of the Message class...rather it's a container of Message instances.Below is reworked version of your code that shows how to separate these two classes and get most if not all of the methods working. It also now mostly follows PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code recommendations.
You shouldn't use inheritance in this case. Here's corrected version (also fixed code style):
