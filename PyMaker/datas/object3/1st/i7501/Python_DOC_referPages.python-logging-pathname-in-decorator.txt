When I logging an error in a decorator, the logging pathname is not what I want.logging.conf:Nomally, logging an error in file /home/lizs/test/app.py:Debug message on console:The above logging pathname(/home/lizs/test/app.py) is what I want. But when I use a decorator:/home/lizs/test/app.py:/home/lizs/test/decorators.py:The debug message:Now, the logging pathname is a pathname of the decorator (/home/lizs/test/decorators.py).How to set the logging pathname to /home/lizs/test/app.py when I use decorator.
Your problem is that your exception handler is one level upper than where the exception was initially raised, so you will have to examine the stacktrace and manually build a LogRecord with the correct file/line information:
Solution:Try this:app.py:decorators.py:Explanation:According to docs here you can pass a dictionary as extra argument to populate the __dict__ of the LogRecord created for the logging event with user-defined attributes. These custom attributes can then be used as you like.Thus, because we can't modify pathname directly, this approach with real_pathname is most straight possible.Links:inspect.getsourcefileinspect.tracelogging.message
