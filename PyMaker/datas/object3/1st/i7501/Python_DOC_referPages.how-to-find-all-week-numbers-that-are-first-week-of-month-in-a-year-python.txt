I want to create a event that falls on Sunday of every first week of months.This is what I am doing for a particular week number which is first week of june to get date:So I need a list of all week numbers that are first week of month so I can loop on it and get desire dates.Adding More informationI want a method which return list of week numbers which are first week of month where first week means week has first sunday.
I've done a loop through the months, then got the first Sunday (starting at month's 1st and moving to the next day until a Sunday is found), then got the week-of-year of the date found:The result, though, is different from what you expect:I also tried with weeks.append(int(d.strftime("%W"))) but it gives the same results - I'm using Python 3.5.2 and a week is defined as:The ISO year consists of 52 or 53 full weeks, and where a week starts on a Monday and ends on a Sunday. The first week of an ISO year is the first (Gregorian) calendar week of a year containing a Thursday. This is called week number 1, and the ISO year of that Thursday is the same as its Gregorian year.
(Edited, because of error in weekday numbering)Assuming you want ISO weeknumbers, you can then use the isocalendar() method. This gives a tuple (year, weeknumber, weekday). This uses the convention that weeks start with Monday, and the first week of the year is the first week with at least four days in the year (or in other words, the week with the first Thursday).If you have another convention for first-day-of-the-week or first-week-of-the-year, you will have to brew your own function to get the week number.Use the above method in a loop over the months, and you can create the desired list with week numbers.
