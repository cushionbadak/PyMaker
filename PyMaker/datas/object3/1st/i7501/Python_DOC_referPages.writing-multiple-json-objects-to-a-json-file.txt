I have a list of json objects that I would like to write to a json file. Example of my data is as follows:I would like to wirte this to a json file. Here's the code that I am using for this purpose:But this gives me a file with only 1 long row of data. I would like to have a row for each json object in my original data. I know there are some other StackOverflow questions that are trying to address somewhat similar situation (by externally inserting '\n' etc.), but it hasn't worked in my case for some reason. I believe there has to be a pythonic way to do this.How do I achieve this?
The format of the file you are trying to create is called JSON lines.It seems, you are asking why the jsons are not separated with a newline. Because write method does not append the newline.If you want implicit newlines you should better use print function:
Use the indent argument to output json with extra whitespace. The default is to not output linebreaks or extra spaces.https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#basic-usage
