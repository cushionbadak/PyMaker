Python 3.6 added PEP 487, which adds an __init_subclass__ method among other things.  Is it possible to write a version of ABC that doesn't use a metaclass?
If all you care about is the check for abstract methods, then yes. Just move the abstract method set computation to the __init_subclass__ method:The base object.__new__ implementation then uses an non-empty __abstractmethods__ set to prevent instantiation. But ABCs also support virtual subclass registration; the two hook methods this requires have to be implemented on the metaclass.
