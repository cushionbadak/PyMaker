Natural Text
I want to make a list of dicts that have the following structure,However at the moment i only have a csv file consisting of the website text. Below i have attempted to somehow create lists of the same length as my website text file, then zip them and create a dict from that. I have been unable to find information on here when it comes to creating a dict from more that 2 lists. I am well aware of the ugliness of the try as well...
Since the only difference is the text, you can do the following:The 'Business':'Attorney' pair will be the same for each dictionary, while the value corresponding to 'Website text' will be the data from your file.
You can use defaultdict
This is what i would do:I don t know if i understood well what you want to do
