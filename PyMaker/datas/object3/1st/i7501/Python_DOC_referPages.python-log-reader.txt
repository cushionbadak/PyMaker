I'm trying to create an asynchronous function that reads the constantly updating log file and gets every line of it. That's what I have for now:It works fine until the file is restarted. I was thinking about checking whether the file's size became smaller than it was, that would mean that it was refreshed, but I feel there must be a better option for that.Any tips are welcome.
For refreshing the file, you can check it's inode. Get it from the path using os.stat and then extract the inode number. If the inode you get is different than the previous one, you'll have to reopen the file. (so doing this using a with block may not be easy)To optimise it a bit so you don't query the file all the time, you could implement some timeout which you can easily accept, but which is higher than the usual delay between the log lines.This will work if the file has been replaced, which is the usual method of rotating logfiles. It will not work if the file has only been truncated.
