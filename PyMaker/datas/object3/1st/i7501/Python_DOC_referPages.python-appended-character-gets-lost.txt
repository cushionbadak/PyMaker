Hey I´m quite new to python and i´m writing a script to sort through a file in for some keywords, and everything works fine except a small reading/printing miss that i don´t understand... This is my problem code and the file im scanning through:this prints The data.append string has the problem, as shown in the print i works, but i want to extract the code ex 1FFF 12 55 1F but not [Channel 1] aslo... so i used .strip to remove it, but then i get this print: All strings that has [Channel 1] loses the first character and if i put a 8 instead of a 9 in data.apped it prints:Then it takes the > from the Tester -> and I don´t understand why? it skips the character in between for some reason? It´s like when I have a 9 it counts every character including spaces and when I have a 8 it counts characters but not including spaces... how is that possible? someone who knows how to fix this, thanks!
The problem is that strip('chars') removes all combinations of 'chars' as noted here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.stripSo what you're really saying is remove the characters [, C, h, a, , n, e, l, 1, and ] from my string.If you just want to remove [Channel 1] I would do the following:This regex pattern will only match the text [Channel 1] if it is as the end of the line.or alternatively if you don't want to include the regex module you could useThis solution will replace [Channel 1] regardless of where it shows up in the line.=================The best solution here is to use regex and skip the entire start and end thing. You can do the following:
this is a version using regex:the regular expression matches the string 'Tester -> ' followed by a string of length 13 containing hexadecimal characters or spaces.that is assuming that you iterate over your file line per line.
