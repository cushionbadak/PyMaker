Natural Text
I have several sentences of the format:Visa requirements for Qatari citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the Qatar.Visa requirements for British citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the United Kingdom.Visa requirements for Belarusian citizens are administrative entry restrictions imposed on citizens of Belarus by the authorities of other states. I only want to match the "citizens of [country name]" in the above sentences. As you can see, some of them end with a period "citizens of china." others continue and some have words like "the" and some countries have two or more words like "united kingdom".How do I write a (pythonic) regex that will match the "citizens of COUNTRY_NAME" in all of the above statements and their variations?
Use the regex module so that we can use Unicode categories.We make the assumption that country names are multiple contiguous words that each start with a capital letter, and are separated by some number of spaces. If you can't make that assumption, then tweak it at your will. If you already have a country list, then just .{,40} match the country part (or some other sensible limit) and check if some country is a sub-string.(?: means we don't match that part, and p{Lu} and p{L} are Unicode uppercase letters and letters, respectively.
