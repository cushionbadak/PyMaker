I am trying to to construct the folloiwng line which is the object from the holidays package:I want to split it as the following:holidays and .DE() as parameter. As string it does not work tried it already and receiving the following error message:HOLIDAYS_German = holidays+Option TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'module' and 'str'How can I solve it?The code looks like the following:
Just putting two strings together does not make Python execute those strings.Dynamic attribute access is done with the getattr() function; DE just an attribute on the holidays module, one that happens to be callable:So getattr() retrieves the DE attribute of the holiday object (a module), and the result is called. Note that Option does not start with a .!
