I have put the following in my config.py:and then I am doing in all of my scripts and imported files.Unfortunately, this causes multiple log files created.How to fix this? I wan't centralized config.py with logging configured both to console and file.
Case 1: Independent Scripts / ProgramsIn case we are talking about multiple, independent scripts, that should have logging set up in the same way: I would say, each independent application should have its own log. If you definitively do not want this, you would have to make sure that all applications have the same log file name (e.g. create a function in config.py, with a parameter "timestamp", which is provided by your script(s)specify the append filemode for the fileHandlermake sure that config.py is not called twice somewhere, as you would add the log handlers twice, which would result in each log message being printed twice.Case 2: One big application consisting of modulesIn case we are talking about one big application, consisting of modules, you could adopt a structure like the following:config.py:module example (some_module.py):main example (main.py)Explanation:With the call to set_up_logging() in main() you configure your applications root loggereach module is called from main(), and get its logger via logger = logging.getLogger(__name__). As the modules logger are in the hierarchy below the root logger, those loggings get "propagated up" to the root logger and handled by the handlers of the root logger.For more information see Pythons logging module doc and/or the logging cookbook
