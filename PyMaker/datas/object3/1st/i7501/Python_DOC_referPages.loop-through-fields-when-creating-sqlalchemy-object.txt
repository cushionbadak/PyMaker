I am trying to loop through a dict that I received via json and save the results to a database via sqlalchemy. I've kept the field names the same as the key names from the dict. It seems repetitive to list each field and dict over and over. But when I try to use something like c.keys() it does not work. If that were the case I could do:    for key in c.keys():        customer.key = c[key]But that does not work. My current code is:
You may use Python's setattr function, which as per the document:setattr(object, name, value)The arguments are an object, a string and an arbitrary value. The string  may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The function  assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, setattr(x, 'foobar', 123) is equivalent to x.foobar = 123.Hence you may write your code as:where I am assuming that you have all the properties defined in your class corresponding to the keys present in your dict object c.
You could just unpack your dictionaries as arguments to __init__, given that you've not overridden the default constructor provided by Declarative that does exactly what the other answer does; it sets the attributes from the keyword arguments:
