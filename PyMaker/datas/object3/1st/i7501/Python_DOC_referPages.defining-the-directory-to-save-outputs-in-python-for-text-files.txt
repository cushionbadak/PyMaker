Natural Text
I would like to save my outputs (which are text files) from a Python script to a different directory. Following is my code to define the directory for my  outputs:How can I generate these outputs to a different fixed directory like:D:\Test\"The file name"
For instance, you can use the join function from os.path (docs)
You can use os.path.join(path, filename) to create the desired path.os.path.join('path/to','file.jpg')
