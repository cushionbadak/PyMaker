ObjectiveI'm looking to use the regular expression \d+ to extract just the digits from the string, answer_40194. ProblemI'm targeting a form element with Selenium and I'm printing the formID to the Terminal, but after the line re.findall('\d+', formID) I expect formID to be just the numbers 40194, but instead I'm getting the entire string answer_40194.script.py
