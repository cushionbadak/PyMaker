There is a solution available for doing bitwise operations. But, it converts the integers in binary number and then do bitwise operations. I already have the numbers in binary format. How do I carry out the bitwise operations for these numbers?Ex. x = 10101, y = 11001I want z = x or y to be 11101.Any help is highly appreciated.
You can convert decimal 10101 to binary 10101 by converting it to string then int(.., 2) (2 => base 2):Do operation you want (| => bitwise or):Then, convert it back to decimal, using format (or str.format  with format string b -> meaning binary representation) and int:
