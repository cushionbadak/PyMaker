Since version 3.4, Python supports a simple subtest syntax when writing unittests. A simple example could look like this:When running the tests, the output will beHowever, in my real world use cases, the subtests will depend on a more complex iterable and check something which is very different for each subtest. Consequently, I would rather have each subtest counted and listed as a separated test case in the output (Ran 6 tests in ... in this example) to get the full picture.Is this somehow possible with the plain unittest module in Python? The nose test generator feature would output each test separately but I would like to stay compatible with the standard library if possible.
You could subclass unittest.TestResult:Then in NumbersTest override the run function:Sorry I cannot test this in a fully working environment right now, but this should do the trick.
