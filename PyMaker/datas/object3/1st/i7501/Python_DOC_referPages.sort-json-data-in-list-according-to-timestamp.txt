I am loading data(20 elements) to another file on load...here I want to sort these 20 elements according to timestamp I am using in list element.     
Trivia:Since you're using an OrderedDict - your records are already sorted by timestamp (to be honest - they're not, but recordses order is preserved).The only unexpected behaviour with your code - when you "create" (overwrite) existed one student in line:And if name in record: already - order is broken, so your idea about sorting isn't a meaningless, but I think, that it's better and more rational to just be sure of the recordses order, than sort records each time.Workaround:Square brackets after variable name means that this object is subscriptable (for e.g. tuple, list, dict, string and many more). Subscriptable means that this object at least implements the __getitem__() method (and __setitem__() in your case).First method handles case, when you're trying to pull something from subscriptable object (by index/key/anything) and the second one - when you're trying to overwrite something.And I suggest to implement such a feature with custom class:and in your code just use this ordered dictionary instead of base ordered!Conclusion:Pros: No need to sort things, because we keep desired order.Cons: If you're already has "unordered" data - you need to sort it once.To sort ordered dict by time stamp you can use this function:References:In Python, what does it mean if an object is subscriptable or not?OrderedDict Examples and Recipes
