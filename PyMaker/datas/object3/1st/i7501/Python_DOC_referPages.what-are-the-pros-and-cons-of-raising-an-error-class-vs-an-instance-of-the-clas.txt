The following appears to have the same effect:Is there a difference, and if so, what are the pros and cons of each?
There is essentially no difference if the exception class requires no arguments for initialization:If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly instantiated by  calling its constructor with no arguments.[Emphasis mine]Otherwise, you'll get another exception complaining about the initialization of the instance:Apparently, you can do more by passing custom arguments to custom exception classes, or passing a custom message to a builtin exception class:The above is much more informative (quite desirable from a users' perspective) than a barren ValueError.
There is no difference:See section 8.4 of the docs: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions
