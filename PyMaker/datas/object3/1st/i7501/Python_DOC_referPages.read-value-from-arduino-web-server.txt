I am trying to write Python code to read a simple temperature value from the local Arduino server.This is my source page:I want to read the value in square brackets with Beautiful soup but no luck. I cannot find my case. All examples are more complex; mine is simple but I do not know.I'm using Raspberry Pi.With PHP, I wrote simple code. It changed for me and it worked.This is my PHP code:How would I write such code in Python?
You can extract all values between [..] directly from your html/text using regular expressions, i.e. re.findall().Assuming you already fetched that page from your Arduino server, perhaps using the requests library:you can extract those values with:For html from your example, values variable will contain:Now you can say:Or if you want to extract all values at once, you can use the destructuring assignment, like this:
Now i use this code and work...Now have problem how declarated find_between to float "test1"I have to write for each set, this part with def ???I think like it in my PHP
