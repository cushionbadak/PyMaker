I have virtual environment created for python 3.6. And I have install python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit package with apt-get. The package have installed in global python3.5 and its working, but if I try to import it from venv python3.6 there is import error... How can I install this package in my virtual environment? Or if this is not possible how can I use global package installed in 3.5 in my virtualenv 3.6 python.Running with global python3.5Running with python3.6 from venv
In order to use system packages inside a virtual environment, you have to use --system-site-packages option when creating virtual env:The same switch is available in Python3's venv.Much better option is (if applicable in your case) to install all packages inside your virtual env, using pip.
If you look at the contents of the package (using dpkg --listfiles python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit) you'll probably see something like this:The package installs binary modules compiled for a specific python version (in this case: cpython-35m), you won't be able to use those from a python3.6 installation/venv directly because of the incompatible binary names.For that to work you'd need to symlink all the .so files in the PyQt5 directory to your venv and there change cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu to cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu. Same for the sip libraries, as those are requiered by PyQt5. And that will only work if the ABI is compatible between the two versions.A quick test with the versions mentioned above shows it works at least for simple scripts, but I can't give any guarantee.
