I have a list of strings which may contain letters, symbols, digits, etc, as below:How do I filter out all other strings, except numbers less than 10000000 and greater than 99999999?Expected Output:
You can use a map and filter.list() optional on python2.Output:If you don't want the conversion to integer, drop the map:
If you don't mind making a new list, you can try something with just a list comprehension like
Explanation:Filter all values in the list using the valid function as your criteria. 
print(res)Output:
Let me provide a simple and efficient answer, using regular expressions. There's no need to map (duplicating the original list), or to convert everything to ints; you are basically asking how to keep all 8-digit integers in your list:We compile a regular expression which matches exactly 8 digits and then filter the list by providing a partial application of regex.match to the standard filter function.
