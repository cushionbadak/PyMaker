I have this dictionary:And a list:What am i doing now is this:In other words i want to count how many times each site appears in the list and on which position. This works but in the given example it will return something like:while i would want it to be:How can i achieve this? I can use a variable, initiate it with var=0 and then +=1 and use it as an artificial index but is there a more "pythonic" way of doing it?
If I rightly understand your question, you already have db dictionary and you're seeking enumerate operator.And your code will be like below:
You could do something like this:You essentially replace your dictionary values with a list-comprehension that compares the dictionary entry to the lista entry. If the result of the comparison is True you convert that boolean value to an integer (True -> 1, False -> 0).If the items in lista are very limited in comparison to the dictionary keys you can do this instead:This way, you loop and edit only those keys in your dictionary that appear in your lista. Also notice that you loop over a set constructed from the elements of lista to ignore its duplicates ('www.baurom.ro' key is edited once, not as many times as it appears on lista).
If I understand your problem correctly, you could just iterate over lista and create db as needed :It requires only one pass over lista and should be really fast.If you have a list of interesting urls, you could use this variant:
