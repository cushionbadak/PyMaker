I have been assigned the following exercise as homework:Some Web sites impose certain rules for passwords. Write a function that checks whether a string is a valid password. Suppose the password rules are as follows:    A password must have at least eight characters.A password must consist of only letters and digits.A password must contain at least two digits.  Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays valid password if the rules are followed or invalid password otherwise.I know there's a more efficient and proper way of doing this but i'm just starting out so I don't necessarily need to be those right now. Just want to finish this question. The counter/ accumulator works and I don't get any errors but I can not fulfill the if condition correctly so that this program prints "valid password"
The problem with your existing code is that the variable digit is a number, and therefore doing digit is True as you have done in your if statement, always return False. If you remove digit is True, then your existing solution will work. Take a look however at my version:I have made the following modifications from your original:Used the built-in function str.isdigit() for checking if a character is a digit.Used the built-in function str.isalpha() for checking if a character is a letter of the alphabetMoved everything but the counting operations outside of the for loop, so that the function doesn't print multiple thingsIf you want, you can undo the first two changes, if you're worried about your teacher knowing you asked for help. However, I wouldn't turn in the solution that prints "Password doesn't contain enough digits" as many times as there are characters in the inputted password.
you can write something like this:nice and simple.
