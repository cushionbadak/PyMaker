I have a dataframe like thisI now want to select all columns of this dataframe where the entries in column a start with r followed by five numbers.From here I learned how one would do this if it started just with r without the numbers:Something like thisdoes of course not work. How would one do this properly?
Option 1pd.Series.str.match Use it as a filterOption 2Custom list comprehension using string methods Use it as a filterTiming 
You can use str.contains and pass a regex pattern:Here the pattern evaluates to ^r - start with character r, and then \d{5} looks for 5 digitsstartswith looks for a character pattern, not a regex pattern which is why it failsRegarding the difference between str.contains and str.match, they are analagous but str.contains uses re.search whilst str.match uses re.match which is more strict, see the docs.editTo answer your comment add $ so that it matches a specific number of characters, see related:
