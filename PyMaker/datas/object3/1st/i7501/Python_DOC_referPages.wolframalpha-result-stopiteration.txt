I getting an error for my below code:Error I am getting:What am I doing Wrong?
I've just run your code (with the question "temperature of the sun") and it seems to work fine, giving me an answer of 5772 K.StopIteration is raised when there are no more items in the iterable (res.results). What question did you ask, and are you sure it gave an answer?Try printing res.results before the call to next to check what it returned.
