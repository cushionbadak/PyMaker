I have two lists as follows:I want to produce the following list, with alternating A and B. Notice that the resulting iterable is longer than the input iterables:I am currently using itertools:But is this the "nicest" way? Is there a solution which doesn't require an import?
You could try
The best way is using a nested loop or use itertools.product() but if you want a functional approach you can use itertools.starmap, operator.add and some built-in functions such as map() and list() as following:
Regarding the alternative to itertools.product, check Arount's answer.About the string formatting now, it's not very Pythonic (and not scalable at all) to use str(x) + y.Instead, use the format string method, or even better, Python 3.6's f-strings:Here is a link to the string formatting documentation.
