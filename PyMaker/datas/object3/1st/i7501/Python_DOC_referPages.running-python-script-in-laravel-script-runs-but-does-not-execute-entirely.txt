Running on a local Apache setup on my machine, and I use python outside of Laravel. Using Laravel 5.4, I have made and registered the command. I can call it fine using php artisan python:printIt. I am getting a success on running the command. . . but the file is not writing! Here is the console message:$ php artisan python:printIt In command handle for printIt. Running  command. Command is : C:\Users\Cortland\Miniconda3\python.exe  C:^\wamp64^\www^\cmrd^\cgi-bin^\py-test^\printer.pySuccess. Here is  the return value: This message came from the python script.1The python script is fine when run through the python shell or command line. Here, must be running the script because it has the correct print message. However, the exec return value is a 1, which is failure. The failure is confirmed in that no file 'pyfyle.txt' exists. What am I doing incorrectly, and how can it be fixed?The real application will be more involved, but have to make sure I can operate basic script calls first. The Laravel command class: printIt.phpThe python script: printer.py
In console enter:To give the Python script execution permissions.That would work for Linux distributions, but seeing that you have "C:\" in your output, it means you're running Windows.In which case:you need to add .py to the PATHEXT environment variable.as per:  https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-make-python-scripts-executable
The issue was I had made an assumption about the version of python the server was running.At home I use Python 3.6. If I had simply ran python -V on the server at the beginning, I would have prevented hours of confundrum and frustration. The server runs on Python 2.6, where file operation is not the same. kwarg encoding is not valid, which is enough to break the program. Also, I should have been printing $res to see the error messages.Moral of the story:Always check software and package versions.Always find a way to show your errors.
