I Have a dictionary with multiple keys and values as follows:Now, I need to write them into a csv file as follows:Does Anyone know how to do that? I tried this code but does not work:
If you format your My_data correctly to be dictionary with valid key value pair and the value being a valid tuple or list here is one of the way you can get desired output. (assuming the value will be a tuple of (item, value)).If your item and value are two words then you can go for approach 2.This is basic coding, you would have to add error handling and other cosmetics to make it perfect for your input validation.Sample Run (key3 has more than 2 items i.e. each key having different number of items)
