I get log messages with the same date when I print them to the console (or logfile). But the time-out between messages is two seconds.  Here is my codeHere is output:
have a look at the documentation of logging.Formatter(fmt=None, datefmt=None, style='%'). the second argument you need to pass is a datefmt ("%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S" in your case). the logger will do the fmt.strftime(...) for you.you are passing a string that represents datetime.now() in this format. as this is a str (e.g. '2017-07-08_17:20:51') the formatter does not complain but always prints this exact date: '2017-07-08_17:20:51'.strftime(...) will result in '2017-07-08_17:20:51' - there are no format specifiers to fill in.what you should do is this:(btw: format is a built-in; renamed your formatter to fmt such that the built-in is not overwritten).
