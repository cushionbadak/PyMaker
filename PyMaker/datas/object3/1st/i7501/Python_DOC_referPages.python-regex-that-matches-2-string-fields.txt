Natural Text
I want to create a RegEx that will help me with my process. I have to see if 2 fields that contain text match or not, e.g First: I want to see how many words there are ==> 2 in fA and 3 in fB. Sometimes fA or fB have only 1 word and I need to see if fA = fBSecond: I need to see if fA is included in fB or if is the same, and what is different?Please let me know if you need more info.
Regex won't be the right tool for what you want.You can start by splitting your strings (which gives you lists of words), and making sets from them.Then, you can easily and quickly get the common elements, differences and so on, see the documentation for all possible operations.Some of the things you want could be accomplished this way:You could print the elements of a set like this:but note that the order will be random, as sets are not ordered.You could also turn the sets into lists with list(set_A) and sort them if you need.
