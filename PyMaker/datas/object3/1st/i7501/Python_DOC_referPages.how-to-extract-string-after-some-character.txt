I need to extract in between part:I need to get "course-single" from above string.
Chain a couple of str.split calls:DetailsFirst, get everything after the last /:Next, get everything before the .html portion:
Using Python 3, use the urllib module, then trim out the parts you don't want from the resulting "path" you want:Details: urlparse(url_str) will yield: So, you extract the path: urlparse(url_str).path: to get: '/course-single.html'Then you need to remove the parts you are not interested in, so split on the ., which will give you ['/course-single', 'html']. So, just access the first item ([0]), remove the first slash with [1:] slice and that gives you your final result of course-single.Multiple slashesIf you have a longer url, and you need that last part, then you can do the following, and it should work for whatever length url you provide:
Use regular expressions:Output:
You can use this:Details:test.find('8080/') - find place where 8080/ string is located ( + 5 because we only have interested in string comes next in line ).test.find('.html') - find where .html located.test[test.find('8080/') + 5: test.find('.html')] - get string between this 2 located strings.
