Hey so the other day I was messing around with some code and it gave me this error.if clearargs[1] == "history":  \n IndexError: list index out of rangebtw most functions are custom defined
The list index starts from zero.So, if the length of the list is exactly one, than clearargs[0] is the right access to the first value in the list.When asking to get the value from clearargs[1], you assume that the length of the list is at least 2.
else block will be executed only when thelen(clearargs < 1) so the only valid index  is clearargs[0].You are making a logical error.
