I have this dictionary:and require the following output:     I tried to use itertools and join but couldn't get it to work, can anyone help out?
Just use chain.from_iterable from itertools to combine these:If you require unique values in the lists (which according to the title you don't), you can additionally wrap the result of from_it in a set. 
I would iterate the dict and ignore the irrelevant list.For uniqueness you can cast each inner_list to a set
You can try this:Output:

A solution with sum:Return the sum of a 'start' value (default: 0) plus an iterable of numbersTherefore, using an empty list as start value works.Remove multiplies using without preserving order using set:
