I have a CSV file of sat scores per state. The file has one state's data(state_name, rate, math, verbal) per one row of the CSV. I have created a dictionary with key values of state, rate, math, verbal with the code below:now I to fill the columns with the remaining CSV. The dictionary format for data will be the column names as the key, and the data under each column as the values. I also need to make string numeric columns Rate, Math, and Verbal into floats. I have gotten this far:I cannot figure out how to loop through both the keys of sat dictionary and the items in row simultaneously. Help, please?
You need to keep the order of the header fields:You don't really need to do that yourself though, you can use csv.DictReader to get a dictionary per row, with keys taken from the first line:
