I'm trying to write a function in python that is like:where f is a function that takes one argument and n is a positive integer.For example if I defined square as:and I calledthis would square 3, 2 times.
That should do it:output:or lambda-less?
Using reduce and lamba.Build a tuple starting with your parameter, followed by all functions you want to call:
Something like this?
I think you want function composition:
Here's a recipe using reduce:I call this power, because this is literally what the power function does, with composition replacing multiplication.(f,)*p creates a tuple of length p filled with f in every index. If you wanted to get fancy, you would use a generator to generate such a sequence (see itertools) - but note it would have to be created inside the lambda.  myapply is defined in the parameter list so that it is only created once. 
Using reduce and itertools.repeat (as Marcin suggested):You can use it as follows:(after importing os or defining square respectively)
There is an itertools recipe called repeatfunc that performs this operation.From itertools recipes:I use a third-party library, more_itertools, that conveniently implements these recipes (optional):
