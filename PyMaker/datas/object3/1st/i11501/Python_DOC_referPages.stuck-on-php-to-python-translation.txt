I'm attempting to translate some PHP code to Python and I'm stuck on the 4th line in the following code (included for context):If array() is used to create an array in PHP, what is $table[$char] = array() doing? Creating a new array inside an existing array? Or is it extending the array?What is this accomplishing? What would be the Python equivalent to this?if (!isset($table[$char])) $table[$char] = array();
Seems to me, you should use another data structure than list as table variable. I suppose that dict should be nice for the purpose.I've just made a quick try to mimic your PHP code in Python:Also, I suggest you look into https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdictWith the class the code could be rewritten in the following way:
its called Multidimensional Arrays, an array can hold another array .Take a look at following link http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays_multi.asp
if (!isset($table[$char])) $table[$char] = array();  is setting value of $table[$char] variable as array() if $table[$char] is not set yet$table is empty array, so it has not contain "$char" as key so its checking if $table[$char] is set or not , if not then set its ($table[$char]) value as array().if you put your code like then it gives notice like Notice: Undefined index: $char in
