I am trying to make a list that only displays the odd numbers between 1 and 12, but I have to use the def main function. I have looked all over and have tried everything I could. I'm not sure why, but I've always had trouble using the def main function. Here is where i'm at now with my program.Anyone have any advice or see what I am doing wrong?
You're pretty close. Start by getting rid of your for-loop, because what you want to do is to assign the list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12] to the variable num, not iterate over the individual numbers in the list.Then you'll notice that num[::2] actually gives you the even numbers, so change that to num[1::2]. Lastly, you have to move print (odd) inside the main function, because the variable odd is only defined within that function.The end result should look like this:If you want to keep the loop, you'll have to check each number individually and append it the list of odd numbers if it's odd:
Python implicitly defines the main() function, unlike C++ and some others. The problem in your code is not in the definition of main(). If you read the error message:you may get an idea that something is wrong with types. With the code snippet you've provided, you're iterating over a list of numbers (Python has a function range() specifically for the purpose of generating a sequence of numbers) and with each iteration, the number (type int) is stored in the variable num. And you're trying to use slicing, which is made for iterables. int is not an iterable. You don't need a for loop in your case. This will do the trick:
well you have much to learn, but in this particular case you use the range function to get the numbers, and even make it more general by asking the user for a number with input, like this
