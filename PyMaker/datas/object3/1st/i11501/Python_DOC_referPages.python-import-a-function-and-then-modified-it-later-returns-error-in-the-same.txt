Natural Text
I have two python scripts, one has all functions I have defined (functions.py) and the other only runs those functions (running_functions.py).I imported the functions into running_functions script using from functions import* My problem is when I ran running_functions into python console using execfile('running_functions.py') at first worked like a charm, but if I don't close the python session and do some modifications into one function in functions.py (for example changing the number of parameters that getLabels() takes (from 4 to 5)) saved then and then I ran again running_functions.py with the same comand or when I called getLabels() I get the error: With execfile()Calling the functionTo get it work again I have to close python session and then run again execfile() or rename functions.py or do little pythons scripts with modified function.This is very annoying because all the code takes around 10 or 15 minutes and I don't like have a lot of little scripts. So, how can I avoid this error?I wouldn't like to close every time the session and wouldn't like to use in each function pickle module. Is it wrong the way I imported the functions? And why python returns this error? Sorry for this silly questions
I would recommend skimming over how python imports work.  In general it's considered bad practice to use glob imports like from module import *.  It's not transparent and makes it difficult to take advantage of reload.I would recommend rewriting your code to do the following :and then after you change getLabels or something, you can from the shell run the following :and that will re-import your changes without having to restart the python kernel.
