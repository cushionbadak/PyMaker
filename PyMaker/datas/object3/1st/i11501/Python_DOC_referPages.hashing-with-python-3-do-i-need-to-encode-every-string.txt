I'm migrating from Python 2 to Python 3 and wonder if every string literal needs to be encoded now before you can hash it. Example code will run perfectly under Python 2:using Python 3 however, it throws a TypeError: Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing so I have to append an .encode() after each string or am I missing something here?
The hashlib operates on bytes-like objects only and the documentation explicitly states:Note: Feeding string objects into update() is not supported, as hashes work on bytes, not on characters.So any time you'd like to hash a str object in Python 3, you have to encode it first.
