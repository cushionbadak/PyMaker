Problem: utilizing any word within a string to locate an item within a list and identifying item or return an index.Hello, I have been searching this site and other sites to find a solution for my problem. The solutions that I have found are successful in determining if the list has a item in the string,Example:But this only returns true or false, and with the command,returns an error I need a solution that can locate the list item and either print the item, or give the index within the list. The project I am using this for as an AI that has an ability to preform math equation. For this it needs to be able to locate operators that are not only the standard " +,-,*,/ " but also the word formats. For example, " plus, minus, etc." When located, the program can simply replace items in the string with proper standard operators that eval() can handle.Sample code reapplied from project:Any help or advice on this code would be greatly appreciated.
I'm going to ignore the part about your AI project, as it isn't a MCVE. I think the first part of your question is, though, so I'll show you how to find the item and index where items in a list occur that satisfy the condition you give (word in str1) using numpy.where:This snippet will output:A word of advice: Don't use a capital letter for a variable like List. I kept my answer like this because I wanted you to be able to easily follow my solution. Typically capital letters denote a class name, so capitalizing variables makes your code harder for other Python programmers to read and comprehend. This is just a stylistic norm in the Python community.Hope this helps!
You can use next().  The first argument is an iterator and the second (optional) argument is the default value if the iterator is already exhausted.  The following is a Python session showing different uses of next():
