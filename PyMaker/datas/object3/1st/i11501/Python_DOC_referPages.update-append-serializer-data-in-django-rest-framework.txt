This question already has an answer here:Adding extra data to Django Rest Framework results for entire result set                    3 answers                How can I update/append serializer.data in Django Rest Framework?data = serializer.data.update({"item": "test"}) not workingreturn Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)serializer.data is <class 'rest_framework.utils.serializer_helpers.ReturnDict'>
Unfortunately, serializer.data is a property of the class and therefore immutable. Instead of adding items to serializer.data you can copy serializer.data to another dict.  You can try this:Read more about property
You don't.If you need to pass extra data to the serializer's create/update please do so while calling serializer.save() as explained in the documentation
Alternatively you might use SerializerMethodField to add additional data by adding a custom method to the serializer.http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/#serializermethodfieldYou can use such a method to return any data, wether in context of the model or not.
The serializer.data object is a instance of ReturnList that is immutable. What you can do to workaround this limitation is transform the serializer.data object into a simple Python list(), then append the value you want so you can use your transformed list in Response() method like this:Then, your response will have your new obj
We can update the data passed in response with serializer._datasample codeserializer._data will make the magic.Reference: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/serializers.py#L260
Apart from what @Linovia has suggested, you can also do something like this:Make sure to call this before serializer.is_valid is called.If you want to add data after serializer validation, you should do like this:
