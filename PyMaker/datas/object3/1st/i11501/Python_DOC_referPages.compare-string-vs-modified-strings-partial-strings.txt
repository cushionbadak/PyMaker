I have a list of links, and I want to see if they're listed in my disavow file.My disavow file contains both URLs (e.g. http://getpaydayloan.org/blog/blog-how-to-apply-for-online-payday-loans-san) as well as whole domains, listed as domain:getpaydayloan.org.The new URLs file holds URLs only, e.g. http://getpaydayloan.org/blog/blog-how-to-apply-for-online-payday-loans-sanI want to see if the new URLs are already in the disavow file. I am currently generating a diff using diff = set(url_set)-set(disavow_urls), but I also need to check to see if they are in the disavow file using the domain:url.com format.How would I do something like that?In case it helps, here is the whole script: https://github.com/growth-austen/disavow_automator
Here is a function to check if the url contains any of the disavowed domains. 
Some alternative definitions to David's function for fun:return any(domain in url for domain in disavowDomainList) return any(map(url.__contains__, disavowDomainList))(replace map with itertools.imap in Python 2 for memory efficiency)
