I try this:If I get the value like this:I will get 1,4,9 and this works perfectly.But if I do this: a[0]. The error will be raised.I know it is because the result of map function is map class:which is not subsciptable.So how can I use the index to get the value of the result of map function?NOTE: This behavior is specific to python 3.
Convert the map object into a list object:Then you can use list indices to access the individual elements.
The built-in map() function in python 3 returns an iterator. Once you consume an iterator or it is exhausted, it won't yield you result any more.The result:Now try,It will return you a StopIteration error, as the iterator is already exhausted.To use index you can use list as suggested in the previous answer.
