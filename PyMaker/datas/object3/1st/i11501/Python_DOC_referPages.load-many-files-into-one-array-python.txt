It works, but looks dumb to me (If I have 100 vectors, it will take some time...).  Is there a better way to make this task?

It could be a tuple, or a list:If they happen to have a pattern, you might try generating the names:If they share a common location, you might consider using one of the various directory scanning approaches (opendir or glob, to name two).Once you have a list of filenames, you can read the dictionaries in:With that, you can either get all the data, or get some of the data:If you only care about the data, you could skip the function definition:
