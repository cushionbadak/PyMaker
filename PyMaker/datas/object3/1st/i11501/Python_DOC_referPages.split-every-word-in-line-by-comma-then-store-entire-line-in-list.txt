I was wanting to read in a file which has 4 values on each line:title, author, genre, price.I want to split each value which has a ',' as the delimiter. Then I want to save it to my List each line being an entry in the list. For exampleThis will save asThis is what I have so far:But I'm just getting List index out of range.
Python has you covered here, just use the csv module:Your code makes several classical errors:str.split() returns a list; you are trying to assign that list 4 times to indices of another list. Just use the list returned by str.split() directly.Take into account that lines from a file come with the line-separator (\n) included; you probably want to strip that off first.You started with an empty list. You can't assign to indices that are not there, use list.append() instead to add elements.You don't need to test for len(line) != 0; just if line: is enough because empty strings are considered 'false' in a truth test. See Truth Value Testing.You don't need to use file.readline() each time; just use a for line in f: loop and you'll get each line one by one, because file objects are iterable.If you use your file as a context manager (by using the with statement), Python will close the file for you. So, without the csv module, you could write your code like this:
I think you can use the Python List Comprehensions, to achieve the your function with less code .The program above is equivalent to the following program:
List will have the data like this
