Natural Text
ProblemI need to populate a list from a text file. The list should be a 2 dimensional list. I have been doing a series of activities for my online class, and I can't seem to find and make the right codes for it. Any help would be much appreciated. The text file should look like this: textfile.txtexpected outputmy current code
To fix your existing code, your i.strip() should be replaced by i.split()Demo:Output: A better way of doing this would be:This way the file management is handled for you. 
What about this:Update:As pointed out by zondo, if you are using Python3, you should:since map will return a map object instead of a list.
