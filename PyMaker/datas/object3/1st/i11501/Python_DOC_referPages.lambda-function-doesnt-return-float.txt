I've written the following code for computing the in-center of a triangle. This code is supposed to be for code-golf. Any help would be appreciated.Input:Expected Output:Actual Output:
Python is doing the maths correctly. Either your logic is wrong or your input is wrong or your expected output is wrong. Given your input, the only possible output for d is 0 or 1 (the Cartesian distance between two points). Doing this, we can simply e to see what it might output for the first function call.Given:becomes:becomes:becomes:After that, it's up to you to figure out what's wrong as you haven't specified why the expected output is the expected output.
Are you sure that [1.000000,2.000000] isn't a correct answer? This code:return floating numbers, for example:in: ([1.25325,2.34346], [2.25325,4.34346], [22.25325,22.34346])out: 2.559632791 4.11015248488
