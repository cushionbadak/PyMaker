I am currently trying to implement a lexical scanner that will later become part of a compiler. The program uses Regular expressions to match an input program file. If a series of non white-space characters are matched to a regex, the section of input matched is then converted into a token which, with the rest of the other tokens, will be sent to a parser. I have the code working so that the right tokens are output correctly but I need to make it so the scanner will raise an exception (called by a method no_token()) if a series of non-whitespace characters are found that do not match any of the regular expressions given. This is my first post on here so please if you have any tips on how I can improve my posts please let me know or if you require more information on the question or code please ask.as you can see I tried using but this produces the exception and exits the program at the start of the and no tokens are returned but if I comment this out the code works fine. Obviously I need this section to produce an exception if non white-space characters do not match any regex or it will cause problems at later stages of developmentThe method skip_white_space() consumes all white-spaces up to the next non white-space character,the regular expressions are stored in token_regexp and self.input_string[self.current_char_index:]) gives the current char.for the program as a .txt file:without the call to no_token the output is:which is correct but when I try to implement the no_token() call i get:which is what the no_token() method outputs if there is a series of characters that do not match a regex I have implemented in the scanner but this is not the case for this input. All the character sequences here are valid.
Got it all sorted. Cheerswas the final working code
