Natural Text
So I am having issues with sorting data in the format:Name, Score1, Score2, Score3 stored in a text file.For example:Zac, 0, 0, 0Zac, 0, 0, 0Zac, 0, 0, 0Zac, 0, 0, 0I need to sort it by alphabetical, highest score and average score but I am unsure on how to do this.Could someone help me out or give me some pointers as I'm not sure where to start?Here is the task:Task 3The teacher wants to use the results from students taking these quizzes to log their performance. The system should store the last three scores for each student. The teacher would like to be able to output the results of the quiz for a particular class, sorted:• in alphabetical order with each student’s highest score for the tests• by the highest score, highest to lowest• by the average score, highest to lowest.And my code so far: 
Assuming that your file is named "data.csv" and has the following text:Then we can construct our code:Because your file isn't perfectly formatted csv (there is a space in between the commas), we have to do some extra parsing.  This is the breakdown of what happens at lines=:reader contains each line from your file so we can iterate through itfor l in reader says, for each line in reader, do some actionThe outermost brackets indicate that we want to store the result of these actions in a listThe innermost brackets indicate that for each line in reader, we want to build a list that holds the data from the lineIn order to do math operations, we have to convert the strings to int or float typesi[0] access the first element which is the namei[1] is the second element which is currently a string - ' 0'i[1][1:] says given the second element, take everything from the second element to the end of the string which is '0'float([1][1:]) says given the string '0', convert it to a float typeThen we sort the list.  First, it will sort on the names, then on the max score, then on the average.Sort list by multiple attributes
I would have an object like this:
