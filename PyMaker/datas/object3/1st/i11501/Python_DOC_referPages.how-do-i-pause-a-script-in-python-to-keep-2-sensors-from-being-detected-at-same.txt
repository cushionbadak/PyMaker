I have this function in a python script that detects 2 vibrations sensors, the problem is the sensors are very sensitive so usually when one is hit they are both detected which gives me a false reading. How would I stop them both from being detected at the same time? I want to detect whichever was first. This is what I have tried -
Just a suggestion, I don't have the setup to test it. Save the time of the last event (using datetime), and then check if the last event is more than 5 seconds ago.
