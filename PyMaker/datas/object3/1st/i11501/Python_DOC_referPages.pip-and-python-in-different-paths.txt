I've been having some trouble installing Python packages and then I noticed that pip and Python were in different spots, which could be the problem. How do I align them back up?AndI'd like for everything to use 2.7 and hoping that fixing this will stop me from getting so many errors/notifications when I try to install certain packages like this:
If you want to set up pip for 2.7, just download get-pip.py and run and it will install pip and pip2 for you in the same bin directory as the python executable. You should still be able to install packages for Python 3 using pip3 or pip-3.5.
