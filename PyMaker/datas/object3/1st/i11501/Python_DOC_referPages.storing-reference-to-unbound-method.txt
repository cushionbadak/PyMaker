I was trying to store reference to unbound method and noticed that it is being automatically bound. See example below. Is there more elegant way to store unbound method in the class without binding it?This is not a standard "do you know about @staticmethod?" question.What I'm trying to achieve is provide a way for children of the class provide another handler or certain situations. I do not control the unbound_method itself, it is provided from some library.It can be achieved by wrapping the unbound method some dummy object like array, or in a bound method, just to drop self reference like this:
Not as far as I know. Would it be so bad if you just replacewith?I can't think of a situation in which the first one can't be replaced by the second one.
