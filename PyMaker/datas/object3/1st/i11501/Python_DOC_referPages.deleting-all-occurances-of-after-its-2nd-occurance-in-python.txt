There are lots of ways to do this. You could use re.split() to split on a regular expression, for instance. re is part of the standard library, documented here.https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.splitThe regex itself uses \b which means a boundy between a "word" character and a "non-word" character. You can use regex101 to explore how it works. https://regex101.com/r/mY8fV8/1
Use the urlparse to correctly parse a URL:At the end of the day, the information you want are in the parts.scheme, parts.netloc and paths variables.
You may do this :First split by '/'Then join by '/' only before the 3rd occuranceCode:Output:
Inspired in Hai Vu's answer. This solution is for Python 3
