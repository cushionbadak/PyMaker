Above is some code that I have used to create a column for a CSV file. I keep getting the following errorHow do I fix this? Thanks in advance. 
The newline argument should be included within the open function, not the csv reader and writer functions.See here for examples.
To avoid this error , open the file in 'wb' mode instead of 'w' mode.This will eliminate the need for newline = "",Look below the the corrected code.
