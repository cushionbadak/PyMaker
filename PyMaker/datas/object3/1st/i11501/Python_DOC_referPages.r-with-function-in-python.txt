In R, I can use with(obj, a + b + c + d) instead of obj$a + obj$b + obj$c + obj$d, where obj can be a list or data.frame.Is there any similar function for dict, pandas.Series, pandas.DataFrame in python?
In a way, no. But there are lots of somewhat similar alternatives. The with function of R seems quite versatile, so in Python one has to replace it case by case.You could use itemgetter() for simple collections:Or attrgetter() for, again simple, objects:Pandas' DataFrames support directly accessing specific columns and applying operations on them. Summing is an easy example, as it has a function as is:There's also DataFrame.eval, which is closest to what you're after, I think:Evaluate an expression in the context of the calling DataFrame instance.
Not really.  R and Python have pretty different philosophies when it comes to this kind of thing--in R it's possible to write a function which parses the entire syntax of its arguments before they are evaluated, whereas in Python it's not.  So in Python, this is impossible:However, this works:If you wanted to apply other chained operations, you could implement support for something like this:Then you can do this:
