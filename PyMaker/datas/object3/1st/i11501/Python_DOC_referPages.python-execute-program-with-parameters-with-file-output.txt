I am trying to use Python to run an executable (Windows 7) with parameters. I have been able to make the program run, but the amount of parameters I can use that will prove the Python script worked with parameters is limited. The best one is formatted like so:-debugoutput debug.txtI have tested this using a windows shortcut with an edited target and it works, it creates a debug output in the program directory.Here is the code I am using:This does run the program, but the debug output is not created. I have tried putting an "r" in front of the parameter but this made no difference. I assume it is a simple formatting error but I can't find any examples to learn from that are doing the same thing.UPDATE:Thanks for the answers everyone, all the same, simple formatting error indeed.
In-code definition results in invocation of shell command line:As you can see, by merging -debugoutput debug.txt to single list element, you explicitly stated that space between them shouldn't be parsed as command line argument separator.To achieve expected behavior put file name string as separate element to argument list.
As far as I know you need to split the arguments by the space, so your args would look like:Does that work?
I do not know if it works, but Following the docs
