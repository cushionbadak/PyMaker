Natural Text
I am trying to add an invisible character (CAN - ASCII Code 24) to a str, but it only adds the ASCII code of that character (obviously because I am using str(24)).Is there some way to add the character 24 to a string object?
Use chr to get the character corresponding to an ASCII ordinal value.
