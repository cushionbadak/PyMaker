These variables are causing a syntax error:I want the program to continue running but it gets stuck on "1point"
Python variable names can only start with an underscore or letter, not a digit. Digits can be used anywhere else in a name, just not at the start.See the Identifiers and keywords section:Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F), the valid characters for identifiers are the same as in Python 2.x: the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z, the underscore _ and, except for the first character, the digits 0 through 9.Bold emphasis mine. Python 3 supports Unicode variable names so characters outside the ASCII range can be used. See the above link for the full details.
