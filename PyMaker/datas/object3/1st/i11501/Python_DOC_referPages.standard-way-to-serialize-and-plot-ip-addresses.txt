I am trying to find a way to convert IP addresses to integers or real values so they can be mathematically grouped and plotted in a meaningful way. Ideally IPs with the same leftmost octet would be similar, IPs sharing the leftmost two octets would be more similar, and so on. Is there a standard, accepted way to do this? Codified in, say, a Python library? Or am I just going to have to cook up my own algorithm?Thanks.
You mean, like... the ipaddress module?IP addresses with the same leftmost octet will be close, because if you convert an address to int, it just refers to the actual number an IP address represents (10.9.8.7 â‰™ 10*256^3 + 9*256^2 + 8*256^1 + 7*256^0).It also works for IPv6:
