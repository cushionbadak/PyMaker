This question already has an answer here:Don't parse options after the last positional argument                    3 answers                I have a Python script that wraps the openssh client binary, and needs to parse arguments in the same way. I'm using argparse.With ssh, this means conect to host, login as "a", and run "ls".While this means connect to host and run "ls -la":argparse treats these as the same. Is there an idiomatic way to tell argparse that optional arguments must precede positional arguments?
Use nargs=argparse.REMAINDER:Result:
I think what you trying to accomplish fits pretty well in argparse sub-commands concept. Take a look at it: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commands
