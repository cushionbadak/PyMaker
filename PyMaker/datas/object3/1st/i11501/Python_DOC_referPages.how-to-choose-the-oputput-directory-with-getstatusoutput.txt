i am a beginner in programming.I have to run a program in python and save the output in a concrete folder, but all the output is saved in my home, could anyone tell me how to choose the directory?i used this command: commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)thanks in advance
I'm assuming you want to know how to choose WHERE you can write a file to. Let's say you have the output you want already saved in a variable:Typically, you should write the output to a place that your program has write-access to. Because you have full write-access to your home directory, that's probably why it is currently pointing there. You can also use a temp directory like /tmp/ on most *nix based systems. Simply create a variable to that file like this:Then write code that saves to it. One quick way is you use a with context manager:Another method is to use logging.See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html for more info.
