Note: Goal of the function is to remove duplicate(repeated) characters.Now for the same given recursive function, different output pops out for different argument:This functions works well for the argument only if the duplicate character is within the starting first six characters of the string, for example:if r=abcdeeeeeeefghijk or if r=abcdeffffffghijkbut if the duplicate character is after the first six character then the output is same as the input,i.e, output=input. That means with the given below value of "r", the function doesn't work:if r=abcdefggggggggghijkde (repeating characters are after the first six characters)
The reason you function don't work properly is you first if x[0]==x[-1], there you check the first and last character of the substring of the moment, but that leave pass many possibility like affffffa or asdkkkkkk for instance, let see why:example 1: 'affffffa'here is obvious right?example 2: 'asdkkkkkk'here we go for case 3 of your function, and then againand when we are in 'kkkkkk' it stop because the first and last are the sameexample 3: 'asdfhhhhf'here is the same as example 2, in the recursion chain we arrive to fhhhhf and here the first and last are the same so it leave untouched How to fix it?, simple, as other have show already, check for the length of the string firsthere is alternative and iterative way of doing the same: you can use the unique_justseen recipe from itertools recipestestand if you don't want to import anything, here is another way
The only issue I found with you code was the first if statement. I assumed you used it to make sure that the string was at least 2 long. It can be done using string modifier len() in fact the whole function can but we will leave it recursive for OP sake. I would however recommend not making the function recursive and instead mutating the original string as follows
Your function is correct but, if you want to check the last letter, the function must be:
