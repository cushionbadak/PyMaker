I am trying to understand how long it takes for a function to run using time.timer, but im really stumped on how to implement it I thought this would work:but then I realized its timing the wrong thing.I need it to check the runtime of breadth_first_tree_search can some one tell me how to do thi I keep getting the feeling that it isnt that hard but I cant figure out how.
You could use a decorator to start the timer, run the real function and evaluate the timer after it finished automatically:
You have a lot of readily available options for timing your functions -- there's no need to reinvent the wheel here.Using ipython : %timeit breadth_first_tree_search(problem)Using Profile: https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.htmlIf you really want to use timeit.Timer, follow the example in the docs.
