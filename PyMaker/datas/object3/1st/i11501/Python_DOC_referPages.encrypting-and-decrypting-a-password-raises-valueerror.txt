I am making a program that is supposed to encrypt the password you pass in. However, whenever I run it, it raises an error:ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Banana' (the word I chose for this test)Here's my code:
In Python 3.x, input will return a string. You can read about it in the PyDocs. When you gave Python the input Banana, it is confused. You can't convert Banana to a float type. If you are looking at converting the string into a set of indexes for your program, you can try this (note the 3 new functions I added and implemented into your code):Of course, this is a weak encryption, if you want better encryption (the stuff used by professionals), take a look at pycrypto.
