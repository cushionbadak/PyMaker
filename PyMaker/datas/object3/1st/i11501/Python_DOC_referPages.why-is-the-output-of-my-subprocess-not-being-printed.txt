Here is my best attempt at asynchronously reading stdin/stdout from a subprocess and printing it from Python:Why is the print function not outputting anything?
Your watch process never terminates and communicate() waits for the process to terminate, therefore stdout never arrives in your script.https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.htmlcoroutine communicate(input=None) Interact with process: Send data to  stdin. Read data from stdout and stderr, until end-of-file is reached.  Wait for process to terminate.Try the following code which was inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/24435988/2776376.It uses pipe_data_received and then len > 16 is simply to prevent printing empty lines.SubprocessProtocol.pipe_data_received(fd, data)Called when the child process writes data into its stdout or stderr pipe. fd is the integer file descriptor of the pipe. data is a non-empty bytes object containing the data.
