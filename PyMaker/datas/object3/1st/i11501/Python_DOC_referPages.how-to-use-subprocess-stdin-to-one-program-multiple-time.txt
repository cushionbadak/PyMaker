I want to make python file which opens two programs. This two programs have to get input from each other multiple times. I opened two programs and know how to give input to one program, but i don't know how to give input multiple time on one program and get output multiple time. My code is like this.Now this program just get program output. I want to give input N times for each program and get output N times. So I expect my code to be like this.
Try using write and communicate to send data to cmd_1 and cmd_2 and get the response, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor.
To exchange messages via pipes dynamically (not tested):It assumes that the child processes expect a line as a request and return a single character as a response.To make it work:p1, p2 should disable their internal stdout buffering (callsetvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0); at the start of the program) or call fflush() after each printf(). Related: Python C program subprocess hangs at “for line in iter”Put the directory with p1, p2 into $PATH or pass a full path instead 'p1' into Popen().
