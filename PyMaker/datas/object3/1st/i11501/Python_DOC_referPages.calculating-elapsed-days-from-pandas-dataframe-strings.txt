Natural Text
I have a Pandas dataframe that stores travel dates of people. I'd like to add a column that shows the length of the stay. To do this the string needs to be parsed, converted to a datetime and subtracted. Pandas seems to be treating the datetime conversion as a whole series and not individual strings  as a I get TypeError: must be string, not Series. I like to do this with a non-looping option as the actual dataset is quite large, but need a bit of help.Desired Output:
Use Series.str.extract to split the Day of Visit column into two separate columns.Then use pd.to_datetime to parse the columns as dates.Computing the Length of Stay can then be done by subtracting the date columns and adding 1:yieldsThe regex pattern ([^-]+)-(.*) means.str.extract returns a DataFrame with the matching text from groups #1 and #2 in columns.
