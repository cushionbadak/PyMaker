in Python, it seems I can do any one of the following 3 variable assignments:followed byand the output is alwaysSo, what's the difference between these 3 types of variable assignments?
First one is three-element tuple.Second one is some string.Third one is same three-element tuple, since in this context parentheses are redundant.Small code snippet will be enough to prove it:To sum up, string representation of object and object properties are two different concepts. There may be multiple objects with same string representation but different behavior.
Case #1 and #3 both result in a tuple, created via an expression_list; which can be enclosed [in parenthesis], as in your Case #1, or unenclosed, as in your Case #3. Some operations in Python allow either syntax (such as defining a new tuple, or a for...in loop), some require enclosed expression_list (such as if statements); in any case, the result is a tuple object.Case #2 is clearly a string in any language, Python included. :)
