I am practicing using type hints in Python 3.5. One of my colleague uses typing.Dict:Both of them work just fine, there doesn't appear to be a difference. I have read the typing module documentation.Between typing.Dict or dict which one should I use in the program?
There is no real difference between using a plain typing.Dict and dict, no.However, typing.Dict is a Generic type that lets you specify the type of the keys and values too, making it more flexible:As such, it could well be that at some point in your project lifetime you want to define the dictionary argument a little more precisely, at which point expanding typing.Dict to typing.Dict[key_type, value_type] is a 'smaller' change than replacing dict.You can make this even more generic by using Mapping or MutableMapping types here; since your function doesn't need to alter the mapping, I'd stick with Mapping. A dict is one mapping, but you could create other objects that also satisfy the mapping interface, and your function might well still work with those:Now you are clearly telling other users of this function that your code won't actually alter the new_bandwidths mapping passed in.Your actual implementation is merely expecting an object that is printable. That may be a test implementation, but as it stands your code would continue to work if you used new_bandwidths: typing.Any, because any object in Python is printable.
typing.Dict is a generic version of dict:class typing.Dict(dict, MutableMapping[KT, VT])A generic version of dict. The usage of this type is as follows:Here you can specify the type of key and values in the dict: Dict[str, int]
