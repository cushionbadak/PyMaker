The following seems to work either way. What is the advantage (other than the nice repr) of using types.SimpleNamespace? Or is it the same thing?
This is explained pretty well in the types module description. It shows you that types.SimpleNamespace is roughly equivalent to this:This provides the following advantages over an empty class:It allows you to initialize attributes while constructing the object: sn = SimpleNamespace(a=1, b=2)It provides a readable repr(): eval(repr(sn)) == snIt overrides the default comparison. Instead of comparing by id(), it compares attribute values instead.
