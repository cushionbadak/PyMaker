Natural Text
I have a lot of files in a directory with name like:'data_2000151_avg.txt', 'data_2000251_avg.txt', 'data_2003051_avg.txt'...Assume that one of them is called fname. I would like to extract a subset from each like so:This will give as a result, 2000. I want to collect these from all the files in the directory and create a unique list. How do I do that?
You should use os.EDIT: Just saw your comment on wanting a set. After the for loop add this line.
If unique list means a list of unique values, then a combination of glob (in case the folder contains files that do not match the desired name format) and set should do the trick:This assumes the files reside in the current working directory. Append path as necessary to glob('path/to/data_*_avg.txt').
For listing files in directory you can use os.listdir(). For generating the list of unique values best suitable is set comprehension.
