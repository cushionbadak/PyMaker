Natural Text
When I use assertEqual() with two dictionaries in REPL, it shows me a diff, e.g.:When I do the same in a Django unit test, sometimes it prints a diff and sometimes only the first shortened line. I wonder, how can I make it always print the diff.I run Django tests with ./manage.py test -v 3.
If you set maxDiff to None, then the full diff will be shown.
