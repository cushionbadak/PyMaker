This does not work:But this does:Why?
Because return is a statement. Lambdas can only contain expressions.
lambda functions automatically return an expression. They cannot contain statements. return None is a statement and therefore cannot work. None is an expression and therefore works.
because lambda takes a number of parameters and an expression combining these parameters, and creates a small function that returns the value of the expression.see: https://docs.python.org/2/howto/functional.html?highlight=lambda#small-functions-and-the-lambda-expression
Lambda can execute only statements and return result of the executed statement, result is the expression.Consider using or and and operators to get more flexability in the values which will be returned by your lambda. See some samples below:
