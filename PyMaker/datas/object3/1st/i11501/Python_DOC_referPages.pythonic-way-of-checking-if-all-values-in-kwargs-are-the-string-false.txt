Take kwargs i.e: send_members, send_companies, send_reviewers, each of which contains the string 'true' or 'false'.If all the values in every kwargs are 'false', I want to display an error message e.g:Is there a Pythonic way of checking if all the values in kwargs are the same, 'false'? While the above example works, it gets very messy when I have 10 kwargs.
Use all()
Interestingly using all() seems about 10x slower. 
You could [also] use the built-in any() function which might be a little faster than all() because it will stop checking as soon as a failure is detected.
