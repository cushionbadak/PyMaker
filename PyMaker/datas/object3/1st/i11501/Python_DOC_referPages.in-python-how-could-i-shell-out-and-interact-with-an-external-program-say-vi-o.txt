I guess bash seems like a more natural way to do this, but I was hoping to get it done in Python.
use the integrated subprocess module. It works quite well with interactive applications. subprocess.call starts an application and is blocking until the application exits.e.g. starting vi and after exit it starts a connection to 127.0.0.1 over ssh:
You can use the subprocess module.An example could look like this:You can find more here: subprocess
