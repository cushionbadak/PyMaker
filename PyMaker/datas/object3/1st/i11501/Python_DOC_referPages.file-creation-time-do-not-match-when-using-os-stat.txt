I need to access the date of creation of a file using Python.As suggested in many posts, I am using os.stat(filename) to get such information.However, the result I get is different from the one I expect.Here an example:The result is :Which is incorrect, if I look for it using "Get Info" (in OSX), I get:Does anyone experience the same error?Do you have any solution to suggest?

On other Unix systems (such as FreeBSD), the following attributes may be available (but may be only filled out if root tries to use them):st_birthtime - time of file creation
