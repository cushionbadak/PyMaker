So, I need to figure out a program that when you input 2 different strings of the same length it will return NOT print the number of differences between the two strings. The order of the characters matters as well. For example if you input ("abcdef", "aabccf")it should return 4. ("abcdef", "accddf") should return 2.All I have so far is: def differencecount ( A, B):    counter = 0    str1 = list (A)    str2 = list (B)    for letter in str1:        if letter == str2:            counter = counter + 1    return counterAll this does is return 0 though so I feel like I'm missing something.
I would useWhich works like
You can zip the strings together and then count how many different pairs there are:Explanation:Zipping the strings together produces this:so it takes a character from the same position in each string and pairs them together. So you just need to count how many pairs are different. That can be done using a list comprehension to create a list with those pairs that are the same filtered out, and then get the length of that list.
Just for a different look here is a solution that doesn't use zip or enumerate:Note that this solution also raises an exception when x and y are of different lengths, which is what you wanted in your comment.
