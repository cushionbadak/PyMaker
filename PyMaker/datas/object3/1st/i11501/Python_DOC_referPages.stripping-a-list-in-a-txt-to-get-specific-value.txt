Natural Text
I would like to sort the file 'Class1Scores' from highest to lowest. I have used a .txt to save the contents in the following way. When sorted the output should be :Here is the code I have used to develop the task:I am kind of still confused on how to order this in the same way as the .txt file above?The code works but outputs the data like this:
I would recommend storing the data in a dict with user as key, their scores as values and to  json the data to file but to sort your data in current format you can use ast.literal_eval to get the data back into lists, sort using the max score as the key and specifying reverse=True to sort from highest to lowest:Which will give you:If you want the names sorted alphabetically for a tie you need to change the logic slightly specifying -max and the name as the value to use in a tie removing reverse=True in this case:You should be able to figure the rest out.
