I have a list of strings in python and if an element of the list contains the word "parthipan" I should print a message. But the below script is not workingThe first element of the list contains the word "parthipan", so it should print the message.
Why not: Also what for is this part: EDIT:Im just too blind to see what for do You need regex here. It would be best if You would give some real input and output. This is small example which could be done in that way too:But if regex part is really needed I cant imagine how to find '(?mis)Parthipan' in 'Parthipan'. Most simple would be in reverse direction 'Parthipan' in '(?mis)Parthipan'. Like here...EDIT:Yhm, with regex You have few possibilities...output, only first one seems ok, so only re.search gives proper solution:
If you want to do this with a regexp, you can't use the in operator. Use re.search() instead. But it works with strings, not a whole list.Or in more functional style:
You don't need regex for this simply use any.
