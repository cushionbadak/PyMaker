Natural Text
I need help rearranging this list alphabeticallyinto "hello world" by indexing into the array. How exactly do I do that? I'm a beginner and I'm doing this in python 2.7.
As has been mentioned, your list can be sorted alphabetically by using the sort() function as follows:Which results in your list looking like:But you go on to say 'index into' for 'hello world'. If you mean you want to create a simple cypher then this could be easily be achieved as follows:This would convert your text as follows:Please could you edit your question to give an example of what you are trying to achieve.
Since there is a empty element in the list. You can try to avoid them by using sorted method of listsorted does create new copy of actual list and sort them. So you can refer the output of the sorted to new variable. LikePS: do not use list as a variable name because it brings conflict between actual list and your list variable
