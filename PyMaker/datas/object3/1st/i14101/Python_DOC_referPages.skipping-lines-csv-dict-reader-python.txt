I have a file that has an obnoxious preface to the header. So it looks like this:I want to  skip past everything and use the tab sep header names for my code. This is what I have so far:This code gets this error:I tried to print the rows, to see where I was in the file, and I changed the "range(14)" to range 5, but when I print the row, I get this:So I am not really sure the right way to skip those top lines. Any help would be appreciated. 
A csv.DictReader reads the first line from the file when it's instantiated, to get the headers for subsequent rows. Therefore it uses Review performed by: as the header row, then you skip the next 14 rows.Instead, skip the rows before creating the DictReader:
You could wrap the CSVFile with an itertools.islice iterator object to slice-off the lines of the preface when creating the DictReader, instead of the providing it directly to the constructor. This works because the csv.reader constructor will accept any "object which supports the iterator protocol and returns a string each time its next() method is called" according to the csv docs. This also applies to csv.DictReaders because they use an underlying reader instance internally.
