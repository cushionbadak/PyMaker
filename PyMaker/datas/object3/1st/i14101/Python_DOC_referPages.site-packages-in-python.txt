When I type in the following code :the following result comes up - What do the two different paths indicate ? On windows, there is just one folder for the site-packages. Why are they different in linux ?
The site packages directories are the directories to which Python installs third party extensions, and in which it looks for packages and modules whenever you import something.On Linux, the /usr directory contains files that come with the system distribution, and the /usr/local directory contains files installed by the system administrator. So, if you install the distribution version of a third party extension, you're going to find it in the /usr sites-packages directory:And if you install the third party extension yourself, you're going to find it in the /usr/local site-packages directory:Windows doesn't make this distinction, so it only has one site packages directory.
