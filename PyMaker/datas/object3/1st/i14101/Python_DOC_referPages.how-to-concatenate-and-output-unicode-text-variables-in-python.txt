My title terms might not be correct and may be a reason why I can't find this simple thing from websites.I have a list of string variables. How do I actually concatenate them and output a real unicode sentence in Python?I will get only strings like '\u280F' but not real character. But if I do:correct symbols shows up, which is: ‚†èAnd I'm sure there is a more elegant way to get a range of the symbols from u2800 to u283F...
Conver the strings to integers (using int with base 16), the use unichr (chr if you're using Python 3.x) to convert the number into unicode object.
If you are stuck with unicodes input; you could use unicode-escape codecs, to get Unicode (b'\\u2800'.decode('unicode-escape') == u'\u2800'):Otherwise, generate range of integers directly:It produces the same output in this case.
