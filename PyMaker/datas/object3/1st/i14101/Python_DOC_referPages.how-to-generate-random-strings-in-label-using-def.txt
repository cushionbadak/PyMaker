Natural Text
This isn't working, how would I make it so that the label's text randomly generates one of the options?
Two issues: wrong argument given to choice, and a misplaced opening parenthesis.This should work:
random.choice(seq)If simply a string is passed as seq, it will be treated as sequence of characters, and the function random.choice() will return any random character as output.To get a complete word from a set of word, either make a list, tuple, etc. of them and then send it as seq to the random.choice() as parameter. It will return an element from a list, tuple (whatever data-type is passed).orIf you have all the words in form of a string, then you can directly use split() function to send them as a list, instead of converting them to another data-type.Source:  Comment of @PadraicCunningham, and python documentation
