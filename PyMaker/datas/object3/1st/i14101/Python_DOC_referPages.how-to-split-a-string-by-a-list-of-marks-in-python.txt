Suppose we have a sentence like: "ABCDEFG", and a list of marks like: [0,0,1,0,0,0,1]. What I intends to do is split the source string into segments by using the list of marks: if a character has index i in the source string, and by using this index we could get 1 in the list of marks, then this character is the end of a word.So the source string could be split into ['ABC', 'DEFG']How to achieve this in Python? I mean, not the simple way like using a temporary buffer.
A simple approach would be:
.index is probably the fastest way to find the 1s. Also allows you to slice the source string directly
We can use simple for loop to acheive this -
A simple answer:
Another variation on a theme.
