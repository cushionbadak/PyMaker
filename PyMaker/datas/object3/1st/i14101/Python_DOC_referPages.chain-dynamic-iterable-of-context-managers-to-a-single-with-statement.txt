I have a bunch of context managers that I want to chain. On the first glance, contextlib.nested looked like a fitting solution. However, this method is flagged as deprecated in the documentation which also states that the latest with statement allows this directly:Deprecated since version 2.7: The with-statement now supports this  functionality directly (without the confusing error prone quirks).However I could not get Python 3.4.3 to use a dynamic iterable of context managers:whether chaining:providing the list directly:or unpacking:So, how do I properly chain a dynamic amount of context managers in a with statement correctly?
You misunderstood that line. The with statement takes more than one context manager, separated by commas, but not an iterable:works.Use a contextlib.ExitStack() object if you need to support a dynamic set of context managers:
The "multiple manager form of the with statement", as shown in the statement's documentation, would be:i.e. it doesn't support a dynamic number of managers. As the documentation for contextlib.nested notes:Developers that need to support nesting of a variable number of  context managers can either use the warnings module to suppress the  DeprecationWarning raised by this function or else use this function  as a model for an application specific implementation.
