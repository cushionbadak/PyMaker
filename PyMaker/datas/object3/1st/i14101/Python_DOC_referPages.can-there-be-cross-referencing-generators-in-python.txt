This question already has an answer here:Nested For Loops Using List Comprehension                    3 answers                Imagine the following piece of code which generates a list of file sizes from the current directories' files:I wonder whether I can create a nested generator from this - s.th. like:This is syntactically incorrect of course since [_base, _dirs, _files in os.walk('.')] is not correct generator syntax. What I need now is a way to iterate through a sub-element from a list (_files) while referencing another one (_base) (what I called cross-referencing in the title).I now wonder if I just can't see the obvious or if this is approach is not valid in general.
You can do it like this:If you want generator, use generator expression (replacing [] with ()):See list comprehension in Python tutorial.
You can use following structure :And note that you don't need to put the first loop within [] since you can use nested for loops within a list comprehension.
