This question already has an answer here:Getting IP address from HTTP POST request using Python                    2 answers                I've a web server setup in a separate location and I wanted to access it remotely using HTTP POST request. Can someone please guide me how to proceed with it. I need to use Python which runs the HTTP Post request and modifies the contents of the WEB page
Although probably not particularly practical, you could use a socket. A script on the server which receives the POST request would have to modify the desired web pages content upon receipt. 
I think the basic idea is to create a connection, build some headers and data, then go ahead and send that request, get the response from the connection, and then you can then read the response.Please see: Python URLLib / URLLib2 POST
