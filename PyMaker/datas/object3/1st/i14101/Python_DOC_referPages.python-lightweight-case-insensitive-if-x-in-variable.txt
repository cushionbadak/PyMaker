I am looking for a method analogous to if "x" in variable: that is case insensitive and light-weight to implement.I have tried some of the implementations here but they don't really fit well for my usage: Case insensitive 'in' - PythonWhat I would like to make the below code case insensitive:Preferably without having to convert the string to e.g. lowercase. Or if I have to convert it, I would like to keep description in its original state â€“ even if it is mixed uppercase and lowercase.For my usage, it is good that this method is non-discriminating by identifying "Short" in "Shorter" or "Shortest".
Just do The .lower() method does not change the object, it returns a new one, which is changed. If you are worried about performance, don't be, unless your are doing it on huge strings, or thousands of times per second.If you are going to do that more than once, or just want more clarity, create a function, like this:
An alternative way without calling .lower() on both strings would be to use a case-insensitive regular expression match:On long strings, it might be a little quicker:However for a vast majority of cases, "Short".lower() in description.lower() will be more than fast enough, and is the clearest way to write it
