I am getting ImportError for from functools import permutations, but it was working before. I am on windows 7 and the only major change I see is installing Anaconda now. I had python 2.7.10 when it was working, and anaconda 2.7.9...I tried uninstalling the regular python and running python in the Anaconda prompt, and still the same error. How can I fix this and still keep Anaconda? Thank you 
I'm not seeing permutations in the documentation for functools:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.htmlI am, however, seeing it in itertools, perhaps you misspelt?https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html
