I have a few IP addresses and I need to 'bind' a request to one or another one of them dynamically. I am using python requests library to make http requests (GET or POST). Is it possible to bind my requests to needed IP?PS:I asked because it is possible in .net C# to bind socket to needed output IP (IPEndPoint) so I thought it may be possible in python requests too.
What you are looking for is the socket library. Here is an example to get you started.Take a look at https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html, and toward the bottom you will see some examples for how to use the library. Version 3 documentation is here - https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html.
