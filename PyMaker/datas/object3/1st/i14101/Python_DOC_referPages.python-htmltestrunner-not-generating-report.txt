I am having an problem in generating html report with HTMLTestRunner. I have created a test suite in a file called TestsSuite.py. Here's the code excerpt:When I run this piece of code, it runs to completion with all test cases displayed as pass in PyUnit but when I open Report.html, the file is displayed blank.What is it that I am doing wrong?
Hi I have Modified the Code inside HTMLTestRunner.py file to work with Python 3.x and followed the normal process to import the module as usualHope it might help
firstly, I don't think HTMLTestRunner works with Python 3.x... so you are out of luck.  But let's assume you are trying in Python 2.7...You have a slew of problems.  You should really read the docs for unittest and HTMLTestRunner.However, Consider this example, which achieves similar in python 2:
HTMLTestRunner doesn't seem to be actively supported anymore.  I did see a post on Github where when HTMLTestRunner creator tungwaiyip mentions that he doesn't have time to support HTMLTestRunner and he asks if others would continue with it's development. In that conversation two individuals mention changes they made to the file to get it to work for them.  The post is at:https://github.com/tungwaiyip/HTMLTestRunner/issues/1I made that changes detailed in locus2k's comment on Sep 28 and that helped me, although some of his line numbers are off.  I also had to make some edits to the file myself to get things working for me such as:line 642 used has_key which needed to be changed to 'if not cls inrmap:'line 687 encoded a string which errors on stream.write().  Changed tonot encode the string.
