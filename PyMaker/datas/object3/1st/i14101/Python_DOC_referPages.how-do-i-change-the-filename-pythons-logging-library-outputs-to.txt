I am using a TimedRotatingFileHandler for my Python project for logging. However, when it's time for a rollover, it changes my base file name from baseName.log to baseName.log.(TimeStamp), what can I do so it instead looks like baseName.(TimeStamp).log.That way who ever is using it doesn't have to configure what program to use each time it try to open it.
Unfortunately, this feature is not present in logging. However, you can very easily use the message formatting of this library to output a time stamp of each message logged in your file. Afterwards, a very simple python script could allow you to break down the files into two for all timestamps greater to whatever you want.
