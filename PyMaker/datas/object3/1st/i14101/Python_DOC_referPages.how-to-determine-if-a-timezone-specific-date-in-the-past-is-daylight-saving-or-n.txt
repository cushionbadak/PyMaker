Is there a way I can check if a specific timezone is in daylight saving in a date I specified?
Just call the datetime.dst() method:Example:It is equivalent to:
In my experience, timezone data is more easily dealt with timezone-sensitive pandas.Timestamp() than datetime. I am pretty sure the timezone-sensitivity infers daylight savings time from the date itself. It is trivial to convert datetime to pandas.timestamp() by first converting it to a numpy.datetime64. http://wesmckinney.com/blog/easy-high-performance-time-zone-handling-in-pandas-0-8-0/python pandas TimeStamps to local time string with daylight savingConverting between datetime, Timestamp and datetime64Also you can try looking at the pandas source code and figuring out how it deduced the tz information.https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/src/datetime/np_datetime.c
