With an IPv4 address range like 169.254.0.0/16 or 192.168.0.0/16, it is straightforward to construct a regex for each, since once you exactly match the first 6 digits, you're done.But what about matching any address in a looser reserved range such asA regex beginning with 100\. won't suffice, because there will be numbers outside of the 100.64 and 100.127 bounds (e.g. 100.65.0.0, 100.127.255.256) that will be erroneously matched. How best to capture a range such as this without having to explicitly define each and every valid subrange within each range? The language is Python.For reference, a full list of reserved IP addresses and ranges can be found here. 
Use of an IPv4 parsing library is preferred. If you insist in using regular expression,re.search('^(100\.(6[4-9]|[7-9]\d|1[0-1]\d|12[0-7])(\.(\d|[1-9]\d|1\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5])){2})$', text)You can see that I am searching separately for:64-69 (6[4-9])70-99 ([7-9]\d)100-119 (1[0-1]\d)120-127 (12[0-7])and0-9 (\d)10-99 ([1-9]\d)100-199 (1\d\d)200-249 (2[0-4]\d)250-255 (25[0-5])
This is one way to do it:Output:
