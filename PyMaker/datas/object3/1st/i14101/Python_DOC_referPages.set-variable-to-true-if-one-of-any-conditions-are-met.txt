I am checking for a long list of conditions, where each one looks something like this:If any one of these are met, I want to set match = True.Otherwise keep it at match = False.I don't want to include match = True in each if statement because that would clutter up the code.Is there a way to simply group all of these together, and if any condition is fulfilled, set match = True?
Initialize match with true and change it to false in else statementSince in some case your all cases can be true so change the sequence of if statement to convert it to elif with still the same logic
Here is the simple hack for your problem list the tuples with conditions and check that weather True is in or not and do accordingly ex :a = 1,2,3,4conditions = (1 in a,5 in a,3 in a.....)//here the coditions holds series                                          of  True or False values                                           then check match = true if True in conditions
