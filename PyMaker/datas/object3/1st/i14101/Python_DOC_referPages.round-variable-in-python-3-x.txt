I have an application that  generates these values:How can I round the number -1.00929366e-16 to 0? what I want is if there is an x number of zeros from the right point, it substituted that value with zero.
The simplest solution is just using the built in mathematical functionWhich will return the integer component of the float if the 10ths decimal place is less than 5 and will return one more than that if the 10ths decimal place is greater than or equal to 5.This should be all that you require instead of counting zeros.*Note: Since you appear to have a list of values, use to apply the rounding to each of the values.**Note if you are going to be applying any mathematical operations to these numbers which require any measurement of variance, I would recommend that you do not round them as you usually want to avoid having an output of 0 from calculating, say, the standard deviation if you're going to be using it in a later function (This has caused me many headaches and required me to actually include minor variation in my floats to avoid errors in later calculations).For more information see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round (Recommended by Deja Vu)
Correct me if I'm wrong: you don't just want to round the value. You want to do so only if "there is a number of zeroes from the right point". Let's say this number is 5. You don't want to round 0.001, but you want to round 0.000001 to 0. And 1.000001 to 1. Well, you can do so by checking the distance between your number and the nearest integer, like this:Which yields:
