You can use Python's inspect module to get the desired code as a list of strings:The output is as follows:As you can see inspect.getsourcelines() returns a tuple of a list and an integer. The list contains all the lines of the function passed to inspect.getsourcelines() and the integer represents the line number in which the provided functions starts.
