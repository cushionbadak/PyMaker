This question already has an answer here:Reading specific lines only                    25 answers                How do I access specific lines (ie #10-#20) in a text file? I tried for iteration in range(10,20): but it doesn't work.
You can do this with itertools.islice.Whether you should use 10 or 10-1 for the first argument to islice() depends on whether you consider the first line of a file line 0, or line 1. Also note that the strings in lines will each end with a newline character.
I think this is what you wantrequired_lines will now contain lines from line#10 to line#20
