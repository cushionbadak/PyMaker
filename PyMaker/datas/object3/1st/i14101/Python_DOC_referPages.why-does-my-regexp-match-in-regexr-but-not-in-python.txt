This question already has an answer here:What is the difference between re.search and re.match?                    8 answers                Prefix is None, but I expected it to be "O1533".When I use the web based tool http://regexr.com/ it works.http://regexr.com/3bag5I tried to escape the \ with different numbers of \s, and I also tried delimiting /s. Could not get it to work.Can some RegExp expert please fix my expression?
Because you should replace match with search. match tries to match the string from the beginning, and \"O1533_FOO\" INTEGER NOT NULL , doesn't begin with something that matches [A-Z], hence it fails.See search() vs. match():Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).
