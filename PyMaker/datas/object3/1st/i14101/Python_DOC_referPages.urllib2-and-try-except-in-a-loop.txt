I am trying to learn about exception handling in python by writing an International Space Station tracker in Python.I have read https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html and have found Handle errors with urllib2 useful, but I am struggling to understand how to have code continue to loop despite an exception being thrown and I'm not sure how to research this further.I have this working code. It runs for days on my Raspberry Pi as part of a bigger program that makes a green light come on when ISS is overhead. Eventually though, an error is caused and the program halts. I'm looking for a way for the program to continue even if an error is called. I.e. This function is called every 10 seconds, but if there is an error I want the program to simply try again after 10 seconds while noting the error.Pointers would be appreciated. Thank you.
I am not seeing any loop in your code . Are you calling issPosition from a loop?If yes, don't handle exceptions in this method or re just re-throw it. And handle the exception in your loop and continue execution.For example:** This will run for ever. You may want to add extra logic to end the loop eventually.
