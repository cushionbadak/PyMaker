Write a program named readfile.py that uses a loop to read and process mynumbers.txt. The program should output all of the integers, one per line, with no blank lines between each line. This program should also output the largest random number that was on file. I have this so far:Everything works but it wont give me largest random number that was on file. Other site said this was broken but its not. It will pull all the integers from the text file. At the end it also needs to print 'The largest random number that was on file is' but I need that number to show.
As stated, since this appears to be a homework problem we will just lead you on the correct path.You correctly opened the file, looped through it, printed each line, and closed the file.(If the problem wants you to print each number on a new line then you might want to review your code regarding the print function)However, you did not keep track of the size of the numbers that you are iterating through in any way.*Hint: Use conditional statements, comparison operators, and a variable or use a list.Conditional Statements: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statementsComparison Operators: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisonsLists: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#listsYou'll have to go from here.*Note: Look into the With statement: http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/with-statement-in-python
HintsRun your code.. does it generate an error?Read this documentation: python built-in functionsIs there a function that can do it for you?You cannot just simply use pure english and do for line in file, you must use this code:.readlines() turns all the lines into a list so you can iterate over them.Extra hint if you've read the documentation and cannot figure it out:http://freetexthost.com/y422jtddflAnswer here:http://freetexthost.com/biylxaqt2yEDIT: improved answer in URL.

If you want to also print the largest number in your file, you just have to add this to your code under your other print:That is if you only have numbers in your file.
