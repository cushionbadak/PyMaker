Say I have a file object which was opened in mode 'r' (such as from the default open() call), but I need to read it in binary mode ('rb').Is there a way to change the mode directly, or do I need to make a new file object using something like open(foo.name, 'rb') (assuming my file object is named foo)?EDIT: Ideally, the solution to this problem should be platform-independent.
In Python 2 you'll have to open a new file object; you cannot change the file mode on an already-opened file.You can do so with the previous file object:In Python 3 you can access the underlying buffered I/O file object, via the TextIOBase.buffer attribute:or reach all the way down to the raw file object, both are always binary:The same hierarchy is available in Python 2 if you use the io.open() function.
