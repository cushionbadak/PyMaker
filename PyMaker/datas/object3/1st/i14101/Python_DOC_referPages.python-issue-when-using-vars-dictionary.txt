I have the following snippet:Which gives me KeyError: 'a' whereas the following code works fine:What's the difference here?
vars() without any argument acts like locals() and since a dictionary comprehension has its own scope it has no variable named a or b.You can use eval() here. Without any argument it will execute in LEGB manner, or specify globals() dict explicitly to eval:But then again the correct way will be to create a dictionary from the start if you want to access variables using their names.
Its because of that in your code vars returns a dictionary contains the local variables.actually based on documentation :Without an argument, vars() acts like locals() . see the following example :As you can see we have not any local variable within function a so vars returns an empty dictionary.And in your case as a more pythonic way you can create a dictionary of your objects :
It seems Python makes a closure in dictionary comprehension (say, dictcomp)
Use vars() in the for loop performs as the second code you gave.We can figure out the new locals/vars within for loop in dict comprehension:
