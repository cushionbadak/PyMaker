I have a file named main.py which contains a class called mainWindow. I have a second file named popupWindow.py, which contains a class named popupWindow. mainWindow class contains 2 methods. One called clearListBox which clears the list box in the main window, and one called addScouts(I) which is a recursive function for writing the scouts stored in a file to the list box. I would like to be able to call the clearListBox and addScouts(I) from my class popupWindow. How do i achieve this?upon trying from main import mainWindow then calling mainWindow.addScouts(1) i received the error that addScouts requires arg selfIn my main.py file:In popupWindow.py:In popupWindow class:My Error:Thank you in advance
This question has been asked times and times again - and is nothing Python-specific. To call a method on an instance of another class, you need to have a reference to this instance. The very obvious solution is to pass this reference, either at call time:or at instanciation time:Note that in both cases, B doesn't need to know about class A - it just gets an instance as param and that's it. So if A and B live in different modules, the module containing B doesn't have to import the one containing A:which avoids the circular import error you obviously have given your traceback.
At the beginning of popupWindow.py, put the lineThen you can just call, e.g., mainWindow.clearListBox()EDIT after OP posted code sample:clearListBox is an instance method and as such can only be called on an instance, not on the class itself. You first have to instantiate an object of type mainWindow.
Based on your question and on your comment to @niceguy's answer, it's clear that the solution to your problem is to go read the python tutorial: Very soon you'll learn about modules (including import) and classes (including self, and calling class methods).Edit: If you already understand about classes and instances, then here's your problem spelled out: Your class name is mainWindow, your instance is mainWin. You should be calling your functions on mainWin, e.g. mainWin.addScouts(1); not on mainWindow.
