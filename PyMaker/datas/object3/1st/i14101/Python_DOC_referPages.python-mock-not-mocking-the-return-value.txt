I'm having some trouble with Python mock() and I'm not familiar enough to figure out what's going on with it.I have an abstract async task class that looks something like:I'd like to patch the createAsyncTask method for a specific instance of this class.The code I wrote looks like:When I print out task_ent in enqueue, I get <MagicMock name='createAsyncTask()' id='140578431952144'>When I print out cls.createAsyncTask in enqueue, I get <MagicMock name='createAsyncTask' id='140578609336400'>What am I doing wrong? Why won't createAsyncTask return 12?
Try the following:where module_name is the name of the module which contains the class AsyncTask.In general, this is the guideline https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patch
