I am trying to convert code that was previously written for Python 2.7 to code that will work in Python 3.4. The code is below and I had to change urllib2.urlopen() to urllib.request.urlopen(). However, this change resulted in the error TypeError: string argument expected, got 'bytes' in the line compressedFile.write(response.read()). 
You should decode the bytes before passing it to the write functionAlso see the docs. "utf-8" may be omitted because it's the default, but explicit is better than implicit ;-)
Append a call to decode() to decode the bytes into a str.
