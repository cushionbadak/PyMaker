Natural Text
I want to read all strings from Python file. Example file (/tmp/s.py):Now I try to read the string from my script:But I want the string (in this case the byte that is in escaped hex representation) not to be escaped. I want to treat the data was it is in my /tmp/s.py file and to get a string with a interpreted \x7f byte, instead of the literal \x7f, which is right now represented as \\x7f.How can I do this?
You'd use the unicode_escape codec to decode the string the same way Python does when reading a string literal:Note that unicode_escape can only decode from bytes, not from text. The codec is also limited to Latin-1 source code, not the default UTF-8.From the Text Encodings section of the Python codecs module:unicode_escape Encoding suitable as the contents of a Unicode literal in ASCII-encoded Python source code, except that quotes are not escaped. Decodes from Latin-1 source code. Beware that Python source code actually uses UTF-8 by default.Demo:
