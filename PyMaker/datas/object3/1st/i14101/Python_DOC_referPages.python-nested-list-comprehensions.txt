I am learning python and going through their tutorials. I understand list comprehensions and nested lists comprehensions. With the following code, though, I am trying to understand the order of events.According to the nested list comprehension, is the first "i" and the second "i" the same variable and do they both increase at the same time? I guess I don't understand how the resulting big list goes from the first sublist [1, 5, 9] to the second sublist [2, 6, 10]
is equivalent tois the first "i" and the second "i" the same variable and do they both increase at the same time?Of course, it is. If it was not the same i, the code would throw an error because one of the two would not be defined.You may be interested in this question: Understanding nested list comprehension
