I have a list of lists sayHow do I generate a combination of the lists for a given length?For example if the given length is 3Then I need all combinations of 3 list element scenarios from the given list of list.Example : orand if the given length is 2 then it should be likeor I dont want a permutation of elements inside the lists but I want a permutation of the lists itself.
There are two options here. The first is to use itertools.permutations. This will give you every permutation (i.e: [1,2] and [2,1] would not be the same)If you want completely unique groupings, with no duplicates , use itertools.combinations (i.e: [1,2] and [2,1] would be the same).
