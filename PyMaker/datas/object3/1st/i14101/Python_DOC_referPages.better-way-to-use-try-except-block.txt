I have a requirement to execute multiple Python statements and few of them might fail during execution, even after failing I want the rest of them to be executed.Currently, I am doing:If any one of the statements fails, except will get executed and program exits. But what I need is even though it is failed it should run all three statements. How can I do this in Python?
Use a for loop over the methods you wish to call, eg:Note that we're using except Exception here - that's generally much more likely what you want than a bare except.
If an exception occurs during a try block, the rest of the block is skipped. You should use three separate try clauses for your three separate statements.Added in response to comment:Since you apparently want to handle many statements, you could use a wrapper method to check for exceptions:Then call the method with the name of your function as input:
I would recommend creating a context manager class that suppress any exception and the exceptions to be logged. Please look at the code below. Would encourage any improvement to it.
