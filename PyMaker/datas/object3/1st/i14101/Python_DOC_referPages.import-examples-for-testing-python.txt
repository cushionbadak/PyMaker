For the following problem I am unable to find an answer.I have my program to do various stuff to graphs in one file. After my class definition and functions I have my basic structure of which functions to call on a pair of graphs.Now I want to have different extra files with a pair of graphs in each to show different aspects of my program.How do I get that file into my main program as if the code that is in the extra files was in my main program?I know, it is a basic problem but I never dealt with this before.For illustration:If I could also specify the file I want to load via command line, that would be even better.
You can put your variable/graph pairs in their own python files and import them into your main file.Ex.example1.pyexample2.pymain.pyIf you really want user to specify which graph pair to use at command line, take a look at argparse and importlib
