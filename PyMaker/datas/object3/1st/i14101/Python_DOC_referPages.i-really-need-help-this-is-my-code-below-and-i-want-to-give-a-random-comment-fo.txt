This is updated version and there are no syntax errors so while it does now fix most of the errors, two errors remain. 1) After the user has inputted an answer, nothing appears, not even the score prints.2)The comment only appears after every question has been answered. How do i fix both of these problems?
One way to choose a random element in a sequence is too use the choice function in the random library.
As was suggested, just put all the comments in a list as strings. To print a random comment, a random number between 0 and the length of the list is chosen as the index of the element that is printed. Run this program a few times to see it demonstrated.
Here is the bug: If the answer is correct, you are creating a list.. but in creating it, you use (and execute) the function "print", which in turn prints out your "correct" statement for all of the entries.ie. Remove the print function from all of the list entries, and just print one of the result set using the random.choice function (as others have suggested).
