I'm really struggling at installing any python modules (e.g six, yahoo_finance) because they require pip to be installed, but I don't know whether I have pip already or how to install it. Once its installed I don't know what command to type in and where to type it in. Can I install these modules any other way without pip?I am only a beginner, so sorry if this is a bit basic.Thanks in advance
pip comes already bundled with python 3.4 It will be in your scripts directory C:\Python34\Scripts\Add it to your Environment variables and you can run it from any directory or else open the directory mentioned above in command prompt and run pip install ... to install whatever you want
First, make sure you have it installed, if not follow the instructions below. Type which pip, and if it doesn't list an URL, it means it's not installed yet.Go here https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and download the file.Then open terminal and go to your downloads folder (or wherever you downloaded it to) and type python get-pip.py to execute the script. If you get an error that says OSError: Permission Denied, or something similar, run it with administrator permissions.If the installation is successful, you should now have pip installed on your computer. Type pip --version to make sure you have it installed. To install six and yahoo_finance, type:andIf something goes wrong update your question.
From Installing Python Modules:pip is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers.Emphasis mineIf you already installed it by default you should be able to use it.Just open the command line and type python -m pip install SomePackage.
