I feel a bit blonde right now, but for some reason I can't figure out how to solve this. Need to correct these two issues. using // integer division messes up the average. Also, I need to use the format function to get 2 decimal placesdef viewscores(scores):def main():main()
This is one of those things where Python2 and Python3 behave differently.using // integer division messes up the average. Python 3:Python 2:In either case, you don't want to use //.Also, I need to use the format function to get 2 decimal placesPython 3:Python 2:Even within each dialect there's multiple solutions.
The most simple option would be to use format(scores, '.2f')
i am new to Python as well.For "//", i gave a trial on ipython, to me they do not make much difference whether you use // or /using "/" http://screencloud.net/v/hcDousing "//" http://screencloud.net/v/bwAqthe solution to your request is  http://screencloud.net/v/rwQpFor two decisoinal place problem, i learnt something from the followingLimiting floats to two decimal pointsand it works to your case  - http://screencloud.net/v/1gPBFor function, you may wish to consult Googlei am not good at creating function, but function always should have "return", because everything in python is object
