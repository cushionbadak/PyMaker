so I have this package. In the cmd I go to hp@HP-PC C:\Users\hp\Documents\scripts:Everything is working fine but I want to have a directory in which I could add my scripts and be able to open my cmd->python->import my package and do whatever I am going to do and not get this instead:PS: keep in mind I have added the directory scripts to the path and I have global bat files which work
RunIt'll list 2 important pieces of information:The Python module search path, sys.pathThe location for the USER_SITE directory, and wether or not this exists.Python looks for modules along those locations. Put your module in a sys.path location (in one that ends in site-packages preferably), or make sure you created the USER_SITE directory and put your code in there.And you can always extend the path by setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
