Trying to write a function that take the sum of each list and return individual values in a new single list. E.g  becomes What I have so far:But this just accumulates each list onto each other resulting in:I'm not sure how to keep the sums for each list separate here. The SUM function is not allowed here as it's an exercise on nested loops.Thanks.
You need to reset your total counter before starting each inside for.Also, you don't need to declare it outside, because you will use it only inside.
The error is you do not re-initialize the total variable after each loop. Instead, initialize sum = 0 inside he first for-loop like so:
Just for fun:I did't use sum :)You can read more about functools.reduce here.Edit: As Sevanteri pointed out in the comment, you can also use [functools.reduce(int.__add__, sublist, 0) for sublist in list](if you really want to drive your teacher mad!)
You need to zero your total for each list.
To be different, flatten the lists and using a generator (assumes sublists are the same length):
You can also do it using map and list comprehension as:
[sum(i) for i in zip(*[[2, 7, 6], [9, 5, 1], [4, 3, 8]])]bultin zip func is what you exactly needed
