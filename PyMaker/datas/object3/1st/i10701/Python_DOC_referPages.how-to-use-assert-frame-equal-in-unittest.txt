New to unittest package. I'm trying to verify the DataFrame returned by a function through the following code. Even though I hardcoded the inputs of assert_frame_equal to be equal (pd.DataFrame([0,0,0,0])), the unittest still fails. Anyone would like to explain why it happens?
assert_frame_equal() is coming from the pandas.util.testing package, not from the unittest.TestCase class. Replace:with:When you had self.assert_frame_equal, it tried to find assert_frame_equal attribute on the unittest.TestCase instance, and, since there is not assert_frame_equal attribute or method exposed on an unittest.TestCase class, it raised an AttributeError.
alecxe answer is incomplete, you can indeed use pandas' assert_frame_equal() with unittest.TestCase, using unittest.TestCase.addTypeEqualityFunc
