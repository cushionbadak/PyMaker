I need a structure in Python which maps an integer index to a vector of floating point numbers. My data is like:If I were to write this in C++ I would use the following code for define / add / access as follows:What is the equivalent structure of this in Python? 
A dictionary of this format -> { (int) key : (list) value  }
How about dictionary and lists like this:The key can be integers and associated values can be stored as a list. Dictionary in Python is a hash map and the complexity is amortized O(1).
I would go for a dict with integers as keys and list as items, e.g.if it is not too much data
