I'm trying to translate a part of my matlab code in python. Actually I'm looking for how to translate fminsearch and I found it on this website with this example :My first question is how to return also the value of fmin ? And in my code when I type :Python answered me :I don't understand why Python told me that because what i want to do is to minimize the function diff_norm changing the values of X, i precise X is an array of length 10.Thank you very much for your help !
Python told you that because in Python, keyword arguments always follow non keyword (i.e positional) arguments (keyword args have a name assigned to them, as in func in the fmin call). Your function call should look like:in order to comply with Python's calling conventions. Alternatively, and, according to the function definition of fmin, you could only supply positional arguments for these two first arguments:this will return the values that minimize the function, so, just call the function providing these arguments:Alternatively you could call fmin with full_output = True and get a tuple of elements back, the second element of that tuple is the minimum value:Now minval contains your full output.
