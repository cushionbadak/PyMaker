how to write the :type annotation in Python in case the argument can have different types?orPyCharm accepts the 2nd variant
You are using the Sphinx project notation, which incidentally was rejected for inclusion in the PEP 484 -- Type Hints proposal. :type is an info field list, and there isn't really all that much of a formal specification for these. The documentation example uses or:but note that integer isn't a formal type, nor is None (it is a singleton object).These are documentation constructs, not type hints, really. That PyCharm supports these at all is nice, but these are not a Python standard.I'd stick with proper type annotations instead. That means using a Union type:You can put these in a # type: comment if you need to support Python 2.
