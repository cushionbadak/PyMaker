This code below is supposed to delete the content of the file and write the new strings that user enters through terminal, but in reality it only appends new line to what is already there. I can't seem to make it fully erase the content with truncate(). How do I do this?Note: it has to be done with truncate() as it's an exercise from the book and I don't want to jump into the future and use any more advanced stuff.Thanks!
truncate() without any arguments truncates at the current position. Pass a size to make it truncate the file to that size.
The truncate method has an optional size argument which defaults to the current position of the file pointer. Since you've already called read on the file, truncate isn't doing anything as the current position is the end of the file. Change your call to truncate(0) and it'll clear the file.
