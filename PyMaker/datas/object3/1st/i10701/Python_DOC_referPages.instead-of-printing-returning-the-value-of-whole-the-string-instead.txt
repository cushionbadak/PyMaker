Currently working on an assignment where I want to print stars as triangles, the code is currently looking like this (very basic, I know):When I enter, for example (3,1) I will get first 3 stars in the first row, then 1 star. This code is working fine, the problem is that for the assignment, I want to ONLY return the whole string that constitutes the triangle, it also has to contain the '\n' for switching row. Does anyone have a clue how I can do this?
Instead of printing, initialize an  empty string and use the string concatenation operator to build the string:
Collect the lines in a list, then join them with \n and return.Or shorter:
