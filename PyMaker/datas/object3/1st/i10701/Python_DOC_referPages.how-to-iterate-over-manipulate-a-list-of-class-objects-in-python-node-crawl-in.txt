Can anyone help me with the an iteration over a list of class objects?I want to setup a simulation of nodes interacting with each other in a decentralized network. Each node is created as an object in the class Node. Every node gets his name and a list of max three other nodes (also objects in sam class) he is connected to.for the simulation later on it is necessary that each node has three lists.l1 contains all nodes he is connected tol2 contains all nodes the nodes from l1 are connected tol3 contains all nodes the nodes from l2 are connected toI want to create l2 and l3 dynamically. My idea was since every node knows the nodes he is directly conected to I just have to fetch l1 from every node. So far I have this (although I don't like how l2 is created now since its static).I thought maybe I can write a for loop to use every element from the preceeding list. But that doesn't work. Python tells me that indices must be integers or slices. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Later I will have to clean the lists of double mentioned nodes any advice on that would be great too.Cheers
Okay so thanks to wwii I found the answernodes appearing double in the list can be eliminated with:
