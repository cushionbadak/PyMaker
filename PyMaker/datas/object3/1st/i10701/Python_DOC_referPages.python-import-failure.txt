Got some strange import error which is as much strangely reported by interpreter.I use CPython-3.5Directory structure:main.py:outer/__init__.py: emptyouter/inner/__init__.py:outer/inner/first.py:outer/inner/second.py:then, I run main.py and script fails with this stack trace:So, Python does not want to bind names correctly. Although import statement in first.py: import outer.inner.second is executed without crashing, this statement binds to name outer something like an empty package, which doesn't have (but should) the module named inner What do I do wrong?
It's better to import relative paths, not absolute ones. I do not know what you are trying to achieve, but correct way to import something from a file on the same level is to use a dot . so In your first file use something like:And in your inner/__init__.py file something like:This allows you to avoid name conflicts as well as keep names simple, unique and generally more readible code.EDIT:Also if you are nw to python consider adding interpreter comment in your main.py module. It's convenient for users of Unix-like systems (OS X, Linux etc.)
