I am currently working on Project Euler Problem 4 (https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) and am consistently getting an error when I try to run my code. I have looked at other questions regarding the 'int' object is not iterable, but have not found one that has helped me so far. Here is my current code:When I run this, I get the following error:Most of the fixes I have seen for this for loop issue involve changing "for a in b" to "for a in range...", but I already have that syntax here.Could anyone help me figure out what is wrong?Any general comments about my code are also welcome. I'm just a beginner!
range(start, end) yields integersusing thisyou are trying to iterate over an integer (1)you can't iterate over an integeryou want
You are trying (without realizing it) to iterate over each integer yielded by the range function:The comma in x,y makes those three characters a single 2-tuple, which is not the same as two variables x and y... especially when they're on the left-hand side of an assignment statement.  Yes, for is an assignment statement --- about a thousand of them, in your case --- with the x,y tuple on the left side and an integer on the right:Assigning to a tuple uses sequence unpacking (described at the end of the "Tuples and Sequences" section), which iterates over the values and assigns them to the variables inside the tuple.  But there is no sequence of values in your code, only an int, which leads directly to the "'int' object is not iterable" error message.As luke_aus answered, you can solve the immediate problem by replacing the tuple with a lone variable, but that means y never gets assigned:In this case, though, you don't need y at all.  It's always equal to x, so just use x:Or, if you really will need that y later, just assign y whenever "later" happens:
