I would like to retrieve dictionary keys according to a list of priority keys.The dictionary looks like:And the list of criteria is:How can this be done in a pythonic way?
you can retrieve elements by the order you specified
You could use an OrderedDict:The advantage is that you can still access your data as if it was a dictionary (e.g. My_dic['age']).
Dictionaries are not sortable, due to the way the information is stored (http://www.python-course.eu/dictionaries.php).You could create a new list of tuple values using list comprehension, like:ordered_info = [(i,my_dic[i]) for i in my_criteria]
Just iterate through your priority keys, not your dict, then get values using those keys:will print the values of your keys in the order that My_criteria is in.
