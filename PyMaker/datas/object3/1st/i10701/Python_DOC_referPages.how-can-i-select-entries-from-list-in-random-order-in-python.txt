Question is simple. I have a list of say 10 entries, I am running a loop over it. What i want here is getting each entry exactly once but in random order.What is the best and most pythonic way to do it?
You can use random.sample, it returns random elements preventing duplicates:The original list remains unchanged.
You can use random.shuffle:
Shuffle the list first by importing the random module and using the shuffle function:Then loop over your list. Note that shuffle mutates the original list and does not return the shuffled version. 
You could use shuffle:
you could use random.shuffle():Valid remark from Jean-Fran√ßois Fabre: if you were to use the original variable and pass it directly to random.shuffle, Python would return an error, stating 'range' object does not support item assignment, as range returns a generator. To solve this, simply replace the assignment with list(range(10)).
