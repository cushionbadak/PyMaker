I'd like to find a string in "match objects" in python, but ".find" does not work. Here is my snippet:... Now e_list is like:I'm expecting to have the result:While e_list[0].group(0) returns '30M.aaa', .find cannot be applied because it's a match object. Then, what should I do?
I think Python is not your first language, your code smell like Java.Please do not use re.compile, because it is unnecessary. Just use re.search or re.findall.And in Python, you can just use:then, result is a list, you can print it or use for... loop to get every item of it.As you can also use:the result is a group. Then you should use result.group(1) to get the the matched item.SO, your code can be:
To check if the string begins with '50M', use str.startswith('50M'). This will not detect cases where 50M is the suffix (test.50M).If the suffix is a legitimate place to find the 50M, using in is much cleaner than .find('50M') > 0.
