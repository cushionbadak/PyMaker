Say I have this method that I cache using lru_cache:I am calling this method like this:Because the maxsize of the cache is 8, only numbers 2-9 are cached at this point. After call_1, I am doing call_2:During call_2, again first number 0 is called (not in cache!), and after that numbers 0 and 3-9 are cached.Then number 1 is called (not in cache!) and after that numbers 0-1 and 4-9 are cached.Well, you see where this is going: the cache is never used...I understand that for this specific example I could alternate between range(... and reverse(range(... but in a more complicated scenario that's probably not possible.Question: Is it possible to inspect which numbers are cached and to order the calls based on that? What would be the overhead for this?
No, no, the cache used in lru is specifically designed to not be public-facing. All its internals are encapsulated for thread safety and in order to not break code if the implementation changes.Apart from that, I don't think it is a good idea to base your input based on caching, you should cache based on your input. If your callable is not periodically called with the same arguments, maybe a cache is not the best option.
