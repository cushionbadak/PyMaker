You can dofor using processes instead of threads use import multiprocessing as mpIn this case if you are after performance, doing the sum in a single thread/process is much faster because you are summing so few numbers. Creating Threads takes time and creating Processes takes much more time. (Normally using threads does not increase computational performance with the standard interpreter if you are not using special functions which release the "GIL")
