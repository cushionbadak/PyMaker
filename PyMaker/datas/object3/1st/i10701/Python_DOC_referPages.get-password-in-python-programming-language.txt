Is there any builtin function that can be used for getting a password in python.I need answer like thisInput:    Enter a username: abcdefg    Enter a password : ********If i enter a password abcdefgt. It shows like ********.  
OriginalThere is a function in the standard library module getpass:This function does not echo any characters as you type.AddendumIf you absolutely must have * echoed while the password is typed, and you are on Windows, then you can do so by butchering the existing getpass.win_getpass to add it.  Here is an example (untested):Similarly, on unix, a solution would be to butcher the existing getpass.unix_getpass in a similar fashion (replacing the readline in _raw_input with an appropriate read(1) loop).
Use the getpass() function and then print the number of stars equivalent to the number of characters in the password. This is a sample:The drawback is it does not print ***** side by side.
