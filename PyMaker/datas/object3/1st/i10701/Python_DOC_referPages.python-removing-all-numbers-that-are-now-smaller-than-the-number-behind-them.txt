I made a function for this in my functions file:My main program looks like: ( I use the removeNum function i'm having issues with towards the bottom of the code. )When I run the program it doesn't print out the new list that's been modified from the removeNum function above, is there something wrong with my function or in my main program? I'm not getting any errors. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.
One way to approach the problem is to zip the list with a copy of itself offset by 1 and then filter using a list comprehension as follows:
your function is broken, lookit skip number, the reason is simpleyou advance loop regardless of the situation, when you should not do it when you remove a element, to fix this just donow it produce the expected outcomeI don't recommend modify the list in place, but rather make a new one with the result like for examplethe advantage of this is that don't depend in iterable being a list, which make it more generic and allow it to work with tuple, generator, and anything elsealso some line of your cade are unneeded like you can use the build-in sum for thisor if they do what it name suggest, then you can use a slice to get thatbut as you don't assign it result to anything, then you print it?
this code will iterate over my_list comparing current item to previous taking only ones which are greater then previous.
