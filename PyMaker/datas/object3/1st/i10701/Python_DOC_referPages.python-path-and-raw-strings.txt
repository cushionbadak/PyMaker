I have some problems with the name of path + file (which is an input for a function). This works:This does not work:What I would like to do is the following (but also does not work [Errno 22] invalid mode ('rb') or filename:):How do I get the "r" in front of the name without using " "? Or, is there a possibility without putting r in front of the path?
My interpreter suggests that you are mistaken in your belief that the second example does not work, becauseThe correct way to build file paths from components is by using the os.path.join function, which can take multiple arguments and is portable across platforms. I would suggest you try something like
How do I get the "r" in front of the name without using " "?Just use os.path.join:
The r prefix is used to indicate the you want the string to be evaluated as "raw", keeping backslashes as-is.Try this:As you can see, I added r before the string expression that contains a non-escaped backslash.To see the difference, try doing :(Without the parentheses if you're using Python2)Also, I recommend using the pathlib module of the standard library to handle paths properly. This will also help a lot if you try to make your code portable:
You need use a raw string for the path variable, or escape the backslash:You can see the difference here:In the first case '\f' is the form feed character 0x0c.Also, use os.path.join() to construct pathnames:Since you explicitly append the string literal .mat to nameFile, why not simply define nameFile with the .mat extension? If this needs to be dynamic, just add it on like this:
