Trying to put the last 24hrs of data into a CSV file and getting using tweepy for pythonas an error, can anyone see what is wrong as this was working in some capacity before today. Code:    def get_all_tweets(screen_name):** EDIT 1 **** EDIT 2**
Your problem is with the characters in some tweets. You're not able to write them to the file you open.If you replace this linewith this:it should work. Please note that this will only work with python 3.x
It seems that the character is something that cannot be encoded into utf-8. While it may be useful to view the tweet in question that triggered the error, you can prevent such an error in the future by changing tweet.text.encode("utf-8") to either tweet.text.encode("utf-8", "ignore"), tweet.text.encode("utf-8", "replace"), or tweet.text.encode("utf-8", "backslashreplace"). ignore removes anything that cannot be encoded; replace replaces the infringing character with \ufff; and backslashreplace adds a backslash to the infringing character \x00 would become \\x00.For more on this: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#converting-to-bytes
