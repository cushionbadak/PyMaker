Natural Text
this is what I am trying to do. I created a method that will upload a file however, I would like to change its file name. I was able to change the filename but I also lost the extension.this is how my codes look:but the file looks like 324329432840932 only when I am expecting something like 324329432840932.jpg
It's better to use splitext instead of method split():
