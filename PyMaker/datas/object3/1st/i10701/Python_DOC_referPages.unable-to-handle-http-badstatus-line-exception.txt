I want to handle http.client.BadStatusLine: '' exception.I am on python3. My code is but httpException is not in python3?  I read stackOverFloeQuestion and this but unable to catch it. Any help?
You need to make up your mind :-). You can either use http.client or urllib.request, but you should not use one and then try to catch errors from the other. If you want to stick with urllib.request, the class to catch is urllib.error.HTTPError.Perhaps it may be more opportune in your case to use Requests, which is a higher level http library.
