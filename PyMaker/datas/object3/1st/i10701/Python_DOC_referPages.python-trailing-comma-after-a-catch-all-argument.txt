Natural Text
I am baffled by the trailing comma in a function parameter list:earns me a SyntaxError exception. In python 3, even this:raises a syntax error exception. Both point to the closed parenthesis.Removing the trailing comma, everything is quiet.I am scratching my head on https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions but it is somehow beyond me (and possibly also wrong... at least, in my browser's rendering I can't pair the last closing parenthesis in the parameter_list definition).Am I doing something wrong?I am thetype of person, and this issue kind-of annoys me (maybe that is the wrong part, and I should become the , a: "doc A" = 1 type of person - but it looks weird to me).Using python as distributed in Gentoo ebuilds dev-lang/python 2.7.12 and 3.5.2 (from http://www.python.org).
Trailing commas in parameter lists are treated as multiple values separated by commas.So if the parameters of a function have a trailing comma, python thinks that there should be a value but there isn't, so it raises a syntax error.Trailing commas in lists, on the other hand, are fine.
