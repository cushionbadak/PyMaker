Natural Text
I need to know if either/all needle are found in a haystack. I assume there's a way to optimize the time for searching.  For example:In this example an optimized method would probably sort the needles by first letter(s). After matching "ezz" in the haystack, there's no point in searching haystack all over again.  Ideally for the next needle ("egh"), the haystack would be searched from the last position of 'e', and not from the beginning ('xxx..').What is the name for such an algorithm?What are the python implementations for that?notes:my current program searches thousands of known needles in an unknown text.In this case i just need to check for existence (true/false)in this case i search if any needle exists ("OR" search). Assume that most needles need to be searched anyway (@marko).
Maybe there is a more efficient implementation for that but you can simply use re. For a really big needles this might not be ideal - don't know where  "really big" starts.
