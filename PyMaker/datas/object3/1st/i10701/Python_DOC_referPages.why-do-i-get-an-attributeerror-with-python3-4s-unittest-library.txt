So here is my code:Whenever I run my code, I get the following error:I don't understand what the problem is here.
You get the error because you're using unittest incorrectly. Per the example in the docs, your tests should look like:You can't just instantiate the test case class yourself and call the methods, that skips all of the test discovery and setup.
Your methods look fine to me, and mimic what I see in the example code provided through the help function.import unittesthelp(unittest)I have the same problem using a debs build in a virtual box working in a python 2.7 environment.  For some reason only the assertEqual method is problematic. assertAlmostEqual (scientific assert equal), assertSequenceEqual, assertItemEqual, etc. have no problems.  Since you are subclassing unittest.TestCase the class you define is inheriting all the methods of unittest.TestCase class, including the method assertEqual.  for your code I can run (from the command line in python 2.7):import testing_code as ttest_object = t.Test()t.assertSequenceEqual([4,5,6] , [4,5,6]) t.assertNotEqual(4,7)and no problems... I get your same errors trying a simple assertEqual method.  I don't think this is a code structure/misuse of unittest problem, and am pretty sure this is an environment/build problem. I decided i needed an assert equal as a method on my class so i just made a simple one:
