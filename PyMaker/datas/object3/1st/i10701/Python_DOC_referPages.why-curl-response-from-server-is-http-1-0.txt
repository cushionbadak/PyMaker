I had created simple server in terminalwhen I send command curl -I http://localhost:8000and command result was a request:127.0.0.1 - - [07/Aug/2016 14:53:22] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -but response was a HTTP/1.0curl -v http://localhost:8000How we can explain this? Why server response was not a HTTP/1.1
curl uses HTTP/1.1 by default from version 7.33.0 (yours is 7.43.0). In man curl:So curl will make a request with HTTP/1.1 to your server. This line127.0.0.1 - - [07/Aug/2016 14:53:22] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -is just a log entry which tells you that there is a request made with expected to get HTTP/1.1 BUT it doesn't mean server must response with HTTP/1.1, see the link of Karoly Horvath for detail.Looking at source code of SimpleHTTPServer, you can see there is a default request version which is HTTP/0.9.This default_request_version variable is then assigned to self.request_version in line 244.The function which does the response is send_response and at line 402 there is a comparison with HTTP/0.9, this leads to the protocol version is protocol_version is HTTP/1.0 in line 515
It's just a version number, the server supports the older 1.0 protocol.See HTTP 1.0 vs 1.1
