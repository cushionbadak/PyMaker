I followed up this tutorial: https://pawelmhm.github.io/asyncio/python/aiohttp/2016/04/22/asyncio-aiohttp.html and everything works fine when I am doing like 50 000 requests. But I need to do 1 milion API calls and then I have problem with this code:Because Python needs to create 1 milion tasks, it basically just lags and then prints Killed message in terminal. Is there any way to use a generator insted of pre-made set (or list) of urls? Thanks.
asyncio is memory bound (like any other program). You can not spawn more task that memory can hold. My guess is that you hit a memory limit. Check dmesg for more information.1 millions RPS doesn't mean there is 1M tasks. A task can do several request in the same second.
Schedule all 1 million tasks at onceThis is the code you are talking about. It takes up to 3 GB RAM so it is easily possible that it will be terminated by the operating system if you have low free memory.Use queue to streamline the workThis is my suggestion how to use asyncio.Queue to pass URLs to worker tasks. The queue is filled as-needed, there is no pre-made list of URLs. It takes only 30 MB RAM :)
