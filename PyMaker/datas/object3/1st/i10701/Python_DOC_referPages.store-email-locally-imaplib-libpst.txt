I'm using imaplib to fetch emails for several accounts (Gmail, Yahoo..).What is the best way to store emails locally (including attachments).Is there any way to pickle and store emails as file?Is it possible to store emails as bytes and retrieve themlater as mail object?I'll try to save mail in separate folder with each field in JSON fileand attachment as separate files, but I was wondering if there is a native way of doing it.
There are already several established ways to store mailboxes (i.e. a list of emails). Popular examples are Maildir and mbox.Python includes the mailbox module which can handle them:Supported mailbox formats are Maildir, mbox, MH, Babyl, and MMDF.You can of course roll your own solution, pickle them or dump them as JSON to a file, but if you use one of the common formats, you gain compatibility with other programs (importing them into Thunderbird, for example).
