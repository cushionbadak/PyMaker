The following function requires a "mutable pointer". How do I represent that in Python?Swift:Objective-C:Seems a bit mad that the function returns values in this way, nonetheless.I've tried just supplying variables, already assigned to empty values, but I get a segmentation fault. If the variables are undefined, I get:Here's some code that causes a Sgmentation fault. It's very easy to get these if CoreGraphics doesn't like the input.
You don't need mutable pointers at all.  There are two common uses for pointers to int (or similar storage) in C-like code, and Python provides better ways to do both.Case 1:  Multiple return valuesA C-like function can't return more than one value without defining a new struct and allocating memory for it.  That's tedious enough the job is often foisted off onto the calling function, which provides pointers to the storage it has allocated in advance.In Python, you'd just return an object... in your case, a tuple or namedtuple:Case 2: Announcing ErrorsA C-like function that needs to signal that an error has occurred will typically return some "illegal" value.  If there is no such value it can use, an alternative is to take a pointer to some storage the caller owns, where it will scribble its exit status on its way out.In Python, you'd just raise an exception, which is better in almost every way.
