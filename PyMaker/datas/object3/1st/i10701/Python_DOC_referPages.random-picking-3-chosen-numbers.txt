Ok, I am creating a game and no matter what I do, it just isn't working. So I have 3 numbers chosen, 25,50,75.I want to be able to random pick one of them. Then I will need to be able to add it to a total making it obviously an integer. I have imported random. I have tried random.sample but I can't get that one to be an number that I can add. I tried random.randint and that did not work at all. I have tried looking it up but it is pretty much all random in a range and not specific. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. I am using python 3.4.3. 
Use random.choice:
random.choice() is the way to go, however, random.sample() will also work if you use a sample size of 1 and you access the first element of the returned list.The point here is that random.sample() returns a list because that function is designed to select multiple values from the population. That's why you can not immediately use the result as an integer.
