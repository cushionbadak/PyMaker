i am working on a python script to be a multi tool for getting DNS information on servers in a enterprise env. so far the script i have is using python 3.5. i am using argparse for creating command line options, which i am trying to create an if/ elif / else statement which contains the different selections. the main error message i am getting is:that is when the command is run by itself. when it is run with a host name at the end ./GetHostName.py hostName it gives this message: I didn't put real name of server for security issues....When i use the argparse options say like the -f option for getting the FQDN, it gives this response...from the way it appears, it is taking the -f as input for the server name, when it should only be the input for argparse input. i have tried everything to fix it that i can think of. i have encased the main code body in a main function, that didn't work so i removed it. i use the try: statement and exception statements. that didn't work. i am wondering if there is something just basically wrong with my programming logic at this point...this here is the code from the script:any help would be appreciated. please note that when i run a script with just this in it, it works just fine:thanks in advance.-BetzelelP.S. the code may look out of format, due to having to copy and paste into this blog, and manually putting 4 spaces on to each line to get it to show up as code lol. 
I've had this problem long time ago. To fix this I've changedinSo for getting the value from -a you have to changeinwhere ipfromhostname is the dest value.EDIT:You have to do this operation for every parser.add_argument
