How to read only number from a specific line using python script for example "1009 run test jobs" here i should read only number "1009" instead of "1009 run test jobs"
a simple regexp should do:https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
Use regular expression:
Or this if your number always comes first int(line.split()[0])
Or a simple check if its numbers in a string.[int(s) for s in str.split() if s.isdigit()]Where str is your string of text.
Pretty sure there is a "more pythonic" way, but this works for me:If the number is always at the beginning of your string, you might consider something like outstring = instring[0,3].
You can do it with regular expression. That's very easy:This regular expression extracts the first number in a text. It considers '-' as part of numbers. If you don't want this change regular expression to this one: "[^\d-]*([0-9]+).*"
