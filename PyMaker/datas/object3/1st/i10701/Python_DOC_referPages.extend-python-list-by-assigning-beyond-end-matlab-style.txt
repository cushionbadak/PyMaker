I want to use Python to create a file that looks likeI tried to write this scriptAn error is thrown: IndexError: list index out of range. There are many answers on similar questions that recommend using myParagraph.append('something'), which I know works. But I want to better understand the initialization of Python lists. How to manipulate a specific elements in a list that's not populated yet?
You can do a limited form of this by assigning to a range of indexes starting at the end of the list, instead of a single index beyond the end of the list:Note: In Matlab, you can assign to arbitrary positions beyond the end of the array, and Matlab will fill in values up to that point. In Python, any assignment beyond the end of the array (using this syntax or list.insert()) will just append the value(s) into the first position beyond the end of the array, which may not be the same as the index you assigned.
A list doesn't have an unkown size - len(myParagraph) will give you its length
Since you want to associate an index (whether it exists or not) with an element of data, just use a dict with integer indexes:Just know that you will need to sort the dict to reassemble in integer order.You can reassemble into a string (and skip missing lines) like so:
result:
append is the easiest way to get around this, but if it makes you more comfortable having those indices then you should consider using insert:Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of  the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the  front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to  a.append(x).And don't forget the new line character '\n' when writing to a file.
