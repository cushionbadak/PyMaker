I have a list which look like this:I want to get the dict angle 25, how can I do it?UPDATE: After playing a while with Pandas, I find this might be possible Returns But this is a bit hack.
Assuming each angle in your dictionary is unique and each dictionary contains the key 'angle':
The built-in filter function will do what you want... you just need to feed it a function that determines which objects to keep.  That function below is has_angle.I wrapped has_angle in filter_by_angle, so I could use functools.partial to avoid hard-coding the angle sought.  filter_by_angle is a generator function, so it can yield any number of matching shapes.This prints:Note that the yield from syntax requires Python 3.3 or greater.
