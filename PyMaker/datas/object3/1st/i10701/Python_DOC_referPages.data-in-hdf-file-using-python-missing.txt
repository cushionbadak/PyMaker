I am trying to read in a hdf file but no groups show up. I have tried a couple different methods using tables and h5py but neither work in displaying the groups in the file. I checked and the file is 'Hierarchical Data Format (version 5) data' (See Update). The file information is here for a reference.Example data can be found hereUsing h5py:Outputs:Using tables:Outputs:UPDATENow my question is how to read in a hdf version 4 file into python since h5py and tables both do not work?
How big is the file? I think that doing h5py.File(hdffile,'w') overwrites it, so it's empty. Use h5py.File(hdffile,'r') to read.I don't have enough karma to reply to @Luke H's answer, but reading it into pandas might not be a good idea. Pandas hdf5 uses pytables, which is an "opinionated" way of using hdf5. This means that it stores extra metadata (eg. the index). So I would only use pytables to read the file if it was made with pytables.
UPDATE:i would recommend you first to convert your HDF version 4 files to HDF5 / h5 files as all modern libraries / modules are working with HDF version 5... OLD answer:try it this way:this should print you details about the HDF file, including stored keys, lengths of stored DFs, etc.Demo:now you can read dataframes using keys from the output above:
Try using pandas:See Pandas HDF documentation here.This should read in any hdf file as a dataframe you can then manipulate.
