When running a pytest unit test against a CherryPy server, using a cherrypy.helper.CPWebCase sub-class, how can I set data for the session object? I tried just calling cherrypy.session['foo']='bar' like I would if I was really in a cherrypy call, but that just gave an "AttributeError: '_Serving' object has no attribute 'session'"For reference, a test case might look something like this (pulled from the CherryPy Docs with minor edits):And the handler might look something like this (or anything else, it makes no difference whatsoever):It's safe to assume that the config is correct, and sessions work as expected. I could, of course, write a CherryPy page that takes a key and value as arguments, and then sets the specified session value, and call that from my test code (EDIT: I've tested this, and it does work). That, however, seems kludgy, and I'd really want to limit it to testing only somehow if I went down that road.
What you are trying to achieve is usually referred as mocking.While running tests you'd usually want to 'mock' some of resources you access with dummy objects having same interface (duck typing). This may be achieved with monkey patching. To simplify this process you may use unittest.mock.patch as either context manager or method/function decorator.Please find below the working example with context manager option:==> MyApp.py <====> cp_test.py <==Now you may safely run test as follows:
