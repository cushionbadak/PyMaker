I have tried to install language_check library in Python 2.7 by using...and...In both cases, I get the following error...I also tried doing...and that throws a different error...How do I install language_check in this case?
I check the sources of the file download_lt.py (github language_check).It appears that the error occurs when you try to move the folder language_check/LanguageTool-X.Y with the command os.rename() from your TemporaryFile to your Anaconda Lib folder.So far, @Orions is right, it is a permission problem.Firstly, you should check your folder permission:Go to your Local folder (should be C:\Users\Gaurav M\AppData\Local)Right-click on Temp folder on select propertiesGo to Security tab and Edit and Add your name if it doesn't appear under Group or user names.Repeat the operation for your Anaconda folder. (should be C:\Users\Gaurav M\Anaconda)Secondly, you can try:But the pip --user option install the package only for the user.Install to the Python user install directory for your platform. Typically ~/.local/, or %APPDATA%Python on Windows. (See the Python documentation for site.USER_BASE for full details.)Last but not least,I presume you are using cmd or powershellas Command-line interpreter. In my opinion, using cygwin on Windows makes a lot of things easier. Although It could be painful to configure, I would recommend a pre-configure cygwin solution like Babun.Good luck!
