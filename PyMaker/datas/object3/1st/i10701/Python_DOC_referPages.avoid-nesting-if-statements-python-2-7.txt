I got the idea for this guessing game from a book, Invent With Python. I didn't like that the original script didn't cover the possibilities of re-guessing a number or incorrectly using a number not in 1 - 20, so I modified it. The program works great, however, I'm just wrapping my head around if/elif/else code blocks. I'd like to rewrite the script without having to nest and if inside of an if. I can't even begin to wrap my head around how to do that. Can anyone please help me--just one example of how this program could work without nesting would be great!Here's the little script in its entirety:
Try it like this, using continue to exit the current iteration of the loop and start again at the top of the loop. You also had a logic bug here:A number cannot possibly be both less than or equal to 1, and greater than or equal to 20. Your and should have been an or like this:Or simpler:Also, keep your try/except only around the things that can actually raise an exception (or shouldn't happen if an exception occurs:Here's an example run:
Just change the nested if statements to elif like so:This would be simplest way i see to solve your dilema
