I run the following very trivial Python code. I am very surprised that it actually run. Could someone explain to me why I can even assign values to "nd" and "hel" without defining them in the class definition? Is this because the attribute can be added in the instance level?
Python has no notion of variable declaration, only assignments. The same applies to attributes: you simply assign an initial value to bring it into existence.There is nothing special about the __init__ method in this regard. For example,Both attributes are created in the same way: by assigning a value to them. __init__ is called when a is first created, but otherwise is not special. self inside __init__ is a reference to the object referenced by a, so self.nd = 1 is identical to a.nd = 1. After the object is created, a.hel is created and initialized with 'wem3' by the same process.
