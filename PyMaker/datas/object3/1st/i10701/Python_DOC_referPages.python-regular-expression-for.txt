What would be the regular expression for such datai would like to get these
It looks like you're parsing paths, in which case you should really be using os.path instead of regex:
It is a simple split, no regex needed:
As an alternative, you can get same result without regexps:
use : [^\/]*\.py$But this is a bad question. You need to show what you have try. Whe are not here to do your work for you.
You can use this.You can also use os.path.split(mystring)
