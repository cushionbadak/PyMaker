Natural Text
I'm trying to find a way to check whether or not an alpha-numeric character follows a portion of a string. For example, if the sub-string is: sub, and the text is: substrings are cool, it should return True and if the text is: sub dafdgnjgf it should return False.
If you're looking for any valid letter after a given sub-string, you can first find the position of that sub-string inside the string with str.find, then check if the index after the sub-string matches ascii_letters from string:Now, your check can look like this, index the string after at the position str.find(sub) + len(sub) i.e the position after the sub-string:This prints True if sub is followed by a letter, if not:it prints False.
You could use a regular expression with the substring as a lookbehind, matching a character:
