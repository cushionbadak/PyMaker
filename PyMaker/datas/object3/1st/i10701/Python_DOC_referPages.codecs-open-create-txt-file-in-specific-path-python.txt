Natural Text
i have this code but it saves the files in the same path of .py file, how can i do to create txt files in specific folder?
The codecs.open fonction takes a filename parameter.This filename can be a file name or a full path.So, you can use "/full/path/to/gabili.txt".To build a full path, you can use os.path package, like this.Then use it in codecs.open parameters:NOTE1: the recommanded way to open a file is by using a with statementNOTE2: to be portable Py2/Py3, you should use io.open instead of codecs.open
