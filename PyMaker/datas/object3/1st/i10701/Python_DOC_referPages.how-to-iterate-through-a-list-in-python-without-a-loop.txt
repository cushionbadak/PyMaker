Suppose I want to print all the elements between index 2 and 8 of the list, how do I implement this without using a for, or while loop?
Let's take this sample list:Now, let's print elements 2 through 8 without looping:Here, 2:9 tells python to uses indices starting with 2 and continuing up to but not including 9.
By slicing the listTo get the summation of the values in l[1:8] use sumEDIT because of @pzp:If you want to print all the elements between index 2 and index 8 both inclusive,just replace print(l[1:8]) in the code above with print(l[2:9]).
How about using recursion?Call it like this:
