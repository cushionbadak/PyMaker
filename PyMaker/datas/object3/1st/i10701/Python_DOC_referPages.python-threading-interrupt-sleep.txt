Is there a way in python to interrupt a thread when it's sleeping? (As we can do in java)I am looking for something like that.The thread is sleeping for 100 seconds and if I type 'stop', it interrupts
How about using condition objects:  https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#condition-objectsInstead of sleep() you use wait(timeout). To "interrupt" you call notify().
The correct approach is to use threading.Event. For example:In the other thread, you need to have access to e. You can interrupt the sleep by issuing:This will immediately interrupt the sleep. You can check the return value of e.wait to determine whether it's timed out or interrupted. For more information refer to the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#event-objects .
