Imagine my old list is:goal:Things I've tried:I feel like this is a trivial problem, but I'm having trouble. Thanks in advance for pointing me in the right direction!Also:Imagine I have another list:I would like to set the elements of this list to each one of the new lists:and so on.Any ideas?
For your first question, this is the basic usage of zip:I can't understand your second question.  
Method 1: If you want reach your first goal in one line and want to use list comprehensions try:leads to new = [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]].Method 2: However you can also use the zip-function like this:will lead to new = [(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]. Note that this is a list of tuples as opposed to the first example.
Thanks so much for the input everyone!zip(*old) worked like a charm, though I'm not entirely sure how...For the second problem, I used this: (I know this is not a good solution, but it worked)
