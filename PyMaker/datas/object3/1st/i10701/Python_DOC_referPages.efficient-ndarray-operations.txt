I'm converting some Matlab code in Python. I need to do some matrix manipulation. My matrix (A) is (right now) a 65x3 matrix. However, the number of rows is variable depending on what step I'm at in the program.In Matlab, the code I'm working on is:The following Python code reproduces the expected output just fine. I'm just curious if there is a better (more Pythonic, faster, etc) way to do this? I'm trying to stick only to basic Python and numpy.Thanks to anyone who is willing to help.
You can use a the T attribute (transposes the array). Also, if using Python 3.5, you can use @ for the dot product (see PEP 465 for details).
