My explaining is horrible so Ill put an example what I meanthis isnt the best piece of code but lets say I wanted to ask the user for a piece of information and they will input 3 different times so how can I take all those 3 value out of the while loop so that they dont get overwriten? If Im not bieng clear please tell me I will try to explain myself better
