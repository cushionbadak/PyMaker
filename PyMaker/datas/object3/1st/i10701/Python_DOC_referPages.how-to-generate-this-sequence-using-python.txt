For example if q = 2, then i have to generate all sequence between [1,1] to [2,2].if q = 3, then generate sequence between [1,1,1] to [3,3,3]. for q = 4, then generate sequence between [1,1,1,1] to [4,4,4,4], etc..example of sequence .for q = 3i have tried this "Python generating all nondecreasing sequences"  but not getting the required output.currently i am using this code,i need another and good way to generate this sequence.
Use itertools.product with the repeat parameter:
I think you want itertools.product(), which does all possible combinations of the iterable elements. itertools.permutations() does not repeat elements, and itertools.combinations() or itertools.combinations_with_replacement() only goes in sorted order (e.g. the first element of the input iterable won't be the last element of the result).See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html
