Natural Text
I want to write a script that takes optional --foo and --bar arguments. It is legal to specify neither of them. It is also legal to specify both. However, specifying just --foo or just --bar should raise a command line parser error.After I call parser.parse_args() I can write code to check this condition and raise the appropriate error, but is there a way already built into argparse to do this, a sort of converse of add_mutually_exclusive_group?
No there isn't that kind of grouping or builtin test, just this one xor test.But it isn't hard to implement the test after parsing - provided your arguments have reasonable defaults (such as the default default None).Another possibility is to define one argument foobar with nargs=2 - it requires 2 values.Yet another is to provide one or both with a good default, such that you don't really care whether the user provides both values or not.
