I'm currently trying to get used to Python and am trying to read a column and count the repeating elements from the strings.What I have so far:print fav_Split gives me:print x gives me:Which is what I want. I'm trying to read those separate vars into an array and simply count them afterwards. But I am getting an error when trying to read into the y arrayCan anyone help me with this? My next steps are counting the repeating elements and displaying the top X (which can be changed based on user input).UPDATE 2:Debugging pic:I don't understand here: y is...not...seeing x as its own element?UPDATE 3:for y += x
First, let me give you an improvement to your original code:Or, even shorter:Okay, now we have the list of two-letter-codes you wanted. The next step is using the collections.Counter class, which seems to be exactly what you need. You pass a list to it, and it computes the occurences of each element and orders it descending by its occurences.To get the n most common elements from your list, you can simply use most_common()which will Return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least.
