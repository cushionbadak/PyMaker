When I need to count the number of positive numbers in a given range (ex, range-->>(1,100)),I use function len(), but it doesn't work and gives:TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()Can someone explain this error, or suggest the correct function to use with this problem.
len(s) takes as an argument a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dicttionary, set, or frozen set).That is, len(s) can only be called - and only makes sense - on one of those data structures. Passing an int will fail with the posted error - it simply doesn't make sense, ints don't have length.TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()As such, something like len(range(1,100)), or len([1,2,3]) works, but len(1) doesn't.In your example, in the comments:s is an int, a different one in the range(10) in every loop, which explains why len(s) fails.P.S. Posting a direct snippet from your code may help the answerers get a better understanding of the problem you are having.Update: From your comments and code it is evident that you are trying to store a list of inputs.When you do the assignment d=float(input()), d will be a different value every loop, a float, hence len(d) fails. What you want is to store all your inputs in a list input_list and then print the len of that. You can store values in a list by append()ing them - input_list.append(d)
You are likely calling len on an individual integer rather than the output of the range. Instead, use it as such:
The easy way to solve this problem is to filter the range and then count the results:
