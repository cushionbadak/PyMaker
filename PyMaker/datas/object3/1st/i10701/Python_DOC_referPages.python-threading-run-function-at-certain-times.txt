I have a set of data likewith the first element of each tuple being a time (in seconds) and the second element being a value.I would like to start a separate thread which tracks the time and at each scheduled time runs some arbitrary function func(value).What is the cleanest way to do this? I could create a Timer object for each scheduled time, but that seems sloppy.edit: You can assume the times are in ascending order
If you need them to be in separate threads then a Timer object or as a commenter pointed out APScheduler. If you want to do the threading manually you could also use sched. They added support for threads in version 3.3. Docs
