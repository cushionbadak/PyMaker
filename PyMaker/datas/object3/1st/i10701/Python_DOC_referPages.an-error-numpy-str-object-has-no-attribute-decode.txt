I tried to run a test on Crab(an open source recommender system) based on python3. Then an error occurred:I tried to use 'decode()' to convert the string, but it's not working:Any help will be appreciated!
The problem is that rating is a string within a string, so when you try casting a string like "b'3.0'" into a float, it gives a valueError because you still have the b in front which cannot be converted into float.I imagine you need the byte encoding in front of the '3.0', so one way would be to evaluate rating to convert it from a string to bytes before typecasting it into a float (beware though, eval can have some safety issues).
