I am new to unit testing using script. I tried to verify login with arguments in post data, but I am getting login page as response and not get logged in.Because of @tornado.web.authenticated i can't access other functions without login and it responding to login page
To test code that uses @authenticated (unless you are testing the redirection to the login page itself), you need to pass a cookie (or whatever form of authentication you're using) that will be accepted by your get_current_user method. The details of this will vary depending on how exactly you are doing your authentication, but if you're using Tornado's secure cookies you'll probably use the create_signed_value function to encode a cookie. 
From documentation:If you decorate post() methods with the authenticated decorator, and the user is not logged in, the server will send a 403 response. The @authenticated decorator is simply shorthand for if not self.current_user: self.redirect() and may not be appropriate for non-browser-based login schemes.So you can use mock do like pointed in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/18286742/1090700Another 403 status will be thrown on POST calls if you have secure_cookies=True app param. If you want to test the code in a non debug fashion, you can also using mock POST actions while keeping the secure_cookies=True application parameter and then just mock the check_xsrf_cookie Handler method as well, like this:
