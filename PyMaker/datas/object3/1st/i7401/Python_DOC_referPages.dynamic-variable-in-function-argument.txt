Let us say I have a function like this:To call this function is easy:But the hard part is that I want to dynamically name the args from variables coming from a list or somewhere else.  And I'd want for myMsg and anotherMessages to be passed from a list (for example, the hard part that I am clueless and I need help with is how to take strings into variables to be inputs of a function).
You can create a dict using the variable and then unpack while passing it to the function:
The ** syntax is a dictionary unpacking.So in your function, args (which is usually kwargs) is a dictionary.Therefore, you need to pass an unpacked dictionary to it, which is what is done when f(a=1, b=2) is called.For instance:Then, you will get kwargs as a dictionary.If you want to do so, you can call the function once for every name as well, by creating a dictionary on the fly and unpacking it, as Moses suggested.
