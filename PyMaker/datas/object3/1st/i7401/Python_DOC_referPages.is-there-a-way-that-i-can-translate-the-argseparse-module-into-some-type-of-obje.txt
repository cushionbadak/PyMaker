I made a python runner program and package like so:The runner program takes in arguments from the command-line and uses argseparse to parse them, like:Then it sends them into my package module like this:   Now I'm making this into a program that does not take in command-line arguments, but I want to keep initialising the PackageObject with that same line.How can I make something like,?
You can provide a list to argparse.parse_args() which does not need to come from the command line:Then you should be able to run the rest of your script as before.
You could define a new class to store the states of the arguments:If you're creating multiple args instances, you may consider using __slots__ in the class definition since you won't be assigning new attributes on the instance, also making the instances ligthweight:
There are several solutions:Make the PackageModule object accept arguments, and unpack the args object PackageModule(**vars(args))Just make a lightweight namedtupleMake a lightweight classPass args as a dict params=vars(args), and substitute for a normal dict
