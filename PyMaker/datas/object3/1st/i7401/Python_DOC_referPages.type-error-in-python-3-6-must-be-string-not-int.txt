I am trying to make a program that can find a definite integral but when i run it I get an error message that i can not figure out even after searching on several websites for the answer. This is my code:Then it displays this error message after I enter some code:Can someone Please help?
Whenever you use the input function in python, it returns a string. To quote the docs (emphasis mine):The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. As you see from the docs, the input() function converts the input to a string and returns it. Thus, you cannot perform operations like += 1 on it as it is a string.To convert a string to an int, you need to use the int() function. Thus, the line of code will be:This will fix your issue as the int() function will cast the string to an int and then you should be able to perform operations like += on them.Side Note: Exponet is a wrong spelling, it is Exponent (note the extra n).
You are reading the Exponet from input and that is always a string, when you try to increment it with exponet += 1 it gives that error. You should modify your input to get an integer ant not a string, so change this lineto this 
if you use python takes it always as string. So to convert it into integer using Here when you input Exponet: 2, Python thinks it is a string but when you try to increment it fails to increment the integer value because of you input string.
Your code is missing self. before the a_over... variable that you set in the equation_parts method. Later, you're referring to this variables using self.a_... which causes the AttributeError to be thrown.
