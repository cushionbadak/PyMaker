Natural Text
I am downloading all of a user's tweets, using the twitter API.When I download the tweets, I encode them in utf-8, before placing them in a CSV file.I'm using python 3The issue is that this creates really weird characters in my files.For example, the tweet which readsGets turned into(I see this when I open the CSV file that I wrote this encoded text to).So my question is, how can I stop these weird characters from being created.Also, if someone can explain what the b' which starts every line, means, that would be super helpful.Here is the full code:
That is not a strange character, that is a RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK (U+2019). You can often see that character in submits done from OSX based browsers.If you need ASCII for everything you can try:If you encode a string in to bytes sequence, and then output that bytes sequence, you should expect the b"..." that indicates a byte sequence and not a normal string.
You are using str.encode(), which turns the string in to a bytes object, hence the b at the beginning of the string.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encodeEDIT: I could not reproduce the UnicodeError from the code you provided. The following works fine for me:resulting in Where exactly does the error get raised and for which string?
You have to give the correct output encoding when writing your csv-file:
