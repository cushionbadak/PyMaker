As ColdSpeed said, you can use "os.path.basename" to truncate a file to its name, but I think what you are refering to is the ability to pycache the data?For Example here is my Directory:You see the pycache folder? that initializes it as a module.Then, you can import a file from that module (for example the staging.txt file and operate on it.) I use the IpConfig.txt File from the assets folder level (or should be) and take a line of information out of it.
