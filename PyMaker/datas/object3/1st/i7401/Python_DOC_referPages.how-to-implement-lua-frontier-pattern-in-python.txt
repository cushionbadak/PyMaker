How to implement Lua frontier pattern%f[set] matches an empty string at any position such that the next character belongs to set and the previous character does not belong to setin Python regex?
You're probably looking for "lookahead" patterns in regular expressions. For example:Yields:From the docs:(?=...) Matches if ... matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the string.   This is called a lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac (?=Asimov) will match  'Isaac ' only if it’s followed by 'Asimov'.  Contra one of the comments, lookahead expressions are not limited to 'fixed length strings', at least insofar as I understand that description. For example:Yields:Here the lookahead is for a fairly expansive sub-pattern of varying length and with embedded wildcards and its own subexpressions.
