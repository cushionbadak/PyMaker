I made 2 programs for show porpose. I would like to import the global variable from the transmitter function into another file, yet the problem that I encounter is that the While true loop also comes along spoiling my whole second program, because the second problem now also starts to show the itiration.Program 1:Program 2:I only need my second program to show the value of 2 once. (2 is the globalvar from file 1)
The short answer is that you can't get only one piece of a module.  from x import y imports x in the same way import x does.  The only difference is that, in the former case, y is added to your current global namespace, and in the latter case, x is.  The docs for import say:The from form ... find[s] the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary ...I am not sure exactly what you are trying to accomplish.  As the commenters noted, you can check for __main__.  However, you might do better to put your variable in its own module, then import that module from both of your existing modules.See also the tutorial.
