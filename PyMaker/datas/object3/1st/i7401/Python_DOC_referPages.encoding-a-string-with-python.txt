I am trying to solve a programming question to convert a string to below form:input: aaaabbbccoutput: a4b3c2My code is like below:But I am getting the below exception :Traceback (most recent call last): File "encode.py", line 30, in   print encode(s)  File "encode.py", line 13, in encode  while s[i] == s[j] :  IndexError: string index out of rangeI am not able to understand the bug here. Can someone please help me?
You could use groupby function:
As others have indicated you are not checking the list bounds in the inner loop. Note that you can do the string conversion with a regular expression (import re) and list comprehension, like this:
Your code is working fine.The only issue being if string has a single letter like aaabbd d1 will not come back.You can try with re as well.
You could use collections Counter
You can convert your string into set. Than you can iterate the set and call the count() for finding number of repetition character.
