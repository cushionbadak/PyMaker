All the packages are available at https://pypi.python.org/pypiClick on the following link to download the corresponding packages:matplotlib - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib
Any search engine would have pointed you to:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pipThere you can download the wheel files, which you can then install using the pip tool locally. If your company prevents access to that site, download the needed packages somewhere else. Be careful to check the dependencies of those packages and also download additional packages.For windows, an alternative is the Unofficial Windows Binaries by Christoph Gohlke.P.S.: sys and warnings are always available.
Python package management toolkit like easy_instsall and pip just download the package folder with executable python code to your local folder which is contained by the module search path and manage the dependency. You could just get the source file of specific module you need and put in your working directory and you are good to goFor example, you could just git clone https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git numpyto put numpy in your project once you download that as a folder in your project (or maybe you'd like to download that with another machine able to connect the internet and copy that folder with an usb drive or something)More over, this manual about the Python library search path maybe help you to understand all the stuff under hookYou should be careful about the dependency stuff by this way though.
I would definately have a look at Anaconda. https://www.continuum.io/downloadsList of packages included:https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/packages/pkg-docsFrom what I can see the only package not included is "warnings".
