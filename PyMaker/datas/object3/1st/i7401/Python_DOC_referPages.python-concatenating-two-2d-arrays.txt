There is a lot about concatenating/appending arrays but I found nothing inbuild for my problem: Input:Output:I dont know how to solve this efficient ( inbuild? )
In vanilla python, this is easily done with a map and zip:The zip combines the two lists element-wise. The map is needed to convert each zipped element to a list.With numpy.... you could've used np.hstack but they've not got the same dimensions, so, to my knowledge this cannot be done efficiently with numpy.
One big advantage of Python is its support for list comprehensions.This is basically a one line loop which produces an array. For your problem - and assuming you safeguarded that A and B always have the same length, you could easily write a single line of code like that:which produces your desired output.
