I believe that you need to convert the dateTime column from int type to string type before you call pd.to_datetime on it.If you get a ValueError about "unconverted data", it will usually tell you that either the string or the format you specified is bad. Try changing '%Y%M%d%H%m%S' into '%Y%m%d%H%M%S'. You can find the documentation on format strings here (scroll all the way to the bottom).
I believe this is what you're looking for using pandas.DataFrame.apply:If you don't like using apply because it's slow (cuz it's a loop) you could still use this:output:
