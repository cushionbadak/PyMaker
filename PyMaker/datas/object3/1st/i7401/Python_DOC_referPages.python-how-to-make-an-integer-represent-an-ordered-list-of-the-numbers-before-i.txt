This question already has an answer here:How can I generate a list of consecutive numbers?                    5 answers                So I've been trying to figure how out how to print an ordered list of numbers that occur before a number, starting from one in python. Let me show you what I mean.Here is my example.Is there any piece of code or built-in function in python that will allow me to do this?  
If you simply want to print the numbers, you can unpack your range() object and use the sep keyword argument to add the commas:For Python 2.x:This answer was inspired by @Grimmy's comment.
You are looking for the range class. Normally a range initializes from a start value to the number before the stop value, so you need to add one to the end:Using a range object has the advantage of storing all the information about the elements in a way that only requires the integers worth of storage. You can iterate over it and test for containment without spelling out all the list elements.
A simple for loopThough you'd have to do a fence-post trick with the comma, so Mad Physicist's response is good.
You can try this:Does the same stuff but might be easier to understand.
