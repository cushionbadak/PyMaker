Write a function integer_type that consumes a value of any type and produces "Even integer" if it is an even integer, "Odd integer" if it is an odd integer, and "Not an integer" otherwise.My code:Everytime I run it, it prints "Not an integer" whatever the value I enter.I tried a different problem with elifs instead and it made no difference. I still obtain the very last "else" return for my print.Write a function off_peak that consumes any type of data and determines if the time is eligible for off peak rates. Your function should produce one of the following outputs: "Off peak", "Peak", and "Not a time". Off-peak rates are based on 24-hour time, for values less than 9 or greater than 17.any help would be greatly appreciated
Your function is correct and does exactly what you want it to do, the problem here is that input() always returns a string, so when you pass its output to integer_type() it sees that it's a string and returns Not an integer.To see this, try using this code:It will print exactly what you want:
I think you should convert the input to an int before comparing:print(integer_type(int(x)))
I'll suppose that you're using Python 3. input always returns a string. What you first want to test is if this string can represent a valid integer.You can simply try to convert it, and you will know that it is invalid if an errors occurs (a ValueError, in this case).If we want the function to accept any type of input, including floats and strings like "3.00", or any object, things get a bit more complicated. You could rewrite your function like this:The input of the function can be a string, an integer, a float, or whatever. Whether it can be converted to a valid integer or not, it will always give the expected result:If you're using Python 2, replace input by raw_input.
