I have the following package/directory structure:And the setup.py file contains the following:How do I now install this and use the classes/functions contained within "code1.py" and "code2.py"? I tried python setup.py install and it seemed to work, but now I have a "dist" and "build" folder in the main "PythonMDK" folder and I can seem to use any of the contained functions. So basically what do I have to do now that I have the "setup.py" file in order to make use of those modules?
For import PythonMDK to expose any of your functions in code1.py, the file PythonMDK/__init__.py must import them like from code1 import myfunction. Then you could do import PythonMDK; PythonMDK.myfunction().See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages, https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages, and https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages
