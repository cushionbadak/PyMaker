It seems that on macOS Python's c_ulong type is 64 bits, instead of the 32 bits that it would be on Windows. From what I've found in my google search, based on this post: Is Python's ctypes.c_long 64 bit on 64 bit systems?It looks like it's because of macOS's memory model. Is there any fix for this?
Just like if you are writing C, if you know that you specifically need a 32 bit unsigned integer, you shouldn't use c_ulong but instead ctypes.c_uint32. This way you can ensure it will be 32 bits no matter the platform you are on.
