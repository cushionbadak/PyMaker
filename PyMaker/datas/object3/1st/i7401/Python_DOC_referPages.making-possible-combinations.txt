This question already has an answer here:How to generate list combinations?                    4 answers                I am trying to make possible combinations of 'AB', like:I'm using itertools.permutations, but its just returning, [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'A')]What would be the procedure to have both ('A','A') and ('B','B') too.Also, here I am talking with input 'AB'. What would be the procedure if I had to make combinations of input 'AB', 'BA' such that the output is [('AB','AB'), ('AB, 'BA'), ('BA', 'BA'), ('BA','BA']).Also, I don't worry about the order.   
The tool from itertools you are looking for is product.This will give all possible arrangements of the specified elements that are of length 2 (specified by the repeat keyword).Both permutations and combinations explicitly state that they do not repeat elements.The function itertools.combinations_with_replacement is close to what you want, which allows repeated elements, but only gives distinct combinations, rather than all permutations.  The function itertools.permutations_with_replacement doesn't exist, because this is exactly what itertools.product gives you.
Apart from what Nielson added, you can also obtain the required result without using itertools,This will produce the desired output.
