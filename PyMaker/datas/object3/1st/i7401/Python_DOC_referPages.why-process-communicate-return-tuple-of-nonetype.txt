Below program, launches subprocess and communicate via pipes,result shows (None, None) instead of (stdout, stderr), where each subprocess is,list.txt is file of websites.Output:Question:Why result shows tuple of NoneType?
You should look at the documentation:communicate() returns a tuple (stdout_data, stderr_data). The data will be strings if streams were opened in text mode; otherwise, bytes.Note that if you want to send data to the processâ€™s stdin, you need to create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE too.As you did not specify any output pipe while creating your Popen object, the returned values are two None while calling communicate().You may try to fix it with:
From Popen.communicate documentation:Similarly, to get anything other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE too.
