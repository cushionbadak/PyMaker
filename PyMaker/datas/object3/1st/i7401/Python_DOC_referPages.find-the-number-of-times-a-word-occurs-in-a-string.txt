So for example if I want to know the number of times hello occurs in this word: hellohellothere, my code will give me 2 which is correct. But if I were to have hellotherehello, my code does not give me 2, which means I think there is something wrong with my second for loop.My code counts the number of letters in the string, and then I divide it by the length of the string to give how many times the string actually occurs, I don't think that really is the problem though. here is the code. 
The other answers recommend the string.count function, and that is how an experienced Python programmer with knowledge of the standard library would do it.  If I look at your approach, however, I see logic errors.Your main loop has an off-by-one error.  The function range(0, n) iterates from 0 to n-1.  In the string 'hellotherehello' this will end the iteration one character before you get to the second occurrence of hello.  What you want is:You are trying to use the variable count for two different purposes: to count the number of successful matches, and to count characters one by one as you search for a match.  When you've already found one match and you begin to look for a second one, your count variable holds the value 1; until you find the first match it's 0.  Much better is to test the characters one at a time for FAILURE rather than SUCCESS, and use Python's for:else: construct.  Inside the loop you will have this:Good luck with learning Python.
Your problem here is that it thinks 'he' in the word 'there' is the beginning of hello and counts towards count. 
Python has a built-in function for this: count
