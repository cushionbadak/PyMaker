Relatively inexperienced Python user here, I was trying to use the readline function for a project in order to read a specific line of an .xyz file.However, no matter what the argument of the readline function I enter, it systematically returns the first line.Any idea what could cause this, and how to fix it?Here is the cube.xyz file:And the bit of code supposed to read it:Which returns:Thanks!
inp.readline(n) returns either the entire line, or the number of bytes in the current line, whichever is lesser. If you want to read by bytes, I suggest you use inp.read(n). Alternatively, use a loop over inpOutput:
Then you'd have lines in a list, which you can index freely.Or if you have a big file, you can use itertools.islice.
