platform.machine()  Returns the machine type, e.g. 'i386'. An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.What are the possible values for this field?
On platforms with os.uname(), this information comes directly from the result of that API call. That is to say, platform.machine() returns the same thing as the uname -m command.Thus, the answer really depends on the kernel's implementation of the uname(2) system call. For that, see this question and answer:Possible values for `uname -m` (utsname.machine)
