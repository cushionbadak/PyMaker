I am currently trying to sort two Python dictionaries into an HTML array such as:I wanted to sort these two dictionaries in order to get the '456' in DictB equals to the key 'value' in DictA.Note: I used other dictionaries than DictA and DictB, it was just an example. But it fits my problem.In my views.py, I define my two dictionaries such as:then I pass them into the template.html via the context:Thus, in my template, it will print an array with the headers (DictA) and the datas (DictB).In my template I make this code:And the datas are in another for loop:The result is kinda such as follow:name equals 456 (instead of the name of the form)geom equals test (instead of my coordinate)etc.It doesn't match the right header. I was thinking about making two for loops with an if statement in it:But I get an error as dataValues['name'] could not be parsed.The rest of the code is in Javascript:The rest of the code is in javascript :
Here is the right answer :I marked it as solved. And create a new topic. Thanks all.
