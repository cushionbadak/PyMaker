call returns the return code of your script. You need to get the output of the process:notes:if process fails you'll get an exceptionyou don't need shell=TrueTo get the output no matter what you could use Popen instead for instance like this:The added ,stderr=STDOUT allows to get standard error in the log as well.or from python 3.5 you can use subprocess.run() instead of Popen
