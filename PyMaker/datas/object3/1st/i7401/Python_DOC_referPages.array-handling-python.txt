I am a beginner in Python. I try to store the max value of two array in an another array. The length of array is known so I used c=[]*len(a)I got the following output, which is correct.If I have arrays likeHow should I proceed this to store the max value of each elements in an another array? Thank for your help in advance.
You can use zip() to zip together each list and each sublist to compare them element-wise:Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables.Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. [...].If using NumPy, you can use numpy.maximum():Element-wise maximum of array elements.Compare two arrays and returns a new array containing the element-wise maxima. [...].
In single line solution you can use map and lambda. For Example in this case the solution can beSince a and b both are array of arrays the first lambda input are arrays and then next map takes the maximum of the individual element.
To handle multi-dimensional arrays you can use two variables i and j which represents your rows and columns. Output:I have assumed c is a 1 dimensional array.
