I'm novice to Python and I am trying to extract a string from another string with specific format, for example:I have original string: -I need to extract exactly the string ABC1234 (must include three first characters and followed by four digits).
You can use the curly brace repetition qualifiers {} to match exactly three alphabetic characters and exactly four numeric characters:Explanation of regex:[a-zA-Z]: Match any letter upper case of lower case...{3}: Exactly three times. And...\d: Any digit character...{4} Exactly four times.
If you now the exact coordinates of the string you can use something like this:a python string has a slice method.
