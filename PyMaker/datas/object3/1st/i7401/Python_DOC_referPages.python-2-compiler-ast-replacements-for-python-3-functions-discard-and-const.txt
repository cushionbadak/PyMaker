Natural Text
I am trying to convert an older library that maps dependencies called snakefood over to Python 3.  I have 2 parts I can't figure out what to substitute as I can't find documentation on what either function does - from compiler.ast import Discard, Const  I can't seem to find an equivalent in Python 3 in the  ast library.  Here are the function calls from Python 2, see both here being used in isinstance() calls:Apologies for not understanding this stuff, I just learned about AST calls trying to use this library.  Much appreciated.
Discard (took me a while to figure out what it does) is now Expr (though this includes more things than previously)I got this hint from the source of compiler/codegen.py:Const has been replaced with several different types which represent various constants, notably Num, Str, JoinedStr, and a few others.  The documentation for all the ast types can be found here.
