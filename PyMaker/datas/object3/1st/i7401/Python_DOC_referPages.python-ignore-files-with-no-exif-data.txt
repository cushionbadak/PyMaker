I am trying to do a mass extraction of gps exif data, my code below: Code sourceWhich is run like: This works fine for one photo, so I've used glob to iterate over all photos in a file: Which works fine, as long as every photo in the file is a) an image and b) has gps data. I have tried adding a pass in the _get_if_exist function as well as my file iteration, however, neither same to have had any impact and I'm still receiving KeyError: 'GPSInfo'Any ideas on how I can ignore photos with no data or different file types? 
A possible approach would be writing a small helper function that first checks, if the file is actually an image file and as a second step checks if the image contains EXIF data.I found that PIL does not work every time with .png files that do contain EXIF information when using _getexif(). So instead I check for the key exif in the info dictionary of an image.
