I have a pandas df (5568, 108) where the column of interest is df.Age, which has some NaNs (303). I want to keep the NaNs but drop some of the outliers.df.drop(df[df.Age<18]) and df.drop(df[df.Age>90]).I tried But this results in TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'float' and 'numpy.float64'Any thoughts on how I can achieve this?
There is an operator precedence issue. Wrap parentheses. (df.loc[index, 'Age'] > 0.0) & ..., etc. The & is evaluated before the > otherwise, leading to the expression 0.0 & df.loc[index, 'Age'].
I think you need boolean indexing with between and isnull for filtering, what is most common as drop by conditions:
