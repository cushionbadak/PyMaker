I'm trying to make a simple website demo and I have some trouble editing the html using python. The following is the string I defined to store the html (not complete because it's too long). I want to write a function that will throw a error under a certain condition, but I don't know how to insert a line in the string "page".I want to insert the line "There is an error" in the blank between these two lines:Note there are two of this group in the string. How can I insert "There is an error" in the first group using Python? Thanks. 
python uses C style format strings.alternatively, you can use python string.format as see (https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html);jinja is an excellent template engine if you've got the time.  Genshi (https://genshi.edgewall.org/wiki/GenshiTutorial) is worth looking into as well.for Jinja2:in python
