So, here is my Shoping Cart code, im stuck with this code, i fix one error, another pop out. So now i get TypeError: getTotal() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)Output i get:Every tip, every help is welcome, thanks,
There a several errors in your classes.First, in Python, you can ger rid of getXXX() methods, especially in your case. So, you can redefine Item and User classes as: In the Cart class, that code does not what you want:It will append the integer 1 into the current cart. To do as you would, take into account the current item to add:Next, getTotal cannot work as it is:Finally, numItems cannot work too (!). If you want to find the carta length (as carta is a list), do that:Final code with fixes and a right print statement:We can do a lot more pythonic, but it seems you are learning Python, so try to understand that snippet correctly and then try to optimize, if wanted and needed. And read that tutorial :)
The class Cart already wraps the list of items contained in the cart. You don't need to pass any argument to getTotal. The call is correct; the definition is not.addItem does need an argument, but it's the item to add to the cart, not the cart itself. Your current implementation only adds the number 1 to the cart on each call, not the first argument.Likewise, numItems just needs to return the length of self.carta, not take any additional arguments.Python isn't Java. You don't need to define separate functions for simple attribute access (as I've hinted by my definition of get_total above, accessing item.price directly).Finally, you want to either return (not print) a string from kart, or dispense with the final=.../print(final) pair. 
Well, in your print you call kart.getTotal() but in the definition of Cart, you have this method def getTotal(self,carta). So when you call it you have to pass 2 arguments. You only pass one wich is kart. So if i understood properly what you're trying to do you have to change the method getTotal to def getTotal(self) as you don't use the parameter carta
