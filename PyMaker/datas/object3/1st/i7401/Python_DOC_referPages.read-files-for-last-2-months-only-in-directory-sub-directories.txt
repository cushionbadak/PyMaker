I have > 6 months of files in a folder and sub folders, currently I can open & read all the files and write it to a csv file, however, i would like to open and read files that were created only in last 2 months.This is the code that I am using to open and read all files-
You can use os.path.getctime() to get your file's timestamp and then you can compare it to a date two months in the past, i.e.:Since you've tagged your question with windows I assume you're using Windows - getting the actual creation date is a bit trickier on other platforms (especially Linux).
