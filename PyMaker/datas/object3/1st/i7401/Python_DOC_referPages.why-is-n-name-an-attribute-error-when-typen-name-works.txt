I am getting an error as n has no attribute __name__:But n is an instance of the int class, and int.__name__ gives a result, so why does n.__name__ throw an error. I expected that because n is an instance of class int, it should have access to all attributes of that class. 
__name__ is not an attribute on the int class (or any of its base classes):It is an attribute on the metaclass, type (it is a descriptor, so is bound to the int class when accessed on int):Just like attribute look-up on an instance can also look at the class, attribute lookup on a class looks for attributes on the metaclass.Attributes on the metaclass are not available on instances of the class.
