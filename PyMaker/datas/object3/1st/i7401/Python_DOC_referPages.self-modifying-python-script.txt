Natural Text
I want to create python script which can modify code in that script itself using Python Language Services or using any other way.e.g. A script which keep track of its count of successfull execution  On successful execution of this script code should get changed to    Simple approach came to my mind was to open __file__ in write mode and do requried modification using reguler expessions etc. But that did not work I got exception io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable. Even if this approach would be working then it would be very risky because it can spoil my whole script. so I am looking for solution using Python Language Services. 
A python script is nothing more than a text file. So, you are able to open it as an external file and read & write on that. (Using __file__ variable you can get the exact name of your script):
Yes, you can use the language services to achieve self-modification, as in following example:So, by new dynamically generated code you can replace stuff contained in the original source file, without modifying the file itself.
