I have a 2D list of characters in this fashion:What's the most pythonic way to print the list as a whole block? I.e. no commas or brackets:
There are a lot of ways. Probably a str.join of a mapping of str.joins:
Like this:
If you're looking for Pythonic then you surely need a generator comprehension:
Best way in my opinion would be to use print function. With print function you won't require any type of joining and conversion(if all the objects are not strings).If you're on Python 2 then print function can be imported using from __future__ import print_function.
