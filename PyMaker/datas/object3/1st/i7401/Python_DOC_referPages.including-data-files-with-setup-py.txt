I'm having trouble including data files in my setup.py script. My package is setup as follows:I want to include the my_data_file.csv file when installing so that it can be read by access_data.py. To do so I used the package_data keyword in setuptools:I also included the file in MANIFEST.in:setup.py seems to run fine and doesn't throw any errors. However, when I import the package I get a file not found error because my_data_file.csv is missing. I have tried referencing other stack overflow questions (particularly this one) but can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. How can I get setup.py to include the necessary data files?
If it is listed in setup.py's package_data (correctly) you shouldn't need to include it in MANIFEST.in (as it will be included automatically)In your case, the error is with your package_data line, the paths are relative to the namespace's rootIn your case it should be:Also note that the key in package data is the dotted module path (it's not super relevant for this toy case however).
