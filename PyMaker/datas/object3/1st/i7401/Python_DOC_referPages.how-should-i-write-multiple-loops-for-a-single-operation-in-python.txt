I'm new to learning python and I really need to get this job done, and I really dont know how to look for an answer in what it seems to be a big giant ocean of information.I'm working with a PDB parser and I have the following code:with this result:3caq | {'1': {'synonym': 'delta(4)-3-ketosteroid 5-beta-reductase, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member d1 ', 'chain': 'a, b', 'misc': '', 'molecule': '3-oxo-5-beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase', 'ec_number': '1.3.1.3','ec': '1.3.1.3', 'engineered': 'yes'}}The thing is that I'm not working with just a single file (defined under "filename") but I have hundreds of files from where I need to extract the "header", and only retain the "compound" variable of said header. I know I have to write loops for that to be done and I tried the following:then I feed the parser but I get an error. I'm pretty sure that the loop is not correctly written.So, I'll be really thankful if I can get some help with how to correctly write that loop, either with a resource I can check, or with the right commands.Best regards.
You're getting an error because you're passing a list (["3caq.pdb"]) when get_structure() expects a string ("3caq.pdb").Here is how you can support multiple files:To make your code even better, I would write it as a separate function:
Clear understanding would help you sort this out. You need to iterate through many structures so good choice with the for loop. I would suggest you use a list instead of set to store the structures and filenames. Now you can iterate by the length of the structures.Let me know if this works for you.
