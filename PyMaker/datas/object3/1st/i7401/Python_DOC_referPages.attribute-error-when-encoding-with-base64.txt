I have two keys(secret key and public key) that are generated using curve25519. I want to encode the two keys using base64.safe_b64encode but i keep getting an error. Is there any way I can encode using this?This is my code:This is the error I got:
The reason you get this error is because the base64 library does not have a function named safe_base64encode. What do you even mean by safe_base64encode? Why do you want to encode both of your keys with base64? there is a urlsafe encoding function and there is the regular base64 encoding function.orThe latter one will just have a different alphabet with - instead of + and _ instead of / so it's urlsafe. I'm not sure what you want to do but refer to the docs here
The error is telling you that the function safe_b64encode does not exist in the base64 module. Perhaps you meant to use base64.urlsafe_b64encode(s)?
