I am trying to test if the decimal representation of a certain number contains the digit 9 at least twice, so I decided to do something like that:But Python always responds with "TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly". What am I doing wrong here? Is there actually a smarter method to detect how often a certain digit is contained in the decimal representation of an integer?
Your problem is here:You need to make 9 a string literal, rather than an integer:As for a better way to count the occurrences of 9 in your string, use str.count():
You need quotes around the nine.
