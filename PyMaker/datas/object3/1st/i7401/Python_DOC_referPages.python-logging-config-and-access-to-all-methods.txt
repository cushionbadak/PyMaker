I have enabled logging to python code.However I am not able to use any of other logging methods. Other methods don't print anything.Is this related to level=logging.INFO ? Which level should i set so it could work with all logging methods?Thanks for help.
The whole point of logging.DEBUG level is so that your, or any code you use, can log debug messages - if you don't want debug messages set your level to something higher.If you still want to print debug messages but want to suppress messages from some of the modules you're using, like the requests and urllib3, set the level of their loggers to something higher than logging.DEBUG, e.g.:
You should use level=logging.DEBUG to log everything.But logging.error should print the error message even with level=logging.INFO
The python logging module have multiple level of configurationDEBUGINFOWARNINGERRORCRITICALThis logs that will be shown are in the sorted order shown above depending on what level you choose. It will show the selected stage and any other stage "levelled above" the selected stage.For example, if you choose INFO, the logs will show for all INFO/WARNING/ERROR logs except DEBUG.This helps in the way that you can sort them by environment variables according to the environment you are currently in, such as you can set it to DEBUG when you are in Development mode, and then set it to WARNING when you are in Production mode.You can read more about it in the link belowPython Logging ModuleAnd finally, to give a concrete answer to your question. You should set it to DEBUG to see all the logs.Hopefully this gives you a better idea on what the python logging module is for!Cheers!Max
DEBUG Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.INFO Confirmation that things are working as expected.WARNING   An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’).  The software is still working as expected.ERROR Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.CRITICAL  A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.The default level is WARNING, which means that only events of this  level and above will be tracked, unless the logging package is  configured to do otherwise.when you set you level to info you must get info,warning,error and critical logsIf you want to log all of level set your level to logging.DEBUG
