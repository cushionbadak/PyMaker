I have a list, a:and need to duplicate some values with the suffix _ind added this way (order is important):I tried:I think my solution is a bit over-complicated. Is there some better, more pythonic solution?
You could make it a generator:You could also do it with itertools.product, itertools.starmap or itertools.chain or nested comprehensions but in most cases I would prefer a simple to understand, custom generator-function.With python3.3, you can also use yield from—generator delegation—to make this elegant solution just a bit more concise:
It can be shortened a little bit by moving the options to the inner for loop in the list comprehension:
Another alternative with splicing (Python2.x, 3.x):
You can use itertools.chain():Output:
Before list comprehensions and generators were invented/became widespread, people used to think much simpler1:* I don't mean that those constructs/tools are evil, just wanted to point out that there is a simple solution.
Since you asked for "simple", I thought I'd throw this in (albeit, maybe not the pythonic way):
