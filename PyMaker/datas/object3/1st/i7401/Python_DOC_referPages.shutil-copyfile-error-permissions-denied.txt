Natural Text
I have worked through a number of other threads on this, but not of their solutions seem to work here, that or I am not understanding properly, and would love your help. I am getting a:This is the general code i started with.I have also varied this a little bit based on other threads, specifically replacing summary_file with the actual text and also adding \ to the end of working directory without success. Really don't know what I'm missing here. I know that the Documentation is looking for complete paths, but I believe I am satisfying that requirement. What am I missing here? Note: there is a desire to use copyfile over copy due to the speed increase. 
From the documentation:You can't just use os.getcwd() as the destination.
you should be the complete target file name for destinationdestination = pathdirectory + filename.* I use this code fir copy wav file with shutil :
