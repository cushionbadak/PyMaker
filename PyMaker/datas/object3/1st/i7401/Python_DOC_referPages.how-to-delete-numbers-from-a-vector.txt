I have this vector I want to remove the multiples of 2 and 3. How would I do this? I tried to do this but I doesn't work:
Given that you use NumPy already you can use boolean array indexing to remove the multiples of 2 and 3:The (arr % 2 != 0) creates a boolean mask where multiples of 2 are False and everything else True and likewise the (arr % 3 != 0) works for multiples of 3. These two masks are combined using & (and) and then used as mask for your arr
I assume by vector you refer to the tuple you set up with the (). You can use a list comprehension with two conditions, using the modulo oprerator you can read up on here:Returns [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19]This returns a standard Python list; if you want np arrays or sth, just update your question. 
You could use the outcome of the modulos 2 and 3 directly for filtering in a list comprehension. This keeps items whose mod 2 and mod 3 values gives a number other than a falsy 0:You can make it more verbose if the above is not intuitive enough by making the conditionals explicitly test for non zero outcomes:
