I have researched this whole website on how to install beautiful soup. I have installed seleniumI am currently trying to pull jobs which use Python, also to include the details of the job like location, i,e; job title, salary(if posted), etc.. off the internet as a final in a html table. Dont chew me up completely.. give me a little break, I am learning as I go. I understand I need to seperate the paragraphs by , but how to go about it, is where I am getting stuck. This is what I have so far.I get this as an error:Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/Devel/BSoup4.py", line  8, in       table = re.find_all('') AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'find_all'Please help. Thank you in advance! 
Per the docssyntax is re.findall() not find_all
