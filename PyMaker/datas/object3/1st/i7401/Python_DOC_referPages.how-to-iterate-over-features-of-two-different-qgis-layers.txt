ANSWER : Thanks to @nils-werner and @goyo for pointing me in the right direction : I needed to pass the Move iterTwo = layerTwo.getFeatures() right before for feat in iterTwo : as such : I have two layers, which I want to compare:This code runs correctly on the first iteration of LayerOne, but then iterates only over the first layer without checking the second layer. The result looks like this :Why does my function only iterate over the first feature of my first layer?More precisely, I'm looking for a result like this which works in the python console:
I would use itertools.product to iterate over both featuresfeatures is a tuple with the features of both layers. If you need more features except the id, you could transpose these with something like zipped_attributes = zip(*feat.attributes() for feat in features) and access the tuple with ids with id = zipped_attributes[0]
