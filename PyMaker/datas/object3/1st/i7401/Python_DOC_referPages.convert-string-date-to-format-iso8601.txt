I have a date of format : 13 July 2017 22:00 that I would like to convert to an ISO date format of type 2017-07-13T22:00:00+0100.So far I have managed to do this: datetime_object = datetime.strptime(date_start, '%d %B %Y %H:%M')where date_start = '13 July 2017 22:00'this returns 2017-07-13 22:00:00 ... close but not the same.How can I convert it to the type I need ?
Use datetime.isoformat():Note that this produces a timestamp in a "local time zone" (since your initial date has no time zone information attached).
