I have two way to access class method into instance method. orMy question is which one is the best and why??If both ways are not same, then which one I use in which condition?
self.task(10) is definitely the best.First, both will ultimately end in same operation for class instances:__class__ is a special attribute that is guaranteed to exist for an class instance object and is is the class of the object (Ref: Python reference manual / Data model / The standard type hierarchy)Class instances ...Special attributes: __dict__ is the attribute dictionary; __class__ is the instanceâ€™s classcalling a classmethod with a class instance object actually pass the class of the object to the method (Ref: same chapter of ref. manual):...When an instance method object is created by retrieving a class method object from a class or instance, its __self__ attribute is the class itselfBut the first is simpler and does not require usage of a special attribute.
