Natural Text
I'm writing a scrapy web crawler that saves the html from the pages that I visit and I'm uploading them to S3. Since they are uploading to S3, there's no point in keeping a local copySpider classpipelines.pyI read in the python docs that I can create a NamedTemporaryFile: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFileI'm a little fuzzy on when it gets deleted. If I were to use a NamedTemporaryFile how could I delete the file after successful upload to S3?
Extending on my comment:You could use the io.StringIO method to create a text buffer instead of saving/reading/deleting a file.It would be something like this:Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html
