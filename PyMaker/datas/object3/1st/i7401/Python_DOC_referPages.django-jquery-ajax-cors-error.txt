I get this error in the console when I try to post data with ajax. This data is supposed to be confirmed at this url and then I should get a response from it containing more data.I am using django-cors-headers as middleware to add the headers. I followed all the config instructions. My settings.py:The ajax call:The data and url is declared above this and that part is fine. I only get the error alert everytime I submit it.My packages:I am on Windows 10.EDIT: I added the csrfSafeMethod for ajax. I don't know if this might have something to do with it?. This code is provided by djangoproject here docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/csrfEDIT2: I ended up sending an ajax call internally so then I did the cross domain stuff with django using urllib. This helped me a lot with posting data cross domain.
As per the documentation: CorsMiddleware should be placed as high as possible, especially before  any middleware that can generate responses such as Django's  CommonMiddleware or Whitenoise's WhiteNoiseMiddleware. If it is not  before, it will not be able to add the CORS headers to these  responses.I would recommend you to put it as the first middleware (highest) among all the present middlewares.Reference: https://github.com/ottoyiu/django-cors-headers
