i have vals = [1.0, 0.0, 3.4, 0.0] and I want to avoid multiplying by zeroif i use reduce(operator.mul, iterable) - i get 0.0. Also for reduce(lambda x, y : x * y, val) tooHow can I add the minimum conditions for variables so that only get greater than zero. But if the array was completely out of zero elements, then it returned 0. Zero element from an array can not be deletedSo for vals = [1.0, 0.0, 3.4, 0.0] - return 3.4for vals = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] - return 0
You could remove 0s from the list. If the list becomes empty, return 0, the product otherwise:Note that from a mathematical point of view, the product of an empy list should probably be 1. In that case, you could write :
if you use numpy arrays you can filter out the zero values:
Another option:
Combining functools.reduce (with initiator value 1) and filter functions:
Just filter out 0.0 values with filter
