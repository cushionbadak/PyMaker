I am trying to upload to dropbox an Excel sheet with multiple tabs made with pandas and xlsxwriter. Not very big files, just around 5MB. I am using the dropbox module for Python 3I am doing:I read in the docs that files_upload expects a bytes object. I am getting the error: Type Error: Invalid file: <pandas.io.excel__XlsxWriter object at 0x000000000071C48>Is this error because I am not supplying the file in the needed format? How can I do this upload so I don't get a type error?

So renaming your variables to better represent what they are and using the .path attribute of the ExcelWriter instance:
