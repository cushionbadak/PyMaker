Hi I would like to compare two list that are different lengths and print a sorted table with items that are missing in each table. I am partially able to accomplish this and print the values that are missing in list_2.  But I am unable to also print the values that are missing in list_1 from list_2, the letter 'z'. How can I perform this to get the desired output below?Current Output:Desired Output:
One solution could be using a third list that contains all the elements of the two original lists. Then we could sort the new list and while iterating over it, we could check the existence of elements of the third list in the original ones. Actually making the third list a set would be better. Following the suggestion from Patrick Haugh, we should convert the original lists into sets too before the iteration. Thus the process will be more efficient. Why? Follow this post. Which is faster and why? Set or List?Output:
Using an OrderedDict seems to do the job:Output:
You can do the same using list comprehension!I've broke down the comprehension for better understanding!
