I am a beginner in Python and cannot understand the below code. Somebody please explain the execution flow.The Question is to enter a number 'N' and calculate N+NN+NNN.
It simply does the task of the question- TO ENTER A NUMBER 'N' AND CALCULATE 'N+NN+NNNSo first line it stores the input number in a variable 'a'.Then in next line it simply passes the value of a as an integer to n1.In the next line(as the question wants NN of the input number N)it just uses %s token to insert it as a string so a now becomes aa then it converts it to integer by using the int() method. Same goes with line 3.Then the print line just prints the sum of the three values n1,n2 and n3.
Your code does the following.Line 1 -  It displays 'Input the integer:" and stores the input in variable a.Line 2 -  n1 stores the value of variable a.Line 3-   n2 stores the value of variable 'aa' as integer.Line 4 -  n3 stores the value of variable 'aaa' as integer.Line 5 -  It adds the values present in n1, n2, n3 and prints it.  Here %s is the formatting string which is replaced by the value present at the end after % sign. For more details on this, visit here 
You can achieve same with many approach below is another attempt to it:You can learn more at official documentation of string formatting
The code you're showing is a very clumsy way of doing the sum of numbers composed of 1 to 3 digits of a number.Just for fun, with a generator comprehension fed to sum, and using string multiplication to generate a string composed of the same digit/number 1 to 3 times:
