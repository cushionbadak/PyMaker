This question already has an answer here:Multiple repeated `in` keyword [duplicate]                    3 answers                Why does the second print statement output False?
in and is are comparison operators in Python, the same in that respect as, say, < and ==.  In general,is treated asexcept that expr2 is evaluated only once.  That's why, e.g.,works as expected.  However, it applies to any chained comparison operators.  In your example,is treated asThe seq is True part is False, so the whole expression is False.  To get what you probably intended, use parentheses to change the grouping:Click here for the docs.
Your statement item in seq is True is internally evaluated as (item in seq) and (seq is True) as shown below(seq is True) is False and therefore your statement outputs False.
The answer below is not correct. The comment explains it an i verified: TypeError: argument of type 'bool' is not iterablePrevious answerI believe it is evaluating seq is True (which evaluates to the bool False), then evaluating item in False (which evaluates to False). Presumably you mean print (item in seq) is True (which evaluates to True)?
