Say I have a csv file, each entry is with a unique ID and a category name. Entries of each category will appear at least k times as specified in the title. Now I want to select the first k entries of each category (I don't know how many categories there are)Exampleoriginal tableif k = 2expected output tableIs there a way to do this in Python (like using pandas, etc.)? Currently I haven't came up with an idea to achieve this ... And I didn't find the solution after bunches of search. Only found these using SQL in database and that's not what I want. Thanks! 
Oh just found this, use pandas, it works!
Use a dictionary to keep track of the categories and how often they've been seen: 
if your input files is sorted by those categories you could use itertools.groupby:this results in (you probably have to replace StringIO with your input/output files)zip(items, range(k)) stops after k items have been reached or items is exhausted - whichever comes first.
