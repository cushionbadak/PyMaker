I'm currently working with python3, and my project requires captcha generation. my goal is to generate the captcha then return it as base64 so it can be served in JSON to the client.However i'm having trouble converting it to a base64 string :returns the error: I'm not entirely sure why ? could someone help me understand why it won't convert ? Thanks for any help :)
