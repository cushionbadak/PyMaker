I'd like to understand what's the cause of this totally unexpected change of behaviour and how it could be implemented. I come from JS world and this is very likely to be impossible to implement in any way..Calling a fn by traversing an object gets a different result from when this object is first assigned to a new variable:This is really disturbing because in any language I've worked with this would execute likewise.BTW, this is a regular django model but I'm more interested in knowing what kind of language resources can be used to accomplish such effect.To better explain why I got into this, I was trying to do a regular save on the profile model by doing:And it didn't worked, but doing:worked just fine.
You have to save a model object if you make changes to it otherwise it won't reflect.The line belowIt does not load new data from database So that's why you see this behaviour
About the python language resource that allows this behavior, you can check this:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#propertyBasically, django uses this to abstract the database queries and does not behave as a regular object in your example.
