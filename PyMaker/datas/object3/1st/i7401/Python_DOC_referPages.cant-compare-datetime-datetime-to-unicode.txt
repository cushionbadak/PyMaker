I need to compare my input time with current time. If my input time is older than 5 days, I will do d = X_value. Otherwise, d = Y_value. The format of my input time like this:my view.py looks like this:I am getting TypeError:can't compare datetime.datetime to unicode. How do I convert my_input_tine and five_dys_ago into same format so I can compare?
datetime.now() will return the date down to seconds.So to add to @thaavik 's answer you could do something like this to compare more accurately:
Try with this and tell me
Use datetime.strptimeyou can also make setting d more concise:d = X_value if t < five_days_ago else Y_value
