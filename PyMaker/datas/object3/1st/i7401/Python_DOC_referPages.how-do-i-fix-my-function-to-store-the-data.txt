My function runs URLcrazy and I figured out it is not storing the output into any variables and I cannot figure it out. The tmp variable shown is not storing the output into that list. How I can fix this to store the data executed. I am trying to get the output of URLcrazy ran against all the domains in the loop and be able to slice the ouptut. I think the way URLcrazy is outputting data I am unable to format the data in another function. Which I need to be able to do in order to store information in a database.
