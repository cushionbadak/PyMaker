I got a programm that let's you choose color in the HSV space (for OpenCV). The first part, is about the creation of a dictionnary that contain some predefined colors :Some line under it, a function is defined :My question is, how could I make a programm that ask the users a color name and 6 different HSV parameters (Low and High), and that add this new color to the dictionnary permanently.The goal is that if I close the programm, and open it 10 days later, I still got this new color that was added last time.In fact, I don't really know how I should save the color data, and how I can access it.Anyhelp would be priceless,Thanks !
I would just use pandas to create a .csv file for that dictionary so something like:Then to read the csv it's as simple as 
You need some way to preserve the data once the program exits. The easiest way to do this is to save the dictionary as a json file, and read it if the file exists.At the top of your program, you would check if this file exists, and read it.The atexit makes sure that when your program exits, the new data is written to the file and saved for the next time.
