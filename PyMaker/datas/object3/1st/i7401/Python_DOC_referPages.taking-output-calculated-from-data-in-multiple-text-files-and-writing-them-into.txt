Natural Text
I am calculating values(numbers) from two numbers in differing columns of a text file. Then I am iterating over multiple text files to do the same calculation. I need to write the output to different columns of a CSV file where each column corresponds to the calculations obtained from an individual text file. I more or less know how to iterate over different files but I don't know how to tell Python to write to a different column. Any guidance is appreciated.
You can use the fact that zip provides lazy iteration to do this pretty efficiently. You can define a simple generator function that yeilds a calculation for every line of the file it is initialized with. You can also use contextlib.ExitStack to manage your open files in a single context manager:The output in the CSV will be in the same order as the file names in input_files.
