I'm trying to grab some data from a XML file that I generated after I did a network scan in my test environment. The XML file that I got back gave me an enormous amount of information which I want to filter.The only systems I'm interested in are the systems with the state "up" Below I posted a part of the XML file that I'm using, it's far too large to post it entirely.Could anyone help me show how I can get only the hosts with the state "up"?
It looks like you should be able to get the hosts with the following xpathIf you want to get the addresses you could use
This finds all <host> tags which have a <status state="up"> child.(found examples on Python docs)
Question: ... how I can get only the hosts with the state "up"?  Note: Your Example XML is invalid for the following Reasons:  Additonal <!DOCTYPE nmaprun> could be only one!  Missing closing </ports>  Missing closing </host> Qutput:  Tested with Python: 3.4.2
