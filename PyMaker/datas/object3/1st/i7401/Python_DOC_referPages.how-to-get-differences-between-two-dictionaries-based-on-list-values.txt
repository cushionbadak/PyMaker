Assume you have tow dictionary A and B:How can you get differences between A and B values in new dictionary? Difference meaning A - B => for example for 'a' key is  [5, 3] - [4,6] result is [1, -3]
I assume you mean A - B and only on keys that exist in both. These are a lot of assumptions but your question is a bit vague..How about this:If you do not care whether the keys exist in both and want to simply "subtract" B go with .get() and zip_longest from itertools with a default parameter of 0 like so:
How about this? it adds any values in B missing from A and if the key is not missing it subtracts the sum of the value in B from the sum of the value in A:results:
