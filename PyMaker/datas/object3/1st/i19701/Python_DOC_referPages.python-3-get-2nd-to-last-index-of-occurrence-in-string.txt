Natural Text
I have a string abcdabababcebc How do I get the index of the second-to-last occurrence of b? I searched and found rfind() but that doesn't work since it's the last index and not the second-to-last.I am using Python 3.
Here's one way to do it:This uses the optional start and end parameters to look for the second occurrence after the first occurrence has been found.Note: This does not do any sort of sanity checking, and will blow up if there are not at least 2 occurrences of pattern in the text.
Enumerate all the indices and choose the one you want
