Natural Text
I am doing text processing. I need the PyEnchant library for verifying if a particular word in the text is a valid English word. However, it's only available for the 32 bit installation of Python. I need the 64 bit Python for handling memory issues with large text files. Is there a way that I can install PyEnchant for the 64-bit Python? If not, what other library can I use to accomplish the similar task? I looked into the NLTK's wordnet but read that the functionality is not as good as PyEnchant.
If you find it absolutely essential to have PyEnchant, you could download the Source code here and then manually install it by putting it in whatever directory you prefer and then runningThis should work, and should be compatible with people who installed it normally.
