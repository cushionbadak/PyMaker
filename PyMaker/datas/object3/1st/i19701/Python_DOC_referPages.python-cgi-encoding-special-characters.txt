This prints "Test: Â£17" when run from the local console, but only prints "Test: " when run from the web browser. How can I rectify the issue when loaded through the browser? Thanks!
Python will encode unicode values to bytes when printing to the console. Encode explicitly when sending to a browser, by writing directly to sys.stdout:Note that HTTP headers should use a \r\n (carriage return, newline) combo, really. I've also added the encoding used to the Content-Type header so the browser knows how to decode it again.For HTML, you really want to use character entity references instead of Unicode code points:at which point you could also just use ASCII as your encoding.If you really, really, really want to use print(), then re-open stdout with the correct encoding:You could simplify that somewhat with functools.partial():then use utf8print() without the extra keywords:Also see the Python Unicode HOWTO for details on how Python sets output encoding, as well as this question here on Stack Overflow about printing and encoding.
