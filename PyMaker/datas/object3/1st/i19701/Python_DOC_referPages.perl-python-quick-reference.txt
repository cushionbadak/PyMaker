I am reasonably fluent in writing perl / python scripts, but still while writing code, I find myself frequently using google to look up the exact order of operands of some built-in function, or the exact name of some feature I know exists. While google works reasonably well, it does take some searching, and about half the time, the reference page doesn't have the right examples that I need. Does anyone know of any good quick reference for perl or python that would have most of the important usage information and basic examples in one place ? Should I make my own ? Or do most people use IDEs and don't need this kind of help ? (I use vim, BTW).Thanks!
Most well written python code should have docstrings that provide information on modules and functions simply by entering help into the interpreter.
For Perl, it's perldoc
For perl, if you want something at your elbow you can't do better than the Perl Reference Guide / Perl Pocket Reference by Johan Vromans. Print out the PDF and staple it into a booklet, or just pick it up at your local bookstore. (Let's face it, a one-page quick reference is not nearly enough for perl).It got me through many years of perl use... till I switched to python :-)For python, incidentally, I just google the docs on docs.python.org-- or here on stackoverflow; python's syntax being what it is, when I look something up I'm usually after a more in-depth description than you can get out of a quick-reference card.
