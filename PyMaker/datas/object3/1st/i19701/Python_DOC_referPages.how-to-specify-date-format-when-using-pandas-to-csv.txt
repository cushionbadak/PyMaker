The default output format of to_csv() is:I cannot figure out how to output only the date part with specific format:or date and time in two separate columns in the csv file:The documentation is too brief to give me any clue as to how to do these. Can anyone help?
You could use strftime to save these as separate columns:and then be specific about which columns to export to csv:
With the new version of Pandas you can use the date_format parameter of the to_csv method:
To export as a timestamp, do this:The %s format is not documented in python/pandas but works in this case.I found the %s from the dates formats of ruby. Strftime doc for C hereNote that the timestamp miliseconds format %Q does not work with pandas (you'll have a litteral %Q in the field instead of the date). I caried my sets with python 3.6 and pandas 0.24.1
