Suppose I have a set {a, b, c, d}. I want to create a "path" from it, which is a generator that yields  (a, b), then (b, c), then (c, d) (of course set is unordered, so any other path through the elements is acceptable).What is the best way to do this?
Here's an example using the pairwise() recipe from http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes

Use the Rolling or sliding window iterator in Python solution:This happens to follow sorted order, because for python integers hash(x) == x and thus the sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4 is inserted in that order into the set.
You could use the pairwise itertools recipe:
Now that I understand the question
