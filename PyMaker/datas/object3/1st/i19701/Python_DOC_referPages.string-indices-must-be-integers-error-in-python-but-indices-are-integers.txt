I'm writing a program to add two numbers from a single line of input of the form: number + othernumberI keep getting a "string indices must be integers" error, but when I call type on all the indices, they all show up as integers.How do I fix this?Here's the code
The immediate issueYou probably meant to use S[0:a] and S[a:len(S)] (slicing) rather than commas.A note about slicing...You don't have to specify the leading zero or the trailing len(S) there - they're implicit. So you could just use S[:a] and S[a:] to mean the same thing.Also note that S[0:a] + S[a:len(S)] is equivalent to S. You probably didn't want to include the + in there, so you'd probably want to use S[a+1:len(S)] instead.Another note about finding the position of a character in a stringYou don't need to loop over the indices manually - there's already the .index() method of strings to do this:A simpler way to accomplish your overall goalYou can just use the split() function to get the parts of a string separated by the + character:As a bonus, this will work for an arbitrary number of numbers - 1+2+3 would work, as would just 4.The third line uses what's called a list comprehension to operate on each of the elements of a list and generate a new one - in this case, taking a list of strings and making a list of integers.The fourth line takes advantage of Python's build in sum() function, which will automatically return the sum of a sequence of items.Note that you could also condense the above lines:This is a much tidier form; I just spaced it out above to make it easier to explain.
0, a is a tuple. Did you mean to slice the sequence instead, via S[0:a]?
you need to modify the , to :
