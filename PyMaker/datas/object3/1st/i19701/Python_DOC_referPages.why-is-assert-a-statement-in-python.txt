Possible Duplicate:design of python: why is assert a statement and not a function? In Python 3, print was made into a function.  What are the benefits of having assert be a statement?
For optimization.  If you run your Python script with the -O option no code will be generated for assert statements.  This would not be possible if assert were a function.See the documentation on assert, which references this behavior.
