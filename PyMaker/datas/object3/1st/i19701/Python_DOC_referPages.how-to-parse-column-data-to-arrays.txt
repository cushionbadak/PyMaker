will get you what you want.opens a file for reading (and closes it once the code is done). You can then simply iterate over it.is a generator expression that yields two strings for each line. For each line, map(int, line.split()) converts these strings into integers. The result until now looks likeWith zip, we can join the n-th elements of the sublists in the result lists x and y.Technically, x and y are tuples(immutable) instead of lists(can be extended and changed) now. In most cases, tuples should work as well, but if you really need lists, simply add
