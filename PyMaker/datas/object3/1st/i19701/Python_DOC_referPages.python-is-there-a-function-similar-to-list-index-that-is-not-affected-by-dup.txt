list.index() will give you the index of the first time the value is shown in the list, but I am looking for a way  that will return the index of that specific item, regardless of whether it is repeated, for example, if  were to use it like so:would returnAny help appreciated
Are you looking for enumerate?
use enumerate
No, it's not possible for lst.something(1) to know whether to return 0 or 3 depending on which 1 it was called with. int is a primitive type, so any 1 is just the same as another 1.As proof, you can use the is operator:So when the hypothetical function lst.something(1) is called, it won't know which 1 you meant, regardless of how you called it.
