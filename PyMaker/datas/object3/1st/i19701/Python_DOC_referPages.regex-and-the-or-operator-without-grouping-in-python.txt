Here are the cases. I'm looking for the following pattern in a log file. All strings are in the form of AB_N or CDE_N. AB and CDE are fixed letters, followed by an underscore. N can be either 2 or 3 numbers.I tried (AB|CDE)_\d{2,3} but that returns a group. I can't do \w{2,3}\d{2,3} because it has to be either AB or CDE and not AC or FEG. Omitting the parentheses breaks too. I am sure the solution is simple but I'm new to python and regex and can't figure this out.
A ?: inside a parenthesis in a regex makes it non-capturing.  Like so: (?:AB|CDE)_\d{2,3}See docs here:  http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.htmlAbout a third of the way through it goes over the non-capturing syntax.
The non-capturing group syntax is (?:...).  So do (?:AB|CDE)_\d{2,3}.  This is documented along with everything else.
