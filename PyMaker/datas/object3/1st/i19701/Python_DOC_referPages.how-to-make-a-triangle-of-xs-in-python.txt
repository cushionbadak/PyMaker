Dude It's super easy:Or even:output for triangle(5):Dont just copy this code without comprehending it, try and learn how it works. Usually good ways to practice learning a programming language is trying different problems and seeing how you can solve it.

First try thinking of lots of ways you think you can figure something out, and if you dont know how to do a specific task just look it up and learn from it.
