I am wondering how to truncate numbers in Python 3? For example, 87.28197 to 87.281The standard in Python 2 was using % but this is no longer used.
The % string formatter still is available in Python 3. It is preferred you use the ''.format() string formatting syntax, which also supports specifying float precisions.Both of these work:If it is just the one float you are converting to a string, then the format() function is probably more convenient as you do not need to use a {0:..} placeholder:
Try:see also the method format for Detail.
