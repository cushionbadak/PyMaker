Is there a way to call foo(i) without explicit indexing on i?Trying to avoid foo(i[0], i[1], i[2])
Yes, use foo(*i):You can also use * in function definition:def foo(*vargs) puts all non-keyword arguments into a tuple called vargs.and the use of **, for eg., def foo(**kargs), will put all keyword arguments into a dictionary called kargs: 
It's called argument unpacking and there's an operator for it.By the way, it works with any iterable, not just with lists.
Yes, Python supports that:See the documentation on Unpacking Argument Lists. Works with anything iterable. With two stars ** it works for dicts and named arguments.
