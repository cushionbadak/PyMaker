I want to print like:and so on but it is printing like thisI want to print marks and subjects in proper line.
Try this:  Beginning from python 3.6, you can use this also. (Courtesy of Jon Clements)   For additional references, visit this link.
You've got a number of options:Taking your original code you could simply tab the next item along:Although this wouldn't be perfect as it's a tab, and unless all the keys are similar length it wouldn't look as you intended.Output: A better solution could would be:output:Python 3.6 requiredMy only question to you is why, you want to do this and would it be better to print some file and use delimiter and worry about presentation later. Either way you should be able to do with the aboveEqually suitable would be the 1st answer here Which out puts the same as f' but, both have the problem that if the subject key is much longer than the others the appearance will need to be amended. Changing key {key:20} or {0:20} to a greater number will help, but maybe you could count check the length of your keys using the longest as the value here plus 5 for padding.for example you could do this (added in an extra key for illustration purposes:Output :Would always make the result the right distance away from the longest subject name.
In order to avoid hardcoded width of the first column as in other answers, you can calculate the maximum key length in advance.  Simple example:will print:We can improve the code further by wrapping it in a function and adding a separator parameter:And use it like this:
