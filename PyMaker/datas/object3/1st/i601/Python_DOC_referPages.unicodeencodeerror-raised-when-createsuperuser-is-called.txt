I am trying to deploy my Django application (2.1.5 with Python 3.6.6) on my server with a PostGreSQL database.I did a 'makemigrations' and 'migrate' as usual and then I can't create a super user with the command 'createsuperuser':I found on Google to add:at the top of the file but it doesn't work, same result with the variable DEFAULT_CHARSET (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-DEFAULT_CHARSET).My PostGreSQL database are asking for utf-8 encoding.
This may be caused by the fact that encoding used for the stdin does not support the characters being typed in at the input() prompt.You can try explicitly setting the encoding to UTF-8 using the PYTHONIOENCODING environment variable before you run the createsuperuser command:
I think it is the same problem as here:previous postYou have to add in the start of each file to include the right encoding
