Was browsing the internet for the past two hours and didn't find the answer. Ridiculus, I know ... Will write a bit more about it, maybe someone else finds this helpful as well.I want to save every single mailchimp campaign as an unpaginated (continuous) PDF. Found this great program that does the job: wkhtmltopdf. All I have to do is run a command in cmd that looks like this ...This obviously makes very long continous PDF (10 pages) but I can batch process (crop, optimize, arhchive) them later with Acobe Acrobat Pro.I made a csv file that holds a list of all the campaigns ever sent. For instance (the last three):I then wrote a short python code ...... that reads every row in a csv file and prints something like this ...Now the grand question is: How do I make cmd run all the lines one after the other instead of just printing them out?I know, I can just copy and paste the lines in cmd and it will execute them, but I would really appreciate learning how to do it the proper way :)Thanks!
