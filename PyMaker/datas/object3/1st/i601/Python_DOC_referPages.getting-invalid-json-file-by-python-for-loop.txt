hello first of all i'm trying to do a web scraper bot and then save all info in a json filebut when looping my json is invalidthis is part of my code and where i'm generating jsonand this is part of my invalid json file that was been generated by pythonwhile trying to parse this json on a online json parser it says SyntaxError: Unexpected token [ in JSON at position 318is there anyway to generate a valid json?if yes anyone that can help  me out?
Python's json module doesn't directly support building a json file incrementally*.  Valid json can be generated by appending each each dict to a list, and then dumping the list to the output file, like this:* From the docs for json.dump: ...trying to serialize multiple objects with repeated calls to dump() using the same fp will result in an invalid JSON file
