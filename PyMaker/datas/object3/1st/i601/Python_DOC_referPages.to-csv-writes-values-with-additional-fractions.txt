I am using to_csv() method to write my data frame into a .csv file. I have a variable called emotion which refers to a data frame, and I am using to_csv() like this;There are over 15.000 rows of data in this data frame, and when I open to check the .csv file which is created by to_csv method, most of the rows look fine. But there are few exceptions. You can see a chunk of rows from the .csv file below;2.8641,0.2737,38.18,73,97,291664  3.1672,0.2688,38.21,73,97,291667  3.4115,0.2786,38.11,73,97,291672  3.3675,0.2737,38.18,73,97,291675  3.1719999999999997,0.2737,38.02,73,97,291678  2.7761,0.2737,38.15,73,97,291682  2.39,0.2688,38.18,73,97,291685  2.0674,0.2835,38.11,73,97,291688As I pointed out above with the bold font on the dataframe values, 3.1719999999999997 has an additional fractions. In the original data, it should be something like 3.171. Could you help me to overcome this problem? Thanks in advance.
See https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.htmlto_csv has this nice float_format keyword argument that you can set.
This is probably a cast made by pandas when extracting the values from your csv.If you want to limit the numbers of digits displayed by the dataframe you can use:This will limit the numbers of digits to 3.
