I have an argparse that is given a string:The parser namespace is Namespace(a=['dummy'], b='dummy2').How can I make the argument for a be stored as a string and not as a list of strings?
It's simple, just skip the argument for nargs. Try this:I believe this is what you expected:Quoting the docs:ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line argument with a single action to be taken. The nargs keyword argument associates a different number of command-line arguments with a single action. The supported values are:N (an integer). N arguments from the command line will be gathered together into a list ... Note that nargs=1 produces a list of one item. This is different from the default, in which the item is produced by itself.
