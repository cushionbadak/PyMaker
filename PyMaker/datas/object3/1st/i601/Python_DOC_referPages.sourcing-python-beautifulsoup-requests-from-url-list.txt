I am planning to use a url list to scrape several pages consecutively, using the code below. Is there a smart way to replace the manually inserted terms for "desired_google_queries" through a reference to an extensive url list (which could be a CSV or Excel file)?
You can put your scraping logic into a function, and then call it on each of the query's you read from your .csv file.
