Natural Text
So I want the user to input a word and in a separate text file it will have something like a = z which means I want it to look at each character in their word and if there's an "a" it will be replaced with a "z".  How can I select each character in Python and replace letters/numbers etc in a word?
I'll assume your file is a simple text file, with on each line, a letter, an equal sign, and then another letter to replace the first with.First, read the file, and construct a dictionary mapping the old values to the new ones:Then iterate through that dictionary and preform the replacements.
You can use str.replace('a', 'z') you don't need to loop though each char in the string. .replace essentially does that for you.https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20replace#str.replace
