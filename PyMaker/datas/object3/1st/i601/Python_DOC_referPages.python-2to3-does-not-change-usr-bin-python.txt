I am in the process of converting my python code from 2.7 to 3 using 2to3.  It seems to convert as expected, except that my code always starts with the line #!/usr/bin/python which I expected to change to #!/usr/bin/python3 but it doesn't.  Have I missed something?  Is there a way to get that to happen?
#!/usr/bin/python is not a python version-dependent statement, or even python at all. It essentially instructs a shell to execute the script (file) using the python executable (program) located at /usr/bin.The intent behind 2to3 it get you along the path of converting your code to python 3, frequently doing all the work for you. It doesn't address issues outside the python code.It's entirely possible for /usr/bin/python to be python 3. The #! line exists let a shell execute a script using what's typically a systems default python.
