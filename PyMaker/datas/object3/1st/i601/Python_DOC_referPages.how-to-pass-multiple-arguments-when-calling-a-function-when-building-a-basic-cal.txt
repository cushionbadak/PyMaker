I want to build a basic calculator that'll ask the user for as many numbers as the user wants and add all of them and print the answer back to the user. This is my code: My function here can take as many parameters as the user needs but I am failing to pass those multiple numbers to the function. When the function is called and printed, only the latest user_number gets printed. This is because the user_number gets changed every time, so my function is not able to add the numbers that the user has inputted. I need some way of making user_number keep every single of its values so that my function can add them. 
If you add the results to a list you can sum the numbers in the list. Then you can sum the numbers in the list just like you do now:sum(user_numbers)
You can just use a list to capture all the user input and then once done have the sum returned.
You can do it on much easier way for the user:-> Enter numbers: 4 5 6 7 4365
