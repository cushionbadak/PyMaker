I am trying to create a program to easily handle IT requests, and I have created a program to test if a PC on my network is active from a list.To do this, I wrote the following code:When I run it my main program freezes and I can't do anything until I close the ping command window. What can I do about this? Is there any other command I can use to try to ping a machine without making my main program freeze?
The docs state that os.system() returns the value returned by the command you called, therefore blocking your program until it exits.They also state that you should use the subprocess module instead.
From ping documentation:So, by using -t you are waiting until that machine has stopped, and in case that machine is not stopping, your Python script will run forever.As mentioned by HyperTrashPanda, use another parameter for launching ping, so that it stops after one or some attempts.
As mentioned in Tim Pietzcker's answer, the use of subprocess is highly recommended over os.system (and others).To separate the new process from your script, use subprocess.Popen. You should get the output printed normally into sys.stdout. If you want something more complex (e.g. for only printing something if something changes), you can set the stdout (and stderr and stdin) arguments:Valid values are PIPE, DEVNULL, an existing file descriptor (a positive integer), an existing file object, and None. PIPE indicates that a new pipe to the child should be created. DEVNULL indicates that the special file os.devnull will be used. With the default settings of None, no redirection will occur; the childâ€™s file handles will be inherited from the parent.  -- docs on subproces.Popen, if you scroll downIf you want to get the exit code, use myPopenProcess.poll().
