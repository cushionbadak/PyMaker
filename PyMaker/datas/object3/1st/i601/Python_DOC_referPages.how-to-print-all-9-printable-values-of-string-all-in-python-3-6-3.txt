How can I achieve such job:IE:if I do get_foo(obj, "name") it should be calling obj.name (see input as string but I call it as an attritube.Thanks
Use the builtin function getattr.getattr(object, name[, default])Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâ€™s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar. If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised.
If someobject has an attribute named foostring thenor if you want to set an attribute to the supplied object then:Try it
You should use setattr and getattr:
