I have wrote a custom hook which works when input string is valid dict in python, but it doesn't works when it is valid list.[1,2] is a valid json but if I pass this to json.loads with my custom hook, the hook is not being called.
You can't manage JSON array deserialization using object_hook, only JSON objects (like d in your example), as it said in docsobject_hook is an optional function that will be called with the result of any object literal decoded (a dict). The return value of object_hook will be used instead of the dict. This feature can be used to implement custom decoders (e.g. JSON-RPC class hinting).If you really need to handle arrays, you can write your post-processing function and walk through every node and modify list objects.BTW object is a name of built-in, so I suggest you to rename it to obj/object_/something else.
