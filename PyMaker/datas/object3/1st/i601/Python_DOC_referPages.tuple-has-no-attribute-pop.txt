Im trying to get this code to select a random value from this 'deck of cards', remove the selected 'card' and then append it to used_deck    However when running this code i get the error: Im assuming that .pop cant be used the way i have used it, but all websites i have looked at are using it in the same way i am?
Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. You can learn more about them from here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences.If you want to modify the data within something, it should be contained in a mutable data structure. In this case, a list would work fine.Here is an example of how you could do it:
You are using tuples, those are inmutables, why you dont use lists?deck = [['ad','ah','ac','as']instead 

A tuple is what is known as a immutable object.On immutable sequences from the docs:Immutable sequencesAn object of an immutable sequence type cannot change once it is created. (If the object contains references to other objects, these other objects may be mutable and may be changed; however, the collection of objects directly referenced by an immutable object cannot change.)You can either change the tuple to a list:, or iterate over the tuple:there are probably other methods as well.
deck[a].pop(b)AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'pop'a is an integer so deck[a] is an item from the list deck, which gives a tuple. That is, deck[a] is a tuple, which does not have a pop attribute/method.would remove an item (a tuple) with index a from the list named deck.
