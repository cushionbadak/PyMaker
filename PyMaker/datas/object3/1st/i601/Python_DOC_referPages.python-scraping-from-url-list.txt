I am planning to open a CSV file containing a number of URLs I want to scrape. However, when running the request, I am only receiving a blank document as result. When entering the URLs directly into the Python code, things work well.My thought is that something could be wrong with the CSV file as the code seems to be in line with what has worked for other users.The CSV file, which is saved in the same folder as the scraper, is currently formatted as follows:'https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2015%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2015&tbm=nws','https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2016%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2016&tbm=nws','https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk&source=lnt&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2017%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2017&tbm=nws',Does anyone have an idea what you be the reason for the blank document I am receiving? Please also find below the Python code I am using:Please find below the run trace:
