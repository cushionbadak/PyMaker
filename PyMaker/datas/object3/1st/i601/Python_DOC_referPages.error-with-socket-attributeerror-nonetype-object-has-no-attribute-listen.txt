I'm trying to write a simple TCP socket server.I'm getting this error:And I can't understand why.Code:
socket.bind() returns None. Don't assign this back to your socket attribute:On a side note: don't use __doubleunderscore__ names for your own projects. Python reserves this class of names for its own use.If you want to mark names as internal to the instance, use single underscores at the start of names. Python classes have no privacy model, all attributes are always accessible from the outside.So this suffices:I've used more commonly-used names for the socket and connection, also adhering to the Python style guide.
