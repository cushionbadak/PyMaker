Check out enumerate to grab both the index and the value while iterating a list.This will allow you to do something like the below:*Note that I actually used idx > 4 which means anything past the 5th value (0-index based) as you noted and used in your example. You can, of course, change to use whichever index you'd like.See a short post and discussion on enumerate here:Python using enumerate inside list comprehension

Just assign it back 
Use a conditional expression and the enumerate builtin:
Just an example using NumPy:
