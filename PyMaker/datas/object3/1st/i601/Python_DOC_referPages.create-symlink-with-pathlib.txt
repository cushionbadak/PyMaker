I want to test if Python code is working with symlinks properly. How can I create symlinks (e.g. equivalent to how os.symlink() can be used) in a faked filesystem based on pathlib.Path in a Python2/3 compatible way?
For Python 3.x, the pathlib package is in the standard library. For Python 2.7 you can use the backport pathlib2.Both packages have a .symlink_to(target, target_is_directory=False) method which should do what you want.From experience, Python 2 does not like to make symbolic links in Windows environments, but Python 3 supports NTFS symbolic links. Linux is happy making symlinks in either. Other environments I can't speak for.Here is an example usage
