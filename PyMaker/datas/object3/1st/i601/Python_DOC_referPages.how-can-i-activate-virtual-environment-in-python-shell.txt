I have created a virtual environment (directory is env) and have installed some third party packages. I work with Mac OSX. How can I activate my venv in the python interactive shell? I triedand get the error message: SyntaxError: invalid syntaxI have seen some had posted this question 8 years ago but I haven't found what I was looking for...I have also checked the python documentation but it is not clear for me how to activate ithttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html?highlight=virtualCan anybody please help?
In your shell, normally python will point you to a default instance of python:This is because python is located in /usr/local/bin which is part of your default PATH. Now, when you source activate <some_env>, you are modifying PATH, which you can actually see in the /path/to/venv/some_env/bin/activate file:I'm using anaconda but the concept is the same, and ... indicates where I've snipped out parts of the script. It is effectively exporting the venv python executable path into PATH. So you won't be pointing to your venv python unless one of two conditions arises: a) you explicitly call that python executable or b) you source activate myenv and then call python.So the correct workflow is:source /path/to/myenv/bin/activate myenvThen callpythonAs an example, the first call to $PATH is before activating my conda env, the second is after:note how $PATH is different
