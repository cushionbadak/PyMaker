I have these two matrices:I need to create three matrices A+1st column of B, and so onSo I need this final result:I start doing the following code, but I only got one of thoseOutput:Process finished with exit code 0
You can leverage enumerate() to get your output:As a personal preference I avoid using range(len(...)) where I can - enumerate is cleaner.If string literals do not work for you, use "A{}".format(idx) instead.Your code does not work because you coupled the range of i to j
This is a possible solution that you can certainly start with:
Make sure to use deepcopy so that they are not all referring to the same object.
