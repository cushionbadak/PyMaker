I have noticed, that if you want to print kwargs of a specefic key in python, it gives an error, when i put the keyword, in front of the the print statement like such the error i get is the followingwhy is it that the second one works fine, but the first one fails to work, even though the logic is essentially the same, only the syntax and operation is different?
Well, is f'{a['b']}' valid syntax? How can you parse this expression? Is this one single-quoted string, as you expect?No, it's not. It's parsed as:As you can see, this b is not actually a part of the string, because a pair of matching single quotes denote a string. It could've been treated as a variable name, but Python's syntax doesn't allow this. The same issue can be shown with a simpler example:It's parsed like this:You can just use different quotes:
Here printf is expecting a string, but 'i would like {args[0]} and {kwargs['food']}' is not a string - it's two strings sandwiching an unknown identifier (food).'i would like {args[0]} and {kwargs[' + food + ']}'Try this instead:
