I have the following functionAlong with the following testWhen my code hits I run into this errorHow do I resolve this so that I can keep accessing my pages fields and keep the async function?
async def here means that call of get_page will returns an asyncio coroutine. To actually execute get_page and get result you should await for this coroutine.Your test should be altered this way:Note however that if you await for something inside function this function (test_get_page) must be coroutine itself (must be defined with async def) and awaited somewhere to be executed.It means you should use pytest-asyncio in addition to plain pytest as shown here.
