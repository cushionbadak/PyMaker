I have created a function, but depending on what name is passed into the function, I'd like the function to behave differentlyCreated function takes in a dataframe, creates a pivottable and scale some columns by 100 or 0.01. For a particular type of dataframe (which contains a particular column), I do not want the Avg Weight to be scaled. Is there a way to find the name of the df passed?  edit:all df have the same column names, so to differentiate the "SpecialDF" from others is only by its name passed into the function. At this point should i be looking at classes or decorators? the def scale(df) function is quite long and only this part requires special handlingwhat i'm looking for is something like 
For a particular type of dataframe (which contains a particular  column), I do not want the Avg Weight to be scaled.Use an if or ternary statement to determine whether a column exists in your dataframe:The idea is to reduce repeated code and only modify the most basic objects required to change the required columns, in this case a list object.For a more generic function, you can have scale_cols as an argument and pipe your dataframe through the function:all df have the same column names, so to differentiate the "SpecialDF"  from others is only by its name passed into the function.Your updated requirement is completely different. Names are just references: do not rely on them for processing conditions. Good practice is to use a dictionary to store your dataframes and use keys in your dictionary to identify a "special" dataframe:
Based on the term "type" of DataFrame, you would want isinstance (documentation here).However, since you say "which contains a particular column", you probably actually mean if col in df, where col is the name of that particular column.
