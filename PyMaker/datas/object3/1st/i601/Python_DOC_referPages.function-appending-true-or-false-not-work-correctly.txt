I make a list:I want to find where are empty list and iterate over them to get information about every person and store it as dataframe. For example:To do so i tried function which save to list True when length of list is 0 and False otherwise.Then i use itertools.compress to print items which selectors are True.The problem is that selectors have more elements then i expected (14 instead of 12). Between True and next True i have 4 times False but should be 3 times and one additional False after second True.Why is that and how to fixed it? Is there any faster/better way to solve whole problem?
you forgot the else clause in your if statement; False is appended to selectors in any case. it should be:
Problem is the missing else: - see hiro's answer - it always appends the False .Zen of python: #3 - Simple is better than complex.You do not need itertools.compress at all:is the same as:To get the indexes of the empty list you can use a list comprehension:Output:Doku:enumerate()Truthyness (value testing)
