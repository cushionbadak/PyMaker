I am a beginner using Scrapy. I am trying to download image and set pipelines but somethings is error and I can not understand about this.books.pysettings.pyI am crawl this command, scrapy crawl books2. If everything is ok then images will be download. But I am facing the error. The error is,... if os.path.isabs(uri):  # to support win32 paths like:  C:\some\dir   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/posixpath.py", line 66, in  isabs      s = os.fspath(s) TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not set
The IMAGE_STORE settings must be a single path.Replace:with:{'asdf'} is a set with the string asdf, hence the error message.
