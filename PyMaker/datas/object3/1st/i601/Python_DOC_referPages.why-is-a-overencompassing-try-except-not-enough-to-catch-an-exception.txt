I though that an outermost try: / except: would always catch an exception (the fact that this is probably not a good idea is outside of the question):In some code I am going though, I faced the case whereraised an exception:Why is it so? Why hasn't the overencompassing try:/except: caught the exception?
In the provided second code example, the Traceback message was not in fact an unhandled exception, due to the exception handler calling logger.exception method which will print out the specified message along with the complete Traceback message into the logging stream.  If the Traceback is not desired, using logger.error will produce the log message at the same ERROR level without it.
