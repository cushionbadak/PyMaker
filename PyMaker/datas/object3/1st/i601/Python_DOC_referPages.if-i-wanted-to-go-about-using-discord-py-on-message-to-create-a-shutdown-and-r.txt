My Discord Bot runs off discord.py, using the on_message function. If I wanted to use this, to create a command which would shutdown, and another to restart my Discord Bot, how would I do it?I run the bot off a server host on repl.it.I will link some code below so you can see what I mean by on_message:Ideally the commands should work as !shutdown and !restart, and should only be able to be used by me.Thanks in advance,H
To exit the script, you would call sys.exit([arg]). To restart the script, take a look at os.exec*().For example:
You can place your code in a while loop and use client.logout() to close the Discord connection. The !restart command will then only use client.logout() without interrupting the while loop, and !shutdown will also use client.logout() but will call break to cancel the while loop.You can create commands to handle this instead of having everything in the on_message event, which will become cluttered.
