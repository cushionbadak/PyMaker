I'm trying to make a game where the user is asked to guess a country based on it's capital which is selected at random from a list of dictionaries (similar to the link at bottom). Guessing 10 countries in total, if they guess correctly they get 1 point, with 10 points in total.I've imported a variable 'countries' that contains a list of dictionaries like the following: So how do I print a random choice from a specific key name? In this case, any 'capital' from any of the dictionaries.Python-Dictionary states and capital game
random.choice is very good for this use case :)
You can use below two options.random.choice toselect a random element from a the list.Sample code.random.ranint to select random integer between 0 and length of list.Sample code:
You can fetch a random sample with randomCountry = random.choice(countries) However, if you do this multiple times, you may get the same country multiple times. To combat this, you could sample 10 distinct elements with randomCountries = random.sample(countries, 10) and then iterate with those. Note that random.sample throws an error if you attempt to sample more elements than there exists in the collection.Your game could thus look like this:
like this?edit: the rest of the code...
