I have a situation, where getattribute fallbacks to getattr and then again getattribute gets called.How current getattribute gets called again? I am confused.Console Output:
getattr is called because getattribute raises AttributeErrorself.__dict__ invokes the "second" call to getattributeClean the code and add print(item) to make this clearer:Outputs
You need to consult with python Data modelExcerpts for getattribute:Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the class. If the class also defines getattr(), the latter will not be called unless getattribute() either calls it explicitly or raises an AttributeError.I see in your code:So I think you did it intentionally
