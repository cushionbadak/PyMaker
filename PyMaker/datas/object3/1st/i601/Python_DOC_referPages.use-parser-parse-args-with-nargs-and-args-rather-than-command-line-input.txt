I have an argparse argument example that accepts a variable number of strings:This works fine when using the CLI as usual with command-line input: script.py --example ab cd.I also want this to work with arguments that are passed to parser.parse_args(args) through the args argument from within the program code.But when I try to pass parser.parse_args(["--example", "ab cd"]), it's interpreted as single string "ab cd" and not as a list of ab and cd.Similarly, passing parser.parse_args(["--example", "ab", "cd"]) is somehow interpreted as single argument, which is a list. So, when accessing args.example[0] I get the list and args.example[1] gets me an error.
As your link shows, you can give parse_args a list of strings.To test parsing without any commandline arguments, by giving it an empty list:With a list of strings:or split a string:Answers to argparse questions often use one of these forms to illustrate their actions.  The split is convenient.It is also possible to create an args Namespace directly:I don't follow your interpretation of the result forThat should produce a args.example that is ["ab", "cd"].This isn't a good test case:to produce the same thing from the commandline you'd have to useThe quotes override the normal split on white space.  You have to use shlex.split to emulate that behavior.
It is tricky for argparse to handle lists directly use a csv list instead:
