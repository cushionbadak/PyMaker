I have written some fairly questionable code I'm sure, but it seems to do the job. The issue is that it is printing the data to a spreadsheet and in the column where I am hoping to find the vehicle's year if the first word in the advert isn't the year, then it displays the first word which could be the manufacturer. Essentially i want to set if statements so that if the vehicle year isn't in the first word but is somewhere else in the string that it still finds it and prints it to my .csv. Also, I have been struggling for a while to parse through multiple pages and was hoping that someone here could help with that too. The url has page=2 etc in it but I am not able to get it to parse through all url's and get the data on all pages. At the moment everything I have tried only does the first page. As you may have guessed, I am fairly new to Python. Please could someone help me with this? I realise that the if statements at the bottom may be way off. The code successfully manages to get the first word from the string, it is just a shame that the way the data is structured that it isn't always the vehicle's year of manufacture (yom)
Comment "1978 Full restored Datsun 280Z" becomes '1978' '1978' '280Z'.     Rather than '1978' 'Datsun' '280z'To improve the year validation, change to use the re module:The output becomes:About the false result make='Full' you have two options.  Stop word listBuild a stop word list with terms like ['full', 'restored', etc.] and loop the title_items to find the first item not in the stop word list.Maker listBuild a Maker list like ['Mercedes', 'Datsun', etc.] and loop the title_items to find the first matching item.Question: find the vehicle's year if the first word in the advert isn't the yearUsed build-in and module:  str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1), str.isdigit() class list([iterable]),Mutable Sequence Types, Common Sequence Operations Sample Titles used:Get the title from <a Element and split it by blanks.Defaults are title_items at index 0, 1, 2.Verify if the year met the condition 4 digitsLoop all item in title_items, break if condition met.Change to assumed, title_items at index 0, 1 are make and modelCheck if model starts with digitNote: This will fail if a Model does not met this criteria!
