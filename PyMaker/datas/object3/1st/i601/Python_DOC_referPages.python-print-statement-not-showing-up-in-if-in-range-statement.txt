I have looked online on how to write a if in range statement in python and I am confused why my print statement is not showing up.The expected result is that if I put in the input -20 it will say "Maybe school" but right now it is not showing the print statement when I put in a number through -1 to -24.
Python's range function increments in values of 1. The first argument in range is start the second is stop and a 3'rd (optional) argument is step which is what it increments by. You have 2 options here. Either start from the lower number and stop at the higher:Or keep what you have but tell range to increment by -1:Both the above will accomplish the same result for you, although just fyi they both will result in reversed list's of eachother if you run list() on themEditIf you dig deeper, the ranges are determined using the following formulas:For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the  formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by  the formula r[i] = start + step*i, but the constraints are i >= 0 and  r[i] > stop.ReferenceSo in essence, range is actually excluding the stop value in my examples (respectively -1 and -24) so be sure to take this into account. Use
Your range function is backwards. But you do not need to include the last if condition if you use the if - elif- else syntax. You should be using an if - elif- else statement here like below:
Your range command is backwards, it should go from the smallest (most negative) number to the largest. If you want a range from -1 to -24, you should do range(-24, -1)
