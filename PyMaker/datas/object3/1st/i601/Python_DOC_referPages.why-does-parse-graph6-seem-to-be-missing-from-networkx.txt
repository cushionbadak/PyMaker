The networkx docs say there is a function for parsing graph6 strings called parse_graph6 (networkx.readwrite.graph6.parse_graph6), but it doesn't seem to exist. Did this function go away, or am I doing something wrong?
parse_graph6 is renamed to from_graph6_bytes as seen in this diff.Going forward in versions of networkx greater than 2.0, from_graph6_bytes is used.
