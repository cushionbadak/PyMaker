I am trying to understand the process of creating a function that can replace duplicate strings in a list of strings. for example, I want to convert this listto thisinitially, I know I need create my function and iterate through the listHowever, I know there are two problems with this. the first is that I get an error statingso I believe I should instead be operating on the range of this list, but I'm not sure how to implement it. The other being that this would only help me if the duplicate letter comes directly after my iteration (i).Unfortunately, that's as far as my understanding of the problem reaches. If anyone can provide some clarification on this procedure for me, I would be very grateful.
Go through the list, and keep track of what you've seen in a set. Replace things you've seen before in the list with 'x':  
Simple Solution.
The other solutions use indexing, which isn't necessarily required.Really simply, you could check if the value is in the new list, else you can append x. If you wanted to use a function:
You can use the following solution:Which will give you:['a', 'b', 'x', 'x', 'c', 'x']
