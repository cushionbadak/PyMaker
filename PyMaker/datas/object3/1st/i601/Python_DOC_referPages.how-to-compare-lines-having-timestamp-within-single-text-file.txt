Natural Text
I have text file with below lines:Now I would like to check the timestamps in the text file whether lines have time difference as 3 seconds with "sending publish" term as well.And if the sending publish is not available, need to print the text within (not connect)from 4th line onwards, need to check the lines with 3 seconds difference.I don't find any clue or I don't have any python code to compare lines(having timestamp) within single file as well..Please do support with any examples / code.
If I get what you've asked correctly, the script you need to build should complete 2 tasks:Reading text from txt file with pythonParse the information you need from a line stringReading from  a fileHere is sample code for opening and reading txt file in python:More information - https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_open.aspString ParsingTo do that you can use both string slicing or regular expressions search, here is some information on both:Regular Expressions - https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.htmlString Slicing - https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-typesEditYou can use datetime package in python to calculate time passed on both dates - https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlHope it helps!
