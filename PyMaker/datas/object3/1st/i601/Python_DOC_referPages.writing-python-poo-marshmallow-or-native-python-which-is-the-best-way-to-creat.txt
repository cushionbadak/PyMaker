Being programming on python, i discovered marshmallow. I always create classes on native python . Is this library (or another) the best way to create POO based program ? 
Marshmallow is useful if you need serialization/deserialization. It is not about OOP.If you like the way the attributes are declared and typed, you could be interested in the dataclasses feature introduced in Python 3.7.
