I would like Python to import several CSV files that are in one folder and concatenate them. As I am working on a Mac and Windows, I need a solution that works for both. Also, I need Python to read the CSV in a specific way: separation by ;This is my current situation, I have to manually add the files in the code: I would like a simple way to have all files that start with "loading" be imported, correctly read with semicolon, and then concatenated. And to top it off, does the same code also work for Excel files (I have some others that I also want to add)?I found this code and was able to import a lot of files but could not get the sep=';' to work:Any idea what I am doing wrong?
I just solved it by combining a few other answers with this
os.listdir() will return list of all files in directory. Simply iterate over names, check if name .endswith('.csv') and open it dynamically
