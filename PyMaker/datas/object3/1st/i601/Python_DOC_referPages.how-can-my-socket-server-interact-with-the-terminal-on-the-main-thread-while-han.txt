I would like to be able to interact with different sessions easily. Right now each different connection is on a different thread but everything being sent to the server compiles into the same list. A few questions. First, after starting the server I'd like to return to an option menu with options like end a thread, interact with a thread, view current threads open, things like that. Something that looks like the options menu at the beginning of main().  Also right now anything being sent to the server is put in the messages list, I'd like to have a separate list for each open thread where their messages are sent. My idea is that my main thread should be the one running the option menu and have threads in the background listening and connected; however, I haven't found a way to change the main thread. I'm on Windows.
The Asynchronous Mixins example in the socketserver documentation shows you exactly what you want to do: create a background thread to run the server itself, so you can do other actions on the main thread while the server is handling requests.Here's a copy of the relevant bit from the example, with a comment showing where you would add your code:
