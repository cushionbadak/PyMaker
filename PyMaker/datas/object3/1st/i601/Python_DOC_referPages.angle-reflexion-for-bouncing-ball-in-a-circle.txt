I am making a game with some bouncing elements IN a circle (I use pygame) ,My elements have 2 attributes  , one for the angle and one for the speedHere is how elements moves :My problem is this : I know the angle at the top (99.6°) , I have the collision point (x and y ) , but I'm unable to find the angle at the bottom(42.27°)Does someones can make a relation between the first angle and the second ? Picture is better ...
I recommend do calculate the reflection vector to the incident vector on the circular surface.In the following formula N is the normal vector of the circle, I is the incident vector (the current direction vector of the bouncing ball) and R is the reflection vector (outgoing direction vector of the bouncing ball):Use the pygame.math.Vector2.To calculate the normal vector, you' ve to know the "hit" point (dvx, dvy) and the center point of the circle (cptx, cpty): Calculate the reflection:The new angle can be calculated by math.atan2(y, x):Code listing:
The inner angles of a triangle need to sum up to 180°. Also, the angle 99.96° is supplementary to the triangle's angle next to it (calling it by A), i.e. 99.96° + A = 180° so A = 180° - 99.96°. Calling of B = 42.27° the bottom angle. And for the last angle C, we can use that it is opposed by the vertex with the other angle that is equal to 2 * 28.85 = 57.7°.Then:P.S.: I know that the values are not exactly equal, but it must be because of the decimal places rounding
