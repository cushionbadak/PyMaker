I am running a grid search to obtain the optimal parameters for my Holt-Winters model. My problem isn't with this, but from splitting the output. scores looks like this:How I can print out the first entry (which is None)? When I print c[0], the output is [. 
If your strings are guaranteed to be python literals then you can use ast.literal_eval:This should solve the problem as stated in the question. But something does not feel right here. Why is score_model returning those strings instead of just lists? You might want to take a look at that instead of solving a problem that probably sould not extist in the first place.
