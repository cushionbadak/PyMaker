As in the last question:TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable while no iteration exists?, I find a problem in my program. That is:In Python,set( (0,0) )actually gives you {0}, but I want {(0,0)}collections.deque( ((0, 0), [ (0, 0) ] ) ).popleft()actually gives you (0,0) , whereas I want ((0, 0), [ (0, 0) ] )So now I',m thinking about designing data classes of my own. Yet in test code I came across an 'function' object has no attribute "mro" problem.Test code 1:Test code 1 error screenshot:Test code 2:Test code 2 error scrrenshot:My Python version is Anaconda 3.6.8
The argument to set has to be an iterable whose elements are the desired set items. set( (0,0) ) has an iterable as an argument, but its elements are 0 and 0, not a tuple (0,0). You need set([(0,0)]). The same goes for deque; you need an iterable containing the tuple ((0, 0), [ (0, 0) ] ), soAs for the error you are seeing, function doesn't have an __mro__, because it doesn't need one. It's base class is always object, and you cannot inherit from function to create a class whose MRO would need to access function's hypothetical MRO. As to why your data class raises that error, it's because the dataclass decorator has to decorate a class, not a function.
