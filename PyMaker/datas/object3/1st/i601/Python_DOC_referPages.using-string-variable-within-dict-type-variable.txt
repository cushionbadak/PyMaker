We have 3 different Datacenter environments, for reference, let us say, US, CA and IN. All three have a puppetdb master different to the other 2. So while automating some stuff, I want to a config.json file like below and reference it from the main code based on the parameters passed:Now, for the main script, where I am trying to use a variable called "myenv", which would be one of US, or CA or IN to refer the key in the config which is of dict type. But I keep getting the error as below:The script itself for your reference below:How can I use the string type variable within a dict as a key?EDIT : Please note, all necessary indentations which maybe missing in my question, have all been taken care of, since I'm using PyCharm.
It's mean that myenv variable is string 'None' in that moment. Check it.
you need to modify your add_arguments remove nargs='*' which is giving env in list  form see below example:myarguments.add_argument("-e", "--env", type=str, metavar="environment",  help="Environment")refer this document for more info.
OK folks, I found what I was doing wrong. The arguments I was using which is why I was facing a type mismatch and getting the output as ['US'] instead of US (or CA or IN). Once I removed that, things are working fine.Thank you all for your pointers. That helped.
