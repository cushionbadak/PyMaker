I am curious, what do the 3 different brackets mean in python programming? Not sure if i'm correct about this, but please correct me if i'm wrong.Or if these brackets can be used for other purposes, any advises are welcomed! Thanks!
[]: Used to define mutable data types - lists, list comprehensions and for indexing/lookup/slicing.(): Define tuples, order of operations, generator expressions, function calls and other syntax.{}: The two hash table types - dictionaries and sets.
() parentheses are used for order of operations, or order of evaluation, and are referred to as tuples.[] brackets are used for lists. List contents can be changed, unlike tuple content.{} are used to define a dictionary in a "list" called a literal.
