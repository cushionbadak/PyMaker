I'm trying to convert a c++ library to python.c++ fileI am having hard time with implementation of myMethod. I thought of making a variable to hold the example method and invoke the variable in myMethod like below. python fileBut then editor says None type can't be called(of course). How can I achieve this?
The base class in C++ is declaring a virtual method with no definition.That means it must be defined in a child class to be used. In your library, that's class B.In Python, you can useto indicate that a method has not been implemented. See this answer for more details.In this example, calling example on an object of type A will throw an error, because the method isn't defined. You can only invoke the method on an object of type B.
To convert your C++ code into python3, you should derive from python's abstract base class (ABC). This lets you create abstract methods:Additional information can be found here https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html
