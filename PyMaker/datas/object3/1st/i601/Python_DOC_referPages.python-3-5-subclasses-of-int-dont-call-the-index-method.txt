I am confused as to when the __index__ method of a class is called. I had assumed the method would be called when ever the object was used in an indexing operation. I am not seeing __index__ called when the object is a subclass of int. it appears that int(i) is being used as the index not i.__index__(). What have I misunderstood?Edited to simplify and correct the example.
__index__ implements lossless conversion to int. Python only calls __index__ if it actually needs such a conversion. In your case, it doesn't need a conversion, because your i is already an int. Python just uses the int value directly.If you want to see the code that handles this, it's under PyNumber_Index.
