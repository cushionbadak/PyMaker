Natural Text
I am pretty new to python and would like to know how to write a program that asks the user to enter a string that contains the letter "a". Then, on the first line, the program should print the part of the string up to and including the certain letter, and on the second line should be the rest of the string. For example...This is what I have so far :So, I have figured out the first part of printing the string all the way up to the certain letter but then don't know how to print the remaining part of the string.Any help would be appreciated
If what you want is the first occurrence of a certain character, you can use str.find for that. Then, just cur the string into two pieces based on that index! In python 3:I don't have a python2 on hand to make sure, but I assume this should work on python 2:Another option that is far more concise is to use and then  as suggested in the comments, thanks @AChampion ! 
You should have some knowledge about slicing and concatenating string or list. You can learn them here Slicing and Concatenating
First find the indices of the character in the given string, then print the string accordingly using the indices. Python 3
