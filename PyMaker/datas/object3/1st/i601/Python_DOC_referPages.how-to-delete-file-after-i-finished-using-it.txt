I am trying to remove files after I'm done using them but I get an error all the time...The error:PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: '0.mp4'I tried closing the Objects but Its not working...I want to remove the file with os.remove...
Did you try simply closing the clips?From the source here.Or, if you want to do this cleanly in case of errors, use a with context:This approach uses an ExitStack to track clips. When the program exits the with block, all contexts passed to enter_context are exited, releasing all the clips.
