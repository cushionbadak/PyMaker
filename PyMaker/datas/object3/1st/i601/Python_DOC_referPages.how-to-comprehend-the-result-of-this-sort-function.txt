I'm new to programming and learning about the sort function. While I did search and looked at a number of SO articles regarding sort/lambda and some even very similar to my situation, I am still having a hard time grasping how exactly this code works. I also read the docs (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) and the examples there make sense to me but I can't seem to carry this knowledge onto this example here. Would someone be kind enough to help me with the code below? I understand this can be a duplicate but I am only asking because I don't have the knowledge base to get what I've read from other similar posts. Please help if you can, thanks. How does the order of list 'b' change from [0, 1, 2, 3] to [3, 0, 1, 2]? How does the list 'a' come into play?
It sorts b as if each element in b had the value of the corresponding value in a. It might help to see what happens if you sort tuples consisting of each value.Notice the second element of each tuple, where they are sorted in the order of their first elements.
