I am trying to copy a blob of data (some bytes) into a larger block at some position. I can do this easily enough in C, but now I am doing it in Python and I am curious as to what is the best/correct way to do this.The way I did it was:Where data and buffer are of type bytearray. Python would not let me copy the data into the buffer without converting it to a string (see the type conversion above), so I was wondering what is the correct way to insert one bytearray into another?
bytearray objects are mutable sequences, you can copy the contents of one into another at a given position by assigning to a slice:There is no need or use for struct.pack_into() here. Note that data can be any iterable of integers, provided they fall in the range 0-255; it doesn't have to be a bytes or bytearray object.Demo:
