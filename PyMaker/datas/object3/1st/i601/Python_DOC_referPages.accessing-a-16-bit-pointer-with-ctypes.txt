Why does the following not work?Error:TypeError: expected LP_c_short instance, got intIs there way to generate a LP_c_short? Or any 16-bit pointer?EDITUsing byref instead of addressof causes:TypeError: expected LP_c_short instance, got CArgObjectThe Test structure is defined that way because it look's like that in a C-DLL.
Use byref or pointer not addressof Despite having a name like the C & operator addressof returns a int and not a ctypes pointer.ctypes.addressof(obj)Returns the address of the memory buffer as integer. obj must be an instance of a ctypes typeEDITIs this not working ? :
I'm not an expert with ctypes, but following the docs the following works for me:otherwise, you could do:the former will allow you to do strange things like:I.e. coerce between different width integer types, or worseâ€¦
