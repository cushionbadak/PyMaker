I am writing a program as an exercise in Automate the Boring Stuff With Python. I believe I have a working prototype, but I am getting a file not found error with shutil.copy. The program is supposed to selectively copy files with a user supplied extension, source directory, and destination directory. I added some print tests at the end and they print the correct file names and the correct absolute path to the destination directory if I have shutil.copy commented out.If I uncomment shutil.copy I get this error:It seems like shutil.copy is confused about the path to the file, but it is providing the "correct" file name? The files are not symlinks and they do exist.
One problem here is that you do not specify the path of the file. As you are executing the command from the parent directory, the script has no way of knowing that testfile2.txt is in a subdirectory of your input directory. To fix this, use:
Thanks for the suggestions. I fixed it by joining the directory path and the filename this way:and it seems to work correctly now.
