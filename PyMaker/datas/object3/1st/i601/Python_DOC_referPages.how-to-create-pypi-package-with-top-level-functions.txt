I am trying to get a package installed on PyPi and am having trouble getting it configured to have the desired syntax.  At the end of the day, I want to be able to use a function within my module using the following syntax:This syntax follows all the common libraries.  (One could also use from ucal import calculate).My directory structure is as follows:Within ucal.py:I can upload to PyPi and then install using pip:However, inside a new script, the following script yields an error:It turns out that this works instead:But I don't want this silly syntax.  ucal should be at the top level.  What changes do I need to make in order to get the desired syntax to work?I tried moving all files in ucal/ucal to the parent directory, but this resulted in ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ucal' even though the module was installed (verified with pip list)
In ucal/ucal.py, declare public names that you want to export using the __all__ variable:In ucal/__init__.py, pull those names up into the top-level namespace by using the * import:Now, users will see calculate in the top-level namespace.
When importing, the namespace within the __init__.py appears to be able to be accessed by the ucal.* syntax.  One option, then, is to replace __init__.py with the contents of ucal.py.  This doesn't seem quite correct.Another option is to add an import statement within __init__.py:This also seems messy, but perhaps that's the accepted way to do things?
