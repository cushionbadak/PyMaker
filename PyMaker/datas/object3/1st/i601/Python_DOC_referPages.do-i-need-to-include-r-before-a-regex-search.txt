I'm looking to split terms on a delimiter. I'd like to put the number as index and the name as name.My terms:I'm using this code:This fails to capture the split. I've tested it by printing the delim and it doesn't match anything.
You are using list as compared to string
The match() function accepts only individual strings, so you have to iterate over terms separately:Also notice the use of groups in the regular expression, which returns a Group object with named matches.Regarding whether to use the r'' prefix or not, take a look at this question or this excerpt from the docs:The r prefix, making the literal a raw string literal, is needed […] because escape sequences in a normal “cooked” string literal that are not recognized by Python, as opposed to regular expressions, now result in a DeprecationWarning and will eventually become a SyntaxError.
