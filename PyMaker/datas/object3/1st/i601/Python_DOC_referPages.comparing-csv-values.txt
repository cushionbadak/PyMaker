I am not a coder but I've been trying to compare csv raw values and switching the larger value with the first raw and first raw value to the second raw. eg:Code:I am not sure how to write a loop for this. Also, end of this, I want to generate a new CSV file with new changed values. Please help to solve this.
Many ways to do this, but start with some examples from the csv library documentation which show how to read a csv file and write a new csv file.sorted.csv should contain desired results:viewed in Excel:
Try pandas.read_csv() to read your file (link) and pandas.to_csv to write it out again (link). You could start learning pandas hereTo write your loop I suggest you get familiar with Python here
