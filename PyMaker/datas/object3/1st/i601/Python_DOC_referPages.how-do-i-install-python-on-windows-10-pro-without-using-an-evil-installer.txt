Environment: Windows 10 Pro. I don't want to download any .exe installer or modify my Windows path. I want all files needed for a program to work in a single directory, and if a data directory is needed, some option to let me specify that, same with configuration files. I would use Linux but I'm at work.I downloaded and unzipped python-3.7.2.post1-embed-amd64.zip and added the path where I unzipped it to my PATH (.bash_profile as I'm using cygwin on Windows). So now I have python installed,$python-v Python 3.7.2Apparently I need to also install pip to get anything done. I search and find this statement:That statement is false, the .zip file did not contain pip. So I search some more and am instructed to type:and so I do: and get:I then add pip.exe to my .bash_profile path, not modifying my Windows path.And so now I run:and I get:I type:and I get:Why is it telling me something about my D:\ drive and a path D:\obj, that I know nothing about? I installed python, the .zip file under H:\apps\python\3.7.2\python.exeI can't pip install or pip upgrade anything, and have no idea why it is talking about my D:\ drive or if I even have a D:\ drive.Should I be able to download a .zip file, put the .exe in my path and start coding? Should I not have to install pip, if it's so very necessary for using Python? I don't know why it's missing in the .zip file, I don't know why it does not work.
Using the zip is not a supported installation method for windows:The embedded distribution is a ZIP file containing a minimal Python environment. It is intended for acting as part of another application, rather than being directly accessed by end-users.If you want to install Python on your machine you'll have to use the "evil" installer.
Under Windows 10, you can run the Linux subsystem, and hence run Python on (say) Ubuntu.First activate/install Windows Power Shell.Then follow instructions from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10You will be able to install Ubuntu with a command-line prompt, and thence, Python.(Windows-filesystem files are accessible from Ubuntu, but Ubuntu-filesystem files should ideally not be accessed from Windows)
