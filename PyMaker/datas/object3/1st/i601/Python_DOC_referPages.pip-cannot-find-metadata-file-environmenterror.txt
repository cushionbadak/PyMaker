Whenever I run pip to install the Flask packages like virtualenv in Ubuntu 16.04, I get this error:pip install virtualenvRequirement already satisfied: virtualenv in ./.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages (16.1.0)No metadata found in ./.local/lib/python3.5/site-packagesCould not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv-16.1.0.dist-info/METADATA'Here are my pip and python versions:pip --versionpip 19.0.1 from /usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pip (python 3.5)python3 --versionPython 3.6.8I already tried almost all that I get from the internet to solve this issue like:/usr/.local/bin/pip install virtualenvBut I still get the same error.I also go into the dist folder to copy the metadata.json with METADATA, but there's no metadata.json file inside.cd /usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv-16.1.0.dist-info/cp metadata.json METADATAcp: cannot stat 'metadata.json': No such file or directoryPlease help me, I'm stucked with this issue for days. Thanks!
I encountered the same problem recently.In the folderI found another one named pip-19.0.1.dist-info, and the last one contained all the required files for the pip.I just usedObviously that you need to replace python version with your own and also check if files are in here.Maybe it will help you, luck.
I think the root of your error is that your pip is configured to work with Python3.5 (and looks in its specific Pythonpath for the metadata), while your Python version is 3.6.8Virtual environments in Python 3 have been made simpler, in my opinion, with the usage of the built-in venv. Also, your Python and Flask versions should coincide, which is here, not the case. I'd suggest you take the following stepsCreate a new virtual environment usingpython3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environmentActivate the virtual environment by You now have an isolated, clean-slate environment, where you only have a single version of Python.Run pip install --upgrade pip to upgrade the virtual environment pip to the version that is compatible with your Python version.Run pip install flask, and install your whole stack from scratch, so that the libraries and Python executable versions are aligned.
I got same errorIt seems that there is a conflict between /usr/bin/pip and /home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.7/.My solution is avoiding the error.pip freeze > requirements.txtI deleted the /home/user/.local/lib/python3.7 dirsudo pip install --upgrade pippip install -r requirements.txt --userfixed it
