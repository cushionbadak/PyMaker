I have been given a task at school to define a function name "fraction", work just as the Fraction Modules.Here is how I do it:But when I tried to see how it'd work, it became like this:I don't know where I was wrong, can someone help me to figure it out?Thank you so much.
In your def fraction, You modified a. a became 45/9 = 5. b divided by GCD(5,9) (which equals 1) will just be b. Instead, you could store the GCD in a temporary variable and divide both by it. 
you modify a before you calculate the GCD for b; your second GCD calculation will therefore always return 1.you could try this:also note that i used integer division (floordiv) // so i do not get a float as result that i have to cast back to in int.
Thank you so much for your helpful answers, I've realized what I did wrong and make a new one combining all your answers.Here is the new one:Thank you all so so much again, you have made my day.
