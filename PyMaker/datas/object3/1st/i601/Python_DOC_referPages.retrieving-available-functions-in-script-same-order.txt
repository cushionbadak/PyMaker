I'm cleaning some smeared data for which I want to automate things a bit. That is, I want a script to have some predefined cleaning functions put in order of how the data should be cleaned, and I designed a decorator to retrieve these functions from a script using this solution:This works extremely good. However, it does retrieve the functions in a different order (by name)For reproducibility purposes, consider the following cleaning module as cd:The solution outputs: Where it needs to be:Other solutions to the main problem are acceptable (performance is considered though).
Other solutions to the main problem are acceptable (performance is considered though).In the interest of being able to define and import helper functions without having them included automatically, how about an explicit list:or an explicit decorator:As far as getting the attributes of a regular module in order goes, though, you should be able to use __dict__ in Python 3.7+:
You're half way there. You only need to sort the list based on the 1st line of the function's code object ([Python 3]: inspect - Inspect live objects).Note that I've only tried this on the (trivial) example from question (and didn't do any performance tests).code.py:Output:
