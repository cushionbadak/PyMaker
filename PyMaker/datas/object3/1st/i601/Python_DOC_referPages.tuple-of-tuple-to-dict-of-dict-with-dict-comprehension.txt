Is it possible to convert a tuple of tuples like this:to a dict of dicts like this:using a dict comprehension like this:
You could use groupby with a dictionary comprehension:OutputAs mentioned by @juanpa.arrivillaga if the input is not sorted by the first element of each tuple, you need to sort it, for that you can do: l = sorted(l, key=first) before using the dictionary comprehension.
Use itertools.groupby:
Do you enjoy abusing built-ins for not their intended purpose? I would honestly use the other answers here but this is also another way to do this.Using any will return a boolean which clearly is not the intended purpose here hence why I recommend other answers listed.
In my opinion, Daniel Mesejo's answer nailed it.  That answer is based on groupby, but functionally speaking, groupby is a form of reduce.   So, for variety, I'll offer here a solution with functools.reduce (which also uses defaultdict):Even though this isn't a dictionary comprehension solution, I hope it will provide more context for someone wanting to understand the computation required to answer the question.
