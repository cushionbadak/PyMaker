I'm not trying to find the highest value or rank them in a certain order. I need the first value to be the 1st place, second value the 2nd place, you get it. Honestly, I couldn't find it done in the simplest way nor done in the way I'm describing. I'm sure it's be done but I haven't found anything. Example: ['10','11','12','13,'14']'10' = 1 or 1st'11' = 2 or 2nd'12' = 3 or 3rd'13' = 4 or 4th'14' = 5 or 5th
Not sure what your end goal is with this...Maybe this is what you are looking forResult:
If I'm understanding, index should be what you want:Will return 1 as it's the first element (with index value 0).
You can put the values into a dictionary to make it easy to look them up:
