I'm writing a program to print the reverse of an integer using Python. I would expect the output of 345 to be 543 (i.e., 345 reversed), but instead, I get inf.Here's my code:What am I doing wrong, and how can I fix it?
As said above, you need integer to integer division.Replaceby// divides to int and not float.
If I may, your problem can be solved without any math at all
Another possible way is to make the number into an array.The output would be as following:Note - The variables that I used can be changed to whatever you like, except letter.
The problem is that division with 10, implicitly convert n to float. The assumption is that n is an integer.Change,to (prevent implicit convertion to float),n.b. The original problem is that you do have float conversion and then your exit condition n!=0 is not satisfied as you expect due to floating point inaccuracy.
