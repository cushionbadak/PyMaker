I am passing parameter into os.system in Python3 like this:the scrapy url contains special charactor:In the Spider only recieve:How to pass special words into spider?
The shlex module knows how to escape strings you want to pass to the shell.However, the shell isn't doing anyting useful here, so it's better to simply avoid it.Of course, given that scrapy is a Python library, perhaps the best solution is to simply import scrapy and take it from there.
