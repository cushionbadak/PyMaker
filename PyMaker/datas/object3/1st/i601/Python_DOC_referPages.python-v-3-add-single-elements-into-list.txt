Program takes a phone number and adds single digits to listThis is my input 867-5309This is my desired output [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]This is what I get instead [[8, 6, 7], [5, 3, 0, 9]]How to fix???Ultimately I wish the program to take the digits and spell out each digit (but that is a different thread, if necessary), i.e 867-5309, eight six seven five three zero nine
You're going way to complicated here.First of all your regex is greedy which means its matching all numbers up to - and then all other after as one match.You can do this with a less greedy regex and then the match turns into exactly your desired output.See code below.Output is,from there you can do this.which outputs,only thing left is to get rid of the "point zero", I'm not familiar with num2words I'm afraid.
why not just something like this:str.isnumeric checks if the digit (as string) can be converted to an int. the rest is a list comprehension that directly generates the list you are looking for.
This might also work:
