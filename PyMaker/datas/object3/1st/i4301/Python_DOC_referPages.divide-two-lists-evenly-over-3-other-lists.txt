I'm struggling to come up with a effective but simple solution to the following:I have two lists of dicts:I want to iterate over these lists of dicts and assign them to 3 empty lists:desired output:I want to evenly divide the lists of dicts over the 3 empty lists. Each item in the list of dicts can only be in the empty lists once. So first line of list of dicts should go in list_1. then the 2nd line of list of dicts should go in the list_2 etc etc until there's nothing left in the list of dicts. Is there a simple way to achieve this? 
You can do so using while loop:EDIT:Can be done using for loop too!EDIT 2:It can be done even better way and still easy to understand for a beginenr
Iterators are very useful here: You can use itertools.cycle to obtain an iterator that endlessly loops over list_1, list_2 and list_3. Then simply iterate over the dicts in list_dicts_1 and list_dicts_2 and append them to the list you get from cycle:I used itertools.chain to combine list_dicts_1 and list_dicts_2 into a single iterable, and the next function to manually advance the cycle iterator.Results:Another option is to concatenate the two input lists into one gigantic list and then slice it:However, concatenating lists is somewhat costly, so it should be avoided if your lists are very large.
