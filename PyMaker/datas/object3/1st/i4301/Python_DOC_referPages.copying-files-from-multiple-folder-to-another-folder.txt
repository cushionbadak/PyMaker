I have a folder called Reports with multiple folders ID1, ID2, ID3...and so on.Each of these folders have a json report. Now I want to copy all these json reports into a single folder called InputThis gives error:    TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
There's quite a few issues here.You're redefining Python's builtin list function, and defining it as a variable, containing an empty dictionary (which is not even a list).You then throw away that empty dictionary and redefine list as the result of os.system("find /home/admin1/Report -name '*.json'"). That's not gonig to do what you want, because os.system returns an integer (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system). It looks like you were expecting it to return a list of results.You're then trying to use the for loop to iterate over that integer, which is what's giving you the TypeError.os.system('cp i /home/admin1/Input') (which your program never gets to due to the error above) literally runs cp i /home/admin1/Input, you're not substituting "i" for the value of variable i.Rather than using os.system to run find, it would arguably be better to use Python's os.walk (see https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-traverse-a-directory-tree-in-python-guide-to-os-walk/) to work through the directory tree yourself, rather than trying to manually parse the output of find.
