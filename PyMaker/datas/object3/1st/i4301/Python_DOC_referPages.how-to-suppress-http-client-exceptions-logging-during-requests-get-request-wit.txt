Natural Text
I am using Python3 and making requests with the following code:And if I get exception during session().get(url, proxies=proxies), I get the following in the log file:But what I want to get is only that string logged:2018-04-20 17:14:27 | RF5MR: ConnectionError!Could you please point me where my mistake is and how could I suppress those exception texts and get only the one I want to log?Many thanks!
Instead of calling self.logger.exception, call self.logger.error.exception logs the message and the trace back. All of the other log methods only log the message at the priority given specific to the method.See the documentation on the logging module.
