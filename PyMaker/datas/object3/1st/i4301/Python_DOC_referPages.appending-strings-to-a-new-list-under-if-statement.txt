After reading the file directory using this line, I got this output, Now, I would like to create another list and appending the strings with a starting with n_eff. I tried this: Unfortunately, nothing is happening there, not even an error.
The problem is that startswith is returning boolean value (True or False). You are then checking if x[i] is equal to a boolean value which is always false because it contains string.Changing the condition should help:if x[i].startswith("n_eff"):
If the output is multiline you need to split it with split('\n').Function "<string>".startswith(<arg>) returns True if <string> starts with the parameter string <arg>. You can check if a string starts with the specified sub string with this function. Using list comprehension it can be written as:edited considering output a list.
...     'n_eff_doping_center1_4.txt']Are you trying to do something like this?
