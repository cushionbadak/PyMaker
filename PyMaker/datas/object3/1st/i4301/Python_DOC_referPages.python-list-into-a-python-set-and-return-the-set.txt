I just started coding. Need help with this. I have a list I need to make it into a set, now the catch is without using a set() function. Why is this not working?
When you declare y = {}, you create an empty dict, not an empty set.To create an empty set, you need y = set().For your exercise, you could store your unique values in a set (if you don't consider using set() to create the empty set cheating):Or you can use a list:But of course, the efficient, not-an-exercise way would be to just write y = set(x)
I don't know how strict is the expected task, but you can just do this (you are not using set()):
Do this: About your error - you cannot create set with y = {} (empty braces). In that case the type of y will be dict. However, for example, y = {1, 2} will create a set (as it is not empty).
