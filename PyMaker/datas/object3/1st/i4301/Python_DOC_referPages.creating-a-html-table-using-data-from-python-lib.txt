I want to display data from an xls file into an HTML table. I am using openpyxl to read data from xls file. I used HTML codes to create a table using HTML tags, but I am unable to put data inside the table using variables. I am able to print sheet['A2'] and see the value from xls file. I have assigned this value to a variable a2. How can I print the value from this variable inside HTML. More specifically, how can I put the value of variable inside this tag: <tr><td class="cell">{%sheet['A2']%}</td> <td class="cell">Cell 1.2</td></tr>
One way would be to use string formatting:Or using f-strings:Or use named replacement fields in the format string with a dictionaryYour string:If using Python version 3.6+ use an f-string:Or use traditional formatting;
