This question already has an answer here:How to perform element-wise multiplication of two lists in Python?                    14 answers                If I have a list data_x = [1,2,3,4], how do I multiply each element of data_x with each element of another list data_y = [2,3,4,5] and sum the values?The answer should be 1*2 +2*3 +3*4+ 4*5 = 40. I am looking for some kind of for loop.
Try this (using a for loop, as requested by the OP):Another (quicker) way (using list comprehensions):You could also try this (if you have numpy installed):
Use zip to perform index wise operations between two lists:Or a numpy solution using numpy.multiply and numpy.sum:
Use thisresult = zip(data_x, data_y) creates a zip object of tuples where each tuple result[i] corresponds to the values data_x[i] and data_y[i]That is if Then, 
You can use zip to do this.
