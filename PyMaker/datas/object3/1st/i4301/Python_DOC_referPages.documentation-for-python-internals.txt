Perl provides internal documentation in perlguts. This is a great introduction to the perl source code, and helps you navigate and make sense of it. Does Python have an alternative that supplements the CPython source code? Something like pyguts or pythonguts?
The equivalent of perlguts is documented in thePython/C API Reference Manual.Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter
No there is no complete documentation for the CPython source code. The public API is documented (Python library reference and the C-API documentation).However there are also some documentations (although not complete and very superficial) in the development guide especially exploring the internals (including the links at the bottom).And you can always inspect the source code directly: CPython repository on GitHub.
