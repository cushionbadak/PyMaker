I have repeatedly installed and uninstalled beautifulsoup4, but no matter what I try to do, when I try to import bs4 in shell, I get ModuleNotFoundError. I'm on Windows 10 and using Python 3.6.4. I'm new to programming, but am on my third Python book and this is the first time I've run into a big problem trying to import a module, including those I've installed using pip. 
Are you writing-pip install beautifulsoup4 ?This will install only beautifulsoup4 module and not bs4.Do this:-pip install bs4And then do this in your python file:-from bs4 import BeautifulSoupAlso you may need administrator access for installing.
So, I don't really understand what is happening, but I at least temporarily solved my problem. I have two different "Lib > site-packages" directories in my C: drive, and pip is installing in a different one from what Python is using. So I just copied the BeautifulSoup and bs4 folders and pasted them into the one that Python is using, and now it works. Python is using this folder: "C:\Users\Victor Hart\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32", while pip is installing bs4 and BeautifulSoup here: "C:\Users\Victor Hart\Envs\virtual", which doesn't make any sense to me.
