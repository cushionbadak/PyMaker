I have this one model where I have fetch published count , under process count, rejected count, received count on monthly basisreceived count is based on monthly count of receivedon DateField in model, published count is based on monthly count of publishedon DateField in model, rejected count and under process count is based on count of specific status value of CharField in model.I'm struggling after writing below queries,I'm clueless as to how fetch data to fill the columns(see figure). I'm not sure queries I wrote will help.The problem comes when I want to zip received_monthly_data and  published_monthly_data but  received_monthly_data has data from April month and published_monthly_data didn't have April month. when i zip , results will loose April month. I am not able to figure how to do this. I need the data to fill these columnsAny help is highly appreciated.
Perhaps you could use itertools.zip_longest which will zip the longest sequence and will substitute None for the missing values in the shorter sequence. That way you won't lose the April data. If you wish to use a value other than None, specify the fillvalue argument.From https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longestitertools.zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None)Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are  filled-in with fillvalue. Iteration continues until the longest  iterable is exhausted.Note that the function is called itertools.izip_longest in Python 2.
