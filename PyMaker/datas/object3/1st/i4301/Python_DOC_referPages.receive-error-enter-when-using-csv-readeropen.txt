I get the following error enter for the code written after:I used the following code:I already saw some other similar problems (Python Json with returns AttributeError: __enter__) but the solutions do not work on my problem.Does anyone see the problem??Thanks in advance and best regards////EDIT:thanks to the contribution marked as helpful, that the code I finally used (after getting another error which I solved)
You're not using csv.reader correctly. It does not support being placed inside a with statement, which is why you're getting an AttributeError: __enter__ error. Try to do it the same way as in the usage example:Wrap open instead inside the with (because open supports it and is actually the recommended way of using it) then use csv.reader inside it.
