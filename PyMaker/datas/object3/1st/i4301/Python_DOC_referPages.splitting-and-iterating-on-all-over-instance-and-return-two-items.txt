Natural Text
I am splitting x variable (string)  in based on * and then ; and return out all info.  I tried so for below and it give only own1 info.so basically I want to split and iterating on all over instance and return two items which will then go into OS.Path.Join(path,own1,OwnAdd1) to make folder/subfolder
Use re.split to split on multiple delimiters and then iterate through the splitted two at a time:EDIT (using function as requested):Note that the function returns a list and you can access each item simply by index.
