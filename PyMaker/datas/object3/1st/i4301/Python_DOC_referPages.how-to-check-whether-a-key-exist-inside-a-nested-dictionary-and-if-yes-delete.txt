I have this main_dict created and want to see if main_dict[x]["Description"] exists or not, and if yes, then delete it. Where x is 'pins', 'nails', 'board', etc ...I tried this:This returns error if main_dict[x]["Description"] does not exist.Also this does not work:
This would remove it from any sub-dictionaries that contain it:Result:
You simply use pop() method with default argument(e.g. None) to omit checking if "Description" exist as key.Note: it's not a good practice to change iterable object while iterating over it.
Here's a simple solution:
To check if a key is in a dictionary try if key in dict to check in nested dictionaries you follow the same logic:About removing an element, you should indeed use the del statement. I copied your main_dict, and ran the same as you:Maybe you're trying to remove it twice?
