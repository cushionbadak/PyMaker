if we want to construct a list from a set, we can do This is O(n) operation, meanwhile:is O(1) according to https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/lectures/complexitypython.txtThus, as far as I know, dict is using set as its keys underlying data structure, is list(set) O(1)? And how is this implemented?
Thus, as far as I know, dict is using set as its keys underlying data structure.Hmm, no not really.  The opposite way around is a closer analogy: in the implementation, set is like a dict with all null values.  The dict came first in Python, and set did not appear until Python 2.2 (July 2000) - see PEP 218.Also worth mentioning that dict.keys() is O(1) since Python 3.  In Python 2 it's O(n) and you should use dict.viewkeys() for the keys "view" (set-like interface).is list(set) O(1)? No, it's O(n) - just the same as the list comprehension.And how is this implemented?Sets support the iterator protocol.
