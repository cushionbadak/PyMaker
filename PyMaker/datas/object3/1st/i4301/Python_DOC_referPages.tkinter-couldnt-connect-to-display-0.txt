As provided by @borrible in comments, you will need to install an X server. See this page for details.
Using WSL on windows to develop tkinter applications you have two main options.  1) Develop the app with cross-platform development in mind, then run the application via MS-DOS.  Using GitHub will help you deal with Line Endings This is the course I recommend (and I use), especially if you are using Python 3.4+ which includes pathlib.Path2) Not recommended is to install an x-server on Windows, in which case Xming seems the easiest to get working.  Once installed run :... then export your display as you did before ...Test the installation by running an app like xcalc from within WSL ...sample imageHere is a sample of a tkinter app running under Xming on WSL after i commented out the icon code ... tkinter app on xmingRunning the app through MS-DOS is my recommendation, when I tested xming it didn't deal with ".ico" files.  It is likely issues like this might hinder more complex applications. However if you do choose this route more info is available here.
