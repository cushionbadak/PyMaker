Please explain. But:I'm pretty sure it's a basic, well-known, over-discussed issue: please link to a duplicate, as I couldn't find one.
The reason is there is a conversion method in the statistics module which checks if a data type is a subclass of int. This works for int, but not for np.int32.Therefore, you can either use statistics with a list, or numpy with an array:Use statistics.mean([0, 1]); orUse np.mean(np.array([0, 1])), or np.array([0, 1]).mean().
