Natural Text
I'm attempting to compare two txt files and find the new lines from one file and write them into a new file. I noticed that the new lines are written in a different order every time I run the program. Is there a way to preserve the original order?I noticed that the disorder stems from read().splitlines() on lines 2 and 3. My code:
From The python documentation for Set:A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.When you save each line into a set the order in which the items are retrieved is not guaranteed to be the same as when they went in.A better choice might be to use a List and in fact, the splitlines() function already returns a list.You should be able to fix your code by simply removing set(...) from line 2.
