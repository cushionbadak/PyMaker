Suppose I have a list a = [-1,-1,-1,1,1,1,2,2,2,-1,-1,-1,1,1,1] in python what i want is if there is any built in function in python in which we pass a list and it will return which element are present at what what index ranges for example I have tried to use Counter function from collection.Counter library but it only outputs the count of the element. If there is not any built in function can you please guide me how can i achieve this in my own function not the whole code just a guideline. 
You can create your custom function using itertools.groupby and collections.defaultdict to get the range of numbers in the form of list as:Sample Run:In order to get the values as string in your dict, you may either modify the above function, or use the return value of the function in dictionary comprehension as:
You can use a dict that uses list items as keys and their indexes as values:You could then merge the index lists into ranges if that's what you need. I can help you with that too if necessary.
