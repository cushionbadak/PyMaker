This question already has an answer here:Elegant ways to support equivalence (“equality”) in Python classes                    9 answers                In something like thisI have a False output because even if x and y are the same it counts the object as a different instance. I can remedy using a loop inside the list and checkingIs there some cleaner way to get this without using a loop ?
Special method for == and !=:
Implement a function __eq__ like below in your class.After that use list comprehension to traverse over the list of objects.result = any(Obj(2,3) == i for i in obj_list )
