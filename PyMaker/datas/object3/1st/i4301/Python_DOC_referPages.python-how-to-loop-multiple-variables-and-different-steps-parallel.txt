How to loop multiple variables and different steps parallel?Like, in c++, for(int i=0, j=n-1; i<n && j>=0; i++, j--).
You can use the built-in function zip() to iterate multiple iterables in parallel:Possible output:zip() will stop iteration once the first iterator is exhausted. When you want to continue until the last is done, providing fill values for the others, you can use itertools.zip_longest().For reference:https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ziphttps://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest
In Python, for loops are usually iterated over a sequence (such as but not limited to: a list, numpy array, a range, enumerated type, dict items etc).The below implementation is a zip'd form of two range objects:The limitation in this approach is that the two sequences (one over i and one over j must be of the same length.However, if say i iterates over n elements and j over m elements, then the number of times the loop will be executed will be min(i, j), i.e., the execution exits the loop as soon as one of the sequences is completed.
