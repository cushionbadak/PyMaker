Natural Text
I want to identify if a string contains a date formatted as MM/DD/YY. It can be any date, as long as its in that format. Not sure how I would denote this. Data:This is one account's worth of data. There are approx 30 accounts I need to iterate through. The issue is that each section of data is separated by some text that is not necessary.   My current script grabs the account # along with yesterday's data:I was hoping that there would be a way to just find any string that began with a date formatted as MM/DD/YY            
You can use this regex to recognize this model MM/DD/YYYY :date_regex = '(0[1-9]|1[12])\/(0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1])\/(\d{4})'regexr exampleand you can use this for MM/DD/YY :regexr example
Using regexOutput:In your case:
You can use re module to find data and you consider to validate the date if it is valid using datetime module
This is how I would extract the date elements from the string:Checking if these give a valid date might be a solution to your problem.
