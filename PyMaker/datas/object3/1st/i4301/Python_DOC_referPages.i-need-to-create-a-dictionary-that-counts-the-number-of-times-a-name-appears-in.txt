I have this code so far:which is resulting in:but I need it to only print the first names, not the lasts. How would I do that? I know that I should use the split function but anytime I do name_list.split() it returns with an attribute error. 
I would create a temporary variable at the start of the for loop which would contain the split name, like so:Note that the .split() function returns a list, so to get the first name, you have to get the item at index 0.Hope that helps!
The Counter from the collection module does just that! You can use: EDIT: I'll let you figure out how to parse the firstname :)
You are very close! What you are doing in your function right now is just looking at the full name, while the directions say you should just be looking at the first name and seeing how much it appeared. what you should have is something like this. While looking through each word in the loop, make an array, lets say name and set it to word.split(). Then like in your following code, check if name[0] (the first name) exists in the list, and increment name_dict[name[0]] if it does. If not, make a new key with name[0] and set it to 1.
This can be achieved in a single line using list comprehensions.
