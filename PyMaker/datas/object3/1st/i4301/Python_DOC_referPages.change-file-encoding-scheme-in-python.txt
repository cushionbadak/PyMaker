I'm trying to open a file using latin-1 encoding in order to produce a file with a different encoding. I get a NameError stating that unicode is not defined. Here the piece of code I use to this:I'm not used at all to handling files so I don't know if there is a module I should import to use "unicode"
The fact that you see unicode not defined suggests that you're in Python3. Here's a code snippet that'll generate a latin1-encoded file, then does what you want to do, slurp the latin1-encoded file and spit out a UTF8-encoded file:If you want the output to be something other than UTF8, add an encoding argument to open, e.g.,The docs have a list of all supported codecs.
