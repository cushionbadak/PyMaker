I'm working on a Python code and I need to round the values of this following array:And finally get: I tried the following method but it doesn't work.
You can use list comprehensions:Output:Edit: 2.7 and 3.6 behave differently - I used a 2.7 shell.See round()Note The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for  example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. This  is not a bug: it’s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions  can’t be represented exactly as a float. See Floating Point  Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations for more information.You can fix it by creating your own round-Method:This will lead to the same results on 2.7 and 3.x.
