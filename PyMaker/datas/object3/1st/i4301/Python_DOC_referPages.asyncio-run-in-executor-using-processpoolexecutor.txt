I tried to combine blocking tasks and non-blocking (I/O bound) tasks using ProcessPoolExecutor and found it's behavior pretty unexpected.I was expecting that both tasks will have control concurrently, but blocking task started in ProcessPoolExecutor blocks and never return control. How could it happen? What the proper way to combine normal coroutines and futures started in multiprocessing executor?
This line:Will actually run the blocking function and give its result to the executor.According to the documentation, you need to pass the function explicitly followed by its arguments.
