Natural Text
The task is to convert an input in seconds to a time that is readable for humans in the format HH:MM:SS.So far this is what I have, and it works.The only problem is that the hours should be displayed in a range from 00 - 99, currently it is in 24 hours. e.g. with an input of 359999 seconds, it should output 99:59:59. This is also the maximum time by the way. Errors:'00:00:00' should equal '24:00:00''03:59:59' should equal '99:59:59''20:36:54' should equal '44:36:54'Question: How to put the hours in the 99 format?
I think you can roll your own seconds parser. For example:
Here is a solution using divmod instead of the time module.Here are output examples.
