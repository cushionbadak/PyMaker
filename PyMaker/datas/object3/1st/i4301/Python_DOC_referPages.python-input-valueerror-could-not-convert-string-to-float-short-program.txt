The error is as follows:if float(user_input):ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'stop' (line 10).I am typing input in as1.02.03.0stop
float('stop') will raise an exception that you have to catch with a try: ... except ...: ... block.Additionally, float(user_input) evaluates to False when user_input is 0.0 (or 0), so that number would never be added to the list.You can change:to:to fix your program.
