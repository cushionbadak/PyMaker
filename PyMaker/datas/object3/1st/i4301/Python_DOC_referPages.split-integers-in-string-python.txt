I've got a bunch of numbers in a string.  I want to split them into individual digits so I can do more with them later.I want to split these like so....ex: 6, 1, 8, 6, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 0, 1, 8I've tried split(), I've tried list(str(number)), I've tried converting these to strings and integers and I have tried searching stackoverflow.In other searches I keep seeing a list comprehension example like this, which I don't understand and don't get the desired result after trying:    [int(i) for i in str(number)]help??
First you have to consider every element of the list as a string, and then cast back every character to an integer.
How about a list comprehension:which produces a list of strings:['6', '1', '8', '6', '4', '1', '2', '1', '8', '0', '1', '8']or if you'd prefer a list of single-digit integers:
You can use itertools.chain like so:I posted this mainly so I could compare it to a Coconut equivalent:while looks nicer. If you like Unicode characters, you can replace |> with â†¦:In standard Python, a list comprehension is probably more readable.
