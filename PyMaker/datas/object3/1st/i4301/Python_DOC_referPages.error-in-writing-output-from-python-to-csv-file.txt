I am supposed to generate a csv file with 10 columns (from A to J) with 10000 rows that contain random numbers between 1 to 1000. I am able to get the desired output but cannot write this output to a csv file. Please find my code and the generated error message below. Error Message 
It looks like writenow only takes the string as an arg, nothing else.https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.csvwriter.writerowIf you want a \t at the end just do chr(i)+'\t'. Char just converts a single character though. I think you're looking for str(i)+'\t'So,csv_write.writerow(str(i)+'\t')And csv_write.writerow(str(random.randint(1,10001))+'\t'When you specified delimiter \t when creating the csv_write I think it will end the row with \t anyway so you don't need to append it to the end. Might have to try it out. 
According to this document when you open a CSV file for write, you will give a delimiter and quotechar and other staff, so here in your case you dont need to pass end="\t" to writerow. this method just gives a list to write in your file. good luck.
