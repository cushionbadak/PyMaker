I'm checking if the instance of a property is of a certain type, but in that evaluation it's returning as a property object, not the getter that I have assigned to it.Other answers to similar questions suggest that it could be because the getter uses something that isn't defined yet, but as far as I can tell everything is already defined.Definition:Failing usage:
This should work:Because you are comparing a @property decorated function to the type of an instance of whatever you return from get_scene. I am assuming self._scene_stack[...] is of GameScene.You should be careful when using the @property decorator, because it is a special decorator in that it provides extra properties (just try typing in  property().getter). By nature, decorators like:Does essentially foo(bar()), so I'm not sure if that's your actual use case for the decorator in the first place.
In python, property() is a built-in function which creates and returns a property object.The signature of this function is:property(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None). fget is getter, fset is setter and fdel is deleter attributes of property.When you write a property like:@property def foo():     return 'something'it is internally mapped to foo=property(foo). And the returned value is a property object.You can check it by isinstance(foo, property). It will return True.For more details, follow property in python.
