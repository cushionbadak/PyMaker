Following code line produces an SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 57-58: malformed \N character escape:This is a filepath, that I Need to Keep.Spyder Shows that \\S24014 is the Problem. The file has # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the top. How to solve the Problem?I am using Spyder 2 with Python 3.5 and PyQt4
It sounds as if you need to pass the string as a raw string literal, i.e. r'\\S24014\\file.xlsx.Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a  letter r or R; such strings are called raw strings and treat  backslashes as literal characters.
