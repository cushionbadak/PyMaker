I can write 'something '.strip() and get something in return or I can type str(8) and get '8' in return. Also, type ('a') returns str as the response. Is str a function (which converted a numeric 8 to '8') or a class, which has methods such as strip(), etc.?
It is a class, whose constructor can get any Python object, and attempts to convert that to a string according to rules built-in the language.The first thing it tries to do is to call the __str__ method in the passed in object. If that does not exist, it tries to call the __repr__ method. Whatever is returned is used as the new built string.However, str is trully the  string class in Python, were all string methods are defined. 
str is a class.  As seen in the documentationIs creating an object of type str.  It calls str's constructor.  Which in turn calls the objects __str__ function.As suggested in the comments, you can take a closer look at what's happens using the type keyword:
