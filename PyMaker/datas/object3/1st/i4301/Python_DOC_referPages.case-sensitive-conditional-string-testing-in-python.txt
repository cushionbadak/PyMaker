This question already has an answer here:Case insensitive 'in' - Python                    8 answers                Let's say that you wish to check existing usernames in a list using Python, ensuring that we check for case sensitivity, such that we force new users to select a unique username so you write something that looks like this:I've tested the code and I know that it works, but I don't pretend to be the world's best coder, and this code doesn't look to be the most efficient. Is there another way to do this in Python without chaining .title().upper().lower() to check for case sensitivity? Also, how would one test for a user who capitalised a character inside the username, such as 'maTThew'?
You should use str.casefold for case insensitivity:As per the docs:Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it  is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example,  the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to "ss". Since it is  already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold()  converts it to "ss".
using title(), upper(), lower() combined together make no sense, Just use lower() function to test.
