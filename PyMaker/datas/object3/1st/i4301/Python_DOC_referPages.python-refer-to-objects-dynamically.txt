Apologies if this is a silly question.I have a list of potential dictionary keys here:I am currently manually adding values to these keys like so:I'd like to be able to do a use a for loop to do this all at once like so:Obviously, however, I can't reference the object self.player.i like that.  Is there a way to reference that object dynamically?
use getattr, For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar.
