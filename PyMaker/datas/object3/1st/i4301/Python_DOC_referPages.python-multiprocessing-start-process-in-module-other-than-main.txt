I have three modules, worker, master, and MainTests. I'm running the MainTestsmodule as the main script. In MainTests, I call master.run(), inside of which I need to spawn multiple worker processes. Is this possible? In all the python multiprocessing tutorials I have come across, processes are started in the main module. If this is possible, could someone provide an example as to what this might look like?This is what I have attempted so far:Worker.pyMaster.py:MainTests.pyTwo issues arise:Workers seem to be running sequentially, one by one executing run() rather than running in parallel.Workers seem to keep repeating runs. I would expect that after the workers complete their runs, the program ends, but it keeps going.Thanks in advance for any help.
I'm not sure if you're still locking for an answer but you just have to put the "entry point" of your main program in this if statement:This way you can start a process in an imported module.For further information check out this bit of the docs and obviously everything else in there :)In your example it would be:This has worked for me.Hope I could help.
