I'm having trouble converting a string to data format. I'm using the time module to convert a string to the YYYY-MM-DD format. The code below is what I've tried but I get the following error. Here is the code
Firstly, the error is because you're using %Y, %m, and %d twice in your time.strptime() call. Secondly, you're using the wrong format. The format you pass to strptime() has to match the format of the date / time string you pass, which in this case is: %B %d, %Y.This is a good reference on the different format types.
I normally use datetime for this:This code returns review_date = '2018-04-18'. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.htmlThe date format for April is %B. strptime() converts to a datetime object, .strftime() converts the datetime object to a string. 
time.strptime() is for parsing strings into date/time structures. It takes two arguments, the string to be parsed and another string describing the format of the string to be parsed.Try this:... and notice that "%B %d, %Y" is:Full locale name of the month ("April")[Space]Date of the month (18)[Comma][Space]Four digit year (2018)The format string specification that you provided bears no resemblance to the formatting of your date string.These "magic" formatting codes are enumerated in the documentation for time.strftime()
