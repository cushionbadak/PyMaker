I'm trying to understand how some built-in Python modules work under the hood.For example, with the code:Where is the definition of the function Tk?I've been searching through the tkinter source code but cannot find it.The code several time calls import Tkinter which is also strange because this is Tkinter, so why is it importing itself?Hope someone can help resolve my confusion
class Tk is in:Py 2.7: Tkinter.pyPy 3.6: __init__.py.  In general, when you import Foo, if Foo is a module implemented using Python code, and there is a Foo/__init__.py in Python's search path, that file runs.  Some more information here, plus official docs on modules for Python 2 or Python 3.  That may not be the case for modules built in to the Python interpreter, such as 2.7's Tkinter.Tkinter specificsIn Python 2, Tkinter is a Python module and tkinter (lowercase) is a C module that Tkinter uses (source).In Python 3, tkinter (lowercase) is a Python module and _tkinter (with underscore) is the C module that tkinter uses (source).
Although cxw's answer is accurate and correct, I would suggest installing IPython, if you find yourself looking through the code of Python modules often. It's a better version of the python console:Then, to see the code of a class / function / module, type its name in and add ??:
