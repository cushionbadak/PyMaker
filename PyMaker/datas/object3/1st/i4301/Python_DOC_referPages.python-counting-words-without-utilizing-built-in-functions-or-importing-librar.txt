Natural Text
I'm having trouble with this assignment... I'm attempting to count multiple occurances of a word(s) in a text file.This is the data from the text file romeo(dot)txtBut soft what light through yonder window breaksIt is the east and Juliet is the sunArise fair sun and kill the envious moonWho is already sick and pale with grief
You could try using a dictionary instead of a list. When you see each word, check if it's in the dictionary, if not add it else increment it's value.
I think your problem is in this blockThe else clause is executed when word is found in compare_list. So the behaviour should be to find it's index, then increment the corresponding index in count_list - you start by iterating through indexes of compare_list which is good, but then instead of comparing it to the current word, you start another iteration through master_list. Take out the for r in master_list: loop and just compare compare_list[rw] to word and I think you'll get there.As others have noted, a dict would be a better structure for storing results - but it's hard to tell from your question if this would be "against the rules".
