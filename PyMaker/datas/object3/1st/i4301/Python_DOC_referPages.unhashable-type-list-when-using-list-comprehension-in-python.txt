I have a set in my code called malicious_urls and I am trying to build a list comprehension from this.When I run '' in malicious_urls I get a False return value. Also, I have an array input and when I run [e for e in input] I get the set back which is identical to input.However, when I try to run [e in malicious_urls for e in input] to simply obtain a list of which input urls are malicious, I get an error back saying TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'?

I think this is not a good place to use a list comprehension, since what you want is the intersection of two lists.Instead, I would use a set, as sets have intersection as a basic operation:
