I'm trying to calculate rolling r-squared of regression among first column and other columns in a dataframe (first column and second, first column and third etc.) But when I try threading, it kept telling me the error that TypeError: ParallelRegression() argument after * must be an iterable, not int". I'm wondering how do I fix this? Thanks very much!See a summary of the data (df) in the picture linked below:
threading.Thread class needs an iterable of arguments as the args parameter. You're passing args=(threadnum) which is a single int object, you need to pass some iterable object that would allow multiple args, even when you only want to pass one arg.args=[threadnum] would work, because that makes a list which is iterable.
