Natural Text
I am very new to coding (just about few months in Python) and NLTK (~1 month). I have a list of sentences that I filtered out with [ i for i in TokenizedSentences if "apple" in i ] and it looks like this-- output:I want to make each sentence a new line when I save the result to CSV file. A similar analogy would be Alt +Enter in Excel for PC and CTRL-OPT-RETURN in numbers for Mac. Is it possible? I have tried Textwrap, but the result is not exactly what I want. Desired output: Thank you!
Your itemDict["Apple"] is a list of strings. What you get when printing it is a representation of the list, not the list itself. The way Python represents lists is by enclosing the textual representations of its elements in square brackets, separated by commas. The square brackets and commas are not part of the data.To obtain the expected output of your question would mean transforming the textual representation of the list, and would give you something that isn't valid csv.What you want is one sentence per line, and that's all. It's best to use the csv module to do that, so that it will take care of the quoting etc.You'll get this nice csv file:
