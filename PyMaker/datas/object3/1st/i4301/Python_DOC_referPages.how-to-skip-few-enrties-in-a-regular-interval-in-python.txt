Natural Text
I have a data file name.txt with the following elements:I want to remove the text lines and make a 3*3 matrix. Can anyone help me with the python code. I want to run the code for 100 events.I tried the following:import itertools from itertools import islice with open('name.txt') as fp:    for line in itertools.islice(fp, 2, None):         print lineI can only skip first two lines which are strings but I want to skip all the text lines and make a 3*3 matrix.
Since you have tagged your question with numpy, I thought an answer using numpy may be useful. You can try the following:Then, for your particular example:
A way to keep only the lines you want is to use itertools.compress to filter them. As the pattern of lines to drop/keep is regular, we can generate it with itertools.repeatSo, one way to generate your matrix would be:We could also create the matrix using itertools - it might be harder to read, though:Or, shorter and nicer, using islice:
