in a Multiset it is allowed to have multiple elements For Example. if X (normal set)  = {0,2,4,7,10}, then ∆X (multiset) = {2,2,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}.∆X denotes the multiset of all 􏰃(N 2) pairwise distances between points in XHow can i Write this in Python? I have created a List X but i don't know how to put all differences in another list and order them. I hope you can help me.
It is basically just one line.
you can use itertools
A simple way is to convert your set to a list, sort it, and then use a double for loop to compute the differences:And if you want the diffs sorted as well:Another option that would work in this case is to use itertools.product:
