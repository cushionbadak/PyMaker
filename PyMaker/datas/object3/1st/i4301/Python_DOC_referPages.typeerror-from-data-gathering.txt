So I am trying to get this output However, I am getting this errorTypeError: tuple indices must be integers or slices, not strMy code is the followingIs it because I need to not call num but the row number? I thought it could work this way though. Any input would be appreciated. Thank you!Added with errorSo this is the code I wrote to help get to this point. I am reading a csv file without PANDAS (because I can't use them for the project)
You redefine data_employer in the middle of your function to a tuple: data_employer = (companies[vari], sum). Use another name to avoid this.In the following code:num will first be companies[vari], then sum. companies[vari] is probably a string. Tuple can only be access with integer. dict can by access with a key (any hashable object).
TL;DR: You are overwriting your variable name and changing its data type.You've overwritten your dictionary with a tuple! Lets take a look...First, your code in full with comments:Obviously there is code omitted (showing ReadyColumn and companies; both of which appear to be iterables of some form); but we can still address the problem either way.At the start, you declare and define a dictionary, with the name data_employer:In your loop however, you eventually replace that name with a tuple!Think of it like this:When you try to access it by [num], its already changed from key access (like dictionaries are normally), to index access (like tuples are normally).
