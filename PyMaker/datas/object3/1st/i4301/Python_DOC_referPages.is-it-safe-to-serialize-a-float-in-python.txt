I'm serializing Python floats to a CSV file viaand then reading them back via pandas.read_csv as np.float64. Is it guaranteed that the floating-point value I read in will be the value I get out, or is it possible that I may lose some precision? Thanks.
A comment in the Python source suggests this is safe.https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/pystrtod.c#L828/* The repr() precision (17 significant decimal digits) is the   minimal number that is guaranteed to have enough precision   so that if the number is read back in the exact same binary   value is recreated.  This is true for IEEE floating point   by design, and also happens to work for all other modern   hardware. */Double check you are getting up to 17 significant digits in your csv file - otherwise you may need to force convert your floating point numbers with repr() on output to csv.
