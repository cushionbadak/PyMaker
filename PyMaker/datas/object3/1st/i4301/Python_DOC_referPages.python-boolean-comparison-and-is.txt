This is an example of comparison chaining since both > and is are comparison operators. Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., x < y <= z is equivalent  to x < y and y <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both  cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).Formally, if a, b, c, …, y, z are expressions and op1, op2, …, opN are  comparison operators, then a op1 b op2 c ... y opN z is equivalent to  a op1 b and b op2 c and ... y opN z, except that each expression is  evaluated at most once.Thus, it is equivalent to:
