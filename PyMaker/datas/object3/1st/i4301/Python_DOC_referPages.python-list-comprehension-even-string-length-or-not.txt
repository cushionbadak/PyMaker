I am trying to print "even" or not with list comprehension, but I get an error.What is the reason behind it? 
You are using the % operator on a string:When using % on a string, you are not getting the modulus, but are using printf-style string formatting instead. And that requires a %-style placeholder for the value on the right to be formatted into. With no placeholders in the string on the left, you get the error you see.If you wanted to test if the length of the string is even, you need to use the len() function to get that length:Demo:
The other answers explain why your syntax is incorrect.If you are interested, here is an alternative implementation using a dictionary.Eliminating if / else constructs in favour of a dictionary is often both efficient and readable.
The % operator, when used with a string as the left-hand argument, is for printf-style formatting. If you want to test the length of your strings, you need to convert from string to the length with len, e.g.
