Natural Text
I want to split digit and number into parts in a string by python with regexp.For example :The output will be ['this','1','is','2','my','3','string','4']I found some similar question but not what i want.Thanks for helping
You can simply use re.split, just make sure you use a capturing group so the split characters are not removed.  Also I added in a check in the list comprehension to avoid empty strings when the first or last characters are matched by the regular expression.
