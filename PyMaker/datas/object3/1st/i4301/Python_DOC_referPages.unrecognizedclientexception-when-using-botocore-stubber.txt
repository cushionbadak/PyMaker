I am using unittest to test a function that makes a call to AWS using boto3.The function looks like this:I am using botocore stubber to stub this request in my unit tests like this:This test is failing with botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred  (UnrecognizedClientException) when calling the StartQueryExecution  operation: The security token included in the request is invalid.Why would this be failing? Is it because I am creating a new client in my_function() which is different from the client used in the stubber? If so, how can I test this?Any help is much appreciated.
Currently, my_function() is creating a new client, and using that instead of stubber.One option would be to alter my_function to take _client as an argument.Then pass stubber to my_function.Another option would be to use mock to patch boto.client to return your stubber.
