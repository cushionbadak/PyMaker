Say I have 100 lines in a csv file.However, I want rows 3-9 and 10-37.Basically trying to skip certain rows. How could I accomplish this?
On my first answer I showed you how to get specific columns, my bad. I misread your question. In order to get specific rows, you can use list comprehension.This is actually duplicated
You can use the panda package to parse your CSV and skip specific row.
