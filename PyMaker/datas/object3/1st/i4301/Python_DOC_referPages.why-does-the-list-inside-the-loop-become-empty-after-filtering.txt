I am trying lambda functions in python 3. I tried the example (to find prime number) given here in this link: http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawkThis did not work in python 3.

filter returns an iterator. Once the iterator is exhausted, as it is by list in your code, you cannot reuse it.The reason this would work in Python 2.x is because filter returned a list in earlier versions.Below is a minimal example of this behaviour in Python 3.To get round this, assign a list to primes instead of an iterator:
