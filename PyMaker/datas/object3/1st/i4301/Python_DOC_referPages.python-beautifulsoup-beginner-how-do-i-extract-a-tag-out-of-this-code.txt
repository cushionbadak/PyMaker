I'm looking for a bit of guidance here. I'm completely new to Python, BS, Selenium, etc so please go easy on me. My ISP doesn't provide alerts for my internet usage and I wanted to create my own monitoring for this. I managed to scrape the page I need using selenium and BeautifulSoup but now I'm a bit stuck. I have a container that has the following HTML code in it: I'd like to extract the data-usage value of 150.29. I've tried using the findAll function (previously used to get the above HTML), but it doesn't work in this case. Could anyone guide me as to what I need to do to get this number into a variable?Thank you in advance.
In BeautifulSoup you can find all tags with "data-usage" attribute like this:And then getting value of attribute will be easy, For your first match it will be:
This kind of problem is a great use case for the interactive Python prompt. Save some html, open the file, and mess around with the object until you can find a solution.https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#interactive-modeThe tutorial really does provide you all you need:https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/In Selenium, you can usually find things using the webdriver and not have to directly invoke beautifulsoup at all.In your case, you could grab that block by class name and/or get the data-usage field via a tag name (it has been a while, don't quote me on the exact function delclarations).If you want to use BeautifulSoup for whatever reason, this example will work:The more important lesson is how to find that tree, though. Get something like jupyter if you want something prettier than a plain interactive console, but I intentionally used only code copied and minimally-altered from the quickstart.
