I am new in Python. I have one doubt regarding static methods in Python. I know that we can invoke a static method by using class name (ClassName.StaticMethodName) and it's not possible by using objects (like objName.StaticMethodName).But I am able to invoke a static method by using objects.This is my code. I can call the method ParentStaticMethod() by using object.How is this possible?
There's nothing stopping you from using an object instance to invoke a static method. See the documentation for the staticmethod decorator:It can be called either on the class (such as C.f()) or on an instance (such as C().f()). The instance is ignored except for its class.
