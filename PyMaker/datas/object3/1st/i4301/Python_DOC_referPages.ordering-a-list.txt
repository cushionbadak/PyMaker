I have a list like this,and I would like to sort it by the largest number on the "zero" position for each element in the list for example,I tried to use a key but it didnt work well also I didnt know why it didnt work well..Here the keyMaybe I just didnt understand the key function.Thanks
Just use sorted (or list.sort) without a key. They already sort lexicographically.edit:Sorting the lists individually:
Try operator itemgetter function as key.Like this:    from operator import itemgettersorted(K,key=itemgetter(0))
try using index of each element :
