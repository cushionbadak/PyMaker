Natural Text
I'm trying to delete the contents of a text file till I find a specific string. This was one of the ways I thought was possible. My doubt is, when you move the pointer to the specific position, what happens to the rest of the data before the pointer? Is it deleted or does it still remain in the memory?
When you move a pointer nothing happen. You just tell that the next read will start a the "seeked" position.If you want to delete part a of file you may have to rewrite it with only the desired content.
