Hello everyone I am new to Django and using newsapi to get some news, the API returns a JSON object having a datetime attribute like this 2018-04-22T11:38:05Z. I want to serialize it into Django DateTimeField. I have tried .date() but it didn't work. Any help will be appreciated.
Use strptime to convert the string to Python datetime object.Output
