I have a script named patchWidth.py and it parses command line arguments with argparse:Suppose this script is run with the following:Is there a way to get this entire thing as a string in python? I would like to be able to print to the output file what command was run with what arguments.
Yes, you can use the sys module:Note that argv[0] is the script name. For more information, that a look at the sys module documentation.
I do not know if it would be the best option, but...Will return a string like /the/path/of/file/my_file.py arg1 arg2 arg3
