I used code from video and received :if i write this:it works just fine. However I shouldn't have to define a variable type. so what am i doing wrong ?
It's nothing about informing about type, as python is dynamically typed language, but also python is strongly typed, which means that strings can't be easily coerced to integers. You had to cast them explicitly to integers to use pow function.
Python's input() function takes whatever is given at the prompt until a new line, and converts it to a string. From the docs (emphasis mine):The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string  (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.The function pow() (which is called when you do something like a ** b) requires numeric inputs, so you have to convert them to a numeric type first. From the docs for pow():The arguments must have numeric types. With mixed operand types, the  coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For int  operands, the result has the same type as the operands (after  coercion) unless[...]The int() function takes a number or string and converts it to an integer, on which you can do exponentiation. You could also get away with float() following the same logic.
