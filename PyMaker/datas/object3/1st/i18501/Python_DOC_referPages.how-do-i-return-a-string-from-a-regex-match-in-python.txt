This question already has an answer here:Python extract pattern matches                    7 answers                I am running through lines in a text file using a python script.I want to search for an img tag within the text document and return the tag as text.When I run the regex re.match(line) it returns a  _sre.SRE_MATCH object.How do I get it to return a string?When run it prints:
You should use re.MatchObject.group(0). LikeEdit:You also might be better off doing something liketo eliminate all the Nones.
Considering there might be several img tags I would recommend re.findall:
imgtag.group(0) or imgtag.group().  This returns the entire match as a string.  You are not capturing anything else either.http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/match-objects.html
Note that re.match(pattern, string, flags=0) only returns matches at the beginning of the string. If you want to locate a match anywhere in the string, use re.search(pattern, string, flags=0) instead (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). This will scan the string and return the first match object. Then you can extract the matching string with match_object.group(0) as the folks suggested.
