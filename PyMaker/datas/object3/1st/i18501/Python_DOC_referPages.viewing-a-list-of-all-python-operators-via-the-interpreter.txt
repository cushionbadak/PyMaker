Say I've just implemented some class in Python and want to overload say the '-' operator, but can't remember if I need to use __subtract__, __minus__, or in fact the correct answer __sub__. Is there a quick way to find this out via the interpreter? I tried simple things like help(-) but no success.There's plenty of online resources to give the definitive list of available operators, but I'm looking for a quick offline method.For common operators one quickly memorizes them, but some lesser used ones often need looking up.
All standard operatorsOnly basic onesOnly numeric onesOther help subsections
Use dir(obj), that will list all attributes of the object (or class) obj. For example you know that you can add integers so typeor for formatted outputthen you can get more information via
Here's a start.
Use bpython (or bpython3 for python 3).It's like the normal python repl, but with tab complete goodness.So for example, I make the code:I'll get a menu with all of the built in functions.You can get it via the bpython websiteOr via doing a sudo apt-get install bpython in ubuntu. (or sudo apt-get install bpython3 for python3.Additionally, ipython has tab complete features, and is more widespread.One nice trick is to use tab completion to make guesses. You can't remember whether it's minus, sub, subtract, or something else, right? So, first type int.__m and hit tab:There's no minus there, so backspace, type s, and tab again:And there it is.
