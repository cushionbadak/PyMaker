I was trying to replicate the strcmp from c in python.I typed the former program and it worked but the latter seems to work as well?please explain the latter one.I only expected == to work but >,< seems to wokrk.How does python know that by <,> i mean the length of string without using len()vs
< , > for string operands compare lexicogrphical orders, not their lengths.Upper-case characters are smaller than their lower-case version.So, your code does case-sensitive comparison.You can use str.casefold for case-insensitive comparsison, (Python 3.3+ only).
Former one just compares the length of two strings.But latter one try to find which one is bigger.For instance:len(A) > len(B) will be trueBut B > A will be true, because "b" > "a" (which is the first letter of A)
