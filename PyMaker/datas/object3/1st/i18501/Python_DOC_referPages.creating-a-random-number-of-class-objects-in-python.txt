Is there a correct way to loop through a for loop and create a number of objects, but not know how many time it loops? From what i've researched I can loop through a list of predetermined strings and create objects from those, but what if I don't have a predetermined number to loop through. How would I go about this, and know the difference between the first and last object created?
What are you going to do with these objects? If you just want to create a random amount with a for loop, do what you are doing. However, it looks to me like you want to put them in a list:Alternatively, you could use a list comprehension:
You could store the objects in a list. Then you can reference the first and last items using indexing.
you could use an array to keep track of objects createdthe first object created would be object_list[0] and the last would be object_list[-1]
