I have a list:I would like to combine the first item all others except the last.The result should be a list, as the list below:How can I do this?Thank you!
This problem is related to powersetsIf you want them sorted shortest to longest:

First compute the power set of the all but the first item.  Searching on "python power set" you'll get several hits, including this one.  You didn't specifically mention it, but you probably want the results in lexographical order, and the implementation I selected gets you most of the way there.That will give you all the combinations you need, .e.g [[], 1, ..., [1,2,3,4,5]] (note this includes the empty set and the whole set itself).  Now just prepend 0 to each of these gives [[0],[0,1],...[0,1,2,3,4,5]].
Its a combination of the first element plus the powerset of all the elements minus the first and last elements:
Here is a generator. Running the code:
