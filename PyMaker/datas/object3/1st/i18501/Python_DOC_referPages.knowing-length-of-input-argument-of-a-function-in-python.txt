Let's say now I have a function:And now, I can get the information about the function using inspect:But I only know I have two arguments, instead of the information on each argument (whether it's a scalar or something else).Just making sure - theoretically, is there any way that I can know the minimum length of the tuple p used in the function?Thank you!
The answer is no.Firstly you can't assume the type (let alone the size of the argument).Secondly, there is no way to tell the length, because it's supposed to be arbitrary and the function may do nothing about the input at all.if you do want something similar, try to use *l for variable-length arguments. similarly there is **d for arbitrary map (named arguments).
You cannot enforce neither the type nor the value of the argument that is passed to your function.The only thing you can do is annotate your functions in python 3: annotations, But even that doesn't prevent the user from passing in something invalid.Note: actually you can enforce by checking directly in the function or with a decorator, but that doesn't help in your case.
