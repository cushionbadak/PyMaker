I'm trying to send data using httplib. Here is my code:When I using requests, it work very nice, but not when I use httplib It returns the following error :  (This means that it can not recover my data.)What can I try? Thanks.
Looks like you have a typo on line:Shouldn't that be params and not param. This would explain why the server is responding about the missing api_key
The third argument of HTTPConnection.request is not the http request parameters.It is the POST request body. The parameters are part of the url and should be sent as such.https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html?#http.client.HTTPConnection
Your code has two mistakes. First you are using param instead of params in your third line, but also you are passing the parameters as request body not as request parameters.Try next code:
