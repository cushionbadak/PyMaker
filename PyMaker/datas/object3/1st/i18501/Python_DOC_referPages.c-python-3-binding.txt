I am trying to bind python3 in C++.When using this:it gives this error:Even though that's how the documentation example shows to do it.I also tried this:But apparently that's the wrong way to do it.So how do I fix this, and is there any other good resources on binding Python 3 in C++?
Try following:http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/mbstowcs/
The official way of converting from char to wchar_t is now :on a side note mbstowcs is not reliable on some platforms.A quite good example of using python2/3 with c++ would be Panda3D. a c++ game engine scripted with python, that also provides a c++ module builder.
I suggest you look at this questionThe example documentation for the Python 3 API appears to have not been upgraded from Python 2 - the example you show is one of them (I have reported some of the others).I have found no good documentation in this area.  Even the new (Python 3) editions of well-known Python books either cover this subject sparsely or have code errors (usually because the code comes from Py2).
