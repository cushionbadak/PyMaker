Natural Text
I have e database as normal txt named DB.TXT ( delimiter Tab is applied only the numbers),like this:I would like to know the code in Python for skip first line (Date, I, II, III, IV, V) and the first two columns ( Date and Id), while reading a text file. (With numbers residues should do sums and multiplications etc.)After reading the txt file, it will appear like this:47  56  7   74  5886  2   30  40  7572  64  41  81  8051  26  43  61  3231  62  32  25  7560  83  18  35  529  8   47  12  69The file is format txt, not CSV.
If you are only going to do calculations on the rows, you can simply do:If your needs are more complex, you're better off using a library like Pandas, which can take care of headers and label columns, as well as regex delimiters, and gives you easy access to columns:sep is a regex since you said it's not always \t, and index_col makes the first two columns column labels.
"the code in python" is pretty broad.  Using numpy, it's:
Using the csv module, to skip the first line, just advance the file iterator by calling next(f). To skip the first two rows you could use row = row[2:]:
