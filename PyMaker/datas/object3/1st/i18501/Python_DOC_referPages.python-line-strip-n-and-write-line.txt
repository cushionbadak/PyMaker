I have this python code,This prints the line same as in the %hname_tmp.log :I would like to remove b' and \n' before writing to the new file. Something like this:How can I do that ? I have tried ...writelines([line.rstrip() ..., but this jams everything in the new log file in one line while still keeping the \n'.
Open the output file as binary:or decode the bytes objects before writing:If your original log file contains those characters, you wrote binary data to that log file instead. You can re-interpret those lines as bytes objects by using the ast.literal_eval() utility function:literal_eval() takes strings that represent Python literals and turns them back into Python objects just like the Python compiler would.
You are reading the file as binary.  Try opening with 'rt'.
