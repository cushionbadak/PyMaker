What is dict_keys() and how to override this in a method (the way __iter__is overridden)?
dict_keys() is a dictionary view object; such objects are iterators.You can return your own implementation of such an object from a .keys() method. The specific type returned by dict.keys() is not available for re-use, you'll have to implement your own from scratch.I covered creating your own in a previous answer; there are a fair number of methods to cover.
