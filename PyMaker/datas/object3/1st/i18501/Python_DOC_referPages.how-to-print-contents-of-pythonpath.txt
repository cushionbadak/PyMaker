I have set path using Then, I tried to print contents of PYTHONPATH variable using os.environ as belowbut I am getting error asHow can we print contents of PYTHONPATH variable.
I suggest not to rely on the raw PYTHONPATH because it can vary depending on the OS.Instead of the PYTHONPATH value in the os.environ dict, use sys.path from the sys module. This is preferrrable, because it is platform independent:The value of sys.path is initialized from the environment variable PYTHONPATH, plus an installation-dependent default (depending on your OS). For more info seehttps://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.pathhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path
If PYTHONPATH hasn't been set then that's expected, maybe default it to an empty string:You may also be after:
