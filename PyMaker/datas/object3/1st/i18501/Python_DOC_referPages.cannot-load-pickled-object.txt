The problem I am having is when I try to load the pickled object. I have tried using both pickle.loads and pickle.load Here are the results:pickle.loads  - TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interfacepickle.load - TypeError: file must have 'read' and 'readline' attributesCan someone please tell me what I am doing wrong in this process? Thanks, and here is my code:
You need to either read the file first (as binary bytes) and use pickle.loads(), or pass an open file object to the pickle.load() command. The latter is preferable:Neither method supports loading a pickle from a filename.
