Natural Text
For a project, I need a method of creating thousands of random strings while keeping collisions low. I'm looking for them to be only 12 characters long and uppercase only. Any suggestions?
CODE:OUTPUT:5 examples:EDIT:If you need only digits, use the digits constant instead of the ascii_uppercase one from the string module.3 examples:
By Django, you can use get_random_string function in django.utils.crypto module.Example:But if you don't want to have Django, here is independent code of it:Code:
Could make a generator:Then just pull from the generator when they're needed... Either using next(random_gen) when you need them, or use random_200 = list(islice(random_gen, 200)) for instance...
This function generates random string of UPPERCASE letters with the specified length,eg: length = 6, will generate the following random sequence patternYLNYVQ
For cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes you might use the pyOpenSSL wrapper around OpenSSL.It provides the bytes function to gather a pseudo-random sequences of bytes.BTW, 12 uppercase letters is a little bit more that 56 bits of entropy. You will only to have to read 7 bytes.
