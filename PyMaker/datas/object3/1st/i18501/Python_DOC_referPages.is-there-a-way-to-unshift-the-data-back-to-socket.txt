Natural Text
for example , i have several kind of handlers , they both handler the socket object as request,but i have to decide the request should go which handler,thus i must analyse the request's data,but since i have read the data,the data in the request would be incomplete.the code can be described in this:is there a way to rollback the data of the request, or clone the request , so i can make this task simply done?
Python uses duck typing. If something looks like a socket, it can be used as a socket.You can write a custom socket object which first serves the data which was already read, then serves the rest from the real socket. For the handlers the whole thing is going to be transparent, so no code change is needed there.
