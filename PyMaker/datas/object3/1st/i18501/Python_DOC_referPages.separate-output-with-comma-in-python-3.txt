I just need to separate my out with a comma so it will print like this 1,2,fizz ectI can add a comma where " " is but my list will print with a comma at the end like 1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,17,fizz,19,buzz,I've gone over my notes and went on python tutorials but I am not sure how to get rid of the last comma or use a more effective method rather than just add that comma in instead of space.I asked this before but I was confused by the wording so my question came out real confusing. I understand that this may be simple but this is my first time programming so I am a noob. My lecturer hasn't explained to me how I can do this. I could really use some help/ pointers. Thanks.
Instead of printing them immediately, put everything is a list of strings. Then join the list with commas and print resulting string.
This could be a good example for learning generators. A generator looks like a normal function that uses yield instead of return. The difference is that when generator function is used, it behaves as an iterable object that produces a sequence of values. Try the following:See the doc for the print function arguments at http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print, and *expression call argument at http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#calls.Another advantage of the last print approach is that the arguments need not to be of the string type. The reason why the gen() definition explicitly used str(x) instead of plain x was because .join() requires that all joined values have to be of the string type. The print converts all the pased arguments to strings internally. If the gen() used plain yield x, and you insisted to use the join, the join could use a generator expression to convert the arguments to strings on the fly:It displays on my console:
