Ok so for a number of reasons, I've been using s = __import__('parse') for the longest time in Python2, now I sorta need to being my transitions to Python3 for certain projects (mainly due to SSL).But there's no reload() equivilant in Python3 as far as i've spotted.There's only one option:But I really, really need this to work:orAny ideas on how to get it working in Python3?
The reload built-in function has been moved to importlib module in Python 3.4:As pointed out by @JPaget in comments reload() function has been moved from imp to importlib module in Python 3.4+. From what's new in Python 3.4:The reload() function has been moved from imp to importlib as part of  the imp module deprecation
