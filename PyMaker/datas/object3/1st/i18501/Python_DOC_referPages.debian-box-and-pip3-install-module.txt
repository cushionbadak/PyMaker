I am trying to pip install the MySQL-python package, but I get an ImportError.Any ideas?
In Python 3, ConfigParser has been renamed to configparser for PEP 8 compliance. It looks like the package you are installing does not support Python 3.
You can instead use the mysqlclient package as a drop-in replacement for MySQL-python. It is a fork of MySQL-python with added support for Python 3.I had luck with simplyin my python3.4 virtualenv afterwhich is obviously specific to ubuntu/debian, but I just wanted to share my success :)
Here is a code that should work in both Python 2.x and 3.xObviously you will need the six module, but it's almost impossible to write modules that work in both versions without six.
MySQL-python is not supported on python3 instead of this you can use mysqlclient If you are on fedora/centos/Red Hat install following packageyum install python3-develpip install mysqlclient
Then try to install the MYSQL-python again.That Worked for me 
Compatibility of Python 2/3 for configparser can be solved simply by six library
If you are using CentOS, then you need to useyum install python34-devel.x86_64yum groupinstall -y 'development tools'pip3 install mysql-connectorpip install mysqlclient
I got further with Valeres answer:pip install configparser  sudo cp /usr/lib/python3.6/configparser.py /usr/lib/python3.6/ConfigParser.py  Then try to install the MYSQL-python again. That Worked for meI would suggest to link the file instead of copy it. It is save to update.  I linked the file to /usr/lib/python3/ directory.
I was having the same problem. Turns out, I needed to install python3 devel on my centos. First, you need to search for the package that is compatible with your system.Then, install the package as:Then, install mysqlclient from pip
pip3 install mysql still gives the "configparser error," and I don't know why this hasn't been corrected by now.
how about checking the version of Python you are using first. 
I run kali linux- Rolling and I came across this problem ,when I tried running cupp.py in the terminal, after updating to python 3.6.0. After some research and trial I found that changing    ConfigParser to    configparser worked for me but then I came across another issue.config = configparser.configparser()AttributeError: module 'configparser' has no attribute 'configparser'After a bit more research I realised that for python 3    ConfigParser is changed to    configparser but note that it has an attribute     ConfigParser().
Try this solution which worked fine for me.Basically it's to reinstall/upgrade to latest version of mysql from brew, and then installing mysqlclient or MySQL-Python from global pip3 instead of virtualenv pip3.Then accessing the virtualenv and successfully install mysqlclient or MySQL-Python.
Kindly to see what is /usr/bin/python pointing toif it is pointing to python3 or higher  change to python2.7This should solve the issue.I was getting install error for all the python packages. Abe Karplus's solution & discussion gave me the hint as to what could be the problem. Then I recalled that I had manually changed the /usr/bin/python from python2.7 to /usr/bin/python3.5, which actually was causing the issue. Once I reverted the same. It got solved. 
This worked for me
