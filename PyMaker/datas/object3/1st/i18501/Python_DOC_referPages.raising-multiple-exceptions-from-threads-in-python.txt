tl;dr I spawn 3 threads, each thread throws an exception, most pythonic way to raise all 3 exceptions?Below is a code example that is similar to what I am doing.What it ends up doing is just failing on the 1st host with the following traceback:But what I want it to do is raise multiple exceptions for each thread that failed, like so:is there any pythonic way of doing this? or do I need to wrap everything in a try/except, collect all the messages, then re-raise a single Exception?
There is no way to "raise multiple exceptions". In a given exception context, there is either an exception, or not.So yes, you will have to create a wrapper exception that holds all of the exceptions, and raise that. But you've almost got all the code you need:Now, instead of:â€¦ you can just do:And that's a list of exceptions.Personally, I've always thought AsyncResult should have an exception method, similar to the one in concurrent.futures.Future. But then I would have used futures here in the first place (installing the backport if I were forced to use Python 2.x).
