This question: How to make a class which has __getattr__ properly pickable? is similar but refer to wrong exception in the use of getattr.This other question seems to provide meaningful insight Why does pickle.dumps call __getattr__?, however it fails to provide an example, and I honestly cannot understand what I am suppose to implement.
