I have an Array which contains a few lists all the same length. All those lists need to be written in a .csv-file. Using a piece of code i have found it works pretty well. Here the code:I understand the basic concept of zip and zip_longest when i have two arrays which i use it on. But i just can't wrap my head around what it does with a single array like here export_data = zip_longest(*ag, fillvalue = '')What exactly happens to ag if i use zip or zip_longest on it? Since i don't have two arrays what does it zip against? zip_longest is being applied to each list in ag hence the *. That is how far I have gotten with it. Could anyone walk me through that?
zip() does not necessarily take two arrays; it takes an arbitrary number of arrays (iterables) as positional arguments.Taking this in smaller steps,*ag unpacks the nested list.  Note that it only unpacks "one level down."  You're effectively left with 4 lists, [1, 2, 3], ... [10, 11, 12], as disparate elements that will become positional arguments.From there, zip() behaves as expected (you're passing it multiple unpacked lists).You can see the equivalency:In other words, those four sub-lists are passed as four positional arguments to zip().In terms of the call syntax, itertools.zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=None) is pretty similar; it just has one keyword argument tacked on to the end.  The way in which the sub-lists are passed is effectively the same.
