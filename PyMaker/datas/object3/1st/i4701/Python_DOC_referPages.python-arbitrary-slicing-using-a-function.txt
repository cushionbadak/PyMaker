I'm trying to make a function that can make an abitrary slice of a list eg:The problem is, how to handle if a user wants the slice arr[5:] or arr[:5] in a nice way?
Omitting a value in a slice is equivalent to using None, so I may suggest this function signature:Recommend not to use the name slice for your function, because it shadows the built-in class.  Note:  You don't need to define your own function for this functionality.  A more Pythonic way of slicing an object with dynamic input would be with using getitem directly:
This already exists in the standard library
