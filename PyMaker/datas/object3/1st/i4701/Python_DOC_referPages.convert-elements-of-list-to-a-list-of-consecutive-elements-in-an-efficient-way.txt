I have a base list [1,4,10] which needs to be converted to a list having consecutive elements of each element in the base list in an efficient wayExamples:If I need 2 consecutive numbers then [1,4,10] will be [1,2,4,5,10,11].If 3 consecutive numbers then [1,4,10] will be [1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12].

Here's a one liner, assuming the list is x and the number of 'consecutives' is c:

Here is one way. itertools.chain removes the need for explicit nested loops.
