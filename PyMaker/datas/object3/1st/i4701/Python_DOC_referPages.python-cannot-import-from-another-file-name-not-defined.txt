I am trying to import a custom function from another python file but keep getting an error NameError: name 'testme' is not defined. I confirmed that I am importing the file correctly according to this SO post and that the function is top level. What else can I try to fix this?My main python file is:and dbconn.py:Not sure if it makes a difference but I am running the main python file from within a Jupyter notebook, and have a compiled version of dbconn.py in the same directoryIn response to the suggestions I tried:got the error:module 'dbconn' has no attribute 'testme'
