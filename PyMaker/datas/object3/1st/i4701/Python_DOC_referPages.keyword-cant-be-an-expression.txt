I have this code : If I put mydict(test_dic, name='python') it works, but if it's an int, I got the following error: keyword can't be an expressionCan someone explain me the processes behind this ? 
is what is called a keyword argument.  The keyword in this case is 3.  But keywords must be valid identifiers.  Valid identifiers are:the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z, the underscore _ and, except for the first character, the digits 0 through 9
Variable names cannot start with a number and the kwargs inputs has to be valid variable names
In Python, keyword arguments names, like parameter names, have to be identifiers—the same rules as for variable names, function names, etc.This isn't really explained in the tutorial. It is described precisely in the reference, but that's not exactly novice-friendly.Anyway, this means the shorthand dict(key1=value1, key2=value2) doesn't work for all dictionaries, just dictionaries whose keys are strings that are valid identifiers. Of course you can always just use a dict display, as you did with test_dic.This usually comes up in more advanced code, where you try to call something like func(**test_dic), which expands into the equivalent of func(1='I', 2='love') and gives you a very mysterious error, so… be glad you ran into this earlier, where it's easier to understand.
