As a beginner, what I understood is that Python Standard Library (PSL) provides a lot of modules which provide a lot of functionalities, but still if I want to use those then I have to import the module, for example, sys, os etc. are PSL modules but still those need to be imported.Now, I wonder if that is the case then how without importing anything I am able to use functions like print, list, len etc.? Is it that their "support is built-in into the interpreter"? 
Yes. They're built-in functions (or in the case of list, a built-in class). You can explicitly import the __builtin__ module (Py2) or the builtins module (Py3) if you want qualified access to the names, but by default, those modules are searched whenever an attempt to access a global name doesn't find the name in the module globals. They're not normally needed though, per the docs:This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed.
The print function comes from the builtins module.You can find its documentation here.Here is an example session.I first check what module print comes from,which is stored in its __module__ attribute.Then, I import the builtins module, and checks if its print function is the same as the prefix-less print.
You should give the page on built-in functions a readQuote:The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into  it that are always available.
