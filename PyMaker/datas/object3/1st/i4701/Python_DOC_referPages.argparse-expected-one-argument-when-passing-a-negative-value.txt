I'm trying to pass a parameter which is a list of values:For most cases, this code works as expected:python test.py --cb_ticks "1"  ->  1 python test.py --cb_ticks "1,2" -> 1,2 python test.py --cb_ticks "-1" ->  -1But when I'm trying to pass more than one value, where the first is negative:python test.py --cb_ticks "-1,2"I'm getting the following error:test.py:error: argument --cb_ticks: expected one argument
The add_argument method allows you to tell the argument parser to expect multiple (or no) values:but the values are expected to be space separated, so you'll have to execute your script as:See reference.
-1,2 is allowed as a optionals flag:This is an edge case, a consequence of code that tries not to constrain what flags (and/or dest) the user can define.
