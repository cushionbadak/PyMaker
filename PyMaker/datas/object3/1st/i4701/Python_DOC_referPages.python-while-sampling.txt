I'm searching to make a loop to go throw samples till I reach the result. Example:Now I want to stop till I have to tot>=100 .So I have to generate many "i" samples lists till I get to tot>=100.How can I do this?Thank you very much
From guessing I would say, this could be your solution.The condition is false if one of the inequations is false. The incementing operator += on tot is adding the integer representation of a boolean True = 1 or False = 0 to the value of tot.
