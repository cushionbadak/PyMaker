Before reading: - This is a solution that, as you mentionned, don't use dictionarySolutionWith:You can do this without for loop, just replacing as required:[Be carefull] Another solutionOr maybe you can use .eval() (see documentation) to evaluate variable from its name. It requires that parameters and variables name are the same.Here is a way to do this:Be aware that you should use .eval() carefully - see Why is using eval a bad practiceCheck alternatives to this solution - using globals/locals/vars for instance - if :  You want a similar behaviourYou think it is not safe enough for your problem
Use for name in names to remove all your String_split[params] noise.Remove the {} from your variables so you can use == rather than in.Use +=.This gets:You should also learn how to use format strings and the ** operator. If you change your FullDate stuff to a dictionary then you can use:
