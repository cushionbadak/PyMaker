I have an any() statement in python, and some of the elements in memo_field array are None. What is the best way to handle those NoneType elements in the array?
This statement must be better than above.It will ignore some of the memo_fields if they are None. It will not ignore these memo_fields: False, 0, [], {}, ()...But in fact, I suggest you do something better, like:
You could apply the filter function to memo_fields to remove any None elements:You should be aware that when using None as the first argument to filter, any values in memo_fields that are 'falsey' (i.e. [], {}, False, None) will be removed. In your case this is probably favorable, but worth being aware of.
