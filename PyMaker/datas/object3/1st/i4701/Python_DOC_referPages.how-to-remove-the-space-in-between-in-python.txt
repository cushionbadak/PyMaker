I would like to put an int into a string. This is what I am doing at the moment:I have to run the program for several different numbers, so I'd like to do a loop. But inserting the variable like this doesn't work:How do I insert a variable into a Python string?
The % operator, when following a string, allows you to insert values into that string via format codes (the %d in this case). For more details, see the Python documentation:https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting
Oh, the many, many ways...String concatenation:Conversion Specifier:Using local variable names:Using str.format():Using f-strings:Using string.Template:
With the introduction of formatted string literals ("f-strings" for short) in Python 3.6, it is now possible to write this with a briefer syntax:With the example given in the question, it would look like this
Not sure exactly what all the code you posted does, but to answer the question posed in the title, you can use + as the normal string concat function as well as str().  Hope that helps!
In general, you can create strings using:
I had a need for an extended version of this: instead of embedding a single number in a string, I needed to generate a series of file names of the form 'file1.pdf', 'file2.pdf' etc. This is how it worked:
If you would want to put multiple values into the string you could make use of formatWould result in the string hanning123.pdf. This can be done with any array.
