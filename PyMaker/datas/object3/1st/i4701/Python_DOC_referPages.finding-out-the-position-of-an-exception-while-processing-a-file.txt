I'm processing some semi-structured documents in Python and I have some code that reads the file into a tuple and loops through each line and performs a function. Is there a way of finding the exact line in the processed file where an error is encountered?The result should be:
enumerate should help:The above would give an error like: Although as good practice you'd generally replace Exception with whatever error you're expecting to catch.
In general, it is good practice to use the with keyword when you are reading from a file, especially if you expect an Exception to occur. You can also enumerate to count the lines:with open(filename) as f:        for line_num, line in enumerate(f):            try:                if (condition is met):                    do something                else:                    do something else             except Exception:                 print('Error: in line {:d} of file'.format(line_num))It's best to not use Exception if you know the specific Exception you are expecting because it will catch all Exceptions, even those you don't expect.
