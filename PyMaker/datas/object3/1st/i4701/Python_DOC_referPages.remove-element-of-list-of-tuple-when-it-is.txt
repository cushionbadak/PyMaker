I have huge list of tuples that looks like:I need to remove the ' ' and convert them all to floats, but I am not sure how to do it. I tried this:It however will tell me that a str cannot be converted to type float and I suspect it may be the '' part?
You can convert using a try/except block like:Code:Test Code:Results:
If empty strings are the only non-numeric values in your floats, then simply filter them out:Or simply None for identity function:
A simple list comprehension will do the job along with filter and map. filter will be used to filter out None values and map will be used to cast the filtered string to float
