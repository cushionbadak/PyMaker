This is a topic that I have not been able to find a straight answer for. Python's website (https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) says that it is included from 3.4, but pip's website (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) says that is isn't included from python 3.4. Some youtube videos are telling me that it isn't already installed. Some questions on this page are telling me that it is. So, is it?
yes , python 3.6 already comes with pip .You can check using pip --version in command prompt to check the version of pip installed .
