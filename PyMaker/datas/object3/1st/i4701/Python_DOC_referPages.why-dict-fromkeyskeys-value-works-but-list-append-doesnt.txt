I am pretty new to python and saw that we can get a dict by dict.fromkeys(keys, value), I am not sure why here you can use dict, not dict().?For list and int or str, if use this and it doesn't work even with the list objectif Iwhat is 'type' type?this might be a dumb question, but I could not find any answers online, anybody can help?
dict.fromkeys is a class method, basically meaning it doesn't need to be attached to an instance of a dict class to work. This makes sense - dict.fromkeys is basically an alternative constructor for a dict. list.append on the other hand is a regular instance method, meaning we need an actual list instance to call .append on. This also makes sense - appending is an operation that does not precede the creation of a list, i.e. we need a list to append to. We can also reference instance methods as class attributes, and get back a regular function object that we pass an instance to as the first argument, i.e. list.append(some_list, 'foo').
