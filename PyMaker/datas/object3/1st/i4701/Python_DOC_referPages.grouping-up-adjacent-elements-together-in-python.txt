For example, the id 1,3 and 6 have the same string so I would like to group them up into another list. Same goes for id 5 and 4. We can also assume that the list is in sorted order by the string.I would like to solve this problem in O(NC) if possible, where N is the number of element in the list, C is the number of characters in the string.Example output would be something like,

You should definitely use collectins.defaultdict:If you want the similar output as you requested.
You can try in one line:output:if you don't want to use any import then:output:
