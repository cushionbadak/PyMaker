I have a function that accepts an arbitrary file handle and either loads all the data or allows the data to be loaded lazily if the object supports random access.How can I check if a file object supports random access?
You can use seekable method to check if the file supports random access.seekable()Return True if the stream supports random access. If False, seek(), tell() and truncate() will raise OSError.
An alternative approach in line with the Python convention of EAFP is to just assume the file object supports random access and handle the exception that occurs when it doesn't:
