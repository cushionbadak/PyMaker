I am a python noob trying to parse through an XML API response using Elementtree. The response contains custom data from a form and I am having trouble trying to access some of the nested elements. Below is my code:Through this call I am able to get this response: I am trying to access the DEALID# (123456789) as well as HELPME inside [CDATA[helpme]] elements. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
I highly recommend you check out https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict. I've used this for massive XML processing and it is very reliable. 
Code below should find and print out each deal id that it finds.deal_id_elem = row.find('FL[@val="DEALID"]') finds element which has an attribute val equal to DEALID. This is example use of Xpath syntax
