I tried using dict.fromkeys([1,2,3],set()). This initializes creates the dictionary but when I add a value to any one of the sets all the sets get updated!It seems that all the three values of the dictionary are referring to the same set. I want to initialize all the values of the dictionary to empty sets so that I can perform some operations on these sets in a loop based on the keys later.  
Using dictionary comprehension Or using collections.defaultdict
You can use collections.defaultdictThe way it works, is, when you try to add a value to a key like dict[key].add(value), it checks whether the key is present; if so, then it adds the value to the set. If it is not present the value is added as a set since the default is set  as a set (defaultdict(set)).
You want a defaultdict so you don't need to initialize the sets in the first place:
