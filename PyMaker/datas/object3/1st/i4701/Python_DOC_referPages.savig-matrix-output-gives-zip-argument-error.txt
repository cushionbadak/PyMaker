Natural Text
I would like to write the outputs of the following code in a text file. It gives this error:for x in zip(c(), R1):TypeError: zip argument #1 must support iterationI could not find any solution. Any help please?I appreciate your help.
Both c() and R1 are both simple values, not lists. So to write them to a file with a tab, you would just need:For example:This would create your txtfile.txt as follows:To write extra variable for each row, I would recommend you switch to using a CSV writer as follows:
Input to the zip function must be *iterables such an array or list.Please try below, hopefully it will work.Documentation for zip in python3 is available here.
When you are using zip(), you are working with lists.List contains arrays, your function and random number are just number without [] which demonstrats an array. so you can use without its for loop containing zip().f.write("{0}\t{1}\n".format(c(),R1))The other point: Bring functions out of the with open order.
