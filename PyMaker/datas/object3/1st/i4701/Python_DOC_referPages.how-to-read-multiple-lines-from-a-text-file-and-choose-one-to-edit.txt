I am a university student and have to prepare a lesson in Python to give to a class of year 9's. I have created an address book program which allows them to create an address book and add entries and view the book. The one part I can't figure out is how to edit entries. You basically have to be able to pick one out of several lines and then type new data which will save over the original line.When adding entries originally, I take in the name, age, address and city in separate variables and then write them to a text file with commas between them.I wasn't sure what information to give over just yet as I don't usually use Stack Overflow so if you need any more information or code please just let me know!Thank you!DavidEdit I've added all the code below. It prints to a text  file and separates them by commas. 
I understand that you want to create your address book as a CSV file (store one entry per line, and use commas to separate the fields of a given entry). Is that your goal? To manage such a file, the easiest solution is to use the csv module from the standard Python library. Here is a link to the documentation page:https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples
