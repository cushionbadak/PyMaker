I've tried encode() and it doesn't work. I keep getting TypeError: must be str, not bytes because normally I'd get TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'.I dont understand what I did wrong?
If you look at the documentation for socket.send, you can see that the first argument is bytes, not a string. You encode a string with a particular encoding to turn it into bytes, and you decode bytes with a particular encoding to turn them into a string:str.encode and str.decode default to utf-8.
