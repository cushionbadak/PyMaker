I am using a bunch class to transform a dict to an object.The problem is , i have a key with a dot in its name({'test.this':True}).So when i call:I have the attibute:But i can't access it:i got an AttributeError.How can i access this attribute?
You can use getattr:Alternatively, you can get the value from the object's __dict__. Use vars to get spam's dict:
Implement __getitem__(self, key):Edit:I don't recommend accessing d.__dict__ directly from a client of a D instance. Client code like thisis trying to reach into the underpants of d and requires knowledge about implementation details of D.
A correct suggestion would be to avoid using dot in the variables.And even if we use somehow, its better to get it using getattr.If we are being stubborn by avoid standards so this may help.Not provided test.this as the key. You may want to create a nested dict iterating through the keys having dots.
Try spam["test.this"] or spam.get("test.this")
