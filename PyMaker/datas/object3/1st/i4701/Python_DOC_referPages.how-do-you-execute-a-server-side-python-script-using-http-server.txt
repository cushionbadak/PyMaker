I have a collection of python scripts, that I would like to be able to execute with a button press, from a web browser.Currently, I run python -m http.server 8000 to start a server on port 8000. It serves up html pages well, but that's about all it does. Is it possible to have it execute a python script (via ajax) and return the output, instead of just returning the full text of the .py file.Additionally, if not, is there a simple (as in only 1 or 2 files) way to make this work? I'm looking for the equivalent of PHP -s, but for python.For completeness, this is my html
Add --cgi to your command line.Then place your python scripts in ./cgi-bin and mark them as executable.You may need to slightly modify your python scripts to support the CGI protocol.Here is the server running:Reference: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler
http.server merely serves static files, it does not do any serverside processing or execute any code when you hit a python file. If you want to run some python code, you'll have to write an application to do that. Flask is a Python web framework that is probably well-suited to this task.Your flask application might look something like this for executing scripts...And of course, I should include an obligatory warning 'having a webserver execute commands like this is insecure', etc, etc. Check out the Flask quickstart for more details.
