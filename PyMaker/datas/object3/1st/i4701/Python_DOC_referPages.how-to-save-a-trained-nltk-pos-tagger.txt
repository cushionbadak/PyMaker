This question already has an answer here:NLTK Tagging spanish words using a corpus                    3 answers                I was wondering how to save a trained NLTK (Unigram)Tagger. I train a Portuguese UnigramTagger with the following code, depending on the corpus it may take a while for it to run, so I'd like to avoid rerunning it.So I get uni_tagger from this function and I have to recompute it if I'm running the program again. Maybe I can save uni_tagger somehow so that next time I just need to read it (weights and such) from a file.
You can use something like pickle to persist your model to disk.You can also used sklearn's replacement of pickle (joblib.dump & joblib.load)Sklearn claims that joblib is more efficient than pickle for larger numpy like model arrays.You can read more herehttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html
