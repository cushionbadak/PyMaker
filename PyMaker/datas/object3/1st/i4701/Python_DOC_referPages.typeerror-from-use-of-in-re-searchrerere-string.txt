Natural Text
According to the docs, "|" can be used to create a regular expression that matches either of the patterns separated by "|".I am trying to use the following to see if moves contains a string that matches one of "UP""DOWN""LEFT""RIGHT":But I keep getting the "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'str' and 'str'".  How to fix it? I tried looking online but there are few samples that show the use of "|" in re. Is it not commonly used for some reason? 
This is, unfortunately a typo, but the answer goes a little deeper than that.| is the bitwise OR operator. It is defined for integers only, not strings. On the other hand, the "|" character (note the quotes) is the regex OR pipe, and is used to specify a conjunction on patterns. In summary, the | needs to be inside the pattern string, not outside.For more information on the various constructs available in regular expression mini-language, see the official Regular Expression HOWTO. The subsection on Regex Metacharacters, in particular (which explains the use of the OR pipe amongst others) should be helpful.
