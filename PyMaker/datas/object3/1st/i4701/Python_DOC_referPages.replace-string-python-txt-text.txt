Natural Text
I have a book in txt format. I would like to create 2 new text: in the first, I would like to replace all occurencies of the string "Paul" with Paul_1, in the second with Paul_2.I wrote this code:There is a problem, often some Paul are skipped and therefore, in the end, I have in the same document both Paul and Paul_1 (and Paul and Paul_2). Where is the problem?
This should help.
