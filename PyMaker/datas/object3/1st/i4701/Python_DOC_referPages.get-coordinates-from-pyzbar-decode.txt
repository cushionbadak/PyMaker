I'm trying to get the coordinates from a scanned QR-code using the pyzbar module. If I use the following code below to do this:I get the following result:[Decoded(data=b'Part4', type='QRCODE', rect=Rect(left=172, top=332, width=75, height=76))]The problem however, is that I do not know how to just extract the rect part of this string. I'm using spyder, and if I go to the variable explorer to try and see how the variable is built-up, I get the following error:AttributeError("Can't get attribute 'Rect' on ",)Anyone know what could be it?
