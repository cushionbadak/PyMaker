I am trying to pass a pipe delimited string as a parameter in my url in django, but it fails to route to the respective view.This is my pipe delimited string:"main/1|adel|1|1989-09-19|1|1|test alert|2018-03-16-09-26-00|test module|1|1|test encounter"and this is my url pattern:
\w doesn't match |:For Unicode (str) patterns:Matches Unicode word characters; this includes most characters that can be part of a word in any language, as well as numbers and the underscore. If the ASCII flag is used, only [a-zA-Z0-9_] is matched (but the flag affects the entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit [a-zA-Z0-9_] may be a better choice).Adjust your pattern, e.g. by capturing [a-zA-Z0-9_|]:
