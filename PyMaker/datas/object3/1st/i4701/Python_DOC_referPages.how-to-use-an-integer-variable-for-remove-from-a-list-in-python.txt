I am making a small python program for an address book and I'm trying to create an edit feature.I take in the data from a .txt file and you choose which entry you want to edit. I'm then trying to remove that one from the list so it can all be rewritten to the .txt file without having a duplicate entry.From what I can find I need to usebut because I take in a number and store it in a variable I can't use the variable (choice) for the index. How can I fix this?editSo in the .txt file I currently have 3 entries. The third of which needs editing.The code I have already reads the 3 lines into the list soIndex 0 contains the first lineIndex 1 contains the second lineIndex 2 contains the third lineOnce the user inputs which entry they want to edit I want that index removing from the list so it only contains 2 and then later on in the program I simply take in the details the user wants to readd and rewrite the 3 entries into the .txt file again.
First of all, use lower case for variable names: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-namesSecond, you should use the csv module to read and write csv files: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.htmlThird, you should print the number of the line:Fourth: del (or pop) will remove an element by index. This is what you want, but be sure to use choice - 1 (credit to digitalLink).With pop, you retrieve the entry and are able to modify only some values (e.g. if a value entered is empty, keep the current value) and put back the entry at the end of the list.But note that you can modify editList[choice-1] in place: editList[choice-1][0] = name, ...Fifth: you should not append to editList but to an editEntryList:And then:Sixth: I'm not sure a flat file is the best option. Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html?highlight=sqlite#module-sqlite3.
I think you forgot to subtract 1 from choice
