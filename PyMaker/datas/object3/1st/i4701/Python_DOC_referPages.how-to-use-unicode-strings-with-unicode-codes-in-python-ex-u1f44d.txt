How do I use Unicode strings in Python? Say I want to use the Unicode U+1F44D (which is the thumbs up emoji). Do I use u'U+1F44D', u'1F44D', or u'0x1F44D'? Or should I use chr(0x1F44D)? I'm just not sure.Thanks for your help, and sorry if this wasted your time.
Unicode characters at codepoints above 0xffff can be entered as literals like this: "\U0001f44D".For characters bellow 0xffff, the four digit version uses the  u character, like in \u2654.If you have your emoji code as numeric data during program  runtime, not at coding time, you can use the chr build in - actually, you can use the chr builtin all along. The inconveninence is that it yields a single character string, always:  chr(0x1f44d).Back to literals, it is also possible to use the official unicode name for the character inside a Python 3 literal string - for that, use the \N prefix and enclose the character name between {}: "\N{THUMBS UP SIGN}".If you want to fetch characters by name at runtime, use the unicodedata.lookup: import unicodedata; unicodedata.lookup("THUMBS UP SIGN")
