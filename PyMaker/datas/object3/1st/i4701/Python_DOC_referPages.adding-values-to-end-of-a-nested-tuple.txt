Natural Text
I have a nested tuple in the form:The 1st element in each tuple is the start date and the 2nd element in each tuple is the end date. I want to find the difference in time between the 2 dates and then append the answer as a 3rd element in each tuple... So far I have the following:I need this duration value to be appended as the 3rd element in each tuple.. I don't know how though..Any help appreciated.
Here is one way:which could be slightly easier to read as:Even though you cannot mutate tuple objects to append a new component, you can concatenate tuple objects using +, which creates a new tuple from the constituent tuple objects, and this is perfectly good for your problem at hand.
You can use map in combination with a conversion function. 
Tuples are immutable data structure. So you cannot append values to tuple. Check out immutable sequence types.This may work for you,
