I'm trying to make multiple directories in python but it's saying the file doesn't exist even though I just created it above the code is below, help would be much appreciated. Output
You're trying to change directories into the testProject/css/assets folder instead of the testProject/assets folder.The quickest way to get there from the css folder is with something like os.chdir('..\assets'), though there are lots of other ways to maneuver using os.pardir and other os.path manipulations.
