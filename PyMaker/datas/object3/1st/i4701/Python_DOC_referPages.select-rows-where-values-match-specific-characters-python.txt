I have a series that looks like this:I need to select all rows whose strings begin with 'dh' or 'kj'I attempted to use .startswith() and .match(); but i get boolean returns of True and False instead of the values of the list.I tried this as part of a dictionary as well and got the same bool returns and not the valued themselves.Is there something else I can do?
Try Explanation: (s.str.startswith('dh')) | (s.str.startswith('kj')) is the logical condition you care about, and then putting that inside of s[] slices the series by rows, returning only the rows where the condition is True
pd.Series.str.containspd.Series.isinstr.startswith within a comprehensionTime TestsFunctionsTestingResultsConclusionsThe only real winner (and only just barely) is isin and it also happens to be the least general.  You can only really extend its use so long as you are looking at just the first 2 characters.Other than that, the other methods all seem to perform with similar time complexity.
