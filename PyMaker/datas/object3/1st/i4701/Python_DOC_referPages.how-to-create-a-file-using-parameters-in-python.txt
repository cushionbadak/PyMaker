I'm currently creating a file transfer client-server. What I need to do is to make the client create a file using parameters (if I'm not wrong, this is the same thing as an argument). So, what I'm looking for is to runpython server.pyand thenThis is the server code:This is the client code:What I'm looking for is to make the client create the file that it will be sent to the server.Sorry for the code in portugese. If someone needs more clarification, just ask.
You can access the command line arguments using sys.argv, which is a list of the arguments passed to the script. Here's an example:Save this to test.py then execute this program with this command line:The first script argument is the name of the python script itself. The second is the first argument. You can use this in your client.py script to set the output file name:The length of sys.argv is used to ensure that at least 2 arguments are present; the first being the script name, the second the output filename. Any additional arguments would simply be ignored.
