I'm trying to mock the return value of a MagicMock instance's function, but the result doesn't go as I expected:Instance g hasn't changed but its name changes?And when I try:Why does g's call become a part of f.goo's call?Even:
This behaviour not very intuitive, but is per expectation.See-https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.assert_has_callshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.mock_callsThe calls to the returned values are also tracked in the mock_calls.Use the any_order flag.
