Natural Text
I'm trying capture all the text across multiple lines of text using Python's regex package. The text I have is, as you'll notice it's SQL. Why that's relevant is that I want to capture everything between the "SELECT" phrase and the "FROM" phrase. In the example below I've got 3 items, column1,column2,sum(column3) but I could have many more. Also, I only know that I will likely have a \n or a \r but I don't know if it will be one or more. My regex thus far has been Thanks in advance for the help. 
I think your problem is just that you don't know about the DOTALL flag.If you're trying to find a bunch of anything including newlines, you don't need to try to figure out a query involving everything-but-newlines plus newlines, just use DOTALL and now . means anything including newlines.So:And now result will be:I'm not sure whether you want .*? or .*, and whether you want to enforce whitespace after SELECT and before FROM, so I guessed at what you're trying to do.
