I'm trying to make my 'own Fraction class'.Almost all code work fine, but at /, >, <, these are not working.I have no idea what's wrong with my code.I get the following output:Am I defining __div__ correctly?
Python 3.x uses __truediv__ and __floordiv__. __div__ is used in python 2.x.To make comparison work you need to define __lt__, __gt__, __ge__ and __le__.
