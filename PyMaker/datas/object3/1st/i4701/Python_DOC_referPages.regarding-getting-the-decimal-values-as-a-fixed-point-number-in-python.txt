I have some decimal values as:0   11.586  11.915  11.0340   4.896   9.675   13.5640   8.676   1.275   17.0340   18.424  15.115  13.3160   1.174   7.515   21.2960   24.054  1.855   17.7460   0.164   21.775  2.776But i need the values in neat format and like this:0   11.586  11.915  11.0340   04.896  09.675  13.5640   08.676  01.275  17.0340   18.424  15.115  13.3160   01.174  07.515  21.2960   24.054  01.855  17.7460   00.164  21.775  02.776Since the latter once looks neat...So, I tried the following code to get the lines from previous values and only till three decimal values, but now i need to get as, (say 8.67, 4.89 as 08.67,04.89 and so on...)out.write('{0}\t{1[0]:.3f}\t{1[1]:.3f}\t{1[2]:.3f}\n'.format(ts.frame, pos))What are the modifications i need to do in the code..??Any suggestions are appreciated.
I'd do something like this to use the format strings to create the widths for each number being converted to a printable format:The 0> part above will zero fill the padding on the left hand side.Also I'd recommend having a look at the decimal module in the standard library, this will let you represent fixed point numbers without having to write the code yourself.
