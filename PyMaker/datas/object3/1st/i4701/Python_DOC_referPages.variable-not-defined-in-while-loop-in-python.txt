Natural Text
I am trying to write a simple program in python to read command line arguments and print a final word based on the arguments. If there is any argument of the form "-f=" then the  will go to the front of the final printed word. Similarly for "-e=" the text goes to the back and if there is -caps as an argument then the final printed word will all be uppercase. I do a while loop to scan through the arguments and check for these flags. The full code is:I had a couple of if statements later on to print out the word based on whether frnt_wrd and lst_wrd were not equal to None (i.e. a value had been assigned to them) but nothing was printing out. To check the problem I did:and the output actually gives me front as the desired array (when there is an argument of the form "-f=" but returns frnt_wrd as None even though I defined:When I type exactly this line outside of the while loop it actually works but why is it not defining the frnt_wrd inside the while loop? Edit: The full code giving me frnt_wrd as None is above. What else do you need?I would like to learn how to do it with while and without argparse. I need to understand why I am defining a variable and it is not defining.Traceback:enter image description here
The problem is that you reset frnt_word and lst_word to None each time through the loop, so you're overwriting the value that was set by a previous argument. You should just initialize them before the loop.
