This question already has an answer here:How can I print literal curly-brace characters in python string and also use .format on it?                    9 answers                I am using python for C code generation, I want to have a function that prints the following:I tried this function:Calling "funky("egg","dog")" results in a KeyError. Relating to the unpaired curly braces.How can I print these braces?
You would need to:Use two {s and two }s.Escape the double quotes inside the string.Use {0} and {1} instead of {egg} and {dog}.
You have no variables in your string literal, you didn't escape the { and }, and you broke the indentation. Try this:The |-part combined with stripMargin ensures that the indentation of the generated code (the object language) does not interfere with the indentation of python (the metalanguage).I would actually indent the generated code differently:Since you don't need any common indentation in the final output, you can also use dedent:(Thanks @user2357112 for pointing it out)
