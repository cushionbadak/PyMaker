Natural Text
I'm building a simple GUI in python with some text and a button inside.I want to click on that button and open a youtube video.How would I do that? Mouse event? is there some kind of onclick function like in javascript?here is my code
You can use webbrowser module from standard librarysoWe need to give argument but we can't use command=onClick(url) because it will invoke the function instantly (not when the button clicked) and assign its value to command so we can wrap the Onclick function with lambda function like this command=lambda: onClick(url). Lambda function will be invoked when button clicked and it will invoke onClick function with its argument
