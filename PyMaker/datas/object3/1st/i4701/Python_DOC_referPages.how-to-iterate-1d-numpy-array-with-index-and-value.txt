This question already has an answer here:Iterate over numpy with index (numpy equivalent of python enumerate)                    3 answers                For python dict, I could use iteritems() to loop through key and value at the same time. But I cannot find such functionality for NumPy array. I have to manually track idx like this:Is there a better way to do this?
There are a few alternatives. The below assumes you are iterating over a 1d NumPy array.Iterate with rangeNote this is the only of the 3 solutions which will work with numba. This is noteworthy since iterating over a NumPy array explicitly is usually only efficient when combined with numba or another means of pre-compilation.Iterate with enumerateThe most efficient of the 3 solutions for 1d arrays. See benchmarking below.Iterate with np.ndenumerateNotice the additional indexing step in idx[0]. This is necessary since the index (like shape) of a 1d NumPy array is given as a singleton tuple. For a 1d array, np.ndenumerate is inefficient; its benefits only show for multi-dimensional arrays.Performance benchmarking
You can use numpy.ndenumerate for examplefor more information refer to https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndenumerate.html
