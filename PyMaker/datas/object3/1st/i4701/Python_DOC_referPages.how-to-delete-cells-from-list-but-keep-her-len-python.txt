I want to delete all the same cells but because of changes in my list the length is changing as well so instead of 9 loops it makes 5. For the input: apple,banana,coconut,apple,banana,coconut,apple,banana,coconut(str)I expect the output: apple, banana, coconut (list)but I got: banana, apple, banana, coconutI tried to make another list so it won't change the original list length but as you can understand it hasn't helped.Can you help, please?P.S I made the string to a list(list_of_products)
