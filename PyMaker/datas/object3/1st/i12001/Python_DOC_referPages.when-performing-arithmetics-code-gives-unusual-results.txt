This question already has an answer here:Is floating point math broken?                    28 answers                Python script seems to do incorrect arithmetics.code outputs:when expecting:What is the cause of this error and how can i resolve it?
The Python script does not do incorrect arithmetic, it is just the way floating-point arithmetic is.The main principle you need to be aware of when using float (double floating point precision in Python) is that it is an approximation of the actual value. Unless the value is having denominator of power 2 - like 1, 2, 4, 0.5, 0.25, etc, the value cannot be exactly represented by float. It is always approximation, up to the 15/16-th digit.Thus all your results:Are correct... up to the 15/16th significant digit, that is:float does not guarantee precision beyond the 15-th/16-th digitIf you really need higher precision than 15-16-th digit, consider using decimal
sum = round(sum, 3))limit float to 3 decimal points, and then do the arithmetic
