I have a JSON data as:How can I count the individual elements, like, number of person born in Jan-Dec (0 if none were born) and born in given year using python in one single iteration. Also the number of unique names registered in each monthLike: Names:counters_mon is the counter that has values for specific months of yearBut I want details too to be printed. How can I achieve this?
I'm assuming that you have the path to your json. I also tested my answer on the JSON that you've posted, and be careful to make sure that your JSON is structured correctly.
This is a good case for using defaultdicts (https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict).Depending on how the data was going to be used I'd actually consider not having the complex nesting in the aggregation and instead opt for something like aggregate[(year, month)] = [name1, name2,...]. I find that the more nested my data, the more confusing it is to work with.EDIT Alternatively you can create several structures on the first pass so the printing step is simplified. Again, I'm using defaultdict to clean up all the provisioning.
