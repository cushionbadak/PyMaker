I have a programm which imports the request module like this:The programm is running fine in the PyCharm-IDE.But when I run the same code in the console in Linux Ubuntu I get the error:Is there a problem with my path? Should I provide more information to solve this problem?According to ImportError on console but not in PyCharm PyCharm is setting the working directory.But when I add this working directory to my script like:I still get the same error.
urllib.request module is introduced in Python 3.x.I suspect PyCharm is using Python 3.x, while in console you are using Python 2.x. Try using Python 3.x in console.
