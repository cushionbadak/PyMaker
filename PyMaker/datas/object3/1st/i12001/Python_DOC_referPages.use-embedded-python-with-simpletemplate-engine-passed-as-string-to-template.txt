I am debugging an application and would like to use the bottle SimpleTemplate to render both HTML and Python. If I use a template as a separate file (views/simple.tpl), then Python is rendered correctly.If I try passing in Python as a string, I get NameError("name 'demo' is not defined",)Is this possible?
Lines with embedded Python code must start with %. The problem is that you're using string concatenation, which doesn't preserve newlines. Simply put, that string is equivalent to the following line:Since % isn't the first character, it doesn't mean anything to Bottle.Add newlines manually:As a side note, you can use implicit string literal concatenation (as shown in the code above).
