I wish to split my code into multiple files in Python 3.I have the following files:Where the contents of the above files are:first.pysecond.pyBut when I run:while in the hello directory I get the following error:
Swap outfor Your default Python path will include your current directory, so importing straight from second will work. You don't even need the __init__.py file for this. You do, however, need the __init__.py file if you wish to import from outside of the package:
You shouldn't run python3 in the hello directory.You should run it outside the hello directory and runBy the way, __init__.py is no longer needed in Python 3. See PEP 420.
Packages are not meant to be imported from the current directory.It is possible to make it work using if/else tests or try/except handlers, but it's more work than it is worth.Just cd .. so you aren't in the package's directory and it will work fine.
