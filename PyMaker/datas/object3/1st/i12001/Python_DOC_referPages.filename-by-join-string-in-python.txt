I have a simple code line in Python, use too many + is not niceCan be like that in phpSo how we write shorten in Python?
You can do this in python which would be much more readable,
What you want is join the path components. To do this you can use the os.path.join() function which uses os.sep as separator.You can also use PurePath if you are using Python 3.4 or newer.Demo:
Use os.path.join because it will work on all operating systems
