This question already has an answer here:How to check if all items in a list are there in another list?                    6 answers                I want to be able to find whether all elements in list1 exist in list2, both lists containing chars. The number of times the same element appears in each list is important.I tried using subsets however that didn't take note of the number of times an item appeared in a liste.g. It would find list2 a subset of list1, whereas I would only want my function to execute if:as this means all items in list2 appear in list1.If anyone was interested, using a counter was inefficient for large strings so I ended up adding all elements of list1 to a dictionary, with the values being number of occurances of each element and subtracted all elements of list2. If any values ended up negative not all items in list2 appear in list1
You could count the items in both lists with collections.Counter and check that the counts for the corresponding items in the first list are >= than those in the second:
You can use collections.Counter
For your problem, you'll need toVerify that all elements in list2 appear in list1 butNo element in list2 appears more often than it does in list2This can be done quite easily using collections.Counter:This first checks (using set.issuperset) that all the different elements of list2 are contained in list1. If that's true, it checks how often each element occurs in list2 and verifies that it appears less often (or equally often) in list1.
You can use issuperset:
Try to iterate over list2 and remove elements from list1, when found:If you need to keep list1, just copy it beforehand
