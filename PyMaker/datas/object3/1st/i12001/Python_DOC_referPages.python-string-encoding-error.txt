I am using python3 to call a function written in another language. The function returns a string which should be a Chinese character. But I only get a string which is b'\xbb\xf9\xb2\xee', not the Chinese character I am expecting. How do I convert it back to the character I wanted? Thanks.Update:  the code is and the result is a list :[{b'\xbb\xf9\xb2\xee': 7.313000000000102,  b'SH000300': 2631.487,  b'date': b'2012-04-26',  b'IF00': 2638.8}, {b'\xbb\xf9\xb2\xee': 12.442999999999756,  b'SH000300': 2626.157,  b'date': b'2012-04-27',  b'IF00': 2638.6}]
If you want to convert the byte string b'\xbb\xf9\xb2\xee' to the proper characters, you can call decode on the byte string and specify one of standard codecs. For example:I'm just guessing on the codec and you may want to experiment with that.It's not clear which Python 3.x version you're using, so I tested this with Python 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 and the results are the same for all versions.
