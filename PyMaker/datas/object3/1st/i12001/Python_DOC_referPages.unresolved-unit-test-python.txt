Question: When creating Unit Tests, HOW do you instantiate classes from other files?In my current example: There are two files. The first file contains the class I wish to instantiate, the second is the unitTest.py.Project.PY has the followingMy UnitTest.py attempts to instantiate that classAs requested here is the direct tracebackError: TracebackFile: 'blahjalalahha', line 6  in test_somethingMyNewClass()Name Error: Global Name MyNewClass is not definedI am getting a NameError:  MyNewClass is not defined. However, i have used hte IMPORT so I should have that functionality?
Your import is incorrect based on how you are instantiating your class: Doing this: You would have to call your class as: So instead do this:It would help you greatly to read this very carefully.
MyNewClass is part of the project module which is why you are getting a NameError when trying to use it the way you are using it. You either need to reference it from the correct module, project.MyNewClass or you need to import the name into your current module, from project import MyNewClass
