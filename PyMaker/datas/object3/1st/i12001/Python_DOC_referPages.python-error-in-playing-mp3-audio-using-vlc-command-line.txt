ObjectiveI wanted to use the os module to play an audio file using VLC player at a faster rate.os.system("vlc 'C:\Users\user\Desktop\file1.mp3' --rate=1.5")What should have happenedA VLC player window should have popped open and the music should have started playing at a speed 1.5 times that of the default speed.What happened insteadFile reading failed:VLC could not open the file "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\'C:\Users\user\Desktop\file1.mp3'". (%m)Your input can't be opened:VLC is unable to open the MRL 'file:///C:/Program%20Files/VideoLAN/VLC/%27C%3A/Users/user/Desktop/file1.mp3%27'. Check the log for details.Codeimport osos.chdir("C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC")os.system("vlc 'C:\Users\user\Desktop\file1.mp3' --rate=1.5")Where did I go wrong?How can I resolve the error?
If you are using python 2.7 you may also use the following.AFAIK, the rate switch should be given immediately after vlc. This worked for mePlease let me know if it solved your purpose.
This might be because of the extra quoting required in Windows pathsIf you are using Python >=3.5 you can use subprocess.run instead of os.system which could help with the quoting issues as well.
