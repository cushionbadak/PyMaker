The input url is mixed ascii and multi byte code.And I can't change this strings.I would like to download this url, but an error occured ordinal not in range(128).First, I tried urllib.parse.quote() but the result is http%3a%2f%2fsample%2ejp%2fapi%3fv1%3daaa%26v2%3d%93%fa%96%7b%8c%ea%26v3%3dccc. I had another error ValueError: unknown url type.How can I resolve this problem? Or do you have some ideas?
