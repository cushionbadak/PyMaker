I am processing a huge file. I want to search for a word in the line and when found I should print 10 lines before and 10 lines after the pattern match. How can I do it in Python?
used collections.deque to save up to 10 lines before match, and itertools.islice to get next 10 lines after the match.UPDATE To exclude lines with ip/mac address:
Use grep with -C option, easiest solution:
Try this
How about some short code like this in python to do context grepping:
Without importing any package, we can achieve this.Explanation:string_to_search: word/pattern that you want to grepbefore: number of lines that you want to print before the pattern matchafter: number of lines that you want to print after the pattern matchmy_file.txt is the file which contains the word/pattern/string    current_lineno will contain the line number which contains the pattern Sample File Content:Sample Execution and Output:The above code is equivalent to Unix `grep' command
