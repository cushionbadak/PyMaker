I have the following class and am currently testing it via running a file which calls the methods in this file. I then use a mixture of print statements and checking the blog to make sure the code has worked.I'd really like to write some pytest unit tests for this and automate it all, but how can I do this? Also, if authentication doesn't exist or had become invalid it opens the browser and prompts the user to input the auth code. Later on this will be handled by a gui form. Pytest doesn't take user input, and rightly so; it wouldn't be automated.
Don't test the oauth2client or webbrowser projects. Test how your code reacts to input and output from other parts. Those are black boxes, which you replace with your own mocks, so you can see how your code responds to different return values.Use the unittest.mock module to produce the mocks. If you are using Python < 3.3, install the backport mock project to do so.For example, for BloggerInterface.get_credentials(), you mock out oauth2client.client.flow_from_clientsecrets(), oauth2client.file.Storage(), webbrowser.open() and input. You can then play with the response from storage.get() to force your code to use webbrowser.open(), and test if your code correctly tried to open a webbrowser, and then called storage.put() to store the credentials:
