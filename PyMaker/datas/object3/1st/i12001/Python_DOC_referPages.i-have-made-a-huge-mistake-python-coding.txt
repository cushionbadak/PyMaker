Ok. I've been playing dungeons & dragons the pen and paper rpg with my friends. You have to have a character sheet and an inventory sheet buts it gets really messy and everything is erased and rewritten a dozen times. So I decided to make a python program to replace my papers. so I started write EXTREMELY basic python codes likeand then theres is about 60 loops of stuff u can go to including money.I realize now that I have made a huge mistake because there are about 2000 lines of round-about overly complicated code that have taken me a long time to write, and I would hate to waste it all. However I know there are better ways to do this. because of the way I've done this I'm having a hard time implementing suggestions from other questions I have asked. So if I just wanted to do a system where the value of gold is stored in a separate file (maybe using one of the methods described in my previous question) and I would be able to change the value of the variable using addgold() what should do. Once again I apologize for my questions. I should have done a lot more studying and learning before getting myself waist deep in code. Thanks.
I don't know what are all the possible stats of "D&D" but as other user suggested you should probably consider using objects, namely class. The very basic implementation of this could be something like this:From this point you can manage your character with simple instructions:, which would result in:Learning to use Objects is the perfect way to achieve what you are trying to do. Also for your other problem (saving stuff to file) the best way to start if you chose to save classes (your character for instance) by using pickle. But take one problem at a time.
