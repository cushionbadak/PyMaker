Is it possible to not assign a scientific/standard form number when doing calculations? for example right now in one of the lines in my code has:    number = 10**23 * 1.1which is supposed to evaluate to 110000000000......0 or whatever, instead im assigned 1.1e+23 which is very annoying because im trying to convert IEEE754 to decimal and making specific things print out but it wont work because of the scientific notation of 1.1e+23Ive tried looking around but no simple concise answers
You cannot change this by default. The default behavior when displaying a float is always to move to scientific notation if the exponent is larger than the floatâ€™s precision.The only way to change this is by explicitly formatting it in another way. If you know what precision your displayed number should have, you can use format:You can also use that with format strings:If your goal is to conver the float into an integer, then you should just do that. Integers have infinite precision, so they are not displayed using scientific notation. You could for example round or cut off the digits after the decimal point:For high-precision decimals, you can use the Decimal type. It allows for decimals to have an arbitrary precision:
