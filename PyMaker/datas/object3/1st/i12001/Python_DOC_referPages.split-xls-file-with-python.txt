I have a large .xls file that I want to split into several files based on the first column. The data structure is kinda iffy which complicates it a lot. Basically I need to create a separate file for every Row starting with "Question" (see below). The amount of options are variable so I cannot use chunk sizes. Is there any way I can do this with Python? I have searched a lot on stackoverflow but I could not find an exact answer. Any help is very much appreciated.
For Python to use .xls files, you will need to use something like xlrd and xlwt. The following script should get you started:This opens your input.xls and reads all of the rows in. It then uses groupby to split it into questions and options. Each pair is then written to a new output Excel file based on the question, e.g. Question 1.xlsYou might need to add full paths to the input and output files.The two libraries can be found at the python-excel website.
The exact answer to your question would demand one to create the whole code, which is not SO's goal.I would say, though, that this doesn't seem complicated to do using Python's csv module. Please have a look at it and edit your question with further doubts and/or failed attempts of achieving the desired result.
