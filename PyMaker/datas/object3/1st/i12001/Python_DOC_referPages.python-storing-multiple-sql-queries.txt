I've got a python file which has a bunch of sql queries in it depending on the arguments that are being passed example would be like this:This continues on for about 10 different queries with different complexities.Obviously this makes a mess of code, and to update and/or add SQL queries involves touching a lot of code.  What I'd like to do is part the queries/arguments into some sort of dict.  Is it possible to use a config file for this purpose where I could do something like the following?And then call via ConfigParser.  My concern is that some of the queries are quite long (10 lines max) so how would I represent that in a config file?Or do I go the route of saving each query as ArgumentA.sql and then list the directory and if the argument matches then use that sql?Has anyone approached a scenario like this before?
A dict which associates each argument with the respective query does seem the best idea. Considering this, I see several approaches for this1) Having a constant at the top of the file which contains this dict. E.g.:2) Having the same constant from 1 in another file (Python module) and importing it to the current module. E.g.:3) Having this dict as a JSON object in a JSON file and using Python's json module to load it as a dict. The downside here is that, to maintain the query's readability, each query would need to be split in elements of a list and joined when loaded in Python. E.g.:
