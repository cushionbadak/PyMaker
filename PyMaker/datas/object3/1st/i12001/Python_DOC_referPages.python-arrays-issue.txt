I tried writing the code for a problem, but the module won't run. It says invalid syntax, but it's not highlighting anything.The code: http://pastebin.com/cJVNBcYEThe problem: http://pastebin.com/p8E0E0NjI don't understand why it's not working.I have numDealers set as a variable so that info can be entered in the program. The arrays are all defined. I have index=0 and x=1 to set up the loop for the numDealer arrays for sales and commission. I have another array=index section to calculate commissions. And then I have the prints set up.Why isn't the program working? I don't understand.
Please post code in future, with a full traceback of the error.  However:should be:i.e. you are missing a colonI'm a bit puzzled by the and.  It means that the second print will only be executed if the first fails (unlikely).  Did you mean:?By the way, it appears you are not using arrays but lists.  The Python standard library includes a module called array https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html which you do not appear to be using.  So don't have a list called array, that collides with the standard library module name, and can cause no end of confusion.
