I got a strange error while working with Python unittest.  I have two folders in my project:test.py is:When I run test.py I get the message:After verifying that __init__.py was present and banging my head for a while, on a whim I changed the name of the app directory from code to prog:... and everything was suddenly fine.  Unittest imported my app properly and ran the tests.I've searched through https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords and https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#path-entry-finders and don't see any indication that code is an illegal directory name.   Where would this be documented, and what other directory names are reserved?System: python 3.4.3 [MSC v1600 32 bit] on win32, Windows 7
code isn't reserved, but it is already defined in the standard library, where is it a regular module and not package. To import from your package, you should use a relative import.
