I have a function with a string as an argument that returns two listse.g.Obviously there's code in between. I want to be able to time this function accurately for various strings as I need to improve efficiency when long strings are inputted.Sorry if this is a trivial question as I am new to python.Thanks
You can use timeit module and pass the arguments in timeit's setup argument:Demo :Output: Note that timeit also accepts a function as the first argument which is defined in your code, but you can not pass argument to it. In that case it's better to create a wrapper which will call your function with relative arguments. Read http://pythoncentral.io/time-a-python-function/ for more info.
With Python 3.7, there is a new nanosecond timer:So a range counter (and calling time.time_ns() that many times) to 10,000,000 takes 2.275888 seconds...There is also a nanosecond precision performance timer (how long does the range part take?):Or the timeit module:
Another option is to use time and timedelta. You can modify the code below
