I'm using selenium for web scraping  but it's too slow so I'm trying to use to instance to speed it up.What I'm trying to accomplish is:1) create  instance_12) create instance_23) Open a page in the first instancedo nothing4) Open a page in the first instancesave the content of the first insctance5) Open a new page in the first instancesave the content of the second instance    The idea is to use the time that takes the first page to load to open a second one.   But the script is waiting to the first page to charge completely  before open  open the next one, also this approach is bounded to only to page at the same timeEDIT.I made the following changes to the code of GIRISH RAMNANICreate the browser instances outside the functionUse the driver and the url as input for the functioncreate a pair of link/ browser using the zip function
use of concurrent.futures can be done here.Keep in mind that two instances of firefox will start.Note: you might want to use headless browsers such as PhantomJs instead of firefox.
