I have a JSON output from a web request in Python, however I'm having a hard time transitioning this data into a Python dictionary. If you look at the get properties model here:https://docs.simplyrets.com/api/index.html#!/default/get_propertiesMy aim is to decode the JSON output and put it into a dictionary. Now I'm not exactly sure how to do this. Apparently inputting the JSON output into a website like http://jsonprettyprint.com/ should've made it easier to read however it didn't work. The output is just a mashup of JSON code and I don't know an easy way to view this on the eyes. To see this output nicely, it could help me build the for loops, which are what I think I need.I think I need to create a for loop with all the relevant properties values extracted from the current property name based on the model above? Is there an easier way to do this. Edit: Hey guys,Sorry but I already triedTypeError: expected string or buffer
json.loads should turn a JSON string into a dictionary.You'll need to import json first. See https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html for more information about this.
So you need to look up json in the Python docs.https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.htmlIf you have a string and want to convert it into a Python dict, you use json.loads(string_variable). To convert a Python dictionary into a string you use json.dumps(dictionary).
