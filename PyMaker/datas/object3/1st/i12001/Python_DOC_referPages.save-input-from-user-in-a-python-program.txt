I am writing a program in Python where a user can input information that is saved - even if the program is terminated. How do I implement this?
Assuming you want the user to input a string of data, you can use raw_input() to get it, and then send it to a file using pickle library, as mentioned in comments above.To use pickle, you should before open a file in writing mode and then use this file to dump into it your object containing the string. A secure way to open a file is to use a with statement, it will be closed at the end of the statement.Later, you can get back the object by opening the pickle file in read mode and store its content in a variable.
