I have a string, and I want to add unique non-ASCII characters to it. I need to do it in a loop because I may need to add more than one. The problem is that I don't know how to construct a proper Unicode string in the loop.For example, I would like to add \u2713, \u2714, \u2715 etc to my string. I'm not sure how to do it.
You can use unichr (chr in Python 3.x) to convert int to unicode string:prints ABCD✓✔✕✖✗✘✙✚✛✜Instead of appending characters, you can use str.join (or unicode.join):OROR
