I understand how this code works in python 2Now I understand on python 3 that string was changed to str, bytes, bytesarrayAnd I have solved it but with a way that seems a lot longer that simple maketrans without references.How would that code be translated to python 3. trying to keep the maketrans method or not putting your a pre rendered table like 'abcde' to 'cdefg'.But how would this be achieved in python 3 without making one yourself.or the simplest way of just shifting a character up by 2.(or if re/bitwise can do it)I am really having fun with this, I'll take any input you can give and I will clarify if I was unclear.My Python 3 code:
It seems that in Python 3 the maketrans() got moved to the str object and the translate() got removed, but since str.translate() already does the same we don't need it.Your Python 2 code will work by simply changing the string.maketrans method call:This is one of those somewhat arbitrary changes that makes migrating to Python 3 a little bit more difficult than it needs to be :-/If you want your code to be compatible with both Python 2 and 3, you could use:P.S.You can do the same without using translate and maketrans in two lines (or even one very long line, but that's ugly). I won't show you the code, but I encourage you to try and figure it out as a learning exercise! Hint: I used a dictionary. If you can't figure it out drop me a line and I'll give you another hint ;-)
