I've been banging my head against a wall here...I want to run a particular cli command from within a python script and then regex it's output. But I get the following error:Here's my short code:This should be simple to debug but I cannot find the solution.Used the following post but still cannot resolve:Regex woes with Subprocess outputThanks in advance,Paul
In Python3 Popen.communicate returns bytes, while regex_speedtest expects str input. Here's an updated version:I've changed the r prefix to rb, which transforms string literals into byte literals and replaced split("\n") call with splitlines, since this works for both str and bytes.Update: as noted by Duncan in the comments, replacing "\n" with b"\n" in the split call would work just as well.
