Cheersmy input1: >>> dict_invert({30000: 30, 600: 30, 2: 10})my output1: >>> {10: [2], 30: [30000, 600]}desired output1 >>> {10: [2], 30: [600, 30000]}my input2: >>> dict_invert({0: 9, 9: 9, 5: 9})my output2: >>> {9: [0, 9, 5]}desired output2: >>> {9: [0, 5, 9]}
You can use a collections.defaultdict to group the keys of the input dictionary into lists by the values of the input dictionary:So, for these examples, this produces the output that you wanted. It's not clear whether you also want the resultant dictionary to be sorted by key. In the examples above, the keys appear sorted, but they are not really because a dictionary has no inherent order.If you want the keys to be ordered take a look at collections.OrderedDict.
