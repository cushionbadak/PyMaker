I need to pick random elements from a list.And the number of random elements is larger than the length of the list (so I will have duplicates).Therefore I can't use random.sample(), because the sample can't be larger than the population.Does anyone have a solution?For example:lst = [1,2,3,4]How can I pick 5 random elements from this list, like [1,4,3,1,2]?
If I understand correctly, that you want to pick at random from a population, this should do the trick:

Use random.choice in a loop or list comprehension to return random elements from your input list.Here's a list comprehension example:typical outputAnd here's the same thing using a "traditional for loop:
You need no third-party modules.  Just use a list comprehension:Another way that is a little shorter, but not as efficient is this:In Python2, map() already returns a list, so you could do:
My answer involves the random.choice function and a list comprehension.I suggest also to put the magic inside a function whose name makes explicit what it does.
