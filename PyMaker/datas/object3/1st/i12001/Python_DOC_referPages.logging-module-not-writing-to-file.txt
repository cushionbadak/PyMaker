I'm using logging module, and I've passed in the same parameters that I have on other jobs that are currently working:Using this method to create the filename:When I run it, however, it is creating the file, and then still outputting the logging info to the console.  I'm running in Powershell.Just tried putting it inside the main statement like this:Still no luck.
Can you try run this in your main file:
I add the following lines before the logging.basicConfig() and it worked for me.
If you are using 'root' logger which is by default has name "", than you can do this trick:In addition you may want to specify logging level as in code above, this level will persist for all descendant loggers.If instead, you specified particular logger, than doThe above code will create new logger 'my_service'. In case that logger has been already created it clears all handles. That it adds handles for writing in specified file and console. See official documentation as well. You can also use hierarchical loggers. It is done directly.
