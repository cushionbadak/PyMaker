This question already has an answer here:Python's most efficient way to choose longest string in list?                    6 answers                Having a problem recently when using the max() function in python. Here is my code:But instead of getting "HappyASD", I get "exit".Any help?
If you are looking for the max by length, you need to send the key to the max functionDEMO: If the key is not specified, by default the max is determined by the coerced type.
ord('e')=101 is higher than ord('H')=72
can see no error in here... ord values of first letter in exit are the highest
It is because the max() compares the ascii value of the character. I think.'e' is 0x65, while, 'A' is 0x41, 'D' is 0x44 and so on.you can refer to:http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_max.htm
