Natural Text
I'm working with a file, that is a Genbank entry (similar to this)My goal is to extract the numbers in the CDS line, e.g.:but my regex should also be able to extract the numbers from multiple lines, like this:I'm using this regular expression:This gives me the correct numbers but also numbers from the rest of the file, like so how can I change my regex to get the numbers? I should only use regex on it..I'm going to use the numbers to print the coding part of the base sequence.
You could use the heavily improved regex module by Matthew Barnett (which provides the \G functionality). With this, you could come up with the following code:\G makes sure the regex engine looks for the next match at the end of the last match.See a demo on regex101.com (in PHP as the emulator does not provide the same functionality for Python [it uses the original re module]).A far inferior solution (if you are only allowed to use the re module), would be to use lookarounds:(?<=) is a positive lookbehind, while (?=) is a positive lookahead, see a demo for this approach on regex101.com. Be aware though there might be a couple of false positives.
The following re pattern might work:But you'll need to call findall on the whole text body, not just a line at a time.You can use parentheses just to grab out the numbers:Let me know if that achieves what you want!
