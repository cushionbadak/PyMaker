This question already has an answer here:How to overcome “datetime.datetime not JSON serializable”?                    29 answers                I have a class in Python for retrieving all the columns in a table and return a JSON with this data.The problem is at least one of those columns is a datetime and I can't seem to understand how to serialize the columns so I can generate a valid JSON.My class is as follows:Any hints on this?
JSON doesn't have a default datetime type, so this is why Python can't handle it automatically. So you need to make the datetime into a string one way or another. I think the best way is to write a custom handler to help the json module.
A simple way to do it is to cast your data to string.That way, you will be able to dump with json.But, you could also implement a serializer to transform the data as you want.
