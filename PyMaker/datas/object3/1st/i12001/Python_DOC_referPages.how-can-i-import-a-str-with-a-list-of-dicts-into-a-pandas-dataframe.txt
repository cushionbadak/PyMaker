How can I transform this string containing data from json into a dataframe?I've fetched this info using a website API, converted the json response to str and stored it into a sql database.Now I've fetched this string from my db and I want to create a dataframe with it.How can I do that?I've tried this code, but without success:The code above produced a df with[384806 rows x 1 columns]Then I tried to use index... again without success:Error Message:How can I use a list comprehension to get this info from str to a dict format and import it into a pandas dataframe?Maybe something like this...I've found it in this answer but I don't know how can I use it effectively in my problem.. Any1 have a clue?
I guess your string sÂ isn't a regular JSON string.But you can try eval to evaluate it as a python object, a list of dict, and let pandas handle it :
