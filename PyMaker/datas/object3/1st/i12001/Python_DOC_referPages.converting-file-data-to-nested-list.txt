Natural Text
I have a string of numbers that I would like to convert to a nested list. So far, I haveIf the text document consists of numbers ordered like this,0000000 0010000 0001000 0111000 0000000 0000000The code I have so far only creates a nested list that looks like, [['0000000'], ['0010000'], ['0001000'], ['0111000'], ['0000000'], ['0000000']]But instead, I wanted it took be [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[],[]] and so on. I also do not know how to convert the string into an integer. I'm just very confused on how I should manipulate the original text document to do what I want it to.
This is what is happening:Instead, call int() on every character in each string:Or, via map():
Use this ,it will return a list of containing data from each line of txt.
