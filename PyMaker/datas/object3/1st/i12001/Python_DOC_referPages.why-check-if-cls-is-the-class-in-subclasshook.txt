In the Python standard library documentation, the example implementation of __subclasshook__ is:CPython's implementation of collections.abc indeed follows this format for most of the __subclasshook__ member functions it defines.What is the purpose of explicitly checking the cls argument?
__subclasshook__ is inherited. The cls is MyIterable check ensures that concrete subclasses of MyIterable use the regular issubclass logic instead of checking for an __iter__ method. Otherwise, for a class MyConcreteIterable(MyIterable), you would have issubclass(list, MyConcreteIterable) returning True.
