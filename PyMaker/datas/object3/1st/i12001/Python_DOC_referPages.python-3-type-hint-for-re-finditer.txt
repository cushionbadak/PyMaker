I am very new to type hinting in Python 3, and have tried reading and understanding the PEP, and I'm struggling with this.I have a function that returns the iterator from re.finditer()When inspecting at runtime, each iteration of finditer() is a _sre.SRE_Match object, but that's not importable, so I'm not sure how I can make the return type hint any more specific.
The typing.re.Match was added for exactly this reason. https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.re
