I am a Python beginner. I need to do a group concatenate. I tried different ways but couldn't come up with anything final.I have a dataset:I need to group it to the following format  Any Ideas. Your help is highly appreciated.
I believe this solves your problem:Output:What it is doing:Opens your .txt file and reads it. Once done it closes it.Splits the file into each line, and iterates over each line.Splits line into each letter and word. Then places those values into letter and word.Tries to add word the list of values at the key of the letter in words.If failed(Key doesn't exist), it adds it as a new key and value.Loops over each one and prints out nicely :)
Here's a solution using a collections.defaultdict:OutputThe defaultdict makes collecting items into lists much easier than managing a standard dictionary because you don't need to check whether a key is already in the dictionary before adding it.Another option is to use itertools.groupby, but that requires the data to be in order, and would therefore require that you sort the file before use.
