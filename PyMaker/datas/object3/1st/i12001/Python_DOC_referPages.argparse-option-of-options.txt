I am trying to add option of options in argparse.Currently I have:which gives:But I want --xsf as a suboption for --md, -N,-n for --opt; e.g.But I dont know how to achieve that. May be I am missing something, but there is no option like that in argparse docIs there any other way of getting that?
The mutually_exclusive_group mechanism is quite simple, and does not work with any kind of nesting, or subgrouping.  There is a Python bug/issue requesting a more comprehensive grouping mechanism, but the proposed patch is rather complicated.  The problem isn't just with testing, it's with defining the groups in a user friendly way, and with generating the usage line.  It's nice that you included a desired usage, but that format is well beyond the capabilities of the current help formatter.You might look into recasting your problem as a subparser one.  subparsers are mutually exclusive (you can only give one command name), and you could specify --xsf as an argument for md, and -N as argument for --opt.  But subparsers has its own help issues.Another route is to write your own usage, and do your own testing of arguments after parsing.  With a suitable choice of defaults you can usually tell whether an argument has been provided or not (the user can't specify None) or you can ignore unnecessary ones.
