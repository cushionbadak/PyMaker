Currently using Python 3.5.1I've been trying to work on this code for hours. I need this for homework any tips or leads for anything im struggling tired and frustrated.All I got wasHBHBHBHBWhat I need is HB HB HBHB HB HB HBThis is my first programming class so all we really worked on was If, else, print, input, while, if i in range, and other basic python statements.
There are two aspects here:printing 'HB' on the same line multiple timesadding a new line every 3 times HB printsTo get HB to print on the same line, you add additional arguments to the print function like this:print('HB', end='')The default end is a new line, so this changes it to print on one line.To have a new line added after every 3 prints, the easiest way is to use the modulus operator (%) so that you add a new line when division by 3 has a 0 remainder.One way to achieve this for your example would be this:
For python 3, use argument  end='' (empty string) in the print function to prevent changing lines (see documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)
