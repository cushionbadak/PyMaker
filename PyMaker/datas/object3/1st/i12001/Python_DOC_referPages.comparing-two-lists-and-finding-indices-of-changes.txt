I'm trying to compare two lists and find the position and changed character at that position. For example, these are two lists:I want to be able to output the position and change for the differences in the two lists. As you can see, a letter can be repeated multiple times at a different index position. This is the code that I have tried, but I can't seem to print out the second location accurately.Is there a better way to solve this problem or any suggestions to the code I have?My expected output would be:
Output:If you want the output you gave, we need to count from 1 instead of the usual 0:
Another possibility to save all the not-equal elements with the index is with a list comprehensions:Not exactly what you specified as output but it's close.You could print the specified output with a loop:In the comments several alternative ways of designing the list comprehension were suggested:Using enumerate and zip:Using enumerate with start index and zip:Using zip and itertools.count:Using zip and itertools.count with start-index:All of them producing the same result as the original but using different (better) python features.
