I am building a user system, where each users has a profile page. I run a cron job every week to give points to users based on which ones updated their profile most recently. For this I have between 1-100 points to give. The idea is for ex: if user A updated their profile today, user A would get 100 points, if the profile was updated yesterday it would be 99 points and the day before that would be 98 points and so on If any user updated their profile last 100 days ago or more, then the score would be 0. Now, the problem I have is changing the date of updated_on to number. I have this code, which I am fetching from database, but I am stuck. 
There's no need to do str(updated_on_date) since updated_on_date is already a string. I'll assume that these dates are in UTC, since using local times leads to madness. :)You can get the current datetime in UTC using current_date = datetime.utcnow(). In the code below, I'll just hard-code today's date so that future readers will get the same output that I do.The datetime module supplies a datetime.timedelta object, which allows you to perform arithmetic with datetime.datetime objects. You can add a timedelta to a datetime to get a new datetime, and if you subtract one datetime from another the result is a timedelta. So it's very easy to get the number of days between two dates.output

Using this example you can calculate number of days between two dates:will print the total number of days between date1 and date2.
