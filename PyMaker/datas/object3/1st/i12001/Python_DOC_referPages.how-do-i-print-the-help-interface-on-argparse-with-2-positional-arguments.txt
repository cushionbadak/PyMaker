I'm learning the basics of argparse, and I have made a program that prints information on the solar system in the command line, however, I have used 2 positional arguments which is causing some complications. My aim is to print the 'help' interface when an unknown argument is entered into the command line, but have been unable due to using multiple positional arguments. Using optional arguments is out of the question for now.How can I print the help for unknown arguments? As I understand it planet does not need to be called as specifically 'planet' but anything and a planet name afterwards so I've found it difficult to do this.
Perhaps what you're after is a mutually exclusive group.which would result inand
You'd want to raise an argParse.ArgumentTypeError with a custom type, there's a basic example how to do that here: argparse choices structure of allowed values
