This question already has an answer here:raw_input function in Python                    6 answers                How do I ask the user to input how far away someone is?e.g.and then get it to tell me if it is under 600me.g.
Use Python's input() method.For the 600m requirement, read up on if statements.
To ask the user a question, do:for python 2.7 orfor python 3and then as you will probably have worked out by now:
Just use print() to display information, input() to receive the input info, and if statement to determine whether the distance is enough. float(input()) means converting what you input to a float type object.
