This question already has an answer here:Returning Dictionary-length of words in string [duplicate]                    7 answers                I have two listsI need a dictionary where the keys are the numbers in b and values are the words in a. However, the keys' values must be unique. So, the output is like this:I've tried this:This is the output:
you will get the result what you need.
You may use defaultdict class, which behaves as dict but can have default start values for missing keys. Try it in such a way:        Then you may use it like usual dict:
As I noted in my comment, this means dealing with three cases:Key not yet presentKey present, value is stringKey present, value is listTo do precisely what you want, therefore:Note the use of map and len to get the lengths on the fly. However, as you can see, this is pretty complex, and now you have a dictionary with heterogeneous value types, which further complicates additional processing. Instead, I would recommend always using a list as the value, even for only a single string:This is clearly neater and will probably simplify any additional steps you have. You can simplify this code further with the dict.setdefault method or a collections.defaultdict object, which is designed for this kind of thing.
