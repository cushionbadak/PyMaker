I'm writing a small Python code that communicates over a socket but I'm having trouble making it so that sending and receiving are absolutely independent actions, i.e. not having to wait for a response in order to be able to send another message. My current code is as follows:How can I 'separate' the actions of receiving and reading from the socket?
This is by no means a simple solution, but you could take a look into python asyncio.https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.htmlThese modules are specifically for asynchronous handling of sockets. After a quick search I found an example that might help you.https://gist.github.com/dbehnke/c8f64cb6e67afff437c1
