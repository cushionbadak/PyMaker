I have encounter a case where I need to convert a string of character into a character string in python. what I want is that, given the string s, I can get the real character store in s. which in this case is "\x80, \x78, \x07, \x00, \x75, and \xb3"(something like this)�xu�. 
You can use string-escape encoding (Python 2.x):Use unicode-escape encoding (in Python 3.x, need to convert to bytes first):
you can simply write a function, taking the string and returning the converted form!   something like this:  remember to print the return of the function.  to find out what does each line do, run that line, if still have questions comment it... i'll answer 
or you can build a string from the byte values, but that might not all be "printable" depending on your encoding, example:HTH, Edwin
