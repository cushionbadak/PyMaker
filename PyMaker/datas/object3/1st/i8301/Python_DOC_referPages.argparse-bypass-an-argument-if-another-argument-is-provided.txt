Following this post I'm creating a small Python script that can input a public RSA key and output a private RSA key. It now works by passing the argument this way:And this is the code:I also want the script to work when there is no public key .pem file and in that case the user need to input n and e this way:I'm using argparse and basically now Python is extracting n and e from the .pem file.But I want argparse to bypass this extraction when n and e are provided by the user 
For file input:For variable input:
Just add optional keyword arguments for -n and -eand if args.n and args.e evaluates to True then ignore the input argument and skip the code that handles it.
