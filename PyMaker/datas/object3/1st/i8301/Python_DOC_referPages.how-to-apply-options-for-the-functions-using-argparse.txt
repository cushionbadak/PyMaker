I have a functions like this Now I am defining linux commands(options) for this functions using argparse.I tried with this codeBut I am getting error while passing command as python code.py --add 2 3
--add is the form of an optionals flag,  add is the correct form for a subparser nameproducingI added dest='cmd' to the add_subparsers command, and print(args) to give more information.  Note that the subparser name is now available as args.cmd.  So you don't need the added func.  However the argparse docs do suggest an alternative use of set_defaultshttps://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#sub-commandsWith this args.func is actually a function object, not just a string name.  So it can be used asNote that I had to change how the functions handle their parameters:producing
