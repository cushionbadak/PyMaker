I created a simple to do tasks GUI application . Besides adding items to the treeview, I add them to the list of Task objects. I want to delete all selected items from the treeview, as well as from the list (self.tasks) at the same time.I was able to delete only one selected item from the treeview, I don't know how to delete multiple selected items. Also, I don't know how to find and delete the selected item in the list I have.Here is what I have done so far:
1. Deleting all selected itemsThe treeview's selection() method returns the lists of the selected items. But in remove_item() you coded this line:Which thing means you are interested only in the first selected item among the list of the selected items.If you take this information in consideration, you can achieve your goal by modifying remove_item() consequently as follows:2. Updating the tasks listI think you want to update self.tasks[] whenever an item (or a group of items) is selected and deleted by the user.You can do that within the same remove_item() function mention above.For this, notice that the items you add to self.treeview are dictionaries following this form:The key of such a dictionary which is useful for your case is  value because it allows us to compare it to each instance of Task() class.To access the value of that key you must run this: self.treeview.item(selected_item)['values']You get then a list which corresponds to the dictionary of a Task()  instance.So you have to compare the Task() instance (self.tasks[some_index]) with the value of the key mentioned above.May be the code is better to understand:DemoLet us insert these 7 items:I selected 2 of them to delete them. The output on Terminal shows the list is updated:
