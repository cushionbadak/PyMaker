I know how to do the sum of a row like this: row = [sum(row) for row in Matrix], but how to find the sum of a column in a python matrix? If I have this matrix:It should make 3 values, they are: 0,4, and 6.
Look here same question, great example codes. Look at theyou can look and each time add one to the index so you look at the next columnor you can use zip:or simplere way from here:
A more Pythonic way than some of the other answers:Bit this is very inefficient in terms of cache performance. So try your best to avoid it, or transpose the matrix first if you need to perform this operation on the same matrix multiple times.
From hereTry this, it sums the matrix by the specified column:
It's quite self explanatory but someone is asking to comment the code. The code first casts the matrix to a numpy array and then sums the array colomn wise, which is what this question is about.
