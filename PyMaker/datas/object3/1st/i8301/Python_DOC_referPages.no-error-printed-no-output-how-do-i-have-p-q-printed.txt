This is what I have written so far. How do I arrange or amend my code so I get '['p','q']' printed? As of now, nothing prints to the console nor any error shows up telling me what I have done wrong.
You have an infinite loop in the while, because you have only i + 1, without the assignment.It should be: i = i + 1.Also, you can use slicing for this:
You need to increment i variable like this:New value of i should be assigned to i. 
You can directly slice original_list . Refer more on lists.
Seems like what you are trying to do is simply this.which outputs ['p', 'q']Python array indexes start at 0 therefore to output ['p'] we would need to say original_list[0] and to get ['q'] would be 1.Since it is an array you can get the data from the first index 0 then stop just before the 3 index 2.orignal_list[0:2] would output what you want aswell.
In regards to your code I would suggest this edit:You can slice a list like so:prints:or from the end:prints:or to reverse a list:prints:or to slice in reverse:prints:again reverse, although a bit unnecessary:prints:or to get elements not at the start:prints:
