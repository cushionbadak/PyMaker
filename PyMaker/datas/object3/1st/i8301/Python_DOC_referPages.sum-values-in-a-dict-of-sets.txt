I have what might be a simple task and I tried several solutions but can't seem to figure it out.I have a dict of sets containing gene names and corresponding positions as sets like:I want to return a dict with the gene name and the corresponding summed value.I tried the following:This is returning the same set of values
You can use a dict comprehension and the sum() function:Your attempt fails because you set the snp_total variable to 0 for every value in snp, thus failing to sum anything. You then seem to treat gene_values[gene] as a set but the dictionary starts empty, so you'll get a KeyError. A working version would be:but the sum() function makes the inner loop rather more verbose than needed; the whole loop body could be replaced by gene_values[gene] = sum(snp).
