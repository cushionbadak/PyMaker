my question is about getattribute. Please consider the following piece of code:I have found a bit misleading that if i change the object.__getattribute__(self, attr) to the self.name or self.quantity i will get 30 times string "Watermelon" or 60.0 (in case self.quantity), but if i put there self.price i will get RuntimeError, something about max recursion depth.So, question: Why i cannot do that with self.price and just write instead object.__getattribute__(self, attr)?
documentaion says:object.__getattribute__(self, name)Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the class. If the class also defines __getattr__(), the latter will not be called unless __getattribute__() either calls it explicitly or raises an AttributeError. This method should return the (computed) attribute value or raise an AttributeError exception. In order to avoid infinite recursion in this method, its implementation should always call the base class method with the same name to access any attributes it needs, for example, object.__getattribute__(self, name).
