I have many different methods in a class. Each method contains a function for a unique case. The case is passed to the constructor as a simple integer that identifies which method should be used. Is there a better way to set call this function then just a bunch of if statements?The code works but it is very redundant. Is there a more pythonic way of doing this?
Yes, there are better ways.If your method names do not follow a pattern but there is a fixed number of them, use a list, then use case as an index:You can build this list up-front with a decorator, but then you'd have to make sure you bind the function objects to self first:If your methods really are sequentially numbered, you can generate the method name and use getattr() to look up the method:
