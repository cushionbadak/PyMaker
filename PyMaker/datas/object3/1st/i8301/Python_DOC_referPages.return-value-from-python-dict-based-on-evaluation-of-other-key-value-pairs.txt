I have three Python dictionaries like so:I want to create functions to get the newest or oldest values from these dictionaries based on the CreatedDate value.  I imagine I would need to put all of these dicts in a list:An function might work like so:
You could use datetime.strptime() to parse the dates, then after that you just compare them until you've found the newest date.Now doing print(get_newest(list_of_dicts)) (given your data) would output:Note that if there's multiple instances of the newest date. Then the last instance will be selected. If you instead what the first instance, then use current_date > newest_date instead.
You can use max and min built-in function.
