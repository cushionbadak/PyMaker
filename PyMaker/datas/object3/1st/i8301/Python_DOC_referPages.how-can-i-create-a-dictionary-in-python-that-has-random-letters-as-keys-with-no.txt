Natural Text
This is my code:I create some random letters and I store them in variables, then I use this variables as keys in the dictionary. The problem is that the keys are duplicates because of the random letters. How can I fix that? 
Don't use separate choice() calls. Use random.sample(), picking from string.ascii_lowercase rather than lowercasing:If all you are doing is shuffling all 26 letters, then use random.shuffle():
