I need to read the file, determine a string that have a certain value(say Blue) in a field (colour) and calculate the percentage of string that fit the criteria.My code so far is as follows:I don't know how I can set the condition and calculate the percentage. 
Try this :) It is more easily configurable than the other answer, and will work on all types of CSV files thanks to the csv module. Tested with Python 3.6.1.Output:
Well, there basically are three steps to this:get number of lines in file. You already do this with linecountget number of occurences of your condition. Let's take colour: you already extracted the colour, now you only have to compare it to the value you are looking for, e.g. if colour == "Blue"Calculate the percentage, which is the occurences / linecountIt could look like this:This is a very basic example, though. In any case, you probably should use the Python csv library to read the fields from the csv, as suggested in a comment to your post (https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html). I would also expect that there are libraries out there, which could solve your problem more efficiently.
If you are willing to use third party modules, then I highly suggest that you use Pandas. The code would roughly be:
