I am trying to use python to interact with jenkins.Initially when I tried to import jenkinsapi , I got the below ERROR.Then I installed pytz.This resulted in successful import of jenkinsapi I was able to do a lot of work and then logged out of python CLI. I then logged back in and tried to import jenkinsapi and then got the ERROR.All of a sudden, its giving me an ImportError: No module named 'jenkinsapi' error. I have not installed any packages or modified anything. What could have gone wrong ?
The problem at hand is that when you were able to import jenkinsapi, your working directory was ~/jenkinsapi-0.3.4; after log out and log in, your working directory is ~. In latter case, Python is unable to find module in the same directory and fails.If you do cd ~/jenkinsapi-0.3.4 and then open Python shell, import jenkinsapi should work.As a side note, you might want to learn about Pythons virtual environments (see this StackOverflow question for pointers) and installing packages through pip.
