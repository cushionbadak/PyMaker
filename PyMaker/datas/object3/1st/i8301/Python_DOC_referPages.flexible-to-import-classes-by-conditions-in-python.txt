I have been meeting a problem when I inherit classes in Python.I have 3 classes that contains test cases and a global variable is called my_condition.Now in the class all_test_case, I want to inherit class mdl_test_case or feac_test_case depending on the value of the variable my_condition. Detail are belowIf I set my_condition = 1 and call the class all_test_case. I expect to inherit the class mdl_test_caseAnd vice versa, if I set my_condition = 2 and call the class all_test_case. I expect to inherit the class feac_test_caseNotes:The varaible my_condition can change after each time calling the class all_test_case
You can add updateClass function as follows:Now all_test_case will inherit from the class based on my_condition
