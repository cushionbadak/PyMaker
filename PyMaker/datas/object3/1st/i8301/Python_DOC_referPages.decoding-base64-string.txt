I'm working with Python to do some string decoding and I am trying to understand what does this line of code...In my case irradiance_list_bytes is something like thisAnd the message error isI beleive that, I have to change "qHHHHfff" to another string format, but I don't understand ?The complete code is here...EDITSo a stated by Strubbly, this is the solution for this question. for i in range(8):    start = 4 + i*28    print struct.unpack("qHHHHfff",x[start:start+28])
struct.iter_unpack is only available in Python 3 and you are using Python 2.There is no direct equivalent.  struct.unpack will unpack one lump of 28 bytes (with that format string).  struct.iter_unpack will unpack multiples of 28 bytes in Python 3.If your data was suitable for struct.iter_unpack with that format code then you could do something like this:Unfortunately your sample data is not a multiple of 28 bytes long and so I would expect an error in Python 3 as well.Without knowing about your data it is hard to correct your code but, at a guess, you data might have 4 bytes of some other data at the front.  So that could be unpacked with something like this:In this example I have guessed that the first four bytes are an unsigned int but I have no way of knowing if that is correct.  More information is needed.
