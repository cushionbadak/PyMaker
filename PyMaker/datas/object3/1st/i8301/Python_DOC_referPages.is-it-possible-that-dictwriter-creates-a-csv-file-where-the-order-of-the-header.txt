It hasn't created an out of order csv file for me yet, but I wanted to know if it could. Couldn't the writerow function write the dictionary values in any order?
No, because the writer uses the order of fieldnames to produce the rows. This guarantees that all rows use the same order.This is explicitly documented:The fieldnames parameter is a sequence of keys that identify the order in which values in the dictionary passed to the writerow() method are written to file f.Bold emphasis mine. The documentation also links to the source code, where you can see how this is achieved:At no point is the order of the dictionary consulted.
