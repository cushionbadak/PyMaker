Natural Text
Even when run in a seperate thread my UI hangs while a large file is being loaded into a Text widget. Is it just because the application is under heavy load or is there a way I can keep the UI functional while this is happening. Im loading several text files in different widgets so the hang up is longer than desired. Tested on several machines with plenty of resources. 
What Bryan is saying is that you need to launch a thread like this: 
In order to invoke loadfile in a separate thread with positional/keyword arguments, use the args and kwargs arguments to threading.Thread like so:... which would invoke loadfile(42, a='foo') in the thread.
