I'm creating a project where:A user submits an input into a formThat data is input into the databaseA random URL is generated (think imgur / youtube style links)The user is redirected to that random URLThe input data is display on that random URLforms.pymodels.pyviews.pyindex.htmlI'm new to Python / Django, which is probably obvious. The above code allows users to submit an input which is succesfully added to the database. It also generates 6 random characters and adds that to the database.The problem is I don't know how to turn that random code into a URL and redirect the user there after submitting the form.I've tried a couple of methods so far, such as adding action="{{ random_url }}" to the index.html form, as well as adding url(r'(?P<random_url>\d+)', views.Home, name='home') to urls.py
models.pyforms.pyviews.pyurls.pyin form_detail.html template
I would recommend using something like Hashids for your URLs instead of uuid.uuid4()[:6], but I think your immediate problem is in urls.py:Here your regular expression for random_url is \d+. \d+ matches one or more decimal digits, but the values generated by uuid.uuid()[:6] aren't decimal. I think \w will be a better fit.The other problem is that views.Home doesn't accept the "random URL", so it never knows which one to display. Give it a second argument:and then use random_url inside Home to load the correct page from the database. I suspect this should actually happen in a new view function, but I'm not clear on what each page represents so I can't recommend a good name for it.
