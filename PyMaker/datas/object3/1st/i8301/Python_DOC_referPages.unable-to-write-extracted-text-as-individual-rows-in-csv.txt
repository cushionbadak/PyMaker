Natural Text
This may be considered as second part of question Finding an element within an element using Selenium Webdriver. What Im doing here is, after extracting each text from the table, writing it into csv fileHere is the code:Results of 3 print statements:Now, You can notice the code where i write these values into csv. But I end up writing it weirdly into csv. please see the snapshot. Can someone help me to fix this please?
According to the documentation, writerows takes as parameter a list of rows, and A row must be an iterable of strings or numbers for Writer objectsYou are passing a list of strings, so writerows iterates over your strings, making a row out of each character.You could use a loop:or turn your list into a list of lists, then use writerows :But anyway, there's no need to use csv if you only have one column...
