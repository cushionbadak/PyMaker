How do I add up all of the values of a column in a python array? Ideally I want to do this without importing any additional libraries.I know I this can be done in a nested for loop, wondering if there was a better way (like a list comprehension)?
zip and sum can get that done:Code:zip takes the contents of the input list and transposes them so that each element of the contained lists is produced at the same time.  This allows the sum to see the first elements of each contained list, then next iteration will get the second element of each list, etc...Test Code:Results:
In case you decide to use any library, numpy easily does this:np.sum(input_val,axis=0)
You may also use sum with zip within the map function:
This should work:
Try this:
I think this is the most pythonic way of doing this
One-liner using list comprehensions: for each column (length of one row), make a list of all the entries in that column, and sum that list.
I guess you can use:
Try this code. This will make output_val end up as [3, 6, 9, 12, 15] given your input_val:
this would make the code even simpler I guess
Using Numpy you can easily solve this issue in one line:1: Input2: Numpy does the math for you3: Then finally the results
