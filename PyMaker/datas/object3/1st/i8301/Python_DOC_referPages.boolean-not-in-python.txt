I leaned C of the last summer from K&R book from 1989.  I am now learning python3. I am a little confused about something.In C if i do a testif !(.....)   The '!' changes the value in the '( )' to the opposite, so if it was true, it becomes false and vis versa. So what i was trying to do, is change this from C to python.When i tried I got a syntax error. So after searching on-line I found  "is not" in the python3 doc.so i try it on the interactive terminal.The interpreter was saying the 'is' is a syntax error. So i decided to remove it and see what happens. And it worked! I searched on-line and i do not find the 'not' without the 'is'?Is it OK to use 'if not ( ......)'  as the equivalent of 'if !(......)' in C? Or will i get into problems?  Or is there a different python way of doing this?
Is it OK to use 'if not ( ......)' as the equivalent of 'if !(......)' in C? Sure. Try it. However, I think you're missing the in keyword. You can write this As this 
"is" means two variables point  the same object,the same Memory addressU can see the link Is there a difference between `==` and `is` in Python?
