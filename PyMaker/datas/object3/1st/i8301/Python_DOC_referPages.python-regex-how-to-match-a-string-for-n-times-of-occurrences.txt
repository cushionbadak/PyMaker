I want to match the line that contains word 100.00% for 3 occurrences.e.g So line 1 and 3 should all be matched.However, my following regex seems only to match the case that has 100.00% repeated for 3 times. (Only match line 3)I wonder how should I do to match line 1 as well?Thanks everybody!
an alternative that requires a simpler regular expression is to find all substrings that match 100.00% and test if the count == 3.example
Halemur Ali's answer is much cleaner than this one which I leave only for completeness.The notation {3} is merely a shortcut, you can always replace it by expanding the repeated sequence. To match line where the sequence 100.00% appears exactly 3 times, you can use:This uses negative-lookaheads.It can be read this way:^ start of the line(?:(?!100\.00%).)* any character (zero or more), until a 100.00% sequence(?:100\.00% the 100.00% sequence(?!100\.00%).)* followed by any character (zero or more) until a 100.00% sequence{3} repeated 3 times$ end of lineConsider taking a look at python's documentation of the re module.Note: brackets are not necessary to match a single character.
r'(100\.00%.*){3}' should also do the trick, and is readable, concise, and (I think) performant.
