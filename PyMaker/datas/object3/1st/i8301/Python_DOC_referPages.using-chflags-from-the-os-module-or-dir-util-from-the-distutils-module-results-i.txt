Python documentation shows that os.chflags exists.However executing the below code on a *nix platform results in an AttributeError:Likewise distutils.dir_util documented here also results in an AttributeError.
It may just be because your system does not provide the syscall for chflags.This is also the case for me running Mint 18.1 and I get the same results than you do, for both python2 and python3.BSD systems provide this function while others do not necessarily do.
I am heaving the same issue with my Python 3.6.7. at my Ubuntu 18.04 box.It is mentioned in https://bugs.python.org/issue31313. In short, Linux doesn't support chflags.Linux uses chattr, sadly Python os module doesn't.
