I am getting unwanted blank lines between each row of scrapy output in the resulting csv output file.I have moved from python2 to python 3, and I use Windows 10.  I am therefore in the process of adapting my scrapy projects for python3.My current (and for now, sole) problem is that when I write the scrapy output to a CSV file I get a blank line between each row.  This has been highlighted on several posts here (it is to do with Windows) but I am unable to get a solution to work.As it happens, I have also added some code to the piplines.py file to ensure the csv output is in a given column order and not some random order.  Hence, I can use the normal scrapy crawl charleschurch to run this code rather than the scrapy crawl charleschurch -o charleschurch2017xxxx.csvDoes anyone know how to skip / omit this blank line in the CSV output?My pipelines.py code is below (I perhaps don't need the import csv line but I suspect I may do for the final answer):I added this line to the settings.py file (not sure the relevance of the 300):my scrapy code is below:
i suspect not ideal but I have found a work around to this problem.  In the pipelines.py file I have added more code that essentially reads the csv file with the blank lines to a list, and so removes the blank lines and then writes that cleaned list to a new file.the code I added is:and so the entire pipelines.py file is:not ideal but solves the problem for now.
The b in w+b is most probably part of the problem as this will make the file being considered a binary file and so linebreaks are written as is. So first step is to remove the b. And then by adding U you can also activate the Universal Newline support ( see: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-universal-newlines )So the line in question should look like:
