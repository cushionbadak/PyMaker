I am trying to create a script that will run code at the top of every minute.  I'm looking into the sched module and I've encountered some strange problems.The first problem is that importing sched runs my script twice.Output:Also this code which comes straight from the documentation:produces this error:
As per my comment - your file is named sched.py, therefore, it was importing itself, of which doesn't have the attribute scheduler.
