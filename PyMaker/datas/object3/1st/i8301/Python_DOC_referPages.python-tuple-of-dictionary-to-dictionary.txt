How can I convert tuple of dictionaries like example present below:to a rather simpler form like dictionary:
just iterate on the tuples and rebuild the dictionary "flat" using a dictionary comprehension:result:
You can't use a dict merge comprehension (yet), but you can go via a chain map:Note: collections.ChainMap is new in Python 3.3.  It's actually a subclass of collections.Mapping, so depending on the use-case you might not even need to convert back to a plain dict.  
If order of the elements in the desired dict matters and is needed to be sorted as mentioned in the question, use collections.OrderedDict as:but returns sorted dict maintaining the order equivalent to the one desired in the question as:But if order of elements in the desired dict doesn't matter, you may use simple dict comprehension to achieve it as:where the value of required_dict will be:Note: Order of items in the desired dict are different because dictionaries in Python are unordered by nature.

You can update an initial dict with all the dicts form the tuple:
Another one, exclusive to Python 3.5 and newer:
