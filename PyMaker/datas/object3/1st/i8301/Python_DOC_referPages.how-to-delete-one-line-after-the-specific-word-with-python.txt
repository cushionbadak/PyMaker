Natural Text
I have a text file (input.txt) and it contains:Now I need to delete the first lines after each COMPDAT keyword in my input.txt file.How can I do that with Python?I tried to use this script, however, it adds an empty line between each existing lines:
first read the file, get all lines that you want, and then write those lines in same file.

Another possibility using a generator, based on @Sanjay's answer.
