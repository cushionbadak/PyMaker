How do you load a compressed grammar file into NLTK? I can load an uncompressed grammar file just fine, with:but since my grammar file is nearly 100MB, I want to load the much smaller compressed version, which is only 1MB, but this fails with:Unfortunately, looking at nltk.data.FORMATS doesn't list any compressed formats.
As you can see by examining the source of load_parser, it relies on ntlk.data.find to open file:/// URLs.That function autodetects GZipped data by checking if the path ends with .gz and reads it with gzip.GZipFile.But, for this to work, the data should be packed with gzip directly, not through tar or anything.
