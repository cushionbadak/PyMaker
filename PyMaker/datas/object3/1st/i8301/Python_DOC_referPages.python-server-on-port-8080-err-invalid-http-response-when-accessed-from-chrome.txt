We have an in-house web server served via Python which was running on port 8080 without issue until this weekend.  After a Chrome update this weekend, my colleagues and I now receive a ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE when we attempt to access the web server via Chrome.  This issue seems to be specific to Chrome and port 8080.  Port 8080 works in IE, and port 80 works for both IE and Chrome with no changes on the server side.  The web server is not being served on port 80 as it is still in development and not production (which is company standard practice for internal services).Based on some research, it seems like different sites/services have been having this problem at one point or another as Chrome has been updated.  Most of those posts seemed to involve HTTP/0.9 being relegated into the bad-security-equals-no-support bucket.  Our server is using HTTP/1.0, and I have experimented with HTTP/1.1 as well to see if we are having a similar issue.curl doesn't show any obvious header issues (that I can see) to indicate a possible root cause.  Chrome's developer console isn't providing any answers either.  Obviously, I am missing something subtle as it seems a browser update shouldn't completely prevent a server being accessed.
