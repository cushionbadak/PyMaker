My teacher said that in a graph I must label the axis like 0, 0.25, 0.5 not 0.00,0.25,0.50,....I know how to label it like 0.00,0.25,0.50  (plt.yticks(np.arange(-1.5,1.5,.25))), however, I don't know how to plot the ticklabels with different precision.I've tried to do it like without avail.
This was already answered, for example here Matplotlib: Specify format of floats for tick lables. But you actually want to have another format than used in the referenced question.So this code gives you your wished precision on the y axisYou can define your wished precision in the String that you pass to FormatStrFormatter. In the above case it is "%g" which stands for the general format. This format removes insignificant trailing zeros. You could also pass other formats, like "%.1f" which would be a precision of one decimal place, whereas "%.3f" would be a precision of three decimal places. Those formats are explained in detail here.
In order to set the ticks' positions at multiples of 0.25 you can use a matplotlib.ticker.MultipleLocator(0.25). You can then format the ticklabels using a FuncFormatter with a function that strips the zeros from the right of the numbers.
