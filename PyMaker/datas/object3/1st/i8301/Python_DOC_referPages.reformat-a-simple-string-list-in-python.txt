Reformat a string, such as converting a list of authors like to Confused on where to go with this problem. I know it is simple and just uses methods such as .split() and .strip() but can't figure out what combination I need. Please help before I turn into Dobby banging my head on the wall. 
This should work.    A slightly simpler version would be:But involves an additional split operation, which would make it slower if you have a huge number of names (otherwise it would be a negligible change).Doing something specific with the last name:So if you want to do something specific with the last element of a list you can do it two ways: The most pythonic would be to use enumerate like in the first example, and capture the case where index == len(list) - 1 (the last element):However, if you're dead set against using enumerate, then you can get the same behavior by iterating through the list only to the second to last element, and performing the final operation outside the loop:Really you should just use enumerate, this is its intended use case. Regardless of which algorithm you choose, you'll notice we print result and not result[:-2]. This is because we no longer add the unnecessary characters to the last names like we did previously. 
as far as i've gotten on the updated question with "and" and "&"
Check out list comprehensions, str.join, and str.format.  If you use python much you will find them all to be very helpful.You can also jam everything together with nested list comprehensions but as you can see this can get harder to read quickly.
