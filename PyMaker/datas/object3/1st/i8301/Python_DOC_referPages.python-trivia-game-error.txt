Natural Text
Trying to have a game where each question has a unique value associated to it. The player's score is then the total number of points of the questions she or he answers correctly. Been fiddling with it but I keep running into these errors :code:not sure why it's having these errors/why its not running - suggestions? ty!this is connected to a seperate .txt file named "trivia.txt" with all the questions and points.
Most likely the error is occurring because your text file contains unicode characters. You can add the encoding parameter to the open call to tell python that it isn't in the default ascii encoding.If this doesn't work, it may be because the file is using a different encoding such as 'iso-8859-15'.The Python documentation Unicode-HOWTO has more details about dealing with Reading and Writing Unicode Data.
