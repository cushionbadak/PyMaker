I'm using python36 on windows installed without admin privs.I create a simple script, tester.pyon the commandline, I install petl to a directory.pip install petl -t libAnd when I check, it's in there.I want to use that directory to find my petl, so I create a python36._pth file.When I try to run my script, it can't find it!What am I misunderstanding about getting ._pth files to work?
Unfortunately, .pth files only get evaluated if they are placed in one of the standard locations shown by python -m site, other than the current working directory. I can't remember the details, but I think Python runs through these standard locations first, running any .pth files it finds there, then adds '' (current working directory) to the start of sys.path afterward. This means you can't extend the path just by adding a .pth file in the directory you launch your script from.The only way that I know to add relative locations to the system path is to set them at the top of your main script, before your import statements. In this case, you could do that with something like sys.path.append( os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'lib')).
