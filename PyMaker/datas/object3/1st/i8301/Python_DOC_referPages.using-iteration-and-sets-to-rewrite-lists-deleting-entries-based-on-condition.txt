I'm trying to remove elements in a list (the list is of dimension seven at the moment) if any sub element is empty.  i.e given this simpler example list:After deleting any row with a "blank" (or another condition at some point)so far I've done something to this effect (it works!) for my list which has 7 elements using setsI've attempted something similar to the following. I'm not sure how to pass a list to a function properly in this context-but here x is a list
How about using some python builtins all and filter:Filter evaluates a preedicate and only returns it if it is trueAll returns true if all items in an iterator are true
