I have a few python scripts, and each one of them consist of multiple functions. I was wondering if it is better (meaning faster, and cleaner) to run the function right after the function is created, or to create all of the functions, and then run them in order at the end of the script. when I say "run them" I mean calling myfunction() after the function is over, or waiting for the end of the script and calling something like:I'll add a little more detail. I have 4 scripts, each of them consist of functions that must be used from other scripts. for example I have one script that, grabs a users login information and logs them into a website, cancels their account, and then returns their data from said site. then I have a scrip that will resume their account, but in order to do so I need to use the login function from the previous script. So I was wondering if, since I am using each function in multiple scripts if it was more efficient to call them all at the end using a "name==main" or to just call them as I create them. 
It actually depends on your need and programming practices, so none of them is better over otherIf you want to keep your code clean, I would suggest that keep all the similar functions in a class then import that class in another class where you can call the function on the object/ classExample File : user.pyFile : main.py (here we will actually run the app/ entry-point for the app)This will keep everything bit modular and easy to manage both physically and logically
