I am trying to get Expect output as: these are the words which consist of string2 and they are found in string1 and their frequency: new_words are those words which are not in string2 but they are in string1, so they are new_words.I am newbie to programming.Can someone help me solve this simple problem? I cannot store keys before because I don't know which words will be there in strings and their frequency.
One more option - you could use defaultdictUPDATETo solve your second problem you should exchange string2 and string1 in for loop. You should iterate over all words in string1 and check them in string2.
You're trying to add to a value that may or may not exist in the dictionary. Use get() instead to ensure safe execution:and
You cannot increment an integer value that does not exist yet, which is the case the first time the word is encountered.
You are trying to increment (+1) a key that does not exist in your dictionnary. You should check first if the key exist. with:
You get a KeyError because the key doesn't yet (found[word] += 1), you may want to use:
