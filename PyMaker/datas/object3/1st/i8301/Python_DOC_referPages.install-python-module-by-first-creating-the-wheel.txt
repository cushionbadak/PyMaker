I just download files to build an API in python - a brief tuto on that API suggest that in order to install it a module, the following must be performed:This seems pretty straightforward, however I am completely unfamilar with that aspect of python and a bit at loss... I tried to run the command python3 setup.py bdist_wheel both in the folder containing the API and by first entering a python 3 environement (by typing source activate python3 - i am using anaconda. Both return the error setup.py cannot be found.Anyone knows where both command should be run in order to properly install the module?
You should write setup script for your moduleLook here
You can follow the steps below:cd  C:\TWS API\source\pythonclientpython setup.py bdist_wheelcd C:\Python36\Scriptspython -m pip install --upgrade "C:\TWS API\source\pythonclient\dist\ibapi-9.73.2-py3-none-any.whl"Note: Change python and API versions to the ones you are using.
