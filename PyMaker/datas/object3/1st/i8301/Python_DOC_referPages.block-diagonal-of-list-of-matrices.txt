I would like to use block_diag to make a block diagonal matrixof multiple matrices.Let's say I have matrices A, B, and C. I can simply write:However, I do wish to have more matrices later on. How do I combine A, B, and C into a list of matrices X so that I can write:I tried using [A, B, C] but that doesn't work. 
Use the star operator (*), which spreads out the contents of an iterable as positional function arguments. (I have chosen to use an immutable tuple, but the list [A, B, C] would work equally well.)
