I am using 2to3 to convert a script. The only warning I get is:Line 716 of the original script is:I don't get where shall I use operator.mul(None). The reference documentation of repeat() (link to docs) shows that I can pass None without any problem. So, what shall I do?
2to3 is just getting confused about which repeat you mean.  It thinks you're using operator.repeat in Python 2:instead of itertools.repeat.  That's not a great guess on its part, to be honest, because operator.repeat takes 2 arguments, but that's what it's guessing.  You can see the transformation listed in the docs.You can avoid the warning by using the fully-qualified itertools.repeat or just ignore it.
