This question already has an answer here:How does tuple comparison work in Python?                    4 answers                What is this python code doing? Output: (2, 3)I am not able to follow the documentation. Can someone explain why the output in (2,3) and not an error?
Because (2,3) < (6,'f',1)Meaning tuples are compared itemwise, therefore 2 < 6 yields that the first tuple is less than the second oneWhile this code works on Python 2 and Python 3, it should fail on Python 3 if both items in 1st place were the same. Because it would compare 3 to the string 'f' and such comparison is now invalid.
The min function will call the comparator methods of the objects you pass. In this case, all tuples. It is returning the minimum tuple with respect to lexicographic order.
