I want to write a file searching code where I don't know if the directory I'm searching in has subdirectories and I want to check that so I don't get an error like this:[Error 267]The directory name is invalid: 'C:/Path/To/Directory'.I wrote a code like this where if it finds the file it breaks and stopps the program but if not it goes down a layer and so on.The easy to notice error is that when the directory doesn't have 3 layers of subfolders the program just breaks and gives an error message.So if I could check if the folder has subfolders before entering it,that would be neat.
Use os.scandir(). Provides better speed over os.walk()Link to docs here!Alternatively use, glob
