The first part of this blog post does a nice job of summarizing the general use case for a dispatch table, but I can't help wondering if it could be even more succinct and elegant using Enums instead...Of course, the big hurdle in using an Enum is that functions are automatically ignored as potential members.So, is it possible?
In a word: Yes1.I will show a solution using the aenum2 library -- while it is possible to do most of this with the stdlib version it would require writing extra plumbing that already exists in aenum.First, the base class:and an example dispatch Enum:and in use:1 See this answer for the standard Enum usage.2 Disclosure:  I am the author of the Python stdlib Enum, the enum34 backport, and the Advanced Enumeration (aenum)  library.
