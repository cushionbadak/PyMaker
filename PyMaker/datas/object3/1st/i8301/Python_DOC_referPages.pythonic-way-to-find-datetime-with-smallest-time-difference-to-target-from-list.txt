I have a datetime object target_time. I also have a list such that times_list[i]['time'] is a datetime object. I want to iterate through this list and find the index of the item that has the smallest time distance from target_time. These differences will be in the order of milliseconds, and the range of times covered in the list will be in the order of minutes. My current solution is rather clunky:Is there a less clunky and more pythonic way of doing this?

Use min() to find the smallest difference. Combine that with enumerate() to keep track of the indices:No need to generate an intermediate list of differences.
Alternative method:
A function to find the closest:
