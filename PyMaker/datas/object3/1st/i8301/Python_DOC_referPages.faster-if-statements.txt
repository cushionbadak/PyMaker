I have a quick question about what would be faster to compute in python.It's a large simulation, so any little thing to save time helps.As I understand it, when python evaluates an "if" statement with an "or" in it, it doesn't bother with the second condition if the first condition is true. Here I want check whether a randomly generated float between 0 and 1 is less than some exponential factor.So would it be worth it in this case to make logically redundant "if" statements when the second condition implies the first, but the first might be faster to calculate? And would this be faster enough to even matter? Any input is appreciated, thanks!
That means for (a and b and c), that b or c would not be tested anymore if a is false.Similar, if you have an OR expression (a or b) and a is true, b is never evaluated.So to sum up, the clauses don't fail faster with separation..Don't worry about performance, worry about readability.... Thank you
