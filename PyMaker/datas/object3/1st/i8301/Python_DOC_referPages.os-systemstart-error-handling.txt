I am asking for an input for a file name using the os library and when the open button is pressed it will open the file that is typed in, this works but if the user enters a file that doesn't exist it will throw a windows error and the following will be displayed in the shell?Is there a way to handle this without the Windows error? Like using a try and except statement.Thanks
Instead of using system, you might want to use the subprocess module.You can call the os.path.isfile to check if the file exists, or you can raise an exception as:Or,Take a look at the documentation for the subprocess module here.
Aside from suspending errors from your platform, I will seek a platform independent solution. You can useos.path.exists to check if a directory or a file exists, if it exists you pass the command to os.system to open the file: I wouldn't recommend using os.system, you're really making the security of your application brittle this way.
