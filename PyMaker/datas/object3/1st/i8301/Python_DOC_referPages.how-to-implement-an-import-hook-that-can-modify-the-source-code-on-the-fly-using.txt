Using the deprecated module imp, I can write a custom import hook that modifies the source code of a module on the fly, prior to importation/execution by Python. Given the source code as a string named source below, the essential code needed to create a module is the following:Since imp is deprecated, I would like to do something similar with importlib. [EDIT: there are other imp methods that need to be replaced to build a custom import hook - so the answer I am looking for is not simply to replace the above code.] However, I have not been able to figure out how to do this. The importlib documentation has a function to create modules from "specs" which, as far as I can tell, are objects that include their own loaders with no obvious way to redefine them so as to be able to create a module from a string. I have created a minimal example to demonstrates this; see the readme file for details.
find_module and load_module are both deprecated. You'll need to switch to find_spec and (create_module and exec_module) module respectively. See the importlib documentation for details.You will also need to examine if you want to use a MetaPathFinder or a PathEntryFinder as the system to invoke them is different. That is, the meta path finder goes first and can override builtin modules, whereas the path entry finder works specifically for modules found on sys.path.The following is a very basic importer that attempts to replace the entire import machinery for. It shows how to use the functions (find_spec, create_module, and exec_module).Next is a slightly more delicate version that attempts to reuse more of the import machinery. As such, you only need to define how to get the source of the module.
