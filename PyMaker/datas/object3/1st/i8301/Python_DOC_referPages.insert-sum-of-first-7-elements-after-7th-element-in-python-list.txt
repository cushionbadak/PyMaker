I want to insert sum of first 7 elements after 7th element, sum of next 7 elements after another 7 elements and like wise.I want to add 8 elements in this list such that the length is 64.This is the list of elements which has sum of 7 elements from above list:Here is what I tried:This is not inserting any element after 7th element, can someone suggest me some other way to achieve this?
The most obvious way is to just iterate over the list, and keep a running total. Then, after every seventh element, add the total.More succinctly:
You can group the items into sevens and then append the sum in a lambda using map:Or use the more verbose itertools.groupby for grouping and then take the sum of each group:
How about using just one list comprehension?
here is another way of doing it, using a combination of islice and iter
