I wrote this code to calculate the distance. But getting error of ValueError: math domain error.In the iterations, d should be:
The value of len(a) is 2, and FOR count since 0, so, ask for the 3rd element in the array, you must do  for i in range(len(a) - 1):
sqrt gives that error when you try to use it with a negative number. sqrt(-16) gives that error because the result is a complex number.
As @not_a_robot mentioned in their comment, the exponentiation operator in Python is ** not ^ as it is in (many) other programming languages. You can fix your by simply replacing them.As I mentioned in a comment, it would be better to use math.hypot() for this as it will give you the same results more quickly and is easier to read (and write):
