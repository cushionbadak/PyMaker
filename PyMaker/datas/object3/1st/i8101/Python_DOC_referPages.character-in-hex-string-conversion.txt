Why does a "?" character appear in the following hex value? (I am using Python 3.5.1)My aim is to convert string into hex value pairs.The value for hexpairs I get is this:What is the significance of the ? character? I would have expected the output to have been:
The ? occurs due to the fact that unhexlify has used 3F as a byte code, which is the ASCII code for '?'. Thus, Python has displayed these bytes as an ASCII code.
@Benedict answer's is correct, Here is some sources to help you understand:binascii.unhexlify() official python documentation.wikipedia -- ascii tableOriginally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified  characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart  above.[8] The characters encoded are numbers 0 to 9, lowercase letters  a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, basic punctuation symbols, control  codes that originated with Teletype machines, and a space. For  example, lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106.  ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing  control characters (many now obsolete)[9] that affect how text and  space are processed[10] and 95 printable characters, including the  spaceThe ascii table valuesConvertor to hexa, decimal, octal, asciiFor ? character:binary: 00111111. in python, chr(0b00111111) will output ?octal: 77.        in python chr(0o77)        will output ?decimal: 63.      in python chr(63)          will output ?hexadecimal: 3F.    in python chr(0x3f)        will output ?As you can see, you can use prefixes like 0b, 0o, or 0x before int to make python understand you are not working with decimal numbers. However 0x8C is out of the ascii table (because it goes from 0 to 127). 0x8C being 140 in decimal it cannot display the equivalent.
