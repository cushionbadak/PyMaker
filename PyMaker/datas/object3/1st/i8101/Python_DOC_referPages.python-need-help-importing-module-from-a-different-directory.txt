I'm running Python3.6 on Mac OSX 10.12.4In that directory, resides __init__.py and Pyrime.py. Pyrime.py has some functions in it.In that directory resides my program: PE010_Summation_of_Primes.py. I want to import one function, called is_prime, in Pyrime.py to use in PE010_Summation_of_Primes.py. I thought all I would need to do is write, in PE010_Summation_of_Primes.py:This doesn't work. My terminal throws:Python is the first language I've ever seen, and I've only seen it for about a week so far. I've looked at a lot of documentation, but for a beginner like me, it hasn't been very enlightening.
Add the system-path at runtime:it will work!
Well, python refers the global library directory or local directory when trying to import a file. But for files in directories other than local you can either add file path to sys.path or create a __init__.py file in all directories including the parent directory PyProjects. Try this -from modules.Pyrime import is_primeSo your directory will look something like this -Hope it helps.
