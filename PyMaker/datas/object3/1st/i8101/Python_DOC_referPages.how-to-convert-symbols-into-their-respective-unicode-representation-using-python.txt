I want to convert devanagri script characters such as 'à¤…' into its unicode representation \u0905. Earlier in python2.7 I was using each_character.encode("unicode_escape") where each_character refered to the devanagri script characters.But lately I have started working on python3 and when I run the above snippet I get the following error?expected str instance, bytes foundCan anybody suggest a way to convert all the characters into their unicode representation. I am working on a devanagri OCR and I need the Unicode representations in order to pass them as ground truths.
You're dealing with bytes object, not string. You should convert the bytes to string using bytes.decode method.NOTE: You should change utf-8 depending on which encoding used.NOTE: If you're iterating bytes object, you should change the code to decode the bytes object first, then iterate; otherwise, decoding will fail or yield wrong result.
If you have an unicode string, like this:In Python 2, you can use repr() to get the escaped representation:But, in Python 3, non-ASCII characters are not escaped:What you want is to escape non-ASCII characters. You can do I like this:The result is a bytes string in Python 3 (str in Python 2), so if you need an unicode string, you need to decode it, like this:The result is an unicode string.Reference to the Python 3 documentation: Converting to Bytes
