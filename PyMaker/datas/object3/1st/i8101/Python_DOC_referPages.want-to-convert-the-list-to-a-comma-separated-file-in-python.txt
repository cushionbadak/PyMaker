I have a raw file as :How can I convert this to a comma separated file in python as:I tried to convert it to a list, so later i can convert it to a comma separated string, using \t as the delimiter, but seems like it won't give me the desired output.My code was:The output I got:Can anyone suggest ?
Try this:The indices were gathered from the data you gave us. I assumed that everything was perfectly aligned.
This may not be the most optimised way, though it produces a comma separated file of the values. Where FILE_IN and FILE_OUT are the filenames of input and output files respectively.
Several things. First of all, don't use open() directly in your list comprehension. If you want to use open(), always use a context manager, which guarantees that the file will be closed when you are done with it: Second: you'll find your life a lot easier to not bother with open() at all and start using the amazing pathlib module. Third: instead of copying and pasting the entire path to your desktop, you can automatically find its location using the Windows USERPROFILE environment variable: Fourth: it appears that the sample raw file you pasted does not have any tab characters ('\t') in it. It has 4 spaces ('    ') instead. If this is actually the case, this should work: Note the if i part. That makes sure any consecutive sets of 4 spaces don't put empty strings ('') in your list. However, your pasted code- which is equivalent to the above- is producing the wrong result. I think it may be because your second and third line actually do have tab characters ('\t') in them rather than 4 spaces. So you'll need to split() using both 4 spaces and a tab character. The easiest way to do this is to replace the tabs with 4 spaces. Use the same if i again to avoid empty strings.
