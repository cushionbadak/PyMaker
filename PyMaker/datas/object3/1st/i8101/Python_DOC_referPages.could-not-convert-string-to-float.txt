Natural Text
I am writing a code that basically asks for user input of an 8 digit number, that is then read from a text file to see if it is valid and then asks the user for quantity. It works fine up until it needs to calculate the total of the product (multiplied by quantity entered)? It produces this error:Here is my actual code:And here is the text file (named "hardware_store.txt")I don't understand what is happening, it works up until you enter the desired quantity. Thanks in advance
You file hardware_store.txt has values separated on each lines by comma, not whitespace. You should split the line by ',', not by ' '.You could also look at the CSV module in python to read your file.
In itemsplit list you have:itemsplit[2] hasn't got any number to cast float.You must use try ... except ...  to catch the exception when no number is in your list item.
I've corrected your code: so say we have a hardware_store.txtfile that contains: Running the code:receipt.txt: You won't see \n in your text editor if you open receipt.txt, I've included the '\n' just to make it clear that there's a new line at the beginning, you'll just see an empty space in your editor followed by +Your reset of the text...
