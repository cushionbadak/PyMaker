If I have a structure like such:Why is that when I call os.path.abspath('foo.zip') I get the file path of where the Python script is located plus the foo.zip? Looks like: H:\Program\Scripts\foo.zip Needs to be: H:\Progran\Groups\group1\names\places\foo.zipThis is the code I have for a function where the problem is resulting:Shouldn't print os.path.abspath(zip) give me the full path of each file that was found in the os.listdir(os.path.abspath(in_dir))?
Why does os.path.abspath() return the path of cwd+file?Because that's quite literally what abspath is supposed to do:os.path.abspath(path)Return a normalized absolutized version of the pathname path. On most  platforms, this is equivalent to calling the function normpath() as  follows: normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path)).(Emphasis mine)
os.path.abspath() has no idea where the name foo.zip came from -- it doesn't know it came from os.listdir() of some directory. So it doesn't know that's the correct directory to use as the prefix. A relative pathname is always interpreted relative to the current directory.If you want to create the desired absolute pathname, use os.path.join:
