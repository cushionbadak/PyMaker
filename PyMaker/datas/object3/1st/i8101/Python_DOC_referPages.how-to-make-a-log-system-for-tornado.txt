I've read the documentation: http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/log.htmlBut I still don't know how to make a suitable log for my server, which is built with tornado.For now, I need such a log system:It can log everything with time format, and for each day it create a new log file.It seems that TimedRotatingFileHandler is what I need but I don't know how to use it with tornado.
The Tornado logging streams are just standard loggers from the "logging" python module.There is nice tutorial on the python website https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#advanced-logging-tutorial As per how to set the handler (same tutorial)https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#handlers
