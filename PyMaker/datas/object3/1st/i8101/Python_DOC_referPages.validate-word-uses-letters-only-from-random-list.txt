I'm building a 'scrabble' game in Python. Basically, the user is given 7 randomly generated letters and these are stored in the list random_letters. They then enter a word using those letters - this is a string stored as player1_word.The bit I am stuck on is where I need to validate that the user has entered a valid word - e.g is player1_word only using letters from random_letters.Expected behaviour:
You can use set operation to do this:set is a data structure contains only unique items. The idea is, convert both of them set. And, then subtract randomLetters from Player1Word to see if Player1Word contains something that not in  randomLetters. If it doesn't contain, the  Player1Word is valid, otherwise not. 
RESULT
Python does not have a native multiset type so there's not quite a one-liner for this, but collections.Counter helps a little:Using Counter at least saves you the loop you'd need to populate a plain dict with the counts.
