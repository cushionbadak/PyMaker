I have try this in my main programand just this in my second file:When I choose the python file, nothing happens... Can you please, tell me how to fix this ?
Two additions to your code may give the expected result.os.system expects a "command" for the operating system:Execute the command (a string) in a subshell.like python3 myscript.py. However, since you are using a custom python programming environment, pass the path of the EduPython's python.exe to os.system:Second, add the last line root2.mainloop() to your second script to make the second Tk window appear.Hope this helps. 
As you are trying to execute a python file, use execfile(file). But if all you want is a dialog, then use the Toplevel class.To keep both windows running, use different threads. It's very easy to do in python.
