This question already has an answer here:Asking the user for input until they give a valid response                    17 answers                I am trying to figure this out on my assignment, but I am struggling sooo hard.So what I need is restricting the user input for variable 'age' to be equal to or greater than 18. I want to display my own error message and terminate the program if the input is either string or less than 18.Also I have noticed that the program is automatically showing ValueError when letters are inputted because I have used the int() for my input. But I would like to change that error message to my own. I read somewhere to call and check the values first then int() them, so I tried the input() by itself but don't think it worked either.Here is what I have now for the age portion:I tried to do something like set the conditions for it to quit, then for other conditions it would keep going.......... but I am not sure if else could go with if not and I don't think it worked :(Any help is appreciated!! 
Use try and except to handle exceptions, e.gAnd this catches all 3 errors
