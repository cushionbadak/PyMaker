I have two lists, t and e, of the same size: to each element t[i] corresponds an element e[i]. I want to print each pair t[i] e[i], but summing together elements e[i] and e[i-1] whenever the corresponding t[i] and t[i-1] are closer than 1. In this case, elements e[5] and e[4] should be summed up, since the corresponding t[5]-t[4]<1. The point is, I want to REPLACE the 4th elements with the 4th+5th elements, without printing the 5th elements. My code is:But this gives me:I don't want to print 21 F, as it is already summed in the 20 EF. How can I do that? Is there a way to increase the counter i at the end of the if condition? Thank you in advance.
Another solution is a while loop : 
If it's just about the output:prints
Either you use the solution down here or you look at this post: Skip over a value in the range function in python
