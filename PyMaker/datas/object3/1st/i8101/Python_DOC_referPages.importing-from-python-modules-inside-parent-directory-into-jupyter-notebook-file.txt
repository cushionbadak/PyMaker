I have a file structure like this:In .ipynb files inside notebook/ folder I want to import classes and functions from module01.py, module02.py and module03.py.I have found answer in this question that it is possible using following lines of code inside every notebook and run those lines as first cell every time:Is there please a better way for this? What if I have A LOT of .ipynb files inside notebooks/ folder, do I have to paste those lines of code at the beginning of every single one? Is there a better, more minimalist or cleaner way?
Try adding the project_folder to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. This will allow you to tell python to search that directory for imports.You would do this in your user profile settings, or in your startup script - not in python. It's something that has to be set before python ever gets run.
