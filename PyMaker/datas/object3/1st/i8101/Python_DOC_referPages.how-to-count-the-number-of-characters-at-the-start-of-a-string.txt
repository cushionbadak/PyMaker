How can I count the number of characters at the start/end of a string in Python?For example, if the string isHow would I count the number of fs at the start of the string? The above string with a f should output 4.str.count is not useful to me as a character could be in the middle of the string.
A short and simple way will be to use the str.lstrip method, and count the difference of length.str.lstrip([chars]):Return a copy of the string with leading characters removed. The chars  argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.
Try this, using itertools.takewhile():Similarly, for counting the characters at the end:
You may use regular expression with re.match to find the occurrence of any character at the start of the string as:
Building on Oscar Lopez's answer, I want to handle the case you mention of the end of the string: use reversed()
You can create a function and iterate through your string and return the count of the desired char in the input string's beginning or end like this example:Output:
You may also use itertools.groupby to find the count of the occurrence of the first element at the start of the string as:Sample run:
re.sub select first letter with repeat( (^(\w)\2*) ), len count frequency.
