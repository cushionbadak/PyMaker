How to improve python sine and cosine precision? For example I want to use follow code (just calculate y = cos(acos(x)) for a random complex vector x):y must be equal x. But my difference is approx 1E-9. I think is too big. For example matlab returns less than 1E-15 for the same test. There is some way to improve python precision? Thanks!
Before reading this: this may not be a correct answer, because it is extremely unefficient, but if you need extra precission, this could be the best solution.You can use a Decimal class, where you can calculate with any precition you want (it calculates using string objects, not integers).But the problem is that you will have to implement your own trinogometry functions. Luckily python website has provided examples:https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#recipesNote that this will affect execution time of your program, because calculating with strings is obviously much slower than with floats.
Problem is disappear after  python reinstall. Thanks for comments
