I am trying to add a new line item to my json file for shipstation. I have the following python code which allows me to change the value of a key:but i want to add a new "items" key
Adding a new item to the list in Python is done with append() method:
You do not mention the type of resp['items'].Actually, if your resp['items'] is a list object, you cannot add a key to it, only an element. You can do it as followsBut resp['items'] is very unlikely to be a list, since you are about two add two identical elements. If resp['items'] is a dictionary object, what you may want to do isOr, since it is not easy to figure out what you really ask/want, know that keys in python dictionaries are unique. Which means that if you want to create a new key with 'DISCOUNT3' as associated value, you will have, in one way or another, to add a new key. E.g.And, be resp['items'] a list or a dictionnary, it will be identical with this other pointer
