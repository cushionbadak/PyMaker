This question already has an answer here:How to test multiple variables against a value?                    21 answers                I am trying to create a "Which television show would you be best in." However, when it outputs which show you should be in- it says them all. How do I fix this?I don't care if I took a long route to complete the code- I just want to know how to fix to say one answer. Thanks.
You are definitely using the or statement wront. Any non-empty string will be evaluated as True. An alternative to evaluating q1.lower() multiple times, you might as well check if q1.lower() is in a list of expression, i.e.:I reduces the number of boolean expression in an if-statement and makes it easier for you to modify answer combinations.EDIT:You can also use sets, which is faster for large answer combinations:
You can find out why you're getting the wrong results in the linked duplicate: How do I test one variable against multiple values?.However, a better way to do what you're trying to do is to build a tree. A nice way to make a tree in Python is to use defaultdict:You can then initialise it with all the values you want (for example):You could also convert all input to lower case, when it's input. Then you don't have to keep doing it later. Also your variable names could be better:Final usage:edit:Your input code is repetitive and is asking to be made into a function:Usage:
I think you might be using the or statement incorrectly. You're saying q1.lower() == 'laugh' or '1'. This evaluates to q1.lower() == 'laugh' or '1'. I believe a string in python is "truthy", so it evaluates all those statements as true. You will need to change your if statements to be if q1.lower() == 'laugh' or q1.lower() == '1', or do away with numeral responses entirely.
