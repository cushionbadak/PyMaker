I'm trying to solve a problem using the following code:This code gives me the desired output when I run using IDLE. However, when I try running this code using an interpreter provided by a competitive programming website, I get the following error:I tried reading the answers of other similar questions, but none of them seemed to work in my case.
Take another look at the codechef page. Notice the checkbox marked 'Custom Input'. With that checked/ticked a textbox will open where you can put your input lines.
The competitive programming website is likely running python 2. Python 2 treats input() differently than python 3.You should rather use raw_input() than input().From the docs:raw_input() reads a line from input, converts it to a string  (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.Your problem can be explained from what was explained here:In Python 2, raw_input() returns a string, and input() tries to run  the input as a Python expression.
I am not sure of the reason but the program is trying to read after the end of the data. You can solve the problem by exception handling
