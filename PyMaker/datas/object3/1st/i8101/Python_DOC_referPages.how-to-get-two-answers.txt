Natural Text
the point of my program is to tell the user where the position of the word he entered is for example,  ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRYThe word ‘COUNTRY’ occurs in the 5th and 17th positions. My program only prints the first position twice. I was hoping I could get some help. 
Here's a solution that matches your input and expected output (5th and 17th positions)
In index you need to specify the starting index to start the search, otherwise it will always return the first matched index.Example:
here is the change of for loop 
Try this code - Remove the while True loop during input. You are breaking after first iteration anyway. enumerate() will return index of the element along with the element when used in loop. That way you can forget about calling index()
Try this...s.index(x) -  index of the first occurrence of x in s
