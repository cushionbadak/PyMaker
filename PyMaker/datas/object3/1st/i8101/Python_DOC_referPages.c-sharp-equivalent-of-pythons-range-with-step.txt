Is there a C# equivalent of Python's range with step?Documentation:For a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i, but the constraints are i >= 0 and r[i] > stop.Example:
We can implement a static utility class to handle this.For completeness, this solution mimics Python's range behavior for one parameter (stop), two parameters (start, stop), and three parameters (start, stop, step):Example Usage with Step:Output:
I would go with two methods implementation. First one for parameters validation and providing defaults:That is required for iterators with deferred execution. Otherwise, you will not validate arguments until iterator will be executed. Which might happen a long time after you get an iterator reference. And iterator itself (actually with C# 7 you can use a local function instead of creating separate method):To implement Python's range behavior we need one more method which accepts only stop parameter. We can simplify code with C# 6 expression-bodied member:You also can make static methods available in global scope with C# 6. Assume class with Range method description is named PythonUtils:And usage in code will look likeYou can also use default valuesLooks like Pascal-case Python :)
