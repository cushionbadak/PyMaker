Natural Text
I have a text file which looks like:   Is there a way to get the value corresponding to "id" when I pass the     "path" value to my method? For example when I pass /a/b I should get "myid2" in     return. Should I create a dictionary?
Maybe explain briefly what it is you need to actually do as I get a hunch that there might be an easier way to do what you're trying to do.If i understand the question correctly, if you wanted to find the id by passing a value such as "/x/y" then why not structure the dictionary as This would give you direct access to the value you want as otherwise you need to iterate through arrays.
This looks very much like JSON, so you can use the json module to parse the file. Then, just iterate the dictionaries in the "contents" list and get the one with the matching "path".Output:
