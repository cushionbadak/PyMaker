My objective:If no error happened in the method, log only messages of level INFOand higher.If an error message appears, log all messages of level DEBUG andhigher prior to the error as well.I found logging.handlers.MemoryHandler class:https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#memoryhandlerIt partly fits my purpose. It buffers all messages and flushes them whenever an error-level message appears. But if there is no error-message, it won't log anything at all.I want my app to still log INFOs and WARNINGs if there were no error.What's the best way to implement that?
The way I see it you can achieve something similar by configuring two loggers.INFO-Logger to log only INFO level loggingDETAIL-Logger to log in DEBUG modeAs an example see the documentationYou can decide how to log them, same file (maybe) or separate files (my-simple.log and my-detailed.log)
