I am trying to import data from a csv file using Jupyter. I am new to Python.It works fine in IDLE, but not in Jupyter. This is the error I receiveI also tried to specify the full path of the file: But then it gives me another error:
The original problem is likely as you surmised, namely the path is incorrect.  However the second error is due to the \ in the "C:\Users\serdi\Documents\Test\mpg.txt"  The \ is an escape.  There are at least three alternatives.Use a raw string:note the r in front of the string.Escape the \:Use '/' instead of \:
I used ("C:\Users\JOHN-PC\Videos\ml-twitter-sentiment-analysis-develop\data\twitter_train.csv") for load twitter data set. I always got problem  in python 3 .
