Natural Text
I entered a responsibility.description via the Django Admin panel that contained an embedded <a>.  When showing it in the template I want the <a> to appear as a link instead of being escaped as &lt;a&rt;. I found this advice (How to disable autoescape in django feeds?) but still doesn't seem to work for me.I've tried marking it as safe:and also turning autoescape off:Am I missing something or are there any other methods I can try?Here is the data that is stored in the database:and here is how it appears in the html:
You can use the html's module, unescape method witch:Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g. >, >,  &x3e) in the string s to the corresponding unicode characters.You can use it in one or both of the following ways:When you receive data to be stored in the database (POST, PUT etc.):Then store to_be_stored in your databaseWhen you send data from the database to the template (GET, LIST etc.):Then return/render/etc the response.
