Natural Text
In Python3, what type should I use to check if the dictionary keys belong to it?So naturally I tried this:What should I put in place of the explicit dict_keys as 2nd argument for isinstance? (This is useful as I have to handle unknown input variables that can take the form of dictionary keys. And I know using list(d.keys()) can convert to a list (recovering Python2 behavior) but that's not an option in this case.)
You can use collections.abc.KeysView:collections.abc module provides abstract base classes that can be  used to test whether a class provides a particular interface
