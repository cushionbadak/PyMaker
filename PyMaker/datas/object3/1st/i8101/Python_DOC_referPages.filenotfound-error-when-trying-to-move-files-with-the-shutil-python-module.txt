I wrote the following code to recognize and organize gif and image files. cdir refers to the directory the program is supposed to organize. When it is executed, it should create folders 'Gifs' and 'Images' in the same directory.The directory contains the files: FIRST.gif, SECOND.gif and THIRD.jpgBut I get the following error:
files contains only the names of the files in a directory. cdir doesn't have a backslash at the end, so, when you concatenate cdir with an element of files you get a potentially invalid path:The latter is obviously not what you wanted, so you should add that backslash to cdir somehow, maybe like this:
Your file path is incorrect. There's a path separator missing.
Following the error report there is a "\" missing in the path between your directory "test" und the file "FIRST.gif":You can resolve this by adding "\" when you put in the path like this:ORreplace:by:By the way:I think here's a "." missing before "gifv"
