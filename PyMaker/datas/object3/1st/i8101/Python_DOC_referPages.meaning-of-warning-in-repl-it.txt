I wanted to experiment with != instead of = here (by switching the if and else statements), in case I wanted to add an elif: after (maybe a test-response if entered guess is greater than max). I don't understand why it is now throwing a warning/error, or what that warning means.To clarify, the code runs and seems to work, but I get a warning in the repl.it I'm using to write/run. On line 3 def make_guessIt says - Redefining name 'guess' from outer scope (line 21) <=What does this mean?And then on line 21 max=int(input("Guess number between 1 and what?"))It says Redefining built-in 'max' [Although I'm guessing this isn't the issue, because if I rename that variable maxi it doesn't show the warning for line 21]Original code:New code:
This particular warning was given by my IDE (in this case repl.it). It was letting me know that I was reusing/redefining a variable (in this case guess) in a different scope (ie within the function) and that this might be an issue. The second warning was being given because I was using max as a variable name, and max has other uses within python, chiefly as a the max Built-in Function used with lists and other iterables. Redefining max could also be an issue if you actually wanted to use the Built-in function. In this case it is not, but the IDE helpfully warns you, as this isn't an advisable practice. 
I copied and pasted your code into my repl and it seemed to run perfectly. Maybe there is a setting that is wrong or maybe you accidentally pressed a letter when running it. One small letter or period could mess up your pages of work.
