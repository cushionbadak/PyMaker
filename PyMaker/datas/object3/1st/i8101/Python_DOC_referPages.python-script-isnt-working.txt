I wrote this script for a program I'm writing ever since I changed careers but running into a lot of issues with it. Supposed to take a string and encrypt it with a key. Not sure where to begin with troubleshooting as I'm new to programming so came here for help. Maybe if you can just point me in the write direction where to begin?This is the error I get but looks fine.This is my code.
The block of if str(varAble1_size).split(".")[1] == "0": is empty, so you will need to add a pass statement after it. Keef Baker is also correct in spotting that the block for else: on line 37 is not properly indented.
You have to indent your code after else :And as Andrew Kulpa noted, the block after is empty, so you either need to do something in that block, or add a pass statement.Python does not use brackets but indentation for control flow. In your code, the Python interpreter sees an else but no statement for it, so it throws an error. See more about control flow here : https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
