I am trying to implement a restricted boltzmann machine in C++. I am using this Python code as a guide:https://github.com/echen/restricted-boltzmann-machines/blob/master/rbm.pyThis is Line 37:pos_hidden_states and pos_hidden_probs are both 2D matrices, of type vector<vector<double>> in C++, and num_examples and num_hidden are both integers. Could anyone explain what the greater-than symbol means here?
Probably not easy to translate numpy into C++, lot's of abstraction in numpy. Anyway, it's acting as a vectorized comparison, because np.random.rand(...) returns a np.ndarray, which if pos_hidden_probs is either a scalar or a np.ndarray it will behave in a vectorized (i.e. elementwise) manner:If pos_hidden_probs is some sort of np.ndarray, the behavior might be influenced by broadcasting, a feature of numpy:
The > operator works element-wise in NumPy, e.g.gives you np.array([[False,False],[True,True]])NumPy also does broadcasting, which gives meaning to comparison between arrays of different dimensions.
The > is comparing the hidden prob (a float in this case) against each item in a 2d numpy array and returning a 2d array of boolean values:
Due to operator overloading, the > operator can do practically anything -- it simply invokes the __gt__ special method on the object. But absent any other information, I would expect it to simply evaluate "greater than" and return a bool value.
