I've 2 lists(sorted) of prefix and would like to compare it in Python so that I can output which element in the original list was missing and which was added.Eg.I want to compare the 2 lists and output the add/remove element in list1_original. ie:
If there is no duplicates in given lists you may use sets and their "-" operator:this prints
I know you mentioned Python, but FWIW, if this is just for a utility script, this can be accomplished with comm or diff.If your lists are already sorted, comm list1_original.txt list2.txt will output three columns, one for containing the things common to both lists, one with the things found only in list1_original.txt and one with the things found only in list2.txt. You can supress output of certain columns with the -1, -2, and -3 parameters (respectively).Of course, you could always jusg diff -u list1_original.txt list2.txt.If you really want to do this in Python, you might have good luck with difflib. I've never actually used it, though, so I'm speculating.
You can get the result using a loop and some conditional statements. Same thing can also be framed like so,
