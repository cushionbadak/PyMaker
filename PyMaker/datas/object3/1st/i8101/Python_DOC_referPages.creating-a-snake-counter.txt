I'm just trying to get the logic straight and using Python to help me do it.  Ultimately, I need to solve this problem using ImageJ macro language.I have no idea if I'm using the right term, but I'd like to create a "snake" counter.The "snake" part is making the counter go up only to the maxVal, repeating that number on the next iteration, counting down to the minVal, repeating that value on the next iteration, and repeating the process.  For instance, in the aboveI'd like the following to happen :  
Here's a silly mathematical solution:
You will find some useful utils in itertools:
Add a conditional to determine if x should be increasing or decreasing at any given point within the loop.Then inside your incrementSnakeCounter() change the value of xIsIncreasing to false when x == maxVal and inside your decrementSnakeCounter() to true when x == minVal (you'll have to do some work to make sure that you're staying at the same value twice in a row, I don't have time right now to solve that part for you).
You can write a little custom generator.The key is to create a list of the pattern you want to repeat [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1] and then index that with the modulo of the length to get the repeating behavior:Then:Prints:
