Natural Text
I followed a tutorial on youtube that was pretty flawed to begin with but it was the best I could find. I have pywin32 installed and pyhook and they are both installed so I have no idea what it could be.
"format" refers to the "%(message)" which is incomplete and should read "%(message)s", the s denoting a "str conversion type" (see the docs) - the message is put through the str builtin."$(message)s" happens to be default, I think you can just omit this argument.
