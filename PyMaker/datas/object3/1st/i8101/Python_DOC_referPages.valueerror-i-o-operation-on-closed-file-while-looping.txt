Hi I am facing I/O error while looping file execution. The code prompt 'ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.' while running. Does anyone have any idea while says operation on closed as I am opening new while looping? Many thankscode below:
with closes the file that you are trying to read once it it is done. So you are opening file, making a csv reader, and then closing the underlying file and then trying to read from it. See more about file i/o hereSolution is to do all of your work on your queries2Google reader INSIDE the with statement:Some additional stuff:That pass isn't doing anything and you should probably be using with again inside the QGN function since the file is opened and closed in there. Python doesn't need empty returns. You also don't seem to even be using f in the QGN function.
