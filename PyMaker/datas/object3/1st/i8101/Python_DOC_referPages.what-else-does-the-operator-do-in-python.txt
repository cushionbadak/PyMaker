Besides being a less than operator, it seems to be doing something else here:But I'm not sure what is going on, and the result is not a boolean. There doesn't seem to be anything online either. Where can I read more about what this operator is doing?
In this particular case, < is acting as an array comparison.  Here you are comparing an array representing the image, with a value representing a threshold.The result will be an array of booleans, representing those values that are less than the threshold.For example:
Any object can overload comparison operators by defining the right methods:By convention, False and True are returned for a successful  comparison. However, these methods can return any value [â€¦]So, it's up to the object what exactly a < operation yields.
