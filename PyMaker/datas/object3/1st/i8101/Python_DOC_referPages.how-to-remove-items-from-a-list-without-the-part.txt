[a:b] returns a list with every value from index a until index b.If you just want to access a singe value from a list you just need to point to the index of the value to access. E.g.
The problem is you are using slices of the list not elements. The syntax l[i1,i2] returns a list with all elements of l between the indices i1 and i2. If one of them is out of bound you get an error. To do what you intended you can do: 
You have slicing and indexing confused. You are using slicing where you should use indexing.Slicing always returns a new object of the same type, with the given selection elements. Slicing a list always gives you a list again:while indexing uses individual positions only (no : colons to separate start and end positions), and gives you the individual elements from the list:Not that you need to use indexing at all. Use the str.join() method instead; given a separator string, this joins the string elements of a list together with that delimiter in between. Use the empty string:
