I am trying to get a Python script to work regardless when an argument has been passed or not.The goal is to make the script functional as "MyPython.py" and "MyPython.py 5" should be able to work. If no argument has been passed, then the argument should be 0.The variable imported_number should by default be 0 but if an argument has been detected, then it should take whatever number the user has passed.Unfortunately I am getting the error: too few arguments error message.Does anyone know of good and automated methods to get this task done? I'd appreciate it.
Use nargs, default, const like this:   Your opt_number will be initialized with 0 when no argument is provided.
You can make your script a function that accepts and argument passed to it.
