Natural Text
Suppose I have the string in the variable below:I'd like to select only the text Incident 11202 and save it to a variable. Also, the numbers that follow 'Incident' will change. I'd like to know if there is a way to copy any unknown characters that followed it.
You can use regex for that.Try the following regex for example:What is regex?A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search patternWhat is findAll function?re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)Return all non-overlapping  matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is  scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If  one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of  groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one  group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the  beginning of another match.You can read more in here
As others have said, you need regexes. Here's the code you need, with an explanation below it:Here's a step by step of the code:Line 1: Imports the re module (short for regex)Line 2: assigns the regex to the the_regex variable. The regex I wrote will match anything starting with "Incident", then any amount of consecutive white space (spaces, tabs, etc) then any amount of consecutive digits. The re.compile part of that line compiles the regex for more efficient useLine 3: Assigns the string we want the regex to search in Line 4: Does the actual match. re.findall will (not surprisingly) find all of the matches to the regex and return them as strings in a listLine 5: Prints the output of it all (see above for output)RegexesAre a useful tool to help you find sequences of characters in a string or file. Here is the python 3.6.1 documentation for re. Here is the Wikipedia page on regexes.
