When you use Pycharm to edit a py file, it inserts a template like this.What's the purpose of :return: here?
It describes the type of what your function returns (for example if it returns a string, you write return: str). Also you can add a comment about what this return value contains or what its purpose is. Note: If your function doesn't return anything, it actually returns None and you can write it down: return: None
As stefan.stt's answer says, the :return: field lets you provide a description of the fuction's return value. However, stefan.stt's example shows the :return: being used to document the return type rather than to describe the value. To document the type, it's more usual to use the :rtype: field, thus:The field names are not fully standardizes, and :returns: is also widely used to document the return value; it's my impression that :returns: is the more commonly used of the two synonyms, but PyCharm's  "Python Integrated Tools" has standardized on :result:. The widely used Python documentation generator Sphinx supports both variants, but other documentation tools may not.It's also worth noting that there are several different syntaxes in use to document parameters, return values, etc. in Python docstrings. The most common ones are documented in this answer.
