This question already has an answer here:Order of for statements in a list comprehension                    1 answer                I'm having a hard time understanding the following list comprehension:I understand the first part, the word for line in open('words.txt', 'r') but the second part confuses me. Does it mean for each line in words.txt, loop for each word on the split line?
The for loops are nested, from left to right. You can write it out as regular loops like this:So the expression before the for loops is the final value added to the produced list, and all the for loops (and any if tests) are executed nested inside the preceding loop or test.So, yes, for each line in the opened file, the line is split and the resulting words from those lines are added to the list being built.
