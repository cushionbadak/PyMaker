I wrote a Python script to run several NS-3 simulations with different seeds and different node counts.My script calls ./waf --run=<scenario_name> then executes 10 seeds, change node count and execute 10 more seeds, and so on.The problem is that after I call my script, I ask the user for an input (which scenario to run). Because of that raw_input call, I couldn't use nohup myScript.py &. I also tried CTRL + Z, bg, and disown. But that didn't work either.Here's my script:Any help will be much appreciated.
