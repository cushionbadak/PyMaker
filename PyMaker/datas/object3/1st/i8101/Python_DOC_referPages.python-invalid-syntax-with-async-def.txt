I am trying write discord bots using Python, I have come across and threw together this bot.Yet when I tried to run it, I received a SyntaxError: Why is that? I have never received that before when I tested it.
Asynchronous requests were introduced to Python in v3.3, if you're running Python prior to v3.3 (including v2.X), you'll have to install a newer version of Python.Only if you are running Python 3.3: asyncio is not part of the stdlib, you'll need to install it manually from pypi:The async and await keywords are only valid for Python 3.5 or newer. If you're using Python 3.3 or 3.4, you will need to make the following changes to your code:Use the @asyncio.coroutine decorator instead of the async statement:Use yield from instead of await:Here is an example of what your function need to change into (if you're on 3.3-3.4):The aforementioned syntax is still supported in newer versions of Python 3, but it is recommended to use await and async if there's no need to support for Python 3.3-3.4. You can refer back to this documentation, here's a short snippet:The async def type of coroutine was added in Python 3.5, and is  recommended if there is no need to support older Python versions.Aside:discord.py currently supports 3.4.2-3.6.6, (It does not support 3.3-3.4.1, 3.7 as of January 2019). For developing with discord.py, I suggest using the discord.py rewrite branch:discord.py-rewrite supports 3.5.3-3.7.
From version 3.7async and await are reserved keywordslike the error in below image.Copy and open the path  (without __init__.py).You will get a list of .py filesRename async.py to _async.py or anything you want, as async is now a reserved keyword with us from version 3.7.Once renamed, modify the new name everywhere.*NOTEAlthough it is not a permanent solutionbut it worked for me in case of the same syntax errorwhile working with firebase.Best solution is to go with previous version of Python. i.e version below 3.7.
