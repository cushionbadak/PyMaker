refsnp_blobs.json.gz is available on external FTP server, I don't want to download since its more the 50 gb.If there is any way to do this ?
You cannot access contents of an archive file stored on a remote FTP server without actually downloading the file.Of course, you can extract the contents while downloading on-the-fly, without actually storing the archive file locally (as suggested by @Cheney in a comment). This way, you spare a local storage, but you will still waste a bandwidth.If you have a shell access to the server, you can extract the file remotely and access only the part of the extracted contents you are after.For a similar question, see Download zip file via FTP and extract files in memory in Python.
