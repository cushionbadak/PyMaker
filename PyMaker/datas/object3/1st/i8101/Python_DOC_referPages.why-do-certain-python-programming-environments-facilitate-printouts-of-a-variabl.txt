For python programming, in most IDE's, the programmer must write the following in order to see a_var's value displayed in output: Contrarily, when using python in the Unix/Linux terminal, or in an Jupyter Notebook, simply writing: on a line will cause this variables value to display in output. How and why does this differ intrinsically between different programming or development environments?
Python running interactively, or via a Ipython/Jupyter session is using a REPL, Read–Eval–Print Loop.  This code reads your input, evaluates it, and prints the result.  Each REPL will have its own rules for suppressing or allowing the display.  It may display the str or repr version.  It may also save the result in a temporary variable (often called _).
In the first case, you're using your IDE to write a program for Python to read in the whole thing and then execute, but in the second case you're just typing directly into the Python interpreter/shell. See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html
