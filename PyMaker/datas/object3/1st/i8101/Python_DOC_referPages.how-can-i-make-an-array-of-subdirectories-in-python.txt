I want to make an array of subdirectories in Python. Here is an example layout and model list I would like to obtain.Hence from the root, I would like to run a program that will make a list of all the subdirectories. That way if I were to write:Where List_of_Subdirectories is the list of appended directories. I would obtain the output:In essence, I would like to achieve the same results as if I were to hard code every directory into a list. For example:Where subdir_n denotes an arbitrary nth directory. Unlike other posts here on stack overflow, I would like the list to contain just the directory names without tuples or paths.
If you just want the directory names, you can use os.walk to do this:os.walk(directory)will yield a tuple for each subdirectory. The first entry in the 3-tuple is a directory name. You can wrap this in a function to simply return the list of directory names like so:should give you all of the directories.
If all you want is a list of the subdirectories of an specified directory, all you need is os.listdir and a filter to display only directories.It's as simple as:The return from os.listdir is a list containing the names of all the available elements in the specified directory (or . by default), directories and files. We filter only the directories using os.path.isdir. Then, as you want a list, we explicitly convert the filtered result.You wouldn't be able to print the filtered result, but you would be able to iterate over it. The snippet below would achieve the same result as the one avobe.
