str.strip strips by character (keeps removing until a character not in the parameter is reached), and the problem is that you're including a whitespaces before is in your input:If what you actually want to do is slice off the substring from the start or end of the larger string, then you can use the following:
Judging by this prompt in your programyou expect that strip() strips off substring prefixes and suffixes. It doesn't. strip() removes unwanted characters. If you want to remove one instance of substring b from anywhere in string a:If, on the other hand, you want to remove only prefixes and sufffixes, like strip() does:And if you want to remove multiple occurrences of the same prefix or suffix substring, again like strip() does, then substitute while for if.
