I want to get the unique values from my dictionary.Input:Desired Output:My code :But I'm getting this error : TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
It is not clear why you are mapping to single-item lists as values, but you can use a list comprehension to extract the elements.If you start out by mapping directly to values though, the code can be much simpler.
Lists do not qualify as candidate set content because they are unhashable.You can merge the items into one container using itertoos.chain.from_iterable before calling set:Note that using itertools does not violate your choice of dict.itervalues over dict.values as the unwrapping/chaining is done lazily.
set expect an elements not list of list, So you have to create a list of elements using list comprehension
