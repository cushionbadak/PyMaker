Natural Text
I have some imported functions from package import fizz, buzz and I want to map them to a variable func from a string arg.But vars() only captures the local namespace, and I don't want to allow access to globals(). Any ideas? Or should I just go with if-else logic?
You could use a white list... or in this case, a "white dict"
