I need to pack the current time into a restrictive bitpattern.the top 5bits is the hours, next 6 is minutes,  next 6 seconds & the remainder are reservedI came up with a nasty bitAND mask and then string concatenation before converting back to a 32bit integrer. This seems overly convoluted & CPU expensive. Is there a more efficient & more to the point, elegant method? 
How about:
Between additional searches ( http://varx.org/wordpress/2016/02/03/bit-fields-in-python/ ) and a comment I settled on:It offers a cleaner structured setting of the associated fields, especially as this is called at least every second. A similar structure has been created for Date and other bitpacking vectors
