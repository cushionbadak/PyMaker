So let's say the project folder is:Now, in /User/me/Projects/library/main/main.py I would like to write the import statement as:What is the $PYTHONPATH variable that allows me to do so? I triedbut it does not work and it threw
Messing with PYTHONPATH really is the wrong approach to go forward here. Instead, turn your user and book folders into proper modules/submodules. For doing so, you need to add __init__.py -files to (both of) them, looking like this for example:In your example, this would be /User/me/Projects/library/user/__init__.py. Now you can import this routine from your main.py-file as follows:For full reference, have a look at the python documentation, modules tutorial.
If you call main.py  directly from the command line, you can set the environment variable at the beginning of the line:Otherwise, you should be able to set that module lookup path with:To verify, you can see your environment variables with: Also, make sure to put the __init__.py inside the user folder.
