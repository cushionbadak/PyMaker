For some reason, I am not able to pass variables from one to another Python file.  Please see files below.pullgps.py:lenny1.py:lenny.py works fine on its own when I print report.lon and report.lon.  Just not able to export the variables to pullgps.py.  It should be simple, but for some reason, the variables just will not pass.  Thanks!
You're using from lenny1 import * which imports everything from lenny1.py into the global namespace.  Not only that, but you're actually running everything in lenny1.py on the first import, which contains a while loop that could potentially block.  This is really bad code practice.  However, I think the problem you're having is that you are referencing lenny1.lon and lenny1.lat while using a starred import.  Just print lon and lat and it should in principle "work" provided the loop terminates.
