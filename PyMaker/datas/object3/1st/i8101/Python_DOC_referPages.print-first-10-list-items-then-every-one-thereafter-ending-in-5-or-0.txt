results list: 80 rows(entries) containing 3 items each (year, age, amt).  I want to print first 10, thereafter print only a row whose age ends in 0 or 5.  There is a syntax problem with the second part.
You are trying to use assignment in an expression (row = results[:9]). Assignment is a statement.That's not how you test if you are in the first 10 rows however. Instead, add a counter to the rows with the enumerate() function, and test against that row counter:
It's probably easier to use a counting index in this situation
