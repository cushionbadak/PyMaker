How does this work for you?If you don't have a modern version of Python (3.5+) you can also just use glob, os, and shutil:
This is easiest to do with Python 3's new pathlib module for path operations, and then shutil.move for moving the files into their correct places. Unlike os.rename, shutil.move will work like the mv command and behave correctly even for cross-filesystem moves.This code will work for paths nested to any level - any / or \ in the paths will be replaced with _ in the target filename, so dir/foo/bar/baz/xyzzy.xml will be moved to new_dir/foo_bar_baz_xyzzy.xml.
