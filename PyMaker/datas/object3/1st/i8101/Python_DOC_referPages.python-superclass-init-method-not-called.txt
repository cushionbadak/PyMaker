When I run the following program in Python 3.6:I get the following stack trace:As you can see from the XMLParser class source code I'm calling its __init__() method with the correct arguments and XMLParser's parser attribute is set within it.What is happening is that the XMLParser.__init__() method doesn't get called. What am I doing wrong? It must be something silly, but I just can't see it.
The C accelerator that's imported for XMLParser doesn't have the parser attribute set. A somewhat viable option is to disable it's importing by setting it's value as None in sys.modules:Of course, in order for this to work, it needs to be done before any imports of ElementTree occur and, obviously, you'll get a performance hit.As for why this is, I'm guessing the parser attribute is considered part of the private API for XMLParser, no documentation for it exists (and it doesn't look like an omission). As such, it should not be relied upon. 
For python 2.X your code is fine but for python 3.x you will have to change thisself.parser.StartElementHandler = startElementHandler to self.StartElementHandler = startElementHandler
If you just want to print starting element's tag name, you can use xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse which does not require patching the parser object.filepath can be a xml file path or a file-like object.
