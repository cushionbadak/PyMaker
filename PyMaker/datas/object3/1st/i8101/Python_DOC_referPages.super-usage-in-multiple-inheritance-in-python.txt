I am new to python. I am trying to understand super() functionality in python multiple inheritance. I am getting the following error:
super() will find the next method in the MRO sequence. This means that only one of the __init__ methods in your base classes is going to be called.You can inspect the MRO (the Method Resolution Order)  by looking at the __mro__ attribute of a class:so from D, the next class is B, followed by C and object. From D.__init__(), the super().__init__() expression will only call B.__init__(), and then because C.__init__() is never called, self.c is not set either.You'll have to add more super() calls to your class implementations; it is safe to call object.__init__() with no arguments, so just use them everywhere here:Now B.__init__ will invoke C.__init__, and C.__init__ will call object.__init__, and calling D().output() works:
