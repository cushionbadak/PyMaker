At the moment, I managed to code, successfully, a simulation for a work that I need to do. However, I'm fairly new to python. And so, I'm now in the process of making the simulation more efficient. For instance:where:As you can see, the code is big. And this is only for males and when they disperse. The rest of the code is very similar. These are standard genetic and demographic processes - but I feel like this can be improved. I feel like these processes are simple enough, so maybe code as big as this is not necessary. Does anyone have any ideas to shorten this and, by consequence, making it more efficient?
Your example does not have any loops but it looks like it could be simplified by one:It is also possible to pass a mutable object as reference to a function which can modify it, which allows further reduction of almost redundant code. I've added some data to test it:
