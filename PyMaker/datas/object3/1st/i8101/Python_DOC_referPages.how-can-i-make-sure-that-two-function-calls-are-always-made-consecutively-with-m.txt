I'm using Pathos like this:I want fn1 and fn2 to be executed as one atomic operation such that no threads can produce function calls in a sequence like fn1, fn1, fn2, fn2. 
You need to use a lock like it is described in the documentation.But, why are you using multiprocessing if you don't want to call your function in parallel?
