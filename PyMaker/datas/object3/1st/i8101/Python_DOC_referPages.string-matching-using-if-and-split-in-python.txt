All, Can someone explain why the second code doesn't return True?1st codeOutput: True2nd CodeOutput: FalseWhat is this particular difference between 'geetansh' (list) and 'geetansh'.split() (array) that causes this Mismatch ?
'geetansh' is a string in python.Sothat check whether the string 'geetansh' contain a string 'geeta'.On the other hand, 'geetansh'.split() is a list in python. split() return a list, so 'geetanch'.split() return ['geetansh']. Sothat check whether the list ['geetansh'] contain a item 'geeta'. The list ['geetansh'] only contain item 'geetansh'.
The basic difference is, str.split() returns a list!When you compare a in b, the comparison is like,b is a list, then a must be an item in b.b is a string, then a part of a is in bThat is,
The split() method return an array Use this instead:
'geetansh'.split() returns a list, ['geetansh'], so it does not actually contain 'geeta'.
