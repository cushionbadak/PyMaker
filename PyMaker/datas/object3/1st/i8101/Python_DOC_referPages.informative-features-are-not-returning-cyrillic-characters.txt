Natural Text
I've switched Python 3.6 now, but when running informative features I end up with gibberish when trying to print Russian in my feature extractor.In the case of the feature extractor itselfI can get тир to print just fine, is there something I can do to make the informative features return Russian characters?  
I figured out what I'd done wrong,when I'd imported my vocab folder, I'd encoded it as latin-1all is well and Cyrillic characters were returned for me
