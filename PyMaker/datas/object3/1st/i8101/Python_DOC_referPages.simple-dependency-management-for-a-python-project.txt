I am coming from Java background and completely new at Python.Now I have got a little project with a few Python files that contain a few imports. I know I does not have the imported dependencies installed on my computer, so I try to figure out the required dependencies and run pip to install them. I would like to do it differently. I would prefer to have the dependencies listed in a single file and install them automatically during the build process.Does it make sense ? If it does I have a few questions: How to list the project dependencies required to install by pip ?How to run pip to install the dependencies from the list ?
A common way to manage dependencies for a python project is via a file in root of the project named "requirements.txt". An easy way to make this is:You can then install all the dependencies in other locations using pip install -r requirements.txt. If you want dependencies to be installed automatically when other people pip install your package, you can use install_requires() in your setup.py.
