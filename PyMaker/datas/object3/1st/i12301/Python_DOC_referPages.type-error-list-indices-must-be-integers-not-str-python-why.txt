This is a code for format printing multiple lists:This prints the first value of each list But as soon as I change it to:And if I put any number in the place of :9 it does not work.I don't understand whyHelp?
If you want to print the 9th position, you can useUsingwill tell format() to use the key "0:9", which is a string but lists only have integer keys:In python derp[0:9] means, to get a slice of the list derp from key 0 to key 8. But format() does not interpret the 0:9 as python syntax. Format does check if the instance has a __getitem__ method and passes the key to it. If you want to print the first 8 elements here, maybe separated by comma, you may use:Additional: If you want to print all stuff in your arrays on separate lines you can use a for-loop:In this approach len(gtinlist) <= len(stylist), len(priceless), len(valueless)
Apparently slicing isn't supported there, only integers (which are turned into ints) and everything else will be interpreted as a string index:How it would look if a slice were requested:I checked the docs but couldn't really find an answer, just that "an expression of the form '[index]' does an index lookup using __getitem__()", which could support slicing. But it doesn't even mention that integers will be turned into ints.
