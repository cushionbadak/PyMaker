I have a function hello_world () that I would like to call every hour (1:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc).I'm a beginner here and not totally comfortable with writing loops.I have the following code, but it stops after 23 hours. I am not sure how to loop the loop such that everything repeats at the end of the day!I also realize this may not be the most efficient way of writing this code, so I am open to suggestions on how to improve.
Do you know about modulo operator (%)? i % 24 will return the remainder after dividing by 24, so i will be 0, 1, .. 23, 0 .. etc
That is because you limited your loop to i <= 23.  You can change it to this:Using (i + 1) % 24 guarentees that i will never be greater than 23.  More about the modulus operator here.
