Natural Text
This is the code I have, but it prints the whole paragraph. How to print the first sentence only, up to the first dot?This code prints:To state that the human brain has capabilities that are, in some  respects, far superior to those of all other known objects in the  cosmos would be uncontroversial. The brain is the only kind of object  capable of understanding that the cosmos is even there, or why there  are infinitely many prime numbers, or that apples fall because of the  curvature of space-time, or that obeying its own inborn instincts can  be morally wrong, or that it itself exists. Nor are its unique  abilities confined to such cerebral matters. The cold, physical fact  is that it is the only kind of object that can propel itself into  space and back without harm, or predict and prevent a meteor strike on  itself, or cool objects to a billionth of a degree above absolute  zero, or detect others of its kind across galactic distances.BUT I ONLY want it to print:To state that the human brain has capabilities that are, in some  respects, far superior to those of all other known objects in the  cosmos would be uncontroversial.Thanks for help
Split the text on that dot; for a single split, using str.partition() is faster than str.split() with a limit:If you only need to process the first <p> element, use soup.find() instead:For your given URL, however, the sample text is found as the second paragraph:

split the paragraph at the first period. Argument 1 species the MAXSPLIT and saves your time from unneccessary extra splitting.
you can use find('.'), it return the index of the first occurence of what you're looking for.So if the paragraph is stored in a variable called paragraphObviously here is missing the control part like check if the string contained in paragraph variable has '.' etc.. anyway find() return -1 if it does not find the substring you're looking for.
