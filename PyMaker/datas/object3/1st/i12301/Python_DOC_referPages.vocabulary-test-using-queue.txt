I have a list with words in two languages where each foreign word is followed (on the next row) by its meaning in a known language. Example:Now I wish to create a vocabulary test using queues. My idea is to create 2 queues q1 and q2. All the words start in q1 until each word's meaning has been guessed correctly. If you get a word wrong, the word will get placed in the end of the queue of q1 and if you get it right, it will be moved to q2. When q1 is empty, you move over to q2 and do the same thing, except the words get 'thrown away' when you answer correctly and the test is done once q2 is empty. The problem is I can't figure out how to create a way to associate the foreign word with the known word. I think I should start like this:But I don't know how to test if the preson answers correctly or wrongly. Also, I think I could somehow implement nodes since the meaning of the word (Node) will be the next word (Node.next). I will update as I make progress, but I'd appreciate any tips you have now.Edit1: This is how I created the queue:
You can simply compare the user input with the known meaning of the word.I have written a simple script(Python3) for you to solve this problem, hope it helps!Looks like that you are using your own queue implementation.I have modified my code to fit the question. However, it is strongly recommended that you use the built-in queue module provided by Python3 as it is thread safe.
In this case, I would just use a list for each word. I don't think you really need a new class. The program I ended up with is a little long (note this is python 2):
