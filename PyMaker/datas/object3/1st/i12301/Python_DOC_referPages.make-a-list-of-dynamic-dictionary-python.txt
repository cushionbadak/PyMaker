Natural Text
The following is my data set from a text file.There is a list named: which holds the following values in the list So, the problem is, i want to create a list of dictionary to hold all my data (from the text file) using the list_of_keys as keys for the dictionary as follows:what i have up to now:
You can use a generator function like following:you can read the file line by line and split the lines, then create the pairs of keys and values using zip function and then convert them to a dictionary.Note that since a file object is an iterator you can iterate over your file object and use with statement to open your file which will close the file at the end of the block.As another alternative and more pythonic way you can also use csv module to read your text file :Here since csv.reader accepts a delimiter argument and returns whole of your lines separated in one iterator you don't need to loop over your file and split it manually.And if you want to preserve the order you can use collections.OrderedDict in both cases:
You only need to use split and do some iterations.Try:Or:
For cleaner code, you could use the function to_dict from pandas:
If think you have to split the string using ,, then using namedtuple to map each row respectively.
