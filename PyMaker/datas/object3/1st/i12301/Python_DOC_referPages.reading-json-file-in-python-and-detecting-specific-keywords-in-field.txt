Natural Text
I just started this week to learn Python and I have the following question. I have a JSON file (Aberdeen2015.json) that contains 60 lines (each line containing a newspaper article). Moreover, each line contains a list with the date, title and body of the article (see picture below, title cannot be seen since it's towards the end of the line). I want to do the following: if certain keywords are in the body of an article, print a list with the date of those articles. So far I have tried to do the following:I am aware that the code might have many failures, any help is more than welcome.
How about this:
The efficient way to do this is using set intersection.We use the standard Python json module to parse the data, which gives us a list of dicts, one dict per row. Then we get the body field of each row, convert it to lower case and split it into single words. Then we see if that set of words has a non-empty intersection with the set of keywords. If it does, we print the date of that row.
I assumed that your json file looks like this:This code works, tell me if you do not understand
