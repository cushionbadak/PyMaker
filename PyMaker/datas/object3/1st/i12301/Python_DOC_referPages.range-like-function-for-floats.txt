I wanted to use the built-in range function for floats, but apparently it doesn't work and from a quick research, i understood that there isn't a built in option for that and that I'll need to code my own function for this. So I did:but this is what I get:resultthe step should be just 0.1000000..., but instead it's about (sometimes it changes) 0.100000000000001.Thanks in advance.
Fun fact: 1/10 can't be exactly represented by floating point numbers. The closest you can get is 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. The rightmost digits usually get left out when you print them, but they're still there. This explains the accumulation of errors as you continually add more 0.1s to the sum.You can eliminate some inaccuracy (but not all of it) by using a multiplication approach instead of a cumulative sum:Result (newlines added by me for clarity):
You can use numpy for it. There are a few functions for your needs.linspace :arange :P.S. However, it's not technically a generator, which is a range in Python3 (xrange for Python2.x).
