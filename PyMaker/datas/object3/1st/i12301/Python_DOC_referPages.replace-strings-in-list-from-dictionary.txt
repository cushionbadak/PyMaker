I'm having some issues with my code:Expected output = '1 you, how's things', '1, good thanks'It currently does not replace any occurrences of hello.  I'm wondering if my sentence loop is correct or not?  Printing i after this prints out exactly what is in sentence.
I guess the word_list(try to rename the variable to word_dict, I think that is more appropriate) has lots of items, working example from ipython
I ran your code verbatim and it worked, but only prints the last "i". If you move the print into the for loop you get what you expected.output:
Using regex:
The replacement occurs on a variable inside the loopSo nothing is changed in the sentence listTo fix this make a new list with the changed items in itAnother way with mapAnother way with a list comprehension
Using str.replace is problematic, as a word could be a part of another word. Better use re.sub with regular expression \b\w+\b, with \b being "word boundary", and use a callback function to get the replacement from the dictionary (or the word itself, if it is not in the dict).Also, not that by assigning to i within the loop, you are only changing the value bound to the variable i; you are not changing the string in the list! For this, you have to assign to the list element at that index, or use a list comprehension, as in my example.
