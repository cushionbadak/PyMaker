Just a quick question regarding converting loop commands in IDL to python.I have the following loop structure in IDL syntax:Now, I would say that is roughly translates toIn python.However, I would say the endelse and endfor commands are redundant? But what should I replace them with?
You are partially right, you just need to abandon the endelse and endfor and replace else if with elif.From the Python documentation, here is an example for an If statement:For statement
Python grouping relies only on indentation, so you need no end for your if and for loops / groups.This is valid Python code:
However, I would say the endelse and endfor commands are redundant? But what should I replace them with?You don't replace them with anything.From the Python tutorial:The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.To end a block, simply return to the previous level of indentation.
There is no endif or endfor in python. You unindent the line to indicate that and elif is "else if" I might be misinterpreting the "end if begin" as a new if statement instead of simply an else. In that case, it is
