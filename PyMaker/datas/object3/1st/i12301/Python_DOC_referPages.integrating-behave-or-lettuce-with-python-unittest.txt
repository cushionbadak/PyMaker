I'm looking at BDD with Python. Verification of results is a drag, because the results being verified are not printed on failure.Compare Behave output:to SpecFlow+NUnit output:Finding failure causes is way faster with the SpecFlow output. To get the variable contents on error, they have to be put into a string manually.From the Lettuce tutorial:From the Behave tutorial:Compare this to Python unittest:resulting in:However, the methods from Python unittest cannot be used outside a TestCase instance.Is there a good way of getting all the niceness of Python unittest integrated into Behave or Lettuce?
nose includes a package that takes all the class-based asserts that unittest provides and turns them into plain functions, the module's documentation states:The nose.tools module provides [...] all of the same assertX methods found in unittest.TestCase (only spelled in PEP 8#function-names fashion, so assert_equal rather than assertEqual).For instance:You can ad custom messages to assertions just like you would with the .assertX methods of unittest.That's what I use for the test suites that I run with Behave.
