Im trying to modify a list of strings so the elements will have element numbers at front starting from 1. For example:['John', 'Eric', 'Samuel'] becomes ['1 John', '2 Eric', '3 Samuel']Here is the code i have so far:This adds a number before but the problem is that it gives the first string number zero, how do I work around this?
You can pass i + 1 to format():But there exists a more elegant way:
You can use enumerate, just specify start and it'll start from 1:And if you just want to print it that way:Output:
You can pass additional arguments for range function, for example:More about range functionBut for this solution you'd need to re-numerate rest of you code though, so it's probably not best idea.
