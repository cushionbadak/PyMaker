What, key isn't in d? OK, then assign d[key] = value, just in time; now give me d[key]."Suppose d = {'a': 17}. ThenHere, 'a' is in d, so d.setdefault('a', 0) leaves d unchanged and returns d['a']. However,Because b is not in d, d.setdefault('b', 100) returns 100 and sets d[b] = 100. d now has two items, and both a and b are keys:
