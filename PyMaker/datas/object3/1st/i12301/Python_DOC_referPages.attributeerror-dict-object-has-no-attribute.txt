I am new to python and couldn't find the answer to this. Referring to the code at the end of the message, can I know what does the part "for item, total in totals.items()" in the line below mean?Also, the code failed and saidAttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'predictors'when I changed all instances of "item(s)" in the code to "predictor(s)". Why is that so?
The dict.items iterates over the key-value pairs of a dictionary. Therefore for key, value in dictionary.items() will loop over each pair. This is documented information and you can check it out in the official web page, or even easier, open a python console and type help(dict.items). And now, just as an example:The AttributeError is an exception thrown when an object does not have the attribute you tried to access. The class dict does not have any predictors attribute (now you know where to check it :) ), and therefore it complains when you try to access it. As easy as that.
