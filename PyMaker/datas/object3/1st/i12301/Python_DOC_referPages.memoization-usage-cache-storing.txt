I am writing a program that calculates the Pascal Identity of two variables, hard coded into the program, as I am new into Python and trying out caching and memoization. Here is what I have so far: My function will output the final real answer with what it has now, but with a lot of outputted answers. I cannot seem to get how to properly store the values to be used in the cache.How do I properly use call_cacheK to store the result values I have already used?Thank you.
Lets see. First, you have a function of two variables, but store result in cache only by one parameter. So callTest(20, 11), callTest(20, 10), callTest(20, 9) will have one result in your cache. Lets rewrite your function a little:Yes there is no counter variable because I didn't realize why do you need it :)Also, as far as I can judge by the use of print(result), you probably use the Python3.x. If so, you can use standard cache implementing:Good luck! :)
