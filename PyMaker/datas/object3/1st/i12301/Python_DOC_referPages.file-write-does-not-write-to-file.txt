i'm trying to create a def for log file and this is my script:the script create a txt file but does not write a def() function into txt Thanks
You are trying to write an integer to a file; the file.write() method only accepts strings.Convert to a string first:You really should not use a blanket except handler in your code; you really do't want to play Pokemon and catch them all. By doing so you are missing valuable error information. See Why is "except: pass" a bad programming practice?Rather than roll your own, you could just use the logging module.
You open a file, and then you close it. You don't write anything in it though, because the function write() fails should anything but a variable of type str() be passed to it! Here is an alternative to write() with fewer restrictions:print() function has fewer restrictions and is a better option here as it automatically formats the inputs it receives as a str(), regardless of the initial type(), and excluding functions, instances and generator objects, which would be displayed as, for instance, something like this: <function <lambda> at 0x1089b70d0>. Additionally, be aware that the visual format to which they are converted (and subsequently displayed or written in a file) may not necessarily be to your liking, so I suggest you do experiment with the results and see what works best in a particular situation.

Rename the variable time to something like current_time to avoid conflicts with the module time.You passed msg, which is an integer, into the method write. You should convert it to a string first: msg = str(operazione)
