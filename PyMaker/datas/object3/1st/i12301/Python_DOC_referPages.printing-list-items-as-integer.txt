So I have some code that reads a file that contains score in this format:I have code that takes the highest score for each name and outputs it from highest to lowest:The program works but the outputs is not correct:I was wondering how i would make it print out like :I did try to do this by doing this instead :Whilst this does output it nicer the program does not print it out in a sorted order. How would I fix?
use [-1] intead of [-1:]The slice syntax (in list) will always return a list[1,2,3,4] [-1] => 4
If you need the highest score then use the max function
