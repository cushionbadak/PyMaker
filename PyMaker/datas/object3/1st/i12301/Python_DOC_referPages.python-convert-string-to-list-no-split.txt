I've got a little problem:I have a String in my Database which is called actions.Now, I'm writing a method, which gets that string from the database (that works), and then I want to turn that string into a list.I know actions.split(), but this didn't work out so well for me, because if my string looks like this:I can't use actions.split(', ') because it would mess up the dictionaries inside.Till now I've got the following code:Addition: If I run the method when actions is empty, it gives me a list with one dictionary, but if I run it when it already has something in it, if sets actions to "".
You should be using the json module to store valid JSON in your database. You can create a valid action list from that string using exec. But please beware that using exec or eval is a potentially dangerous practice.output
Use json library.then work with Python objects. You will gain so much time :-D
I found a way that works for me:Thanks for all the help.
