Here initially val is of type int but in the loop it is getting converted to float although I am performing integer by integer division. Why is it so?
You have to use: //And your val will remain being an integerThe behavior of / was changed with this: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/The operator module docs give also a hint about the separation between true division (returning a float) and floor division which returns the floor and therefore an inthttps://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html
It is specified in the Semantics for True division in PEP 238:True division for ints and longs will convert the arguments to    float and then apply a float division.  That is, even 2/1 will    return a float (2.0), not an int.  For floats and complex, it       will be the same as classic division.So an automatic conversion is performed when an int is found. Note that this is the default behaviour in Python 3. In python 2 you'll need to import from __future__ in order to have similar results.
