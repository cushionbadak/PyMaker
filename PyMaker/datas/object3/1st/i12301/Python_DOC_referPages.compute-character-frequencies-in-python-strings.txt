Natural Text
I was wondering if there is a way in Python 3.5 to check if a string contains a certain symbol.  Also I'd like to know if there is a way to check the amount the string contains. For example, if I want to check how many times the character '$' appears in this string... ^$@%#$$, how would I do that?
These are the built-in functions index and count.  You can find full documentation at the official site.  Please get used to doing the research on your own; the first step is to get familiar with the names of the language elements.
You can use split to check if symbol's in the string:You can also use re.findall:It returns 0 if there is no such a symbol in the string, otherwise returns count of that symbol in the string.But the easiest way is to check and return count if symbol is in:It returns 0 if nothing is found.
