BackgroundI have some dataframes that I'm trying to split, then write the individual columns into binary files as signed shorts.CodeEverything through making the series dfA into integers (which finishes their conversion into a format that will be readable as signed shorts, I think; all my values are between -6000 and 6000 for this particular post-transform data set.The ProblemI expect dfA.to_csv to write to the file in binary, hence mode='wb'. I get an error:f = open(path, mode, errors='replace')ValueError: binary mode doesn't take an errors argumentI must be doing something wrong, but I don't know what. Maybe to_csv can't write binary files out, but I can't find anything in the documentation that would indicate that. Barring telling me what I'm doing wrong with this, what's the best way to convert information in a DataFrame into a form that can be done as binary?EditWriting the file out the CSV is trivial (and I can do that already). If anyone has a method to convert a CSV to a binary file, I'm completely open to that as well.
Python 3 is giving an error for the builtin open() function when it is trying to open the file from within pandas, since binary file mode only supports None as an error argument.  It'll probably work with "w" mode only from pandas.Python 3 open() docs doesn't explain it, but it is shown in library code here.You should look here for a full description of writing types appropriately binary using the python struct package.
