I was wondering if tuple unpacking can be used in a "index from ... to" kind of style, so with inds = (a,b), M[*inds] would lead to M[a:b].I often have tuples which contain the indices that I use to slice my data into some interesting subset, and would think that something like the proposed above would be convenient. Is there a way to do this?thanks for input
You can use tuple unpacking, but you have to unpack them into a slice, and then use the slice for indexing:Also works with numpy:Remember that A[start:stop:step] is just syntactic sugar for A[slice(start,stop,step)].
You cannot use tuples (at least not in the start-stop-step way). But you can always use slice.some examples:
