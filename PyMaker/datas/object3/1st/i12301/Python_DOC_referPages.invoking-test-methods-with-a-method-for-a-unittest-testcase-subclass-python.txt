I've been reading the documentation for the unittest module, but I haven't been able to decipher if it's even possible to do what I'm looking to do. Specifically, I'd like to be able to do something like the following class:The reason I would like to do this is because I would like to run my tests from within another Python file. E.g., say I'm writing code in another file:Is this possible?Thanks
An alternative to what you are trying to do would be to run the main module shown below. Make sure that the test module is available for import if you wish to run the tests in it. Hope this helps you!Module: testModule: mainAddendum: To do what you are requesting, add a method that replicates some of the internal work done by unittest.main to run the tests. The following two modules help to demonstrate how you might go about modifying your TestMyCode class so that it can run tests on itself without outside help.Module: test_moduleModule: main
