Assuming that you want to get -18.149649 instead of 18.149649 since that would be consistent I suggest using a regex in combination with the .findall() function as follows:Giving:Update due to comment:You could replace [0-9] with \d which is equivalent since \d matches a digit (number) as shown here.
This should do the trick.
