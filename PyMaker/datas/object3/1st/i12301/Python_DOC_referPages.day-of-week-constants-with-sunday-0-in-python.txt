The calendar module has day of week constants beginning with However, sometimes one must interface with a system (perhaps written in JavaScript) that uses the convention Sunday = 0. Does Python provide such constants?
There are no such constants in the Python standard library. It is trivial to define your own however:or, when using Python 3.4 or up, you could use the enum module functional API:and then you can then also map a weekday integer to an enumeration value by calling the enum.Enum object:I used 3-letter abbreviations but you are free to use full names if you find that more readable.
I just use this with mydate.isoweekday(), does the job.
hope this helps:
