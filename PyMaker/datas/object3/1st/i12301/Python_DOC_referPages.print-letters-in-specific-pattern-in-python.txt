I have the follwing string and I split it:Now I want to print the g letter two times, the k letter one time and the p letter three times:How is it possible?
LATE FOR THE SHOW BUT READY TO GOAnother way, is to define your function which converts nC into CCCC...C (ntimes), then pass it to a map to apply it on every element of the list l coming from the split over %, the finally join them all, as follows:Or if you want to put all of these into one single function definition:EDIT :In case of the presence of _ where the OP does not want this character to be repeated, then the best way in my opinion is to go with re.sub, it will make things easier, this way:
You could use generator with isdigit() to check wheter your first symbol is digit or not and then return following string with appropriate count. Then you could use join to get your output:Demonstration:EDITUsing re module when first number is with several digits:Example:EDIT2For your input like:You could replace _ with empty string and then add _ to the end if the work from list endswith the _ symbol:Output:EDIT3Solution without re module but with usual loops working for 2 digits. You could define functions:And then use them as:
One-liner Regex way:%|(\d*)(\w+) regex matches all % and captures zero or moredigit present before any word character into one group and the following word characters into another group. On replacement all the matched chars should be replaced with the value given in the replacement part. So this should loose % character.or
Assumes you are always printing single letter, but preceding number may be longer than single digit in base 10.
Loop the list, check first entry for number, and then append the second digit onwards:
