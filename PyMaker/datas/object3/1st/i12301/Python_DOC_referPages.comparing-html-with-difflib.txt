More specifically, the only change I need to pick up is a new Instruction ID added:To get a feel for what difflib will produce, I first diff two identical HTML contents, hoping to get nothing back:Since difflib mimics the UNIX diff utility, I would expect diffed to contain nothing (or give some indication that the sequences were identical, yet yet if I '\n'.join diffed, I get something resembling HTML, (although it doesn't render in a browser)Indeed, if I take the simplest case possible of diffing two characters:diffed = d.compare('a', 'a')diffed.next() produces the following:So I am either expecting something from difflib that it can't or won't provide (and I should change tack), or am I misusing it? What are viable alternatives for diffing HTML?
The arguments to Differ.compare() are supposed to be sequences of strings. If you use two strings they will be each treated as sequence and therefore compared character by character.So your example should be rewritten as:If you only want to compare the content of a html file, you should probably use a parser to process it and get only text without tags, e.g. by using BeautifulSoup's soup.stripped_strings:
