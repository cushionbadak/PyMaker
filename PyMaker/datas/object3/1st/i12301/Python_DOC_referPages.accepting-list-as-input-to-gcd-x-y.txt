This question already has an answer here:Euclidean algorithm (GCD) with multiple numbers?                    6 answers                I am trying to write a function that accepts list as an argument to my gcd function. Would something like this work?Now,how do I make my gcd function step through a list,i.e a_list=[12,24,18,6], iterate through gcd(12,24), gcd(12,18),gcd(12,6) and returns a single value.
you have to keep the current value in a variable, and use that with the next value in the list, something like thisyou can also use reduce to keep the acumulated for youalso you can find gcd in the math.gcd library in python 3.5+ and in previous versions is in fractions.gcd library so the your function can be reduced to
